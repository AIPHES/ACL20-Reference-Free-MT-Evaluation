Civil rights groups issue travel warnings against Missouri
As a result of discriminatory policies and racist attacks in Missouri, the American Association for the promotion of people of color (NAACP) issued a travel warning to coloured people preparing for an excursion to Missouri.
"The NAACP Missouri Travel Advisory, which came into effect on August 28, 2017, called for all African-American travelers, tourists and Missouri people to pay special attention and exercise the utmost caution when traveling in Missouri as a result of the recent series of suspected racial incidents in Missouri," the group's statement declared.
NAACP noted that a recently passed Missouri law has made it harder for people to win discrimination lawsuits, and that the state's law enforcement has partly targeted minorities, phenomena that have prompted the group to issue travel warnings.
Violations of civil rights are happening to people.
They were stopped for questioning because of the color of their skin, beaten or killed, "Rod Chappell, president of NAACP, Missouri, told the Kansas City Star.
"We have received an unprecedented number of complaints."
This is the first such warning issued by the organization against a state in the United States.
The group cited racial slurs against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, a 28-year-old black male in Tennessee.
Sanders, who died earlier this year in suspicious circumstances, ran out of fuel while traveling in Missouri and was detained by Missouri state police without charge of a crime.
The consultation also noted that a recent report by the Missouri Attorney General's Office showed that "black drivers in the state are 75 percent more likely to be stopped and checked than whites."
"The consultation was intended to raise awareness and warn their families, friends and colleagues about what could happen in Missouri," Chappell said.
"People need to be prepared, whether it's carrying bail to Missouri or letting relatives know they're traveling within the state".
According to the latest data from the FBI's hate crime reporting program, Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015; based on the number of crimes, the state ranks 16th in the country.
The travel warning is also a response to Missouri's new law, which will make it harder to sue housing or employment discrimination businesses.
The move comes after U.S. States passed immigration enforcement laws requiring local law enforcement to detain immigration violators, a move the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) said would increase the number of racial lawsuits and issued travel advisories for the States of Texas and Arizona.
Travel warnings are usually issued by the United States Government against other countries, but more recently, advisory groups have taken this approach in response to certain laws and trends within the United States.
After a "Golden era" in which the box office soared in 2015, the overall film market entered a lull in 2016, and it became a suspense whether it could break through last year's total box office score of 44,069 billion yuan.
According to figures released by the National Bureau of Statistics, the prices of new and second-hand houses in Beijing both cooled in October, rising by only 0.6 per cent and 1.1 per cent.

The BBC says Beijing is the most exciting city: Making foreigners feel "living in a new era"
Beijing may have a long history of three millenniums, but it is also rapidly transforming itself into today's modern glamour city, British media said.
With its astonishingly fast Internet, cutting-edge technologies such as face recognition software, huge investment in artificial intelligence and unrivalled cosmopolitan energy, the Chinese capital is one of the most exciting cities for inquiring foreigners.
"If I can make it there, I can make it anywhere in the future," Clemens Sehy, a German expatriate, said on the BBC's website on January 16, citing the lyrics of singer Frank Sinatra singing the praises of New York City.
"If Sinatra lived to this day, he would probably sing about a city like Beijing," said Sehi, who works as Creative Director at Voyager Archives magazine, saying that living in the city makes you feel like "living in a new era" and always keeping up with the trend.
"People generally have a sense of being at the centre of something grandiose, which is hard to say, but it keeps many foreigners there for a long time. They want to see what it will look like and want to witness it with their own eyes," Simon Norton, who is based in England but recently lived in Beijing, wrote on the personal blog site 4Corners7Seas.
The city's high-quality, high-speed Internet and technology-friendly environment make daily life easier than ever, according to the report.
"Beijing is rapidly transforming into a cashless society, with the Internet integrating the functions of traditional wallets into smartphones, making it easier for everyone to make many transactions," said Andy Peña Fuerte, who is from Manila and now works as deputy editor-in-chief on the Beijing Children's website.
But smartphones are only the beginning of Beijing's technological ambitions, and facial recognition software has become so popular that many mobile phone APPs use the technology to make bank transfers and payments, get people into apartments and offices, and even use it to verify the identity of online car drivers, the report said.
Beijing also recently announced plans to spend 13.8 billion yuan to build an artificial intelligence technology park that will house more than 400 companies that will focus on developing artificial intelligence technologies ranging from biometrics to self-driving cars.
Food is also at the heart of many major festivals in China's calendar year, and participation in these celebrations is highly regarded by foreigners. The Spring Festival is the most important social and economic Festival and one of the easiest for foreigners to participate in.
"I suggest helping Chinese friends prepare for the New year, cleaning apartments is just as important as posting red spring couplets with New year's greetings on their homes. On New year's eve, all family members gather for a big meal, then observe the age until midnight and greet the New year with bright and loud fireworks. For foreigners, spending the night with friends and family is indeed an opportunity to fit in," Sehi said.
The number of foreigners in Beijing is large and growing, but China's language barriers and the ease of communication among expatriates are an easy excuse for not being fully integrated into local culture, according to the report.
"Some foreigners have been living in China for years but have little experience of their host country, and if your initial attempts to reach out to Chinese people are not successful, it's easy to have a sense of whether it's easier to get along with other foreigners," Sehi said.
"In these so-called" foreigner bubbles "(" foreigner bubbles "means that foreigners mingle only among foreigners and do not come into contact with locals and local culture - translators), foreigners huddle in their own communities, eat in Western restaurants, and there are only foreigners among their friends.
The easiest way to overcome this is to learn a little Mandarin - it's simpler than one might think.
"One or two hours a week of private lessons in Chinese or learning entry-level radio dramas should suit everyone's busy schedule," Sehi said.
Learning even a few classic short sentences can help with shopping, ordering a meal in a restaurant or chatting in a taxi.
Stubborn air pollution is also a fact of daily life, although government efforts in recent years have curbed some of the problems, according to the report.
Residents stress the importance of getting outdoors during warm months when pollution is often light, using those blue sky days as an opportunity to wander through historic alleys or explore popular Ritan parks.
"Beijing is the Chinese city where you can find the most things below the surface, and you can find very good artistic and musical activities, amorous nightlife, historical wonders, ultra-modern business districts and ancient hutong areas," Norton said.
The report argues that the role of ageing as an impediment to human capital growth is increasingly evident, particularly in the north-east, where the average annual contribution of ageing to human capital growth is -1.28 per cent.
Pan pointed out that at present the risk of cross-border capital flows is manageable and the fundamental factors underpinning the balance of payments balance still exist for a long time.
Beijing, Dec 17 (Reuters) - the International Summit forum for the identification, Restoration and Protection of Ancient Chinese books and paintings opened at the Renmin University of China on December 17.
In April, the European Commission accused Google of forcing handset makers to pre-install software such as Google search and the Chrome browser, otherwise they would not be allowed to use other Google applications.
The European Commission considers the move to be detrimental to consumers and an impediment to competition.
EU regulators initially asked Google to respond by July 27.
If convicted of antitrust charges, Google faces a fine of up to 10 per cent of its global revenue, or about $7.4 billion.
Google was not immediately available for comment.
Google also faces an EU investigation for favoring its own shopping service in its search results.
Zhang Yining's stay is solid, it can be said that his realization of the "jump" from Guoqing to the National Olympic Games is no accident, and the magnitude of his leap growth is still surprising.
A picture to read: The legal status of bitcoins around the world
Absrtact: In addition to the price correction naturally triggered by speculative attributes, the current downturn in the digital currency has nothing to do with the "old enemy" - regulatory risk.
Judging from the visual map, the eastern countries are more conservative about bitcoins than the West, the countries that make up the bulk of the world are still waiting to see the legitimacy of the digital currency, and the "black swan risk" remains high.
* This article is from Wall Street (Microletter ID: Wallstreetcn), editor Wang Mu. For more information, please visit wallstreetcn.com or download Wall Street see app. *
The price of bitcoins fell below the psychological integer of $10,000 on Tuesday, the biggest one-day drop in three years, as the global digital currency, led by bitcoins, has been bloodwashed this week in the wake of regulatory storms in major markets such as China, South Korea and the European Union.
In addition to the price correction naturally triggered by speculative attributes, the current downturn in the digital currency has everything to do with what has always been an "old enemy" - regulatory risk.
At this important juncture, the visual big data website HowMuch.net has produced a map showing the legitimacy and degree of regulation of bitcoins in countries around the world.
As shown in the figure below, green represents the legal market for bitcoins; orange represents the neutral market, which has not yet been publicly legalized, but there are no major restrictions on its use; pale pink represents restricted markets, where local governments try to use digital currencies through red line policies or regulation; deep pink represents countries where bitcoins are defined as illegal; and grey is a country that has not yet commented.
(Pictured above from the HowMuch.Net visualization team on January 15)
The article points out that from the distribution of green color blocks in Central Africa, it can be seen that the traditional Eastern countries have a more conservative attitude towards bit coins than the West.
Russia is the largest country that currently defines bitcoins as illegal, China is one of the largest restricted markets for bitcoins, and India is one of the largest countries that has yet to comment on bitcoins and does not yet have a policy in place.
North America and Western Europe are the regions with the highest acceptance of bit coins, that is, the distribution of green blocks is more concentrated.
There is a marked divergence of views on bitcoins in the Middle East and Latin America, with a more mixed distribution of color blocks in these regions.
Among them, Iraq, Iran, Turkey, Brazil are all legitimate bit currency markets, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Bolivia and others have some degree of restrictions on their trading and use, and more Latin American countries do not yet have a voice for bitcoins.
A combination of the above data shows that, of the 246 countries counted globally, a total of 99 (or 40 per cent) impose no restrictions on the trading and use of bitcoins, that is, green and orange areas.
Seven countries (or 3%) are restricted markets (pale pink), 10 countries (or 4%) define bitcoins as illegal (dark pink), and 130 countries (or 53%) do not yet have more treatment of digital currency information (grey).
This suggests that the countries that make up the bulk of the world (53%, more than half) are still waiting to see the legitimacy of the digital currency, led by bitcoins, within their Borders, and that the "black swan risk" of bitcoins remains high, as some of them may eventually make legislative decisions to limit the digital currency.
The article argues that global regulators do not yet fully understand the emerging category of digital currency and may be the main reason why most countries have not yet taken a position.
Although the "popularity" of bitcoins has grown exponentially since last year and does not represent the interest of all countries, some may be concerned about the local legal currency being threatened as a result or more worried about the digital currency being exploited by criminal organizations.
Wall Street has written a detailed summary of international regulatory news on bitcoins since last week, including China's start to crack down on centralized service online platforms and mobile App on over-the-counter exchanges, the fact that South Korea is still considering shutting down digital currency exchanges, the European Union's belief that bitcoins are not yet widely accepted and warning investors of the risk of "losing their blood."
Wall Street editor-in-chief "read 2018: The world's Central mom opens the year of the Digital currency?" Has mentioned that 2018 will be the year of the Digital currency for Central Banks around the world from any point of view of regulation, acceptance / criticism, and adoption.
The criticism of the legitimacy of the bit currency by large countries such as Russia is also intended to make way for the official issuance of a digital currency.
Madrid, Jan. 8 (Xinhua) (Xie Yuzhi) Barcelona's new aid Coutinho made his first appearance in a Barca shirt at the Nou Camp on January 8.
Coutinho passed a medical examination at Barca that morning and signed with Barca president Bartomeu on a contract that was due to expire in the summer of 2023.
He then made an appearance as a Barca player in front of nearly 7,000 fans at the Nou Camp.
According to Spanish media, Coutinho's total transfer fee, or 160 million euros (1 euro or about 7.77 yuan), is the price of the Barca club and Spanish history.
As Coutinho is still injured, he will have to rest for nearly 20 days to make his debut in a Barca shirt.

Now Trump's White House is targeting the Statue of Liberty
The most certain sign of regime change was when they started attacking the statues.
Americans agree with this as much as anyone, so Saddam Hussein, of paradise Square in Baghdad in 2003, was carefully plotted down.
Stephen Miller, one of the key thinkers of the Trump administration, must have known what was going to happen when he cut a symbolic axe to the Statue of Liberty during a heated debate with CNN's Jim Acosta over the president's proposal to severely restrict legal immigration.
To be fair, Miller did not attack the statue itself.
If he does, then a group of cruise ship owners and followers of liberalism are bound to devour him alive.
But he did attack the significance of the statue, especially when Emma Lazarus's famous poem was engraved on a pedestal in 1903 (the monument was built 17 years later).
As Miller reprimanded Acosta for saying: "I don't want to talk about the full facts of history here, but the Statue of Liberty is a symbol of America's freedom to light up the world...
The poem you are referring to, which was added later, is not part of the original Statue of Liberty. "
In fact, Miller is right, but as he himself said, it's not really about history.
This involves a modern echo of the startling words of Lazarus, the only country that seems to invite not only any old immigrant, but also the poorest of the poor: "Your exhaustion, your poverty, or your huddle of people yearning to breathe freely, / suffering people reject your crowded beaches."
There is no such thing as "suffering people refuse" at the moment when our screens become more piercing.
Miller, who has not worked in literary commentary, made it clear that these people would not be welcome in Trump-era America.
This conflict over the meaning of statues is part of a broader political and cultural war: It's actually a conflict with the American spirit.
Lazarus, and her friends who held events to engrave her verses on a pedestal after her death, are well aware of the highly political nature of the acts in which they are participating.
The purpose of the sculpture is to express the link between French and American republicanism through the ancient classic metaphor of the female incarnation of the goddess of Liberty.
Lazarus changed the meaning: In her poems, the female image is no longer abstract, she wants to be vocal.
She gave herself a very different name: The mother of exile.
The combination of the poem and the painting was a successful feminist coup and a devastating blow to native Americanism.
Just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, those on the right have always wanted to change it back to its original meaning.
The great Speaker, Rush Limbaugh, a Baptist at the time of Trump's arrival, argued in 2010 that liberalism was not an invitation to whomever, and that he was now an early neo-conservative who brought the flame of American wisdom to the benighted world: "The goddess of Liberty is brave."
She was meant to carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
The torch does not light America's path. "
Unusually, Limbaugh was actually struck by something.
The meaning of a statue depends entirely on the angle of cognition.
Lazarus's most imaginative approach is to be able to see it. When the tired, poor but hopeful will be able to see it on the deck of the ship after a long and often terrible journey.
On the face of it, this involves the point of view of the world by those who seek asylum and have the opportunity to improve their lives.
Her statue conveys to them the meaning of hope and welcome that they need to hear.
Of course, this is not a view that Miller and Trump had wanted to acknowledge.
Their torch is not to light the way, but to ignite the hatred of their only source of strength.

2017 world Championships: Neil Black has highly praised the Scottish players in the British national team
Eilidh Doyle recalled that there were only two Scots in the British national team at the time.
Neil Blake, executive director of the British Athletics Association, said the team of 16 strong Scots in the World Championships team would make a "huge contribution to the national team."
A record number of Scottish field athletes have been selected for the 2017 London athletics world championships, which open on Friday.
According to Blake, "Scotland is making extraordinary progress" and British track and field athletes must learn from it.
"We accept and try to understand that, and we'll stick with it until we succeed," Blake said.
"I spoke to people at the Scottish Institute of Sports who thought it had something to do with what they were doing.
Scottish track and field athletes think it has something to do with what they do.
The British athletics Association believes it has something to do with what they do.
Even people on the streets think so.
It's extremely brilliant no matter what the situation is, "he said.
A number of Scottish track and field athletes are medal contenders, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart, who will be on a par with Mo Farah at 5,000 metres, while Eilidh Doyle has been chosen by the group to be captain.
"Arid is a little modest.
Her captain's speech was unbelievable, "Blake said.
"Many track and field athletes, whether they are Scottish or not, or wherever they live or train, walk out the door with pride and drive.
The passion and true feelings that Arid naturally puts in are very good, "he said.
The Commonwealth silver medallist, who will compete in the 400m hurdles at his fifth World Championships, said it was "incredible" that there were 16 Scots in the British national team.
Previously, the number of Scottish track and field athletes taking part in the world competition was up to seven, the number of entries achieved in 1983 and 2015.
Muir, the middle runner, is the leader. She has set five British and two European records in the past year.
She will compete in the 1500m and 5,000m events.
Chris O'Hare, who competed in the 1500m event, is another Scottish player to watch, having previously done well in the season, winning the British national against qualifiers and the Olympic Anniversary, respectively.
Doyle recalled her participation in one of the world championships, when the only other Scot on the team was Lee McConnell.
The captain said she was deeply proud that so many of her countrymen had not only joined the team but, in some cases, would challenge for medals and compete for the finals.
"What's special about being captain of the national team is that it's voted for by the rest of the national team. So it's a great honor to know that your teammates voted for you to go for extremely unusual achievements, anyway," she added.
'Of course, I'm very proud of all the Scottish players.
It just shows how far we've come.
And they are all established track and field athletes here, track and field athletes who are about to make their way to the podium.
How was my captain's speech?
Well, I think it's fantastic.
I have just referred to the fact that in this case we are very lucky because we have the World Championships at home.
So it is really important that we build on our home support and that we are strengthened by our return to the Olympic Stadium.
I will get a second chance to compete and the atmosphere there will be fantastic, "he said.

Shielding critics in the Facebook: If you can't stand the censure of voters, don't run for office
The father of our nation knows the ways of bad media.
Americans loved Washington, but it wasn't long before the major newspapers began lashing out at him for everything from domestic policy to political principles.
He was annoyed by the criticism, no doubt.
But he did not silence these critics.
For as early as 1783, Washington said, "freedom of speech is denied - - and we will be slaughtered like lambs in silence and ignorance."
That brings me to the governor of Maryland, Larry Hogan, who needs to learn from Washington.
Hogan's staff blocked and deleted the posts of at least 450 people for posting their views on his Facebook's official home page.
The ACLU filed a lawsuit against him over it earlier this week.
The governor's staff described the lawsuit as hasty, and online reports were rife with their backlash: "Who cares?"
A lot of people say "it's just a Facebook."
But, it's important.
This is particularly important because it is against the likes of Hogan.
This is a Republican who serves as governor in a state where democracy is in the majority, and he is surprisingly popular.
Of the 50 governors in the country, he received the second highest praise.
Hogan is not a reactionary edgy.
He runs the state of Maryland smoothly and strictly abides by the rules.
He is also very good at using the Facebook as the main way to connect with voters, playfully showing his post-chemotherapy bald head for the first time on the home page.
So it is completely unnecessary and ultimately dangerous to block people who come to comment on the governor's home page, a public forum that serves as an official management platform touted by members of the public who pay taxes.
In an interview with the Washington Post, Hogan's spokeswoman, Amelia Shas, defended the governor's actions, saying she thought shielding their comments was nothing more than an attempt to make them refrain.
But they were too hasty to describe it as a deluge or a cynic sweeping the web.
The Washington Post has spoken face to face with people who have been shielded by Hogan.
They are just ordinary people talking to their elected leaders: They are teachers, small business owners, and priests, not a deluge.
They said their comments were deep, respectful and not obscene.
The pastor quoted the Bible in his post, calling on Hogan to remember his Catholic faith.
Lakhemi Salma Lamani, a barrister in Bowie, Maryland, was not cynical, but she asked about hate crimes.
Writing in the news story comments section of the Washington Post, she said, "I politely commented that I was disappointed that he did not respond to hate crimes and other recent news events.
I also don't like a bunch of people commenting on the same topic, because these people will be directly ignored by some as so-called crowd psychology, rather than treating them as a group of worried citizens, "he said.
What the governor's staff calls "intensive junk information bombing" may seem to others to be "insistent."
The face-book era makes it easy to modify a message by simply shielding a critic or deleting a negative comment.
And it is far cleaner than in the past, when the same effect required sending staff out to collect and burn critical newspapers or to arrest or silence protesters.
But that's really what's happening now, but on a digital level.
Hogan is not a public official who has been blamed for silencing others on Facebook and other social media.
President Trump is being sued by push users for shielding them on the push.
There was a landmark ruling in Virginia last week on such issues.
The chairman of the Lauden County supervisory Board violated the first Amendment by blocking voters from her face-book home page, according to James C. Kataris, a District Judge in the U.S. city of Alexandria.
Kentucky Gov. Matt Bevin (R) has also been patronized by the ACLU for his use of Facebook and tweets.
It shouldn't be so hard.
In the Washington era, affordable postage and the Internet had a similar influence.
The number of news newspapers quadrupled between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letters were written to fiercely criticize his leadership.
And even at that time, there was an anonymous deluge against him in Washington.
People wrote to newspapers using pseudonyms such as Yurikla, Valerius, Belesarius, Borgius, etc., to harshly criticize Washington's decisions.
According to historical documents collected by the George Washington newspaper online Project, his office was inundated with petitions criticizing his attitude on the Treaty of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation between his Majesty the King of England and the United States of America.
But he did not silence them.
Freedom of speech, freedom of political opinion and freedom of speech are the foundations of this country.
And real leaders need to accept that.
The slightest bit of wind and wind in the property market all tug at people's sensitive nerves.
Purchase restriction is a hard bar of many urban real estate control policies.
In May 2017, Jinan issued a regulation that undergraduates pay social security continuously for half a year and can enjoy the same housing purchase policy for local resident residents;
In June, Wuhan issued a policy requiring college students to settle with a diploma and employment certificate within three years of graduation.
Then the policy added, the official said, "college students can buy a house at a price below 20% of the market price";
In July, Chengdu issued a regulation that young talents with undergraduate degrees and above from foreign universities can apply to settle in Chengdu on the basis of their graduation certificate.
In addition, Kunshan, Shanghai and other cities or regions have also introduced "talent introduction" related policies to lower the threshold for talented people to buy housing.
According to Zhang, this is actually the competition of the major cities for the population, especially talent, and the retention of the population, especially talent, in order for the cities to be competitive, which is the most important significance of these real estate policies.
Some even argue that this means that the time has come for the "restriction" in the property market to be lifted.

Ronan Lafferty is looking forward to enjoying being home at the Renaissance Club
The East Lozion Renaissance Club hosts the 25th Scottish evergreen Open, and former European champion Ronan Lafferty will enjoy the feeling of being home for the next three days.
The Northern Irishman, who led Archer field Lynx next door to the final last year but eventually lost to Paul Iles, now works for the new venue, representing the club's founder and chief executive, Jerry Salvati, as ambassador for the event.
Lafferty said: "I witnessed the founding of the Renaissance Club and we will also witness its glory through this competition.
The athletes will see the Pitch at its best and at its best.
Jerry started this place like no other.
He is a keen champion of the competition and is very proud of his achievements here.
It's the best stage to show this Pitch. '
Els, an Englishman, is looking forward to defending his title for the first time, even though he has won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour in his 32-year career.
The Shosport athlete said: 'It's very special indeed.
I did not defend the Estremadura Open because it was cancelled in the second year of my victory.
It feels amazing to come to this place,
It's wonderful to play golf here.
Memories of last year came up one by one, and for me and my wife, Sharon, last year's win had a special meaning for us.
That's really a special memory that we'll always remember. '
Back in the native race was Gary Orr, who had just turned 50 earlier this year and then also played on the European evergreen Tour.
This is the first time he has played in Scotland since the Scottish golf Open in 2013.
Mr Orr, of Helensburg, said: "It always makes more sense to go back home and play,
You want to do well; but you can feel that extra pressure.
I'm really enjoying being able to play again, I've been playing golf.
I'm satisfied with the current situation. '
Joining the trio on the field were former Masters winner Ian Woosnan and evergreen contest winners Paul Brodhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNewty.
There were six Scottish athletes on the field, two of whom were Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance, while the other four were Andrew Oder Coyne, Stephen McCullister, Bill Lomus and Ross Drummond.

In August, a total of 57 cases of daily continuous punishment were imposed nationwide, and the newly revised Environmental Protection Law, which came into effect at the beginning of this year, significantly strengthened China's Environmental Law enforcement, Zou Shoumin, head of the Environmental Inspectorate of China's Ministry of Environmental Protection, said in Beijing on 22.
At present, environmental protection authorities in all parts of China may use punishment methods such as daily continuous punishment, seizure and seizure, production restriction and transfer to administrative detention to investigate and deal with environmental violations, and cooperate with judicial organs in punishing environmental crimes.
In August, a total of 335 cases of seizure and seizure were carried out throughout China, 177 cases of production restriction and shutdown were imposed, 189 cases of administrative detention were transferred and 166 cases of suspected environmental pollution crimes were transferred, Zou said.
Among them, Henan imposed seven consecutive penalties on a daily basis. At present, China is in the process of embedding from terminal control to the whole process, comprehensively strengthening the control of environmental pollution.
Despite the downward pressure on the economy, China's Ministry of Environmental Protection has previously made it clear that China should correctly handle the positioning of Environmental Protection in economic development and enhance "green stability". The more economic growth goes down, the less it can relax Environmental Protection and give full play to the optimal role of Environmental Protection for the economy.

Her cabin is located in Ena Rotali, the capital of Paniai district in Indonesia's Papua province, and the housewife usually just puts a sweet potato - which locals call "nota" - directly into the fire.
Half an hour later, the charred sweet potato was eagerly taken out by a pair of unwashed hands and gobbled up.
Dajie sat on the mud - she had no furniture, and this was where she did her daily household chores, such as washing clothes, the water of which was very muddy, all from the nearby swamp.
There is a bucket in a room without a roof, which is an outdoor toilet.
She was the youngest of her husband's four wives, so she was not assigned to the fields to take care of.
Polygamy is common here.
Of course it's dangerous to work until the party: Most of the men in the village don't have jobs, and many are drunk, plus there are a lot of soldiers here.
"No one dares to walk around the village after 5pm," she said.
It was a rare glimpse of daily life in the highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony that was incorporated into Indonesia after the 1969 referendum, which was also controversial, when only 1,026 elders were forced to vote by show of hands in front of the occupying army.
The current campaign for independence and against Dutch rule was quick to point the finger at the government in Jakarta for its heavy-handed rule over the region and its isolation of foreign journalists and rights activists.
In 2003, the province was formally divided into Papua and West Papua, while Papua New Guinea independently controlled the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is remote and uninhabited; to get here it takes a 90-minute flight from the provincial capital, Chayapura, to Nabile, and then hire a car for five hours, all the way to the stomach.
There is no public transport here.
In this town of about 19,000 people, wooden houses are surrounded by bamboo fences, and pleated tin roofs are a variety of yellow-brown coverings made of rust.
Few Indonesians come in, let alone journalists, and there are few foreigners.
Before the arrival of the Christian preacher, the Mee Pago Papuans believed in a God called Uga Tamee.
There are other changes here, too.
"We can't get used to these clothes," Dyger said, referring to her brightly colored hand-knitted headscarf, dark shirt and bright half-skirt.
"We used to cover our bodies only with leaves."
Papua is the poorest province in Indonesia, where 28 per cent of the population lives below the poverty line and has the highest infant mortality rate and the lowest literacy rate in Asia.
But this is also the Golden continent of Indonesia.
Located in the highlands, about the same size as New Jersey, with 153,000 people, the world's largest and most profitable gold mine, Grasberg, is only 60 miles away and is owned by Felipe McMoran copper Gold, based in Phoenix.
In 2015 alone, Felipe mined about $31 billion worth of gold and copper mines here.
In addition, Papua is rich in timber resources, with an estimated value of $780 billion.
Yet these abundant resources are also the source of the tragedy of the Papuans, which is why Indonesia's powerful military forces have been able to suppress them.
According to a 2005 survey by the New York Times, Felipe paid nearly $20 million to local military personnel and troops between 1998 and 2004, up to $150,000 for one official alone.
The growing demand of the Papuans for independence threatened the King, as a result of which they were subjected to cruel treatment.
Since 1969, more than half a million Papuans have been killed and thousands have been raped, tortured and held by the Indonesian army, according to rights activists.
According to the Asian Human Rights Commission, mass killings in the tribal highlands of Papua in the 1970s have escalated into genocide.
Last year alone, Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful protesters.
A 2016 report by the Catholic Archdiocese of Brisbane, "We will lose everything," includes evidence of the misdeeds of the previous year, such as extrajudicial killings, torture - another report that rape and electricity are particularly widespread - and a brutal crackdown on peaceful demonstrations.
"Violence occurs on a daily basis, making it difficult to count the number of victims," according to Andrias Harsono, an Indonesian researcher at Human Rights Watch.
Papua's resources brought in large numbers of immigrants from outside Indonesia, and oppression began.
Eighty-three percent of the province's population of 3.5 million is Christian, but the demographics of Muslim economic migrants have changed since they arrived from the densely populated islands of Java, Kalimantan, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
The Java people's snack stand sells Gadogado, a mix of fried chicken and vegetables, served with peanut butter.
The locals fought hard.
Apos Yu, a 24-year-old native of Paniai, moved to Chayapura, the provincial capital, to find work, explaining that "those immigrants began to sell chicken and vegetables in traditional markets at lower prices than local Papuans.
This has caused the local Papuans - Papua women (mama-mama) - to lose their market, "he said.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, often referred to as Jokowi, vowed during his 2014 election campaign to address inequality and abuse in Papua.
The former carpenter's road to the Presidential Palace in Jakarta is supported by 27 of all 29 districts - including Paniai.
But nothing has changed in Papua, and today the locals feel betrayed.
"We are heartbroken, and in 2014 we voted for Jokowi in the hope that he would fulfill our wishes and restore fairness," Yu said.
Indeed, just two months after Jokowi took office in October, Paniai has suffered his worst nightmare.
On 12 months and 7 days in 2014, 11 children in Ena Rotali were singing Christmas carols in front of a bonfire outside when two Indonesian soldiers suddenly rushed over on a motorbike.
The frightened children told them that they should turn on the headlights.
One of the soldiers was dissatisfied with their tone and then returned with four soldiers, according to the local Pastor, Yavit Tebai.
Victims and witnesses said the drunken soldiers chased the group of children with their guns.
One of the soldiers then fired shots at the group of children.
Ulyanus Yemo, 16, was left in a coma after being badly beaten.
A few hours later, a blaze broke out in the building of the Election Commission, a nearby government agency, and the incident escalated on the second day.
About 1,000 young Papua men, women and children gathered at a football field in front of the local police station and military command centre to demand justice.
Armed with a ceremonial hunting bow, they danced the Waita of the Mee Pago tribe in Papua - running in circles and imitating birdsong.
Some of the protesters began throwing stones at regular military posts.
When the mood continued to intensify, the soldiers received orders over internal radio: "If the crowd resists more than three times, shoot immediately," but the document was not released to local media, according to an official document seen by the times.
Yeremias Kayamu, 56, the head of the Kego Koto neighbourhood of Enarotali, sensed the impending danger and appealed to the crowd to calm down and implored them to go home.
But no one was in the mood to listen to him.
He stood on the porch of his brightly colored wooden House and told time magazine "when I turned back, I was suddenly shot in my left wrist."
Kayamu still does not know who fired the shots, but he said the bullets came from among the assembled soldiers.
He added "it was crowded at the time and they fired a lot of shots."
According to the cousin of Olfjus Juul, a local, he witnessed the shooting and saw Olfjus Juul being shot three times in the body.
Yuhanes sadly told time magazine, "I ran over to check his body to see if it was not him,
I found him dead... I kissed him. "
The Chief Inspector of the Papua Police, Yuj Mende, told reporters that his subordinates were only "protecting" the Police station because it had been attacked.
"When someone threatens to kill us, we have to defend ourselves," said Puggio Sulistio, a spokesman for the Papua Police and Police chief in 2015.
It's a matter of life and death. '
Five young protesters were killed and many more were injured, according to Human Rights Watch.
News of the killing spread only slowly in Jakarta on the second day.
Three weeks later, Jokowi gave an impassioned speech in Chayapura, expressing deep sympathy for the families of the victims and vowing to address the abusive legacy of Papua's history.
"I hope this case will be resolved as soon as possible so that it doesn't happen again in the future," he said.
Verando, the security Minister for the 10 months of 2016, said he was going to set up a non-judicial mechanism to address the historical legacy of human rights violations.
But the excuse to push off also sounded almost immediately.
"Most of the violations occurred a long time ago," he said.
Some were in the 90s and early 2000s.
The point is that we are committed to addressing these violations, but it will take a process. "
Then six months and five days in Jakarta, Wirando came out in a conversation with time magazine, saying he had no plans to establish a complaints mechanism in Papua.
Instead, he said "everything will be settled in accordance with the law."
The United Nations has filed a complaint against Wirando for "anti-human rights crimes" over the deaths of more than 1,000 people in East Timor's bloody independence vote in 1999, but he said 11 cases of human rights violations in the Papua region had been resolved, including the Panai incident.
The families of the victims of the Paniai incident scoffed at these claims.
"I've been interviewed four times in the past three years, but things haven't moved on at all," Yohanes said.
Years later he said "I'm tired."
He is still living in fear.
He said "I'm scared.
I'm afraid of being arrested by the army, of being shot, "he said.
His brother, Yucaboos, agreed that the people of Paniai were afraid to talk about the incident.
He said he was beaten by the military after helping to bury four victims.
He said "after burying the body, the military came to me."
The shooting did not stop.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police shot villagers in Deyai County, a neighboring county in Paniai.
A construction company manager refused to help transport a comatose man to hospital, and the two sides clashed, killing one person and injuring 17 others, among them children.
Lavianus Dowe, a 24-year-old man, drowned while fishing by a nearby River and died on his way to the hospital.
Angry villagers protested in front of the company's site office.
Police said the villagers threw stones at the police, so the police fired a warning.
But riot mobile units (Indonesian paramilitary police) began shooting at the crowd and one person was killed.
"We all panicked at the time and are now afraid that they will retaliate," Domin Valley Buddy, 29, who lives near the hospital and witnessed the wounded being rushed to the hospital, told the times.
"I hid at home for two days."
The Deyai parliament has called for the police involved to be brought to Justice and for riot mobile units to be withdrawn from the area.
Paniai has always been a right and wrong place for the Indonesian government.
The lack of effective development breeds discontent among the Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal tribal peoples, which are scattered in the lush central highlands of Panai.
Many have joined the Free Papua Movement (OPM), a rebel army that claims to protect the rights of Papuans through scattered attacks and raids to kidnap Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the senior leaders of the Free Papua Movement were born in Paniai, including Tadius Yugi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
As a result, thousands of Panai have been arrested by the military in recent years under the guise of "upholding national sovereignty" and deliberately detained.
Some never showed up again.
In the eyes of the Papuans, Paniai is a "forgotten land of tragedy."
Poverty breeds discontent.
Enarotali is selling so little rice that the locals can't buy it at all.
Bread is simply out of reach.
People here grow everything they can eat: Mainly sweet potatoes and some fruit and leafy vegetables.
Farming is a woman's job, and every woman can take care of four or five sweet potato fields.
They usually keep most of the harvest for household use and sell the rest on the local market.
Ten sweet potatoes are worth only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Over time, economic inequality has opened up among local Papuans and new immigrants, and the number of these migrants has increased significantly since the opening of the new route to Nabile Airport.
The few jobs available usually fall into the hands of better-educated and wealthier immigrants.
Few Papuans have the funds or the necessary skills to run competitive companies.
John Gobai, president of the Paniai tribal Council, said "young people don't want to stay in this village... because there are no jobs and no money here."
Papua is isolated.
In addition, restrictions on international media coverage remain tight.
Earlier this year, French journalists Frank Escudi and Basel Longchamp were expelled from Papua because they "did not cooperate with the relevant agencies," even if they had received a rare authorization to film.
Jokowi's election vow to lift reporting restrictions to promote transparency and development has not been fulfilled, according to Felim Kane, Deputy Director for Asia at Human Rights Watch.
"If foreign journalists try to cover Indonesia's easternmost disaffected provinces of Papua and West Papua, they are at new risk: Denial of visas and blacklisting," he said in a statement.
The absence of media scrutiny means that international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely limited to Papua's neighbors.
In March, six Pacific countries - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands, Solomon Islands - requested the United Nations Human Rights Council to investigate "all types of widespread Human Rights violations" in Papua, including the Panai shooting.
These countries have also supported the Free Papua Movement.
Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesman Almanata Nassir did not care about the group's allegations, telling reporters in Jakarta that "Indonesia still has a democratic system and a free media, so evidence of human rights violations is difficult to hide."
Locals want more foreign governments to pay attention.
Five months and four days, when the Dutch ambassador for human rights, case Van Barr, led a delegation of officials to Chayapura, local people broke their silence and begged, "We want to be free," according to a person familiar with the meeting, who also attended the meeting but requested anonymity.
Indonesia will hold its next presidential election in 2019, but Papuans say they are unlikely to vote for Jokowi again.
Gobai, president of the tribal Council, said "Jokowi's intentions were good, but he was surrounded by people involved in the Paniai shooting."
He wants Jokowi to know that the people of Paniai not only live under the threat of a greedy army, but also have nothing, a region with little education and a lack of public health care.
Gobai said the people of Paniai, like other Papuans, believed that their vote for Jokowi was a debt he had to pay.
He said "they don't need money, they need Justice."
Even under threats and intimidation, the families of the victims of the Paniai shooting made their last symbolic Revolt: Burying the body of a victim opposite the military police post.
They know that justice may never come, but at least they will not let the culprits forget their crimes.
Yucaboos bowed his head and said "my family has been killed,
What else can we do? "

9 (Reuters) - Samsung Electronics on Tuesday released its first set of components for self-driving vehicles, developed with Harman International, as well as information entertainment solutions, in an important move into the automotive Electronics market, Reuters said.
Samsung Electronics bought Harman International about a year ago.
At this week's Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas, Samsung released car cameras with collision warnings, lane offset warnings, and cruise control features, which were developed in partnership with Harman.
Samsung plans to start shipping the camera system this year, which is built on technologies such as automatic machine learning and expansion of reality.
Samsung also showcased the "digital cockpit", which can make the vehicle more personal even if the driver is not the owner, as the system allows users to download the driver's information from mobile devices and clouds.

Fire engulfs Dubai's Torch Tower again
A fire broke out in one of the world's tallest residential buildings in Dubai on Friday, forcing hundreds of residents to flee the 337-meter-high, 79-storey super-high-rise building.
It was the second fire to sweep through a high-rise building in just two years, and it happened to be in the Motian tower known as the "Torch."
The building has been evacuated, no injuries have been reported and no cause of the blaze has been identified.
'We were sleeping and then We were woken up by the fire alarm and people started screaming.
We ran down the stairs and it took about 10 minutes to run down from the 50th floor, "a resident named George told Reuters.
The fire brigade extinguished the blaze at around 4: 00 local time (0000 GMT) and is cooling the building, according to the civil defence authority in Dubai.
The Government indicated that efforts were being made to provide places of refuge for those affected.
The accident is likely to reignite concerns around the world about the safety of the use of external wall materials in high-rise buildings.
A survey conducted by the management of the "Torch" skyscraper after its 2015 fire found that most of the objects damaged were cladding panels for decoration and insulation.
British police have said they believe problems with the Thermal insulation and cladding system at the Glenfer building in London may have contributed to the rapid spread of the fire in June, which killed about 80 people.
The Williams team also hinted at the possibility of Massa's return, although he has announced his retirement.
January 9 is only a month before the opening of the Winter Olympics in PyeongChang, South Korea. With the transfer of the Olympic flame from South to north and intensive preparations, the Winter Olympic atmosphere in South Korea is becoming increasingly strong.
South Korean public opinion expects the long-running inter-Korean talks to bring a "colored egg" to the one-month countdown to the PyeongChang Winter Olympics.
The PyeongChang Winter Olympic flame arrived in South Korea on November 1 last year.
The surge in the flame is directly reflected in ticket sales for the PyeongChang Winter Olympics.
Just over two months ago, the rate of ticket sales for the PyeongChang Winter Olympics hovered at only 32%, and only 4.3% for the Winter Paralympic Games. The low rate of ticket sales once raised concerns about the popularity of the PyeongChang Winter Olympics.
But as Li Xi-fan, Chairman of the Organizing Committee for the Winter Olympics in PyeongChang, predicted to reporters not long ago, "as the Winter Olympic flame is passed around South Korea, the heat of the Winter Games is growing, and it is believed that ticket sales will soon improve."
As of January 3, ticket sales for the PyeongChang Winter Olympics had reached 64 percent, and ticket sales for the Winter Paralympics had topped 50 percent, according to South Korean media.
To encourage foreigners to watch the Games in South Korea, South Korea's Ministry of Justice also announced on Monday that it would extend the stay in South Korea for foreigners visiting the country to watch the PyeongChang Winter Olympics for up to 120 days.
More than a fifth of American travelers carry prohibited items on board, the survey found
A survey of plane passengers found that more than 20 percent of passengers had deliberately or unintentionally carried illegal items through U.S. Transportation Security Administration checkpoints, with at least 6 percent of them unintentionally carrying prohibited knives or other bladed objects on board.
Less than 1 per cent of passengers claimed they only found out afterwards that they had mistakenly travelled with guns, ammunition or explosives.
The survey of more than 1,000 people, conducted by charter services firm Stratos Jet Charters Inc., also found that young travelers were more likely to blatantly ignore the rules.
Of the respondents who admitted to having deliberately attempted to carry TSA contraband on board, 19.7 per cent were millennials, compared with less than 15 per cent of the Generation X population.
The most common items that deliberately slip through TSA security personnel are food and drink.
More than 3 per cent admitted to deliberately carrying a bladed object through security, while 2.2 per cent of female respondents and 3.7 per cent of male respondents also said they had deliberately carried prohibited drugs on board.
The company said the survey of travelers across the country was to find out the number of people who accidentally and deliberately carried embargoed goods through aircraft security.
It is not surprising that the people most likely to carry embargoed goods through security - intentionally or unintentionally - are those who fly most frequently.
However, the company points out that the TSA guide is a bit complicated and difficult to understand.
People are usually unsure what and how much liquid they can carry.
So it is not surprising that the TSA seized, at best, a banned liquid.
It was once thought that the TSA might have treated books as an embargo as well.
Domestic flights are allowed to carry liquids, but international flights are not.
Pruitt, head of the EPA, changes his mind about Obama-era emissions reduction regulations
A day after being sued by 15 States, Scott Pruitt, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, reversed his earlier decision to delay the implementation of Obama-era regulations to reduce emissions of smog air pollutants.
Pruitt proposed the change because the EPA was able to respond more quickly to the needs of environmental regulatory state agencies than previous governments.
He did not mention the legal challenge brought by the federal appeals court against his predecessor's position.
At issue is the setting of a 10-month, 1-day deadline for states to begin meeting the 2015 ground-level ozone standards.
In June, Pruitt announced that he would delay compliance for one year in order to give the Environmental Protection Agency more time to study the plan and avoid "interfering with local decision-making or impeding economic growth."
Prior to his appointment by President Donald Trump, Pruitt was the attorney general of Oklahoma and had long opposed the tightening of environmental regulations.
Since arriving in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly turned to blocking or Delaying regulations opposed by the chemical and fossil fuel industries.
Wednesday's sudden reversal is the latest legal hurdle on Pruitt's regulatory return agenda.
Last month, a federal appeals court in Washington ruled that the head of the environmental protection agency overstepped his authority to try to delay enforcement of the Obama administration's rules requiring oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leaks.
In a statement released Wednesday night, Pruitt offered a U-turn in his approach to ozone standards, saying he wanted to strengthen the EPA's commitment to work with States to adopt complex procedures to reach new standards.
"Under the previous administration, the EPA typically failed to meet the designated deadline and then waited for activist groups and others to sue before agreeing to set a designated timetable by agreement," said Mr Pruitt, who has launched more than a dozen prosecutions against the EPA in his previous work.
"We don't believe in regulation through litigation, and We take deadlines seriously.
We also take regulations and authorities seriously, "he said.
Still, the EPA statement said Pruitt may again use his "extended authorization and all other legally available authorizations" to ensure that the provisions are consistent with "good policy and the best information available."
Republicans in Congress are pushing for a broad rewrite of the ozone layer regulations.
The House bill, approved last month, aims to delay implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years.
The measure has not yet been voted on in the Senate.
New York state Attorney General Eric Schneiderman led a coalition of States to sue the EPA this week, saying it intended to maintain legal pressure.
"The EPA reversal - after we filed the lawsuit - is a significant victory for the health and safety of 6.7 million New Yorkers, with more than 115 million American communities directly affected by smoke emissions," Schneiderman said.
California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington, as well as the District of Columbia, all joined New York in the case.
Ground-level ozone is formed by the reaction of common pollutants emitted by cars, power plants, refineries, chemical plants and other sources to sunlight in the atmosphere.
The resulting smoke can cause serious breathing problems for sensitive people, causing thousands of premature deaths each year.
Of course, public health advocates and environmentalists cheered Pruitt's surprising shift.
Lori Ann bird, of the centre for Biological Diversity, said: "It is disturbing that this common-sense measure has come under intense pressure from the head of the Department that protects the air we need to breathe."
"We must fight to the end with the Trump administration's ideological movement to cater to polluters and special interest groups."

Since the second half of 2009, sales of flowers and trees in Xiaoshan have maintained a high trend. In particular, this Spring, sales of Xiaoshan seedlings have reached a record high, with a significant increase in sales and prices. According to statistics, the sales of seedlings in Xiaoshan from January to June this year increased by 48% over the same period last year, the largest increase in nearly 20 years.
Shi Haiyong, Deputy Director of the Xiaoshan Forestry Bureau, said that with the good sales situation, Xiaoshan flower and wood production has also achieved rapid development.
In the past two years, the area under flower cultivation in Xiaoshan has expanded by 30,000 mu, reaching a total area of 180,000 mu; at the same time, it has actively developed outside the region, and Xiaoshan seedling farmers have established flower and wood bases throughout the country to reach 80,000 mu, an increase of 30,000 mu over 2008.
While the planting area is expanding, the quality of seedlings is also constantly improving, the storage value of nurseries is constantly increasing, large specifications and high quality seedlings are retained more, and some seedlings appear sparing sale.
Shi also cautioned that, in the face of the current boom in production and sales, producers should be calm and objective analysis, so as to see that the social demand for flowers and trees will be long-term and increasing, and at the same time recognize that the market will be more competitive.
On the morning of July 13, Beijing time, the U.S. company Somaltus filed a lawsuit in the East Texas District Court, accusing Apple of violating a battery technology patent it filed in 2010.
The company has previously sued Asus, Lenovo, Samsung, Sony and Toshiba with the same patents.
Both the iPhone 6s and similar Apple devices violated U.S. Patent 7,657,386, which is called the "Integrated battery service system," the lawsuit said.
The plaintiff wanted cash compensation or a patent fee for the infringing equipment after the judgement was pronounced.
Judging by the indictment, the plaintiffs appear to believe that the fast-charging feature of the iPhone violated the company's patent.
A fast-charging iPhone will quickly charge up to 80% of the electricity, followed by a trickle charge.
Somaltus is actually a so-called "patent rogue" because the company does not offer obvious products and services and it is difficult to find relevant information online.
However, they have successfully reached an out-of-court settlement with auto makers such as Ford and Nissan over the patent.
The meeting considered that accelerating the development of informatization, promoting the integration and efficient use of resources and raising the level of digitization and intelligence of the industry are of great significance in promoting "made in China 2025" and mass entrepreneurship and mass innovation, nurturing new kinetic energy and improving the quality of life of the masses.

Trump had pressured Mexico to pay for a Wall at the border, according to leaked phone records
The Washington Post leaked a transcript of the call between U.S. President Donald Trump and the leaders of Mexico and Australia.
On January 27, in a call to Mexican president Enrique Pena Nieto, Trump urged him to stop publicly saying he would not pay for the proposed border Wall.
The President of the United States reportedly expressed his displeasure at his public bashing of the Wall, with Putterrand allegedly saying to him: "You don't tell the media."
Trump promised during his presidential campaign to build a Wall on the southern border of the United States and solemnly announced that he would make Mexico pay for the project.
A transcript of the call between him and Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, which showed a tense exchange between them, was also released.
Trump told Turnbull that it was "ridiculous," "obnoxious" and "stupid" for the United States to take on a deal for refugees to be sent to Australia, and that he had suggested that the United States ban refugee resettlement, while now sticking to a deal brokered by the Obama administration would make him look like a "fool."
Trump hung up after telling Turnbull "it was the most unpleasant call today."
In an acceptance speech read on his behalf by the U.S. Ambassador to Sweden, Dylan said he was still on his way to the tour when he received the award and that "it took me quite a while to react."

Moore Beach tragedy: Activists recreate racist lynchings and deliver Justice
A 1948 Ford Mercury car rumbled through a crowd of bystanders in the small town of Monroe, Georgia, toward the tiny Moore beach Bridge.
The car was carrying four black passengers and a White driver, and before the car arrived at the bridge, a group of White men with guns approached and blocked the car's way forward.
The head of the mob - a middle-aged man in a pinstriped suit - took a deep sip of his cigar and glanced into the windshield.
The passengers in the car were filled with fear.
"We want - Roger!" The man shouted.
"Drag him out of the car!"
A young black man was dragged from the front passenger seat and screams pierced the silence.
Fortunately, the terrible scene of 7 months and 22 days was just a repeat.
But when "Roger" had a noose around his neck, there was a real gasp from almost all the onlookers.
Since 2005, civil rights activists have returned to the Moore beach Bridge to recreate the scenes of two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Marcon, and George and mere Dorsey - the night they were lynched by the Ku Klux Klan in 1946.
No one has ever been charged with murder.
"Although we know who they are, and even though we've seen them in the community, it's unbelievable that none of them have been arrested over the years," said Tillon Brooks, who helped organize the repeat.
"It's a stain on history, a burden on our souls."
Brooks, 71, is a former Georgia state congressman and lifelong rights activist.
For him, the repeat was a remarkable call to action, an annual reminder to the people of the Monroe community that injustice has never been corrected.
"We want to sue, We want to close the case, We want to heal, We want reconciliation, but We have to get Justice first," he said.
"Unless We get justice, We will not be healed and reconciled."
On July 27, 1946, the coroner put a sheet over the body of a victim of a Moore beach lynching.
According to FBI files obtained by NBC News, more than 50 men from Monroe and surrounding counties are suspected of involvement in the lynching.
But none of them have ever been prosecuted.
While the suspect has been at large for decades, civil rights activists say the dual motive for carrying out the lynching is well known throughout the town: Political and sexual.
In the fourth month of 1946, a Supreme Court ruling allowed black citizens of the state of Georgia to vote for the first time in the primaries later that summer.
Around the same time, according to the FBI, Roger Malcolm, a black tenant farmer, assassinated Barnet Hurst, a White landlord, in a struggle - seemingly for a woman.
Brooks said the rumor in the town was that Hurst had slept with Malcolm's wife, Dorothy, and that her baby was not her husband's.
Seven months and 25 days in 1946, Loy Harrison, a prominent White landlord, paid $600 to bail Malcolm out of jail, according to the FBI.
Dorothy and his cousins, McMurray and George Dorsey, accompanied him to prison.
But as they returned from prison and approached the Moore beach Bridge, a mob of vigilantes fenced the car.
"It turns out that it was Harrison who organized and ordered the murder," an FBI report concluded.
"It is clear that there was a conspiracy between state and local law enforcement, who not only participated in the murder, destroyed the evidence, but also concealed the identity of the witness."
Brooks is very concise.
"This is a voting rights tragedy," he said.
"They were killed, and it was the killer who sent a message to black people in this community: 'If you sign up and vote, the same will happen to you.'"
For nearly a decade, Cassandra Green has been leading the annual repeat of the Moore Beach Bridge lynchings.
Her style of expression is vivid and gripping, with a deep background of racism that many hope no longer exists in the United States.
It's hard to watch, it's harder not to watch, but green says that's the key.
"We don't want to talk about lynchings because lynchings make us face the ugly face of all," she said.
'But I can't build a relationship with you if you don't listen to me or if you don't hear me tell my own story. '
This year's show began in June, with nearly 30 actors - a dozen whites and the rest black - huddled in a room to hear Greene release a rehearsed overview of the show.
Wade Marbaugh served as co-director of Green.
For years, he played the role of the Ku Klux Klan, but he said the role was never easy.
"I feel dirty because I'm not such a person," Marbaugh said.
'But I think it's very important to keep this history alive because we don't want to go back to that era. '
In the room, actors Darios Bradshaw and Nick Lascona, who played Roger Malcolm and Barnet Hurst, were rehearsing their lines.
At the beginning of the scene, Malcolm yelled and pushed Hurst away, angry that he had slept with his wife, Dorothy.
"I said, get out of my place!"
Lascona shot back.
And then they got into a fight.
Then everyone (at least all the black actors) burst into laughter.
Green laughed the most.
"What's wrong?!," Lascona asked.
He was alarmed, confused.
Did I overdo it?
"No," green said with a laugh.
"I just don't think White people say 'Ah' when they hit back."
"Yes," quipped another black actor.
"Your tone has to be tough."
In this way, the energy in the room changes; the feeling of camaraderie drives away the discomfort.
Everyone tried to do so, not only to perform the scene, but also in memory of the four victims.
The scene starts again.
This time, Lascona's tone was sharp and powerful when he said the word "Ah."
No one was laughing.
The repeat ended powerfully and quickly.
There were screams, gunshots, and then, there was a silence.
A woman dressed in funeral black stood by the actor's body, singing Billy Halide's mournful words, "Strange Fruit."
Her voice outweighed the other words.
A hundred yards away, about forty spectators were constantly wiping sweat and tears.
Blacks and whites made up almost half of the audience.
A couple made a special trip from Ithaca, New York, to see the show, and many others lived near the road.
Brooks took them to worship at the cemeteries of Malcolm and Dorothy, nearly eight hours away, and everyone was suffering from the uncomfortable feeling of wet heat in Georgia.
Until this point, the murderers were still a mystery, but now, standing in the same land where the lynching took place, the air was filled with anxiety.
When the final note of the song disappeared, Green asked people to come closer to examine the body played by the actor.
The children leaned over and looked at the fake blood and bodies, whispering to each other.
"They're not really dead," a little boy muttered to himself, as if to remind himself.
A few minutes later, green thanked the crowd and then the performance was over.
The actor shook off the lynching ropes and wiped away tears.
Bradshaw hugs Marbaugh, the suit man who plays the leader of the Ku Klux Klan.
Nick Lascona hugged his two colleagues and wept in their arms; the emotion in the performance eventually infected him.
"It's OK," one of the women whispers.
"We know it's not like that inside you.
You're doing this for a reason. '
After that, the audience sat down to dinner with the actor.
At the same table, a White couple from Atlanta had an intimate chat with a black couple they had just met, talking about a repeat.
Denise Duplinsky had a hard time finding words to describe how she felt after watching.
"It's hard to imagine those horrible words and actions...... that are actually spoken and done by people like you, because they look a lot like you," she said.
"This, for me, seriously made me think that lynchings were still going on," she said, adding, "now this sort of thing is just called police shootings."
In the room, Tillon Brooks sat at the table watching, tasting and recounting civil rights.
He said he had started planning for next year's performance.
"Repetition is a way of drumming because it describes the horrors we have experienced, but it is also very educational," he said.
'If you don't learn from it, this sort of thing could happen again.
Those who don't study and don't understand their own history are doomed to repeat it, "he said.
For the reform of natural gas marketization, the importance of the reform of "pipe network independence" is self-evident, but the resistance and controversy are also greater.
The reporter learned from Hebei Kailuan Group that at 11: 25 a.m. on the 7th, an explosion occurred at the emulsification workshop of Kailuan Group Chemical Co. Ltd., located in the ancient Metallurgical District of Tangshan City, Hebei Province, and 13 operators were trapped at the scene.
So far, of the 13 people trapped, one has been rescued and rushed to hospital, while the remaining 12 are in intense search and rescue.
It is understood that at present the scene has been cordoned off, local public security, fire, medical and other departments are on the scene rescue.
According to witnesses, there was a loud bang at the time of the incident and an instantaneous mushroom cloud rose into the air.
According to the personnel of Kailuan Group, which organized search and rescue on the spot, Tangshan Kailuan (Group) Chemical Co. Ltd. is located in the north of Zhaojiazhuang, Tangshan City, Hebei Province. It is a state-approved designated production enterprise of civilian blasting equipment. It was established in 1958, formerly known as the 6 O 2 Factory of the Kailuan Mining Bureau.
Jay Chou has produced a new album every year since he came out 15 years ago, but he was rarely out of contract last year.
However, the fans did not express any dissatisfaction with this, but Qi Qi sent his blessing, because the reason for the broken contract is that Jay Chou was happy to become a father.
After waiting for a full year and a half, Jay Chou finally came to Beijing yesterday to present his first work since he upgraded his father, as well as the 14th album of his music career, "Jay Chou's Bedtime story."
US media: Scientists at the Chinese Air Force Engineering University study laser satellites for the removal of space garbage
Chinese scientists have come up with a bold and innovative proposal to use large lasers to clean up the cluttered Earth's orbit and destroy old satellites as well as its sky garbage, US media said.
According to Newsweek's website on January 15, researchers at the Chinese Air Force Engineering University wrote a paper entitled "Sky based laser removal small scale Space debris reorbiting Model study", which describes how space debris can be irradiated by lasers into smaller, less hazardous debris through the use of Sky based platform lasers.
Space junk has been a concern for international space agencies for years, and NASA has considered a variety of options to track, detect and remove man-made debris, the report said.
Ways to remove large-scale space debris include giant networks used to sweep and collect waste, as well as magnets that can be used to suck them out of orbit. Chinese scientists have conducted laser simulation studies and concluded that this would be an effective way to clean up the Earth's orbit.
"(The simulation study) provides the necessary theoretical basis for the application of space-based platform laser space debris removal technology," the summary of the paper said.
A 2014 study by U.S. defense giant Lockheed Martin found that for satellites in orbit, there are about 200 threats a day.
High-speed debris moving along the Earth's orbit is seen as a serious threat to future Space missions and has been described as a "deadly chain of threats" by experts at the European Space Agency. High-speed debris has continued to increase over the past year.
Space is largely empty, but space next to the Earth is becoming more and more crowded, and every satellite we send into space will eventually become another piece of debris orbiting the Earth, which will build up over time, according to the website of the monthly Volkswagen Machinery.
The more debris there is, the higher the chance that a satellite that is still functioning will be hit by debris, which in turn damages or destroys an investment worth hundreds of thousands of dollars.
All space agencies have made plans to remove space junk in the future, according to the report.
NASA is considering using Jet gas to reduce the speed of debris and get it out of orbit, Europe is considering launching a satellite carrying a large net to capture debris and bring it back to Earth, and the Japanese idea is to capture debris with an electric chain.
For now, China is also proposing a solution to space junk by using a large laser to smash floating space debris into less harmful small pieces.
Installing such a laser on a satellite would be effective enough to clean up space, at least according to simulation results, according to a paper published by a group of researchers at the Chinese Air Force Engineering University in the German monthly Optics.
The only way to prove effectiveness is to test, and there are no arrangements for such a mission, but perhaps sooner or later someone will install a laser on a satellite and send it into space, the report said.
Once we do, we can finally begin to eliminate the problem of space junk once and for all.

Person Group cut another 3,000 jobs and slashed its dividend to revive the business
British education group person said Friday it would cut another 3,000 jobs and slash its interim dividend by 72 per cent as it embarked on another restructuring project to deal with business pressures.
Chief Executive John Farron said most of the job cuts would take place in the second half of 2018 and the first half of 2019, after 4,000 jobs had been cut in the restructuring.
Person Group in May announced plans to cut another 300 million pounds ($394 million) in three cost-cutting projects to revive a business hit by the rapid development of digital learning.
Last month, the company agreed to sell its stake in Penguin Langdon House to partner Bertelsmann and published a report that its underlying sales rose 1 per cent to £20.5bn in the first half of the year, but said the outlook for the year was unchanging.
A few days ago, the China Tian Association issued a serious notice to severely beat the phenomenon of running and was prepared to impose a heavy penalty of a lifetime ban on violators.
Nato soldiers killed in a suicide bombing attack on a convoy in Kabul
A military convoy has been hit by a suicide bomber in the Afghan capital, Kabul, killing one Nato soldier and injuring several others, according to official sources.
Five soldiers and an interpreter were injured, according to the Nato statement.
Three civilians also died in the incident in the Karabag area of the city, according to unconfirmed local reports.
It was the latest violent attack to hit Afghanistan - more than 30 people were killed in the bombing of a mosque in Herat on Tuesday.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
A joint patrol of the Afghan and Nato coalition forces was hit by an "individual carrying an improvised explosive device" attack on Thursday night, according to the Nato statement.
All those injured are now in stable condition and are being treated at the U.S. military hospital at Bagram airbase, according to the statement.
According to journalists, the growing strength of the Taliban and the so-called Islamic State (is) group in the Karabakh region has raised serious concerns among Nato forces stationed near Bagram.
At least 1,662 civilians died in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, while the capital accounted for about 20%, according to the United Nations.
At least 30 people were killed in a suicide car bomb attack in a predominantly Shiite area of Kabul at the end of seven months.
The Taliban claimed they had carried out the attack.
Five months and 31 days, a huge explosion killed more than 150 people in central Kabul, the deadliest militant attack in the country since the U.S.-led multinational force toppled the Taliban in 2001.
The violence highlights the perilous security situation in the country at a time when U.S. President Donald Trump is weighing whether to send more troops to Afghanistan to support its troops and police.
The suicide bombings in Kabul in recent weeks have also triggered a crisis of public confidence in the government and its policies, particularly the reputation of President Ashraf Ghani, according to journalists.
The National Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) overturned the resolution after a lawsuit to delay smog regulations
In office, Obama issued a rule requiring states to curb smog-causing emissions, and 15 states sued the National Environmental Protection Agency for the rule, which was overturned by the EPA a day after the lawsuit.
The EPA on Wednesday announced its decision to continue to pursue the so-called "2015 Ozone compliance zone" and promised that the EPA would work with the States.
EPA administrator Scott Pruitt said in a statement, "we are confident in dialogue with our national partners and are committed to responding to it."
Pruitt announced in June that the EPA plans to delay the implementation of the ozone compliance zone standard to 10 months in 2018, with a delay of one year - according to which existing smoke pollution in some areas is measured to determine which areas should reduce emissions that cause smoke pollution in order to meet air quality standards.
Fifteen major Democratic States, as well as the District of Columbia, filed a lawsuit against it on Tuesday, claiming the act was against the law.
As part of a broader agenda, President Donald Trump's administration has been working to restore various environmental regulations promoted by former President Barack Obama to spur economic growth.
But the efforts have sparked opposition from Democrats and conservative groups, who fear more emissions will affect public health.
Breathing air containing ozone "reduces lung function and increases respiratory symptoms," such as asthma, according to the EPA's website.

McKee Garcia and Vassily Lomarchenko met for the first time to explore a possible showdown in the future
The most high-profile boxing match under 147 pounds will be held soon, and Vassily Lomarchenko and Mackie Garcia, who are currently in a state of potential conflict, met for the first time on Thursday.
They were in separate rooms at the ESPN office in Los Angeles, where García, the undefeated World Boxing Council lightweight champion, led the way down the hallway to greet Loma chenko, the World Boxing Organization's super-featherweight champion.
At the Showtime boxing match on Saturday, the referee unanimously decided that Garcia had beaten four-division world champion Adrian Brona to victory, by which time both boxers had become the top five players in the same heavyweight list.
Garcia stretched out his right hand and said, "how are you, champion?
Good luck with that. ""
Lomarchenko preserved his position with a victory over Miguel Mariaga in the ESPN game at 7: 00 on Saturday night.
When the two of them were photographed, Lomarchenko's agent, Egis Klimas, pointed out that the potential showdown between the two contestants depended on the "perfect size."
"I was lightweight before," Garcia said.
'I raised my grade to fight Brona (140lbs), but I didn't weigh that much.
I'm still a little short of my weight relative to 140 pounds.
I want to go back to lightweight.
And he has to reach the lightweight (135lbs) before we can play against each other.
That's what fans want, too.
Then we'll satisfy them. '
Lomarchenko agreed.
"The Boxing world needs this fight."
Klimas asked if he should be charged on a pay-per-view basis, and part of his strategy is that Lomarchenko must be allowed to play a debut match with a 135-pound player later this year to set a date for next summer with Garcia (37-0, 30 knockout), who is also interested in going up against the winner of the nine-month 23-day Forum lightweight boxing match against Jorge Linares - Luke Campbell.
"With all the fans asking the question, the fight could be on a pay-per-view basis," Garcia said, after which he was open to playing on the network, which offers the best financial solution.
"We are the main people.
It's impossible for anyone else to generate so much attention.
As long as they're ready... "
Garcia appreciates that Lomarchenko is "an excellent contestant" and may be on the spot to watch his boxing match on Saturday.
But Lomarchenko hesitated about Garcia's praise, saying he thought the three-division champion from Riverside looked "slow. Sorry, McGee... you're going to get knocked out."
'The point is to show the power of the fist and then boxing, 'Garcia said.
They all said they could feel the momentum of their boxing match.
"This is a battle that must be fought,
Attention and heat are beyond the reach of any other boxing match.
I'm more than happy to compete, "Garcia said.
Lomarchenko said: "I've been waiting for the top fighters, this time round to McGee.
It's going to be a great matchup. '

At present in China, many children have given up their studies because they target professional golfers, and go smoothly on the career path, and will not consider college.
The announcement by China Development and Reform Commission officials on the early completion of the eleventh five-year emission reduction target has given the steel industry, which has limited electricity production, strong expectations of a return to production.
Although at present steel mills have not received a clear notification from the local government that energy conservation and emission reduction has come to an end, the industry estimates that, around December 15, 2010, steel plants that had been limited in production will be returned to production, and steel prices may begin to come under pressure.
There has been no notice of the end of the power limit, but in fact the pressure on individual enterprises has been much less than in September and October, a private steel company in Hebei province told reporters.
Parts of Hebei have repeatedly issued documents limiting the production of electricity, and at one point adopted the method of forced sluice to restrict the production of enterprises.
The reporter learned from local enterprises that at present, steel mills in most parts of Hebei have resumed work, and the pressure to limit production has eased.
My steel network analyst Zhang Tieshan expects that, as the north is already in winter, the terminal demand for construction steel will gradually change from strong to weak.
Coupled with the gradual end of energy conservation and emission reduction, most steel mills will basically resume production by December 15, and products will reach local markets by New year's Day.
The increased availability of resources will put some pressure on steel prices, which are currently on the rise.

The 68th Emmy Awards ceremony was held yesterday (the evening of September 18, local time) in Los Angeles, United States.
This year's drama category, "look at the Emperor", was hotly contested, culminating in the defeat of a host of old actors by two newcomers: The Best Actor Award was won by Rami Marek, the first-time nominated "hacker Corps" Actor, and the Best Actress Award was won by Tatiana Maslani, the "Black Orphan."
The big winners of the Emmy Awards are "the Game of power" and "the American Crime Story."
"American Crime Story" won important awards in the mini-drama / television film category, while "the Game of power" won 12 awards (including the technical category), including the Best Drama in the plot category, the Best director and the Best screenwriter.
At this point, "the Game of power" has reaped 38 Emmy Awards, making it the most award-winning TV series in history.
It's a pity that this year's "Game of power" has come to naught at the actor awards.

The representative of Italy said that Italy had a diversity of environmental technologies and solutions in the field of renewable resources, proposed pilot projects with China in the areas of industrial waste disposal, waste oil treatment and waste incineration treatment equipment, and looked forward to extending the experience of environmental cooperation with China to other parts of the world.
Latest results of age assessment test for asylum seekers in Sweden released
The Swedish asylum test uses the latest method to medically assess their age, and the latest results show that more than 80% of the subjects were judged to be over the age of 18, but not all were convinced of its accuracy.
The Swedish National Centre for legal Medicine (R? Ttsmedicinalverket) began the test earlier this year.
After being accused of failing to accurately assess the age of some of the refugees claiming to be minors, the Swedish Migration Board designed these tests with a view to making a more accurate age assessment during the asylum process.
So far, the Swedish Migration Board has sent 6,880 testers, and the Centre for Forensic Medicine has now published the results of a total of 2,481 testers between the middle of three months and seven months and 31 days in 2017.
Eighty per cent (2002) were judged to be 18 years of age or older, but in 25 other tests, the Swedish National Centre for legal Medicine determined that the subjects were "likely to be 18 years of age or older".
In 432 tests, the result was that the person "may be under the age of 18."
The test is only for people whose age is in doubt.
These results are consistent with those of previous months, according to John Gramson of the Center for Forensic science.
"These figures are not very different from those of previous months, and the figures are very consistent," he told the Local.
The high proportion of cases judged to be over 18 years of age does not necessarily mean that these asylum seekers have lied about their age.
In May, the Center released the results of 581 tests and said 442 "indicated that the subject was 18 years of age or older."
The news newspaper Svenska Dagbladet investigated the results of the 581 tests published and found that 243 of the subjects had publicly stated that they would be 18 years old this year.
An X-ray examination of wisdom teeth and an MRI scan of the joints, followed by analysis of the results by dentists and radiologists, has also been questioned in some areas.
One of the doubters is Claude Marcus, an endocrinologist at Caroline College, whose work includes assessing people's biological maturity to determine whether they experience puberty earlier or later than normal age.
He told the news newspaper Metro: "I have reason to think so, and I don't think the measurement used should be like this.
Determining biological age in this way is far from accurate.
If we can't guarantee accuracy, we shouldn't pretend we can, "he said.
Yet Gramson, of the Center for Forensic science, defended the accuracy of these tests: "By and large, it can be said that the risk of uncertainty in determining a child as an adult is small."
The biggest risk is that the person is just under the age of 18, which accounts for about 10 per cent.
Governor of West Virginia announces party change
On Thursday night, Jim Justice, the Democratic governor of West Virginia, announced at President Trump's rally that he would change the party.
"Like it or not, the Democrats have left me," the governor said.
'TODAY, after a lot of prayer and a lot of thinking, I'm going to tell you... Today I'm going to tell you as a West Virginia that I'm not going to be able to help you again as a Democratic governor. '
The rally erupted into cheers.
"So, tomorrow, I will change the party to the Republican party," Jastis added.
'AS a coach, I'm going to tell it's time to start another game. '
Trump earlier promised to make a major announcement at a rally in West Virginia.
Mr. Trump won 42 percent of the vote in West Virginia, while Jastis did not support Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Jastis was selected as the state's only billionaire in 2016, according to Forbes.
Forbes noted that he inherited his father's coal industry and owned coal mines in all five states.
At the moment, he is worth about $15.9 billion.
Meanwhile, the Republican National Committee issued a statement on Thursday night saying: "Gov. Jastis's change of Party is another blow to the Democratic Party, and far from preventing our country from becoming great again, it will make our country great again."
"The Democratic party currently has only 15 governors and control of the state legislature is at an all-time low, and Gov. Jastis's statement is the latest rejection of a party that has lost leadership from top to bottom and is unable to find a positive unifying slogan," Rona Mack Daniel, chairwoman of the Republican national committee, said in a statement to CBS News.
Fang Wenshan confessed that it is his dream to tell a complete story with music.
A song for four to five minutes, it's difficult to tell a story in full.
When I write songs it's just emotions, there's no story line, it's always felt like a pity.
Sebastian Coe praised Russia's "candid" apology for the doping scandal
On Thursday, the president of the International Athletic Federation, Sebastian Coe, praised Russia's apology for the doping scandal and called it "candid," but reiterated that this was not the moment for Russia to rejoin the sport.
Mitri Hilaktin, president of the Russian Athletics Federation, told the IAAF Congress on the eve of the World Athletics Championships that his country was right to be banned from the sport and that he was determined to fight doping.
He said he regretted that "all athletes who have won gold and silver medals in the competition have been stripped of their medals."
Despite his comments, the IAAF general Assembly voted in favour of maintaining the ban, after a report by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) referred to the discovery of evidence of Russian state-sponsored doping, which was imposed in the 11th month of 2015.
"I think the response today was a very candid, very candid presentation," IAAF president Coe told reporters.
"The whole Council and the IAAF Assembly are delighted...... the Russian Federation acknowledges that it has gone through a very scorching period and is doing everything possible to ensure that Russia can get back into the game." "
Coe said he was also "pleased" that Russia had accepted the criteria for reentry.
"I think it was a very constructive day and also that we have made some progress, but the IAAF Assembly supports the recommendations of the ad hoc panel and now is not the time to reinstate Russia's eligibility," Coe said.
"We need to do everything in our power over the next few months to normalize this situation.
Our guiding principle has always been the desire to separate clean athletes from the contaminated system, "he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes meet the strict standards of the IAAF and will compete as neutral players at the World Athletics Championships in London on Friday.

On January 18, the renminbi was trading at 6.4401 against the US dollar, with the median price falling by 66 basis points in the previous session, ending the previous five consecutive gains.

The release of the Fed's economic brown Book shows that almost all of the 12 Fed regions reported moderate to moderate growth in economic activity in early 2018, remaining optimistic about the outlook for this year.
Meanwhile, the U.S. unemployment rate remained at 4.1% in December, the lowest since 2000, and companies are expected to raise wages in the coming months.
Fed officials generally see tax reform as a factor supporting this moderately stronger economic outlook, with the Fed forecasting 2.5 percent growth and three rate hikes in 2018.
People in the market pointed out that recently, the tightening of the European Central Bank's monetary policy is expected to push up the Euro exchange rate, the continuous decline of the dollar index and the corresponding rapid rise of the renminbi against the US dollar, but at present, the ECB is unlikely to adjust its policy position soon, the short-term fluctuations in the foreign exchange market will eventually return to fundamentals, and the continued smooth operation of the renminbi exchange rate is a big probability event.
It is worth noting that as market expectations for the renminbi have become more stable, the attractiveness of renminbi assets to foreign investors has gradually come to the fore.

What are the implications of the football world's financial rules for Neymar's move to Paris?
Rules aimed at preventing unrestricted spending by Europe's big football clubs will not prevent Nemal from moving from FC Barcelona in Spain to the Paris St Germain football club (PSG) in France at a record price.
The consequence has been a further downgrade of the Paris Saint-Germain Football Club by the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA), the governing body of European football matches, which has the right to ban teams from the much-watched Champions League.
The Financial Fair play rules (FFP), introduced by Uefa in 2011, mean that Paris's St. Germain Football Club will eventually have to prove that Nemal's transfer was funded without incurring huge losses.
FC Barcelona have already paid 222 million euros ($262 million) just to pay for the Brazilian player's cancellation, while Nemal's salary will run into the tens of millions of dollars a year.
Here are some of the financial implications of Nemal's move to France.
Given that the team is funded by the rich Qatari ruling family, the Paris St. Germain Football Club could certainly sign Nemal with cash and include him in other star-studded teams.
Clubs can spend huge sums of money on players, but they have to use legitimate sources of income to make up for the huge sums spent, allowing them to break even in the relevant business of football.
The "financial fair play rules" were conceived by Michel Platini after his election as Uefa president in 2007.
The former French player believes that for clubs that are heavily in debt in pursuit of success, if the banks or owners withdraw their support funds, they are effectively cheating and putting the club at risk of destruction.
In 2011, the focus of the rules shifted from the issue of club debt to the monitoring of club losses.
The change means that the business model used by Roman Abramovich when he bought the Chelsea club in 2003, which was to buy a club with potential and then spend heavily to improve the team and build a global brand, now faces a more demanding situation.
In the interim of the 3-year "rules" review up to 2018, the club could lose 30 million euros.
Although Abramovich was disparaged by the then-president in 2015, Uefa's successor, Aleksander Ceferin, remains committed to stopping overspending.
"Of course the rules have not lapsed, and we will certainly strengthen the regulations of the future," Andrea Traverso, Uefa's head of matters related to the rules, told the AP last week.
While the Paris St Germain football club will pay off Nemal's buyout clause in a lump sum, it can also distribute the amount for accounting purposes over the duration of the contract.
Nemal has signed a five-year agreement, so the transfer fee could be shown as a fee of €44.4 million in the annual accounts for the next five years.
A wave of "rules" sanctions, imposed in 2014, brought the toughest sanctions on the St Germain football club in Paris, as well as the Manchester City club, which is owned by Abu Dhabi.
The Paris St Germain football club was fined 60 million euros ($82 million at the exchange rate at the time), which was later reduced to 20 million euros, and asked the team to reduce the number of players to 21 in the Champions League in the 2014-15 season, instead of the normal 25 players.
Uefa is eyeing clubs that are trying to increase their revenue by linking up with club owners, deceiving financial regulators.
While companies in Qatar can sponsor the St. Germain football club in Paris, Uefa will not treat it as a legitimate income if the amount of sponsorship is deemed to exceed the standard market price.
This is what happened in 2014, when Uefa ruled that the amount of money sponsored by the Qatar tourist board for the St. Germain football club in Paris had been exaggerated.
It has been reported that part of Nemal's income at the St Germain football club in Paris could come from payments from the organising committee for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.
However, both the Paris St. Germain Football Club and the organizing committee denied that Nemal would be an ambassador for the World Cup, and it would be easy for Uefa regulators to make such a move.
The recent sanctions imposed on the St. Germain Football Club in Paris mean that Uefa will be more wary of any attempt to circumvent the rules.
Uefa did not have advance discussions with Paris's St Germain football club about Nemal's transfer, people familiar with the matter said on Thursday.
All of the above-mentioned persons contacted the Associated Press only in an unnamed capacity, as they were not authorized to discuss the status of the St. Germain Football Club in Paris.
The last published accounts showed that the Paris St Germain football club had an operating income of €5424 million in 2015-16, making a profit of more than €10 million.
The accounts for the previous fiscal year have not yet been published.
The Paris St. Germain Football Club expects Nemal's arrival to be a boon for sponsorship, franchising and shirt sales.
The club expects revenue to rise by at least 30 per cent after signing Nemal.
It is clear that the Spanish League was deeply angry to see the most famous of the players leave, tried to block Nemal's move and claimed that the Paris St. Germain Football Club had violated the rules.
Havel Tebas, President of the Spanish League, told the Spanish newspaper as that "this is a clear example of a 'financial doping' in which the club and the country are the same," referring to Qatar, which has ultimate ownership of the St Germain football club in Paris.
Arsene Wenger, the manager of the Arsenal team (which is owned by the American sports mogul), has reservations about the attitude of the state-funded club and the Spanish League.
"This is a consequence of ownership, and that has revolutionized the whole ecology of football over the past 15 years," Wenger said on Thursday.
'Once the country owns the club, then anything happens.
This will make it very difficult to comply with the rules because there are many different ways or interests for a country to require big-name players to represent a country. "
Rokid, an intelligent interactive robot developer, received a new investment in Temasek
In recent years, start-ups in the field of artificial intelligence have continued to be feted with capital.
Artificial intelligence Rokid recently completed a new round of financing, led by Temasek, followed by Credit Suisse, CDIB (the investment arm of Taiwan's China Development Finance holding Corporation) and old shareholder IDG Capital.
The current round of financing is understood to be about $100 million, with Credit Suisse and CDIB appearing for the first time in a financing deal in the domestic artificial intelligence sector.

According to Apple, from February 28 this year, the iCloud service in mainland China will be transferred to run by the Guizhou company on the cloud.
Apple said that "the partnership with Guizhou on the cloud will allow us to continue to improve the speed and reliability of iCloud services, while also complying with the new rule that cloud services in China must be operated by local companies."
During deactivation, the data previously stored by the user in iCloud will also be kept in iCloud and will not be lost.
If, after deactivation, users wish to use the iCloud service after February 28, they will need to accept the new terms and conditions first to ensure that the account is reactivated and relocated to cloud Guizhou.
At the same time, Apple also stressed in its statement that "Apple has strong data privacy and security protection mechanisms and will not create a back door in any of our systems."
The main data center in the New district of iCloud will also be a data center project set up by Apple in China, which, when completed, will be used to store data from Apple users in China.
When built and put into use, Chinese users are uploading and downloading data without having to transfer it back and forth over long distances between China and the United States, increasing speed and reducing delays.

At the premiere ceremony held in Wuhan on the 25th, the Director of "bean blessing" Zou, the Animation Director of "bean blessing", Meng wisdom, the film's soundtrack producer and winner of the Emmy Award, Tom Disher, made an appearance to share the behind-the-scenes story of the film's creation.
Based on the story of Liu'an, the Huai-nan king of the Han Dynasty in traditional Chinese culture, the story of "Liu'an made Tofu, made by mistake" tells the story of the hero "bean blessing", which is transformed from a bean into a human shape, overcomes many difficulties and sticks to the dream of immortals. This animated film is deeply rooted in the local culture of Hubei Province.
Wudang Mountain in the city of Shiyan, Hubei, is one of the World cultural Heritage sites published by the United Nations. It is also the birthplace of Taoist culture and Wudang martial arts.
Director Zou Zou revealed that in the early stages of the film's creation, he had travelled to Wudang Mountain with the main creative team.
He said that the story of "bean blessing" took place during the years of the Emperor of the Western Han Dynasty. In the background of Liu'an, the king of Huai-nan, the hero of the film "bean blessing" was a bean that was accidentally transformed into a human shape when Liu'an was making Dan.
In addition to Wudang Mountain, the birthplace of Taoist culture, Hubei also has deep roots with the clock, a traditional Chinese musical instrument with a long history.

Nostalgia hits the market - "Hala Summer Camp" and "Detective Shuangxiong"
The story is repeated in memory of the actors' scenic years of the 80s and the junk days of the 90s (before and after David Wayne and Michael Schwart produced the sketch comedy "the country" for MTV); it is also a memory of nostalgia itself, of 2001; before this year, many stars such as Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Luther had not yet been born.
As a cultural artwork, it is an imitation and embodiment of the permanent memories of our face-book era.
But as a series, it feels like time is running out.
"Camp Day" reverberated strongly after it was broadcast, but not just because of its absurd humor (the plot is an original story about a talking can of vegetables, dubbed by H. Jon Benjamin).
The double use of the core smile in the plot - the middle-aged actor playing a child at the age of mischief - makes it a Funny part of not being able to go back in time.
Ten years later, when adults actually play adults, the mood is less ingrained and the imitation is more diffuse, including improvisations of the tracking films of the 1990s, such as "the hand that pushes the Cradle."
At some point, a character is caught up in an Apple notebook, some straight skates and "something else from 1991."
Many of the core stories are the same.
Mr. sweetheart (Mr. Schwart) has now become a novelist, but he still hasn't forgotten Katie (Margaret Morrow).
Victor (Ken Marino) remains a man.
There is another sinister plot in the show involving Ronald Reagan (also played by Mr. Schwart), instigated by George H. W. Bush (Michael Ian Blake, impressive).
As always, the best part of this series is the interjection.
It was particularly interesting to see the eternally young Mr. Luther, who flaunted Matt Dillon's soul patch in the film "the single aristocrat," and Andy in the former "campus giant" now feels like a giant.
It was a moment of random madness that might have powered the film, like the recursive "Seven years of life" series, until it came to what I thought was the logical conclusion: "Hala Summer Camp: Twenty years later," and its final act was to get the gang to see the movie premiere of "Hala Summer Camp."
At the same time, Amazon's "Detective Shuangxiong" speaks of different nostalgic content: The Cold War revival of the "American ultimatum dream," the film "the city of the extreme Cold," and even the "GLOW: Gorgeous women's wrestling alliance" of East-West wrestling imagery.
The comedy, created by Brian Gatwood and Alexandro Tanaka, was pushed onto the television screen by director Reese Thomas: A difficult brother comedy set in Romania in the 80s, telling the story of two Bucharest officials fighting for truth, atheism and Marx's Leninist line.
The main characters - the hardline Grigor and the idealistic Essef - are played by Florin Pierce, Jr., and Corneliu Ulich, respectively, and their conversations are dubbed in English by Chanin Tatum (also an executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
It's a brilliant idea.
But it's not just an idea.
There are some good visual gimmicks (police watch chess on TV to pass the time because Americans like to play football).
And there are a number of celebrity voice actors - including Jenny Slatt, Nick Offerman, Maher Sarah Hash Baz Ali and Colo Sevini - who have created a wonderful sound pageant.
But "Detective Shuangxiong" is so committed to creating a boisterous and lifelike propaganda comedy - in which there is a killer wearing a Reagan mask - and it usually plays such a role.
The six-episode TV is a little tardy, and the comedic effects are not released quickly or frequently enough.
"Detective Shuangxiong", edited more strictly, had a better effect of inciting satire when Gregor and Etherf repeatedly visited the U.S. Embassy, where there were always two fat men gobbling down a pile of burgers in the lobby.
For the imaginary communist audience, the message means that Western culture can turn anything into material for revelry.
The creators of this Romanian fictional story are not wrong, and we will even tell the story with our own recent history and their history.
In a recent interview, the reporter learned that there has been a general decline in the benefits of steel, rail transit, ships, machinery manufacturing and other industries in the Northeast, and even losses.
Some experts believe that under the current situation, the new round of revitalization of the Northeast industry is not only related to the current national economic recovery, but will also have an impact on the long-term development of China's manufacturing industry and international competitiveness, so it is urgent to adjust the transformation.
There has been a general decline in corporate performance in traditional industries there has been a serious decline or even a loss in the manufacturing of raw materials and heavy machinery and equipment, which is the primary performance of the Northeast industry in the current economic downturn.
In the past in the economic downturn, mainly low-end, primary products have been the characteristics of large shocks, but in this economic fluctuations, the Northeast traditional industry high-end, low-end industrial products have been affected.
In previous years, Ansteel Group (Weibo) began by adjusting its product structure, focusing on high-end panels such as container boards, steel rails, ship boards and civilian home appliance boards. However, sales of these varieties have fallen more sharply this year, and shipboard sales in particular are down 50 per cent from the same period last year.
Ansteel shares (Hao Qingshun, head of the metallurgy division of the industrial and credit Commission of Liaoning province, introduced that metallurgy is the three pillar industries in Liaoning, with an annual output of 60 million tons of Steel capacity ranked third in the country.
In the 1-5 months of this year, Liaoning Province produced 21.54 million tons of crude steel. The production and marketing situation of products needed for projects encouraged by state policies and built by local governments is better, and the decline of products with more intense market competition is greater, which is another characteristic of the Northeast manufacturing industry.

The bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England will announce at a later date that interest rates will remain unchanged, after weak economic growth and loose inflation have dashed hopes of a rise.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will continue to be "weak" as it controls interest rates while tightening household incomes.
Policymakers on the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted 6-2 to keep interest rates at 0.25 per cent, while a handful of members this month called for higher rates, even as weak economic growth has weakened the lift.
In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank of England shrank its growth forecasts for 2017 and 2018 to 1.7 per cent and 1.6 per cent, respectively, and issued a warning that the squeeze on household incomes would continue, while inflation would soar to nearly 3 per cent in the autumn.
But it said it would need to raise interest rates over the next few years to curb inflation brought on by Brexit, while borrowing costs may need to rise by as much as expected in financial markets.
A year ago, a massive policy of economic promotion was implemented under the influence of Brexit, and members voted to withdraw it.
The bank of England will announce the suspension of its regular funding Scheme to provide cheap money to banks starting in the second month of next year, although the bank says it will now need an additional £15bn on top of £11.5bn under the Scheme.
In the minutes of the rate-setting meeting, the Bank of England said: "In the MPC's core forecast, gross domestic product (GDP) remains weak in the near term, as the squeeze on real household incomes will continue to depress consumption."
On interest rates, the bank has repeatedly reiterated the need for "some tightening of monetary policy" to suppress inflation, and to a "greater extent" than the market expects.
The market is now expected to grow for the first time in the third quarter of next year and for the second time in 2020.
But the Bank stressed that any increase would be "slow" and "restrained."
The Bank's growth forecasts for this year and next are on a downward trend, compared with forecasts of 1.9 per cent and 1.7 per cent in May.
The bank maintained its forecast of 1.8 per cent growth in 2018.
The pound fell against the dollar, followed by the euro.
The pound fell 0.5 per cent against the dollar to 1.31 and 0.4 per cent against the euro to 1.11.
The unchanged decision comes after rising expectations were dashed by recent dismal growth figures, with GDP rising to 0.3 per cent in the second quarter, compared with 0.2 per cent in the previous three months.
The Bank said growth was likely to remain at 0.3 per cent in the third quarter, although it will rise slightly at the end of the year.
Ordinary households have been hit by a surge in inflation, while wage growth has been negligible, and the bank of England's recent inflation report has not brought good news for them, as the bank says austerity will get worse before it gets better,
Monetary policy "cannot prevent" a hit to incomes over the next few years, but wages are expected to recover "massively" by the end of the three-year forecast.
At the same time, the economy will be stimulated by a sharp increase in demand for British goods as a result of the fall in the value of the pound, offsetting some of the low consumption.
The decision comes a year after a stunning EU referendum sent the pound plummeting, with interest rates cut to 0.25 per cent in August.
The Bank of England estimates it could take four years for it to have a full impact on prices and the UK economy.
Calls for an increase in interest rates came before the Bank published its latest interest rate ruling, as inflation added to the already stressed average household, while three policymakers called for an increase in interest rates to 0.5 per cent in July.
Inflation retreated to 2.6 per cent last month from 2.9 per cent in June, although the Bank of England said this was expected and would rise again in the coming months.
The Bank said the excess was already entirely the bottom line of the weak pound against its 2 per cent target.
"Given the recent decline in swap rates, the Mortgage market looks set to become more competitive again, as lenders make a strong call for more business and look forward to a perfect end to the year on a positive note," said Andrew Monterrey, director of Coreco Mortgage Brokers.
Such a market looks particularly advantageous for those who may be nearing the end of existing deals, as remortgaging (many of which are free of fees and low interest rates) becomes increasingly popular.

After the dust settles on NHS drug funding in the High Court, patients will be able to access "transformative" HIV prevention treatment from nine months.
NHS England has announced that pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), a drug that can be taken before sex, has been shown to reduce the risk of infection in people at high risk by about 86 per cent, and that the health service will now make the drug available to an estimated 10,000 people through an initial trial of three years.
It agreed to fund the trial after the Court of Appeal upheld the High Court ruling last year, which said the NHS had the right to pay for PrEP despite the NHS's claim that local authorities should fund the drug.
The move announced on Thursday was described as a "significant new intervention" by NHS chief executive Simon Stevens, while the National Aids Trust (Nat) described it as a "critical moment."
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be the first to be registered. More clinics will be added in 10 months, followed by full implementation across England in the fourth month of 2018.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is an HIV drug taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
Trials have shown that PrEP can significantly reduce HIV transmission in people at risk of infection.
Taking PrEP before sex means there are enough specific drugs in the body to prevent HIV infection.
The drug can be taken daily or two hours before sexual intercourse.
Those eligible for treatment include gay, bisexual men, transgender people and positive HIV carriers who have not been successfully treated.
The clinic will identify eligible participants who have agreed to the trial, including men, women, transgender persons and persons whose sexual partner's HIV infection status is unknown.
People who live in England and register as a GP can also sign up at their local sexual health clinic.
The scheme will cost £10m, while the NHS England branch has signed a contract to procure the drugs this week following international competitive procurement.
The trial aims to assess the full potential of PrEP by collecting clinical evidence on how it is positioned, absorbed and implemented on a large sample basis.
"This major new intervention should complement and reinforce HIV prevention in a broad and increasingly successful way," Mr. Stevens said.
This is another milestone in 30 years of action worthy of progress in addressing humanity's major health challenges, "he said.
Deborah King, chief executive of the UK Aids Trust (Nat), said: "This is a critical moment in the fight against Aids.
If it does target people in need and at risk, pre-exposure prophylaxis offers the possibility of changing the Aids epidemic in the UK.
Starting in September, people at high risk of HIV will be given a permitted new tool through this NHS funded trial in England, which is truly implementable on its own, without consultation with sexual partners, which will make a difference in the lives of a large number of people.
We have both hands in favour of this announcement, "he said.
Ian Green, chief executive of the Terence Higgins Trust, said: "The priority now is to ensure that the trial is quickly pushed away across the country and that none of those living with HIV can fall.
Now that we have purchased the PrEP trial drug, we are ready to protect more than 10,000 people at high risk of HIV, "he said.
Shadow Public Health Minister Sharon Hodgson said: "After months of delay and Government procrastination, the start of PrEP's first trial is welcome and should come earlier.
The evidence shows how the drug can make a difference as part of our approach to preventing HIV and halting the spread of this deadly infectious disease.
This experiment will give us a further and full understanding of the advantages of PrEP.
It is now very important that this trial be rolled out nationwide as soon as possible in order to protect people exposed to HIV and to help us further end the spread of HIV in society. "

High quality of life: Application of the attic and ingenious design to build the small apartment of the Earl's Palace into a spacious home
Joanne Ray, a former banker, was so keen on refurbishing houses that she moved from her big House in Knightsbridge to a small apartment in the Earl's Palace in 2014.
The apartment is located on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - Joanne didn't pack up and sell it, a powerful testament to the new design.
"Before that, my ex-boyfriend and I lived in a bigger House in Knightsbridge," says Joanne.
"I was looking for the right house with the offer.
I saw this apartment at the Earl's Palace and it also had a high ceiling.
I was very pleased and made an offer the same day, "he said.
Since looking at the room for the first time, the 1,000-square-foot apartment has now been completely overhauled.
The apartment was originally a single room with a complex layout - it needed to go through the kitchen to get to the bedroom - and Joanne wanted to increase the storage space and attic at the time to make the most of the ample ceiling height.
"I want high ceilings, big windows, plenty of light.
That's what I asked for, "she said.
To that end, she hired Elfan Azadi, from the Duck & Shed architecture and design studio (in Notting Hill), to use the 12.5-foot ceiling to craft a home that is not only a development project, but also where Joanne lives.
The ceiling is not high enough to add two up and down spaces, so the architectural challenge is to create a loft high enough for people to stand.
Erfan had to think creatively in order to solve the problem.
"The steel structure is quite complex," he explains.
"We have to arrange the space so that it is displayed up and down, and there is no need to shrug our shoulders.
It's not just as simple as building a simple platform, but also starting the steel to get it around the right height to achieve the function, "he said.
Through this arrangement, Erfan is able to obtain two full-body high rooms in the space - to which many interesting elements can be added.
The attic features a retro copper window of the Retrouvius brand that overlooks the glamorous living area.
Gold furniture with mirrors, small silver pieces of furniture and Serge Mouille retro lighting laid out the overall style.
The use of mirrors plays an important role in increasing atmosphere, space and light.
Putting a mirror on both ends of a short corridor can make it look longer.
In the kitchen, an anti-splash board with a mirror is like a window to another room.
At Xuanguan, a small lattice with a mirror provides Joanne with storage space for the storage of cutlery and glassware.
The beautiful living room has a fascinating sense of space and is able to put the kitchen away when it is unused.
The folding kitchen is not new.
But what's unique about this folding kitchen is a garage-style lift door.
"Some knowledge in the field of engineering is involved here," Erfan explained of the reinforced veneer MDF door.
"This uses the principle of balance, so when you push the door, it's easy to slide."
Thanks to the ingenious use of space and storage, Joanne was given an extra 16 square metres, an extra bedroom and an improved layout.
"In the end, you're selling the size of the house - or the valuation of your property is based on the size of the house," says Erfan.
"Basically, the real estate agent will walk into the room and calculate it based on the size of the floor."
They will seek to increase the floor space and use quality materials at the same time, bringing a sense of luxury to the space.
"The material is all hand-picked by you, so it helps to create an emotional bond in the home," Mr Erfan said.
'You don't fall in love with the power on the Wall.
These things are all important, but they don't buckle your heartstrings. '
As it turns out, with good design as well as adding extra space, standard apartments can shake up to amaze you.
In reality, you might, like Joanne, choose to live.

The two brothers staged a $500 million real estate empire fight
Forty years after his Italian family founded the dynasty, the two brothers fought for one of Victoria's largest real estate empires worth more than $500 million.
Colin de Lutis, a former Carlton Football Club director and developer, lives in a mansion in the Tucala district, three doors away from the residence of his brother Paul, who took him to the Supreme Court over the division of their real estate and business assets.
Paul has been hoping to break away from the family business since 2014, but the two brothers have engaged in a heated debate in the Supreme Court over the division of the asset.
The brothers and their mother owned a total of 38 properties valued at more than $500 million, which had accumulated since the family bought Smith Street, Collingwood district, in 1973.
There, the family founded Westco Jeans and gradually grew it to the size of 160 retail chains.
In 1999, the company sold for $85 million.
That money was then put into real estate, and the de Rutis family's portfolio now includes city office buildings, Brunswick and Sorento developments, Gold Coast and Buller Hill apartments, and suburban shopping malls.
Under an agreement with his late father, Colin, described by his brother Paul as the "prime mover and dominant figure" of the de Rutis family, owns about two-thirds of the company's assets, while Paul accounts for about a third.
On commutation, the property owned by Colin was valued at $316 million, while the property owned by Paul was valued at $176 million, according to documents filed with the court.
Paul came to believe that the division of real estate and cash proved to be the crux of the talks.
"Colin's proposal for the division of property left him with what I thought was the best property," he wrote in a first court affidavit in 2015.
On Friday, after several failed mediations, the Supreme Court held a hearing for the first time.
Now, the two brothers are still vying for control of the existing business, and Paul says Colin has kicked him out.
Colin, on the other hand, denied this and accused Paul of poor management of certain real estate.
In an early affidavit filed by Colin, he expressed a desire to resolve the dispute.
"My Italian heritage determines that family is the most important option. My Italian ancestry determines that family is the most important," he wrote.
The cost of the case is mounting, along with hundreds of pages of affidavits, emails, and company reports submitted by companies such as Deloitte, Pitcher Partners, Charter Keck Cramer, top firms such as Allan Myers, QC, and senior lawyers hired by both sides.
Ms de Rutis and her late husband Luigi, both Italian immigrants, have been running mass and deli restaurants since the late 1950s and bought a shop in Brunswick in the early 1970s.
They used collateral to buy the Collingwood property, where Colin opened the family's first jeans store.
Colin said, "when I was a junior in high school," where he started Westco, "at the time, Paul was very young (about 10 years old)."
Anna de Rutis said she and Luigi, who died in 2012, wanted to be able to pass on the property peacefully to their son
"Luigi used to say to me that he never wanted the brothers to end up in court," she wrote.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer members of the de Rutis group company, and Colin said Mark paid $10 million to him and $26 million to Luke when he left the company.
Both Luke and Mark "expressed dissatisfaction with the terms of their division of property," Paul said.
According to a biography published in 2015 by TV star Eddie McGuire, Colin has kept a low profile despite being on the board of the former AFL club.
"Fairfax Media" contacted Colin and Paul, as well as their lawyers, on Friday.
But only Colin replied by text message, saying that because the case had been brought to court "I really can't say too much."
"It is very, very sad that my brother Paul chose to sue me and bring our family affairs to court," he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote in a court filing that he had tried to meet his brother's demands.
"Our father does not want to see Paul and I end up in a dispute like the current one," he said, adding that he "remains hopeful that the dispute will be resolved."
On Friday, that hope seemed to be dashed.
"Our problems will be resolved through the courts in the near future," Colin wrote.

Trump's new chief of staff plans to limit the president's media time
Others have tried, but all have failed.
John F. Kelly might actually be able to do it.
If that's the case, then he's one.
The new White House chief of staff plans to limit the flow of information to President Trump - including news media reports - in a bid to ensure a smoother boss, according to Politico, the U.S. political news website.
Here's a quote from journalist Josh Dawsey:
"When the new White House Chief of staff, John F. Kelly, began a day of work to gather for discussions with senior officials, he pointed out that he was going to address one of President Trump's main problems in the White House: The flow of bad information to the President."
Kelly told the officials that receiving good information helps the president make better decisions, so the information needs to go through his hands - both in writing and in the form of briefings.
Kelly's diagnosis looked like a model, but others had tried to tame it by spying on Trump's media time, but it all ended in failure.
President Trump has a long history of television addiction - and now in the White House, his habit of watching television is still deepening.
"If candidate Trump is frustrated by unfair reporting, it would be useful to let him know that he has also received positive coverage in credible channels," Sam Nerberg, a former campaign adviser, told Politico in February.
Politico's Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that "in the experience of six former campaign officials, the point of controlling Trump's habit of tweeting is to ensure that the media messages he receives personally always contain a certain amount of praise."
That's no problem at all.
But the idea that Trump's push habit was once "controlled" is laughable.
It may be that these campaign officials know something we don't know - that Trump's push would have been even more fiery if it hadn't been for their intervention.
We probably never knew about those tweets that Trump didn't send.
If his staff can save him from the fire, if only a few times, their efforts will be worth it.
But no one can stop Trump from being controversial all the time.
Part of the problem is that in a White House of competing blocs, people promote their worldview by presenting Trump with information that may or may not be reliable, floral to advance their cause.
Politico - all about this story - reported in May on advisers' penchant for strategically providing dubious information to the president.
This is an example described by the journalist Shane Goodmancher:
"Trump's response to negative news clips, such as volcanic eruptions, especially those with damaging leaks of information, would be frantically trying to find out where it came from, according to current and former Trump officials.
At the end of the second month, someone viciously copied to the president an article on the web agitator Charles C Johnson's website, GotNews.com, accusing deputy chief of staff Katie Walsh of being the "source of a lot of leaked information" in the White House, as Trump did at the time.
Even if Johnson had been permanently banned for harassment, no concrete evidence had been provided, and he had blasted a large number of false quality controls, which he later blatantly denied.
Trump read the article and then started asking officials about Walsh, "he said.
Goodmancher also said that Reince Pribas, the chief of staff at the time, and Robert Potter, the White House Secretary, "had tried to set up a system to manage and record the documents that Trump received."
What about the result?
Kelly intends to do the same thing, in three months.
It may be that he can prove himself to be a more efficient manager than Pribas, but Trump is still that impulsive Trump, and his aides are still competing with each other for influence.
These timeless influences will make Kelly's task even more difficult.
Tourist town: How to get drunk
[Abstract] the potential of the small town of Zhejiang is gradually woken up.
Now these small towns have become an important destination for visitors to Zhejiang to enjoy the Zhejiang landscape, read Zhejiang culture and feel Zhejiang homesickness. They will also provide an important help for our Province to focus on building "poetry and painting Zhejiang" the most beautiful tourist destination in China.
Winning in amorous feelings
"The social play drum rises with the moon, and the smell of sausage wafts with the wind.
"Strolling through the Ancient Town of Anchang, Shaoxing, you can see the traditional craftsmanship of buckets, bamboo knitting, iron beating, shoes, lace picking and spinning cotton, which fully demonstrates the immaterial cultural heritage of the Ancient Town of Anchang. The four tourists revel in the atmosphere of experiencing Shaoxing folk customs and enjoying the accumulation of Shaoxing history and culture.
It is reported that there were more than 65,000 visitors to the Ancient Town of Anchang during the three-day holiday on New year's day this year.
In Zhejiang, such a unique Town as Anchang Ancient Town: The flashing light of Jiaxing Xitang, flowing with the warmth of Jiangnan Water township; Dewa, the white wall of the city of Quzhou, telling of the vicissitudes of the millennium old Town; paintings of fishermen in Shitang Town, Taizhou, depicting both traditional and modern fishing life...... These small towns are the "palm treasure" of Zhejiang tourism, as well as the "love" of tourists.
In recent years, with the advance of all-area tourism construction in our province, the potential of the small town of Zhejiang has been gradually woken up.
In 2016, the Executive Office of the Provincial Government officially issued the "implementation measures for the creation of tourist amorous towns in Zhejiang Province," proposing that, over a period of five years or so, 100 provincial tourist towns with thick folk customs, a beautiful ecological environment and a rich tourism industry be accepted and named throughout the Province.
Now these small towns have become an important destination for visitors to Zhejiang to enjoy the Zhejiang landscape, read Zhejiang culture and feel Zhejiang homesickness. They will also provide an important help for our Province to focus on building "poetry and painting Zhejiang" the most beautiful tourist destination in China.
The relevant person in charge of the Provincial Tourism Bureau introduced that under the upsurge of the creation of tourist amorous towns, villages and towns all over our province now attach more importance to the creation of a personalized Tourism industry. There has been a proliferation of new Tourism projects and industries, which have brought a rich experience for tourists and won a good reputation.
Focus on promotion
Recently, hosted by Zhejiang Tourism Bureau and Zhejiang Daily Press Group, the Zhejiang newspaper Group Tourism All-Media Center hosted by the "small Town X Future artists" sharing Exchange and "Poetry painting Zhejiang? Town has amorous feelings" 2017 Zhejiang Tourism amorous Town promotion season closing ceremony was held at the Zhejiang Exhibition Gallery.
"The town has the beauty of art and the temperature of life.
The amorous feelings of the town lie in the original juice, the original taste, the original township, a kind of original ecology pure.
Experts such as Xie Hanfeng, a teacher in the Film and Television department of the Academy of Television Animation Arts of the Chinese Academy of fine Arts, Xie Hanfeng, director of domestic first-line Film and Television advertising, and Professor Xu Xiangsheng, Dean of the School of Arts and Communication of the University of Metrology of China, told the cross-border stories of small towns such as
Many amorous tourist towns in Zhejiang have deep cultural resources. Dong Xinxin, a representative of the small town of Nanxun in Huzhou City, interpreted the Chinese painting Nan Xun for everyone at the scene.
The amorous feelings of Jiangnan Water township have been loved by painters since Ancient times. Today, the Ancient Town of Nanxun carries out deep cooperation with Art colleges such as the Chinese Academy of Arts.
Tourism amorous feelings of the town must amorous elements, tourism elements, service elements and environmental elements.
In this context, the service facilities and environment of tourism are also very important elements.
If you hand over a timely umbrella on a rainy day, it can also allow visitors to better experience the amorous feelings of the town.
In this era of sharing, the Zhejiang newspaper Group Travel all Media Center has joined forces with the hottest sharing umbrella company to customize a number of "poetry and painting Zhejiang" versions of shared umbrellas, hoping to promote the concept of "share? Green", enhance the civilized Tourism awareness and public morality of tourists and town residents, and create a shared beautiful Tourism environment.
This becomes "poetry painting Zhejiang? Town has amorous feelings" 2017 Zhejiang tourism amorous town promotion season activities in a bright spot.
Looking forward to wonderful
So far, Zhejiang Province has released the first 21 provincial tourism style town creation list and 115 provincial tourism style town breeding list.
As a key area for the priority development of rural tourism during the 13th Five-Year Plan period, the amorous town will eventually build a tourist scenic spot above level 3A, becoming a new model of diversified tourism products, outstanding tourism benefits and win-win industrial integration.
The key to the attraction of the tourist town is its originality.
The beauty of the tourist town stems not only from the smoke and rain of the small bridge water, but also from a long cultural tradition; the revitalization of the countryside stems from cultural self-confidence.
Throughout the world, the Dutch Town of Liser, the Austrian Town of Halstadt and the French Town of Pumpkin, with tulips, "salt" and pumpkins as their core attractions, attract a large number of tourists from all over the world every year to help the Town's economy take off.
For the amorous town, the focus of "highlighting the characteristics and retaining the homesickness" gives the town a clear personality and soul. It also lies in providing cultural immersion, carrying the local context and highlighting the local civilization.
The tourist town, with culture and homesickness as the link and the humanities and scenery as the carrier, connects the quad tourists, allowing the traditional amorous feelings and culture to pass on and innovate in the joint construction and sharing.
In essence, the tourist amorous town is a complex open tourist scenic spot, which should be a living space shared by local residents and foreign tourists and even expatriates.
As the main battleground for the future growth of tourism, the tourist town may not only change the rural ecological outlook, the way of economic and social development and the direction of the flow of industrial factors, but also be an important force in bridging the gap between urban and rural infrastructure and awakening the revival of rural culture.
In the tide of accelerated revitalization of the countryside, Zhejiang tourism amorous town will deduce a richer wonderful story.
Figures show that 70 per cent of China's travel demand is concentrated within three kilometres, so the entire short-haul market is sooner or later the world of shared bikes.

Motorists negotiate ditches and return to "Rich Street"
Some of the wealthiest owners in the West Midlands region are once again at loggerheads with determined rangers, who have negotiated a government-dug ditch for the return of land outside the mansion.
Rangers parked their 20 trailers in an open area outside the bustling Solihull Street, which has been dubbed "Rich Street."
The caravans, who were holding horses, carrying babies and leading caravans, returned again after being driven away in May, and the "moat" dug up by the municipal authorities did not prevent them from entering.
The sleek and sophisticated team found a gap in the defensive line, through which their vehicles crowded in, even though there was a stretch of road through which there was no barricade to pass.
Angry residents have been fiercely critical of Solihull Council, saying it has "behaved badly in dealing with the problem."
One resident, who did not wish to be named, said: 'They got there on Monday night, before coming to Bentley Heath Street and throwing stones at passers-by.
The committee should be ashamed of their actions, because they are simply useless at dealing with problems.
The hikers came here in May and were subsequently driven away, and now they are back.
It came quite a bit last night and it's probably going to be more today. '
She added: "Birmingham city Council knows how to deal with it by implementing a long-term ban to protect its parks.
I live on Streetsbrook road and I'm not willing to keep paying municipal taxes if the Council can't stop something like this.
One local resident, who did not want to be named, said: 'It's ridiculous, we've just seen the last batch of RV passengers go, just to facilitate another batch to destroy.
The number has increased again this time, and some have even seen horses grazing on the Park lawn, "he said.
A Solihull Council spokeswoman said: "We are aware of unauthorized camping taking place in an open area on Sjutsbrook Road and now we are working with the Solihull Police and taking the necessary legal action to get them to move away as soon as possible.
To support us in gathering evidence, it is very important to ask as many local residents as possible to report any anti-social or criminal behaviour to the police by calling 101.
This helps us to outline the situation for the court to look at when we submit a case to the court, "he said.

Italy takes a tough approach to NGO migrant rescue boats
Italy has issued a warning to NGOs operating migrant rescue boats in the Mediterranean that they will not be allowed to continue the rescue if they do not sign up to new operational management norms.
"If NGOs do not sign up to the new code of conduct, it is difficult to see how they will continue," Interior Minister Marco Minnetti told the Turin daily news.
Minnetti's warning came a day after Italian officials seized a German aid group, Youth rescue, on suspicion that the crew of a ship had actually colluded with human traffickers to assist illegal immigrants.
The aid group has only been in operation for a year and declined to comment on the subject of specific allegations by Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.
"Saving lives is and will be the most important thing for us, so we regret not being able to operate in the search and rescue zone at this time," the group said in a social media statement.
"Having gathered all the information, We can only assess all the allegations and the situation at this time."
Italian officials have been monitoring the Iuventa, the ship of the organization Youth rescue, since October.
Its crew is suspected of carrying migrants transported by human traffickers directly from small boats and allowing smugglers to flee in a Hurry and reuse the ship.
At least one such meeting allegedly took place at sea 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast, according to prosecutors' documents, which were published by Italian media.
Its crew is suspected of flagrantly ignoring the authority of the Italian Coast Guard, which oversees rescue operations in the area out of humanitarian zeal and no other motive.
According to the code of conduct, vessels such as Iuventa clearly need an Italian police officer on board to supervise their activities.
Currently, of the nine non-governmental organizations involved in search and rescue operations, only three have agreed to abide by the code of conduct: Save the Children, the Malta-based migrant maritime Assistance Station and the Pro-Activa Open Arms in Spain.
The latter said on Thursday that it believed the new rules, while unnecessary, were acceptable because they would not bring about any "significant changes and obstacles" to its rescue operations.
Among the organizations that refused to sign was the Nobel Prize-winning organization M é decins sans fronti è res (MSF).
Meanwhile, Minnetti said the number of migrants arriving in Italy has plummeted in recent weeks, indicating that efforts to strengthen the Libyan coast guard and unite local mayors are beginning to bear fruit.
"In recent days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel," the Minister said.
He unveiled plans for in-depth talks this month: With Libyan mayors on economic development activities, and with Chad, Niger and Mali on how to reduce the number of migrants who want to leave those countries for Europe.
For his part, Lianping, Chief financial scientist at the Bank of Communications, said that industrial value added growth was expected to accelerate to 6.6 per cent in December due to the upturn in industrial value added in the first three quarters of 2017.
Fixed asset investment is expected to grow at a cumulative 7.2 per cent in December, the same rate as the previous month and lower than last year.
Industrial production, although it will be weaker than in October, is about the same as in November.
And China's manufacturing investment was low in December, but there was a small improvement in infrastructure investment, so fixed asset investment is expected to be flat in November.
More than 200,000 people in Changle, Fujian, entered the United States, mostly stowaways; being in a foreign country, returning home for an indefinite period, separated loved ones, similar scenes continue to play out.
Beijing "University dredging" New measures: Tens of thousands of teachers and students of North Chemical Industry will be stationed in Changping New campus
The opening ceremony of the new campus of Beijing Chemical University was held on the 2nd in Changping District of Beijing, and the 1,800-acre green campus was officially put into use.
The reporter learned from the ceremony that in order to strengthen the core functions of the capital and manage "big city disease", in recent years, in the context of the coordinated development and resolution of non-capital functions, Beijing has accelerated the evacuation of colleges and universities in central urban areas to the suburbs, and teachers and students in some universities are moving in batches to new campuses in the suburbs such as Shunyi, Daxing and Fangshan.
The new North Chemical campus, located in the Town of Nankou, Changping, covers an area of 1,800 mu, 40 kilometers from the city, and is one of the key projects in Beijing to solve non-capital functions.
The new campus has been built in three phases. At present, the first Phase has been fully completed and the second Phase is expected to be fully launched by the end of this year. When completed, the plan will meet the learning and living needs of nearly 20,000 undergraduate, graduate and teaching staff.
Looking back at this year's film market, we found that the original text of the film and the two groups of fans of the participating stars became an important part of the film's expected audience.
Today, at 1710 hours, the 119 Command Centre in Shaoyang City was alerted to a fire of tetrahydrofurans stored at the Hongzhi Chemical Plant in Longsutang, Shuangqing District of the city.
Shaoyang City fire branch immediately dispatched 5 squadrons 20 fire trucks with heavy anti-chemical clothing, anti-chemical cleaning vehicles and other equipment to the scene.
After preliminary investigation, the fire was a small storage tank storing chemical substances such as tetrahydrofurans, which produced more smoke at the scene.
As of the time of writing, fire officers and soldiers are nervously rescuing, the City health, safety supervision, environmental protection, public security, traffic and other departments have rushed to the scene, no casualties were found.
Michelle Carter has been sentenced for texting to encourage Conrad Roy to commit suicide
A Massachusetts woman has been sentenced to two and a half years for encouraging her boyfriend to commit suicide through text messages and phone calls.
Michelle Carter, 20, will serve 15 months, which can be converted to probation, plus five years of probation.
Carter was convicted in six months of the intentional unpremeditated murder of Conrad Roy, who committed suicide in seven months and 13 days in 2014.
Speaking at Thursday's hearing, Roy's father said: "My family is heartbroken.
My son is my best friend. "
While awaiting an appeal, Carter was allowed to maintain his personal freedom.
She faces a maximum of 20 years in prison, but her lawyers believe both she and Mr. Roy are mentally ill.
At the sentencing, Carter stood, wearing red trousers and a Beige blouse, his hands clasped, his eyes tearful and his eyes down.
"Her actions killed Conrad Roy," the prosecutor told the court.
'She ended his life in order to live better for herself.
She did not take responsibility ", the prosecutor said.
'She doesn't have any remorse. '
But Carter's lawyer said it was "a terrible consequence and she feels very remorseful."
However, Judge Lawrence Moniz said he had not found that her "age or maturity, or indeed her mental illness, would have had any significant effect on her behaviour."
A prosecutor read a statement from Roy's mother, Lynn Roy, who said, "not a day goes by that I don't grieve the loss of my beloved son.
I hope he is proud of me and what I have done. I am trying to stand with his sisters in all my pain, which will be with us forever, "the statement said.
Mr Roy's sister, Camdyn Roy, testified that she was "in a trance" because she realised she would never be able to attend her brother's wedding or become an aunt to his children.
"It is a pain to lose someone who has been with me since I was born, and I will live with that pain for the rest of my life," she said.
The case seems to set a legal precedent because Massachusetts law does not make it a crime to encourage others to commit suicide.
In 2014, Roy was found dead of carbon monoxide poisoning in his car; this year, Carter was 17.
The case drew national attention after Carter's text messages revealed that she had egged him on to commit suicide.
"There are many ways to Hang, jump and stab yourself," she said in several text messages sent two weeks before his death; he was on holiday with his family.
In the period before he killed himself, she wrote, "you need to do this, Conrad," and "all you have to do is start the generator and then be free and happy."
Judge Moniz said Carter had gained attention through Mr. Roy's death and ordered her not to profit from the case through any media.
There is a difference of legal opinion in this case.
One of the few people to defend Carter, Amanda Knox, who was accused of murdering her British roommate in Italy in 2007, was acquitted two years later.
"Michelle Carter deserves sympathy and help, not imprisonment," Ms Knox, 30, said in a column published by the Los Angeles Times.
Zhang Yimou is destined to be a controversial film artist, and while he has been leading the trend of Chinese films, he has also reaped a lot of criticism since he began filming a film, "Red Sorghum."
The reporter learned from the Lhasa Pure Land Basketball Club on Tuesday that recently, the Lhasa Pure Land Basketball Youth team won the fourth place in the grand final of the National Youth Basketball League held in Beijing.
The Lhasa Pure Land Basketball Youth team is composed of 11 local players. The head coach is Siren Sangzhu, assistant coach of the Lhasa Pure Land Men's Basketball team.
The Tibetan "Basketball boy" before heading to Beijing for the grand final.
Liang Junchao, General Manager of the Lhasa Pure Land Basketball Club, told reporters that compared with last year, the team's results have improved, the players' self-confidence and grasp of the playing field have improved markedly. Exchanges between players and other teams are also more comprehensive, and exchanges on and off the field are more and more relaxed.
After the game, captain Jiang Zou said he hoped to gain experience by participating in the game and do his best for the cause of basketball in Tibet.
It is understood that in the competition in Beijing, the players overcame factors such as low altitude drunken oxygen and presented the image of Tibet.
Although athletics is the gold medal in the Olympic Games, athletics won the world, but the famous athletics match to draw gold is in the downwind.
Automakers face a shock, with Audi set to retrofit up to 850,000 Diesel vehicles
Audi's announcement of the modification comes a day after BMW said it would provide software upgrades for more than 350,000 vehicles.
BMW's chairman said BMW believed there were "more intelligent options than restrictions on driving," meaning that major European cities - including Munich, where BMW is based - were considering banning or restricting diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it would retrofit three million Mercedes cars in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions.
None of the companies claimed the move as a recall.
European carmakers have aggressively promoted the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to help meet carbon dioxide emissions rules.
But nitrogen oxides emitted by diesel engines are thought to be carcinogens and can cause asthma.
Car companies are also increasing the cost of installing equipment to offset diesel vehicle exhaust emissions, making it difficult to keep diesel vehicles competitive in price.
As German carmakers face scrutiny, Chancellor Angela Merkel's government has also been accused of allowing these powerful car companies too much and ignoring signs of the problem.
The car companies are trying to avoid a repeat of Volkswagen's mistake of covering up its use of so-called failure devices, adjusting emissions to comply with regulations when cars are tested and returning to normal under normal driving conditions.
Multiple Volkswagen executives have been charged in the United States, while others are under investigation by countries on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former head of thermodynamics at the Audi engine research and development Department was arrested in Germany.
Former manager Zachero Giovanni Pamio, who is Italian and therefore not protected by extradition, could face trial in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi was caught up in a German criminal investigation involving Volkswagen, and the German government accused Audi of installing systems to evade European emissions requirements, expanding the scope of the investigation, which had previously been limited to the United States.
Audi's investigation could have a significant impact on Volkswagen: Luxury automakers account for a disproportionate share of Volkswagen's profits.
It is commonplace for a film to take one or two years, or even a few years, from preparation to release.
The animated film "Big Fish Hai Tong" announced a day ago that it will be released on July 8. The film takes 12 years from preparation to release!
Liang, the original author of "the Big Fish", was 21 years old from Tsinghua University, majoring in Thermal power, and his close friend Zhang Chun founded the other side of the world. In 2008, he received a million dollars of venture capital from Zhiyuan and launched the animated film debut of "the Big Fish".
The film has won many awards at home and abroad at the creative sample stage, and has been included and praised as "one of the most outstanding works of art" by the Centre for contemporary Art in Pompidou, France.
For six years from creativity to production, the film has been dubbed "the pit of God" by millions of fans looking forward to its release.
"The Big Fish" tells a fantastic story that belongs to the Chinese people. With the release of this slotted trailer, it brings new expectations to all the audience.
"These 12 years have only done this one thing, and now that it has gone from a dream to a reality, I am both nervous and excited," Liang said.
Zhang Chun said: "Always want to use other people's 50% of the budget, to make exactly the same picture effect as others, the team is going to be driven crazy by me."
Dongguan, a "World Factory" that once relied on material processing and a large number of popular workers, is setting its sights on the high level of talent who can lead the city to reposition itself.
At the high-level talent activity week held by the Dongguan city government recently, a financial reporter saw that a number of local enterprises with considerable strength participated in the talent fair.
On the particularly bright billboards against the orange background wall, they each put up a hefty price tag.
Therefore, the China Television production Industry Association decided that it would unite the national TV Drama production Industry and sign a self-regulatory convention.
Provence lavender is threatened by climate change
Lavender has become a symbol of the city of Provence in southern France, but now there is bad news that it is being threatened by climate change.
Lavender is decaying due to the ongoing drought and the emergence of virus-carrying insects, which is a headache for scientists and farmers who are trying to find a solution.
"Lavender in Provence is facing a huge threat, as the plant has been affected by climate change in recent years, with significantly less rainfall in the spring and rain in the autumn," said Eric Chaisse, an expert at the Provence-based agricultural research Institute (CRIEPPAM).
This can affect the life cycle of lavender.
There is also a smaller individual cicada, a leaf cicada that can spread tiny bacteria, which appear in large numbers in very dry weather, "he said.
The point is that it is huge.
In addition to attracting vacationers, lavender oil is also sought after by the perfume and cosmetics industries.
"In contrast to plants that can have many large flowers and have long ears of grain, ours has the problem of smaller individuals, stunted, missing or weak," Eric chase said.
So we have less essential oil, "he said.
Solutions being studied include the adoption of better Irrigation techniques and the mitigation of evaporation of soil moisture, the spraying of protective mixtures of clay and water on plants, and the development of more drought-tolerant varieties.
Compared to the sci-fi elements in the movie, the two stars said it was the story in the film that attracted them more.
On the afternoon of September 5, a reporter from the Huaxi Metropolitan newspaper interviewed a number of prominent figures in the crosstalk world in a row, as well as two crosstalk performance artists, who, astonishingly, remained almost unanimously silent.

Mexico is in danger and journalists are killed
All the employees of the weekly Riodoce usually meet on Wednesday to review their plans for coverage of the riots in Sinaro state, caused by criminal organizations, corrupt officials and the endless war on drugs.
But today, the shadow of tragedy hangs over themselves, and they come together to discuss security.
It is important that they are told to change their daily habits.
Two senior journalists discussed which felt safer: Whether to take their children to the office, which had been hit by a grenade attack in 2009, or to leave them at home.
Security experts wrote three words on the blackboard at the front of the room: Enemy, neutral and ally.
They asked the journalists to name each column - without the need for evidence, observation and intuition.
There are suspected drug dealers, politicians, businessmen, and journalists on the government's list, or cartels, a gang of villains that make reporting in Mexico dangerous.
The violence never stops and bodies are scattered throughout the country, including a growing number of journalists: According to the records of the Committee for the Protection of journalists, at least 25 journalists have died since President Enrique Peña Nieto took office in the 12 months of 2012; 589 journalists are under federal protection following attacks and threats; and so far this year, at least seven journalists have died in seven states.
The last to die was their editor and source of inspiration, as well as Javier Valdez Cardenas, the co-founder of "Riodoce."
Valdez, who has written many books on drug violence, wrote in one of them: "The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and become a journalist."
There was a deep sense that he had left, although he was everywhere - a huge picture hanging on the front of the "Riodoce" office building, Valdez with his middle finger up, with the word "Justice"; and a smile on the T-shirt worn by two journalists in their 30s, Aaron Ivala and Miriam Ramirez, who was wearing glasses or his iconic Panamanian straw hat.
The seminar took place less than two months after his death; journalists discussed their shared trauma, nightmares, insomnia and paranoia.
Although a special federal prosecutor's office had been established in 2010 to deal with journalists' cases, it had prosecuted only two persons, according to the records of the Committee for the Protection of journalists.
Most of the thousands of crimes each year involved drug trafficking and organized crime, so the perpetrators of the killings of journalists were rarely brought to justice.
In "Riodoce," they insisted on reporting on the violence in the state of Sinaro, although they were heartbroken, although the land was devastated.
'There is no information about the killer, there is no Justice, then there is not much use in holding a security seminar, 'Iwara said.
"It's foolish to waste time attending such a seminar," he said.
As long as we don't know why, you don't believe in anyone. '
On the morning of 5 months and 15 days, Valdez left the "Riodoce" office in the capital, Kulyacan.
His red Toyota Karola was only a few blocks away when he was stopped by two men; they forced him out of the car and fired 12 shots, presumably because of the name of the newspaper - translated as "ten two rivers."
The gangster drove away in his car and crashed it nearby.
Valdez is 50 years old.
Leaving behind his wife and two children who have come of age.
There were four rumors about Kulyacan.
But on the subject of Valdez, there was practically nothing but silence.
Since Guzman's arrest last year and his extradition to the United States in January, the state of Sinaro has become the bloodiest battleground in the country, with rival forces going on a killing spree.
It has become commonplace for one or more people to be shot every day on the streets of Sinaro state, and for cemeteries to be littered with the drug Lord's ornate two-story mausoleum.
Forget for a moment that the state of "calm" is when only one cartel controls the waterfront state and its ports and drug trafficking routes to the United States.
Even so, even though Valdez was deeply aware of the dangers of the job, Ismail Pohoqué, the 60-year-old co-founder and director of Riodoce, was guilty of failing to protect his friend.
He believed that two mistakes had caused the tragedy.
The first and second month published an interview with Damaso Lopez, who leads a cartel group fighting several of Guzman's sons.
The report may have infuriated the sons; the newspaper was bought out by suspected gang members as soon as it was delivered to the newsstand.
The second mistake was not to force Valdez to leave Mexico for his own safety after another newspaper covering the same story was confiscated.
Valdez is a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his death is of great significance for violence against journalists in Mexico.
His spirit lives on, and his friends and colleagues believe he has always been with us.
He was also a senior reporter for "Noroeste" in 2003, when he teamed up with five colleagues to start "Riodoce" and sold a $50 stake.
In the state of Sinaro, "it is impossible to set foot in journalism without dealing with the drug problem," Pohoqué said.
As time went by, the paper gained a good reputation for its bold and honest reporting, and sales and advertising increased.
Journalists like to be able to publish hard-hitting investigative stories without fear of censorship, and readers like newspapers to publish stories that others are afraid to report.
Five years after its founding, "Riodoce" won the Maria Moskapo Press Award of the Latin American nation.
In the same year, the Association for the Protection of journalists awarded the Valdez International Press Freedom Prize for his courage in pursuing the truest Mexican drug stories.
He confessed he was scared, too.
As the society for the protection of journalists awarded the award, he said "I want to continue to live."
Later, in late October, he said in an interview on the local television station Rompeviento TV that "in the state of Sinaro, drug trafficking is a way of life,
You have to take on the task of falling on your shoulders as a journalist - either so, or be deaf.
I don't want to be asked 'what have you done in the face of so many deaths...... why aren't you vocal about what's happening?' "
All the employees of "Riodoce" were nostalgic for Valdez, for swearing like a Docker, for the friend who had never been generous with hugs and advice, and for the teacher who knew how to live.
They relied on his habits.
He used to wear that hat.
The El Guayabo bar, which used to go across from the office, was also always sitting at the same table.
Now, they will ask: Was it his daily habits that caused his downfall?
His death also forced them to think about how to do a good job and live well.
'They don't like the fact that you're getting their women and children into trouble, and they don't like the fact that you're affecting their legitimate companies and the secret airports that are used to deliver drugs, 'Pohoqué said.
These are over their line, "he said.
The result is to maintain a high level of self-censorship and self-protection even at the safest of times.
Trust your instincts.
If you smell danger, stay away.
The problem, says Andres Villarreal, editor of Riodoce, is that "breath is a feeling that's going to be cheated...... and then something like that happens with Havel."
He and others say that the previous rules no longer apply to the state of Sinaro - just as they no longer apply to the states of Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero, and others, where smuggling routes are lucrative, while institutions are weak, government officials corrupt, and miasma.
The situation is constantly changing.
In the room where "Riodoce" employees participate in security training, mobile phones are suddenly not allowed; a few days ago, spyware allegedly sold only to the government was already used in Mexico to spy on journalists and activists.
Outside, two police officers took shelter from the heat of 104 degrees (40 degrees Celsius) in the shade of a tree.
They were sent by the state government to protect the "Riodoce" offices, which are located in a four-storey building in the middle class neighbourhood of Kulyacan.
Some reporters quipped, half-jokingly, that they didn't know if the cops belonged to what the governor himself said was 50% of the letter.
Journalists have been going to the mountains for months, where drug cartels are under the control of a physical presence.
This week's "Riodoce" featured three major events.
Among them was the killing of the brother of Julio Cesar Chavez, a great former boxer in the state of Sinaro,
And the disclosure of government funds in the governor's hometown,
And the kidnapping inside an expensive restaurant in Kulyacan, a block from the prosecutor's office.
Officials do not release information about the subject or the kidnapping process, so there is a need for caution in writing about what the city knows: The restaurant is a favorite place for drug dealers and officials alike.
A reporter learned from public files that the restaurant was registered in the name of a politician from the ruling Revolutionary institutions Party (PRI), which dominated the political class almost throughout the last period.
Recently, several PRI governors have been accused of embezzlement in several high-profile cases.
Villarreal asked reporters to write about what had happened at the site of the incident, including the escape of a son of Guzman, Mexico's top drug king, from a military attack.
If only a few months ago, readers would have looked at Valdez's column for the most powerful information about the kidnapping.
Villarreal, 46, who is known as "skinny" because of his thin build, said "before, we had known what was going on for a long time.
Now all our sources of information have been cut off.
Valdez's office is now used to store logos and stickers protesting the killing of journalists, as employees become what they never wanted to be: Activists representing the media.
On the morning of the second day, journalist Miriam Ramirez grabbed a handful of signs and walked out of the room and went to the local prosecutor's office to take part in a parade related to another reporter.
El Salvador Adame disappeared in the western state of Michoac á n three days after he was killed in Valdez.
Officials found a charred body and said it was his body, according to DNA tests.
Across the country, journalists have become more outspoken, organizing protests and painting sidewalks and buildings with the words "save the media."
On this day, director Pohoqué, who is not in Washington, is trying to get Justice and international support for the Valdez case.
Two days after Valdez was killed, in a meeting with the governor of the state of Sinaro, Ramirez accused officials of spying on journalists and killing them for telling the truth.
Given that her anger has affected her objectivity, she has also asked to resign from her position covering government affairs.
Valdez has repeatedly reiterated that journalists in Mexico are "surrounded" by organized crime, complicit government officials, and an indifferent society.
In his last book, "drug journalism," he wrote that journalists were not just mutilated by drug cartels, but were on the list of politicians and security forces who were complicit in organized crime.
Articulo 19, the media watchdog group, blamed police and public officials for more than half of last year's attacks on journalists.
Ramirez said, "in Mexico, they let you die just to shut you up."
Obviously, these murders are chilling.
No one forgets that six years ago, blogger Maria Elizabeth Marcias died on the northern border of Tamaulipas.
Next to her body was a note allegedly signed by the Zetas cartel: "I came for my report."
Her head was cut off with a computer keyboard and headphones on the side.
After Miroslava Braich was killed in three months, some newspapers chose to close, such as the newspaper El Norte on the northern border of the state of Chihuahua.
Others continued, and the directors of "El Manana of Nuevo Laredo" were killed in 2014, but they continued.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juarez spoke openly about the drug cartel with a front-page news story entitled "what do you want from us?"
Some of the journalists fled their home towns, or even left the country.
It was a difficult choice.
It is difficult to find work in exile, and they still need to be cautious and alert to danger in the streets.
Sometimes they are arrested, and in 2015 photographer Reuben Espinosa is said to have been killed along with four women in a Mexican City three months after fleeing Veracruz.
For those who stay behind the scenes and continue to work, it's a daily dance step for high-risk decisions.
Iwara, who had wanted to be a poet, admitted he was terrified by reporting on the drug trade.
He said "Mexico is turning into hell, so I became a journalist."
In the middle of the night on a recent Friday, the latest issue of the newspaper had gone to press, and the editors of "Riodoce" were sitting in the aisle outside the office drinking beer when, suddenly, their cell phones rang.
Nineteen people have been confirmed dead in a series of shoot-outs between rival gangs and security forces near the beach resort city of Masatland.
The fighting is still escalating, as foreshadowed by a series of cartel messages found in the region.
They uploaded the news to the "Riodoce" website right on the side of the road via their mobile phones.
The headlines of the second day had to be changed.
The siren sounded nearby - and there was another shootout of a life-and-death duel in the area.
Pohoqué glanced at the policemen standing there to see if they were alert.
If they're a little bit scared, then they're not showing it either.
The founder of this newspaper has been killed, and in his large portrait, his middle finger points to where the entire state of Sinaro needs to look out, and the entire staff of "Riodoce" follows in his footsteps.
"How can you even want to shut down? The same day that Havel was killed, the intern asked me to send her out on the Street to participate in the coverage," Pohoqué said.
China's self-driving tourism market size or exceed trillion yuan in 2020
[Abstract] in the broader context of rising consumption and the prevalence of free movement, self-driving is encouraged by national policies and loved by a growing number of consumers.
But at the same time, the self-driving market, which is expected to break through the trillion, faces a double challenge.
In the broader context of rising consumption and the prevalence of free movement, self-driving is encouraged by national policies and loved by a growing number of consumers.
At the same time, however, the self-driving market, which is expected to break through the trillion scale, faces a double challenge. On the one hand, the development of the self-driving industry is not proportional to market demand, self-driving clubs and self-driving organizers such as travel agencies face the dilemma of meagre profits; on the other hand, the infrastructure and services faced by self-driving are still in the primary stage.
Accounting for 60% of domestic visitors, the market is expected to break trillion
With 4.44 billion domestic trips in all of 2016, self-driving accounted for about 60 percent of the country's total, and the size of the self-driving market is on track to exceed a trillion by 2020.
According to the China Travel and Shipping Association's statistics on the number of self-driving excursions, the number of people from driving has continued to grow in the past five years, with the number of excursions accounting for more than half of domestic Tourism.
At the same time, regions, as well as at the national level, have shown more attention and support for the emerging area of self-driving, with the intensive introduction of policies and regulations related to self-driving, sojourn cars and camping tourism from 2016 to 2017.
In July 2017, eight departments, including the National Tourism Administration and the State General Administration of Sports, jointly issued the Plan for the Development of Automobile self-driving Sports camps; in the same month, self-driving was highlighted in the Action Plan for promoting the quality upgrading of Rural Tourism Development (2017), issued jointly by 14 departments, including the Development and Reform Commission and the Ministry of Finance.
The introduction of the policy provides opportunities and policy guidance for the development of domestic self-driving travel.
Self-driving club profit is meager, complete industrial chain is the key
Although the domestic self-driving market has great potential and national policies are actively guided, the self-driving industry is still in its infancy.
According to the China self-driving Annual Development report 2016-2017, there are thousands of self-driving clubs, car clubs and car clubs in the country, but the proportion of self-driving excursions arranged by tourists themselves accounts for the majority, with only about 15 per cent of visitors attending various institutions such as car clubs and self-driving clubs.
At the same time, there are few online travel enterprises and traditional travel agencies that independently develop self-driving products. Many online travel platforms sell only self-driving products offered by some suppliers, and some self-driving clubs are also important suppliers.
In terms of organizing self-driving activities, it covers many aspects of "eat, live, travel, travel, buy and entertain", with a high degree of fragmentation, a heavy upstream supply chain and a large random consumption of tourists.
Li Guanjie, founder and CEO of the Beijing World Automobile Club, believes that self-driving clubs are essentially similar to travel agencies, and that the main early profit models were dominated by offline activities, with self-driving line products and tour leader services at the core.
But now the self-driving travel field line product homogenization is serious, the tour leader service level is uneven, the self-driving club is faced with the need to transform again.
It can be seen that self-driving is not an independent industry in itself, but with its self-driving displacement characteristics to form a cross-regional, industry ecological circle, it is important to form a complete industrial chain.
Experts point out that in addition to basic tourism consumption, experience is a more important consumption element.
Therefore, for the development of the self-driving industry, we should enhance the experience characteristics and develop the theme of "self-driving +" as well as the IP of self-driving products.
Scenic roads are not only roads, car camps should not be only for food and accommodation
In the face of the rise of self-driving, the basic supporting development of self-driving is also relatively rudimentary.
Li Guanjie pointed out that the tourist scenic road is not just a road, but needs to integrate the elements of traffic and tourism, but the construction of roads and tourism itself is the responsibility of two departments, the transport sector to increase the tourism element, but also in the construction of toilets, consultation centres, publicity bars and other facilities, the degree of integration with tourism is not high.
Compared with the well-known self-driving Route "American highway 66", the construction experience is worth learning from.
The design of the scenic road is no longer the most direct and fast route between the place of departure and the destination, but follows the design concept of "experience driving fun" to provide self-driving tourists with the best enjoyment of the beauty along the road. The scenic road can link the point and face tourism landscape, not only preserving the historical and cultural value of the ecotourism resources along the route, but also holding various thematic activities to enhance the participatory and recreational experience of tourists and create economic benefits for the local tourism industry.
In addition to the scenic road, the camp is also an important supporting Facility for self-driving.
But among the self-driving tourists known to the Beijing News reporter, there are not many consumers who choose to stay in the camp.
They believe that many camps are biased towards infrastructure and can only meet the demand for food and shelter, a low grade and a single product, and are unable to meet the demand for self-driving, which contains many elements.
Some insiders, who did not want to be named, said that many of the enterprises that did the camp in previous years were in order to take the land, after taking the land, the supporting infrastructure construction and services in the later period did not keep up, and many of the operating conditions were losses, and without the late injection of funds, it was difficult to do some corresponding supporting products.
Consumer groups
According to data released by the China Travel and Shipping Association in 2017, the self-driving group is concentrated in the 21-40 age group, especially in the 31-40 age group, which has a certain economic base and has a high demand for personalized Tourism and is mostly parent-child travel customers.
From the accommodation survey, self-driving people are relatively more likely to prefer non-standard accommodation.
In terms of the type of self-driving, peripheral self-driving is the most dominant type of self-driving, accounting for 84.32%.
Self-driving out of the country is the aspiration of many people, but the proportion is still small.
At the same time, with the rise in consumer demand, tourists who used to like self-driving "tourist attractions" began to change their minds, no longer "get out of the car and take pictures and go to sleep" during self-driving, but pay more attention to the experience and process of travel.
Dinosaurs used camouflage to avoid their enemies
At first glance, it looks terrible, but it looks like a statue.
Researchers have released the first study of a rhino-sized, incredible biological fossil found by Canadian miners, noting that the fossil is well preserved, so experts call it the "Mona Lisa of the dinosaur world."
The fossil was so well preserved that it was even able to conclude that the color of its scaly skin was reddish brown, suggesting that it had had some "troubled experiences."
The associated report in the Journal contemporary Biology described it as "the best-preserved armored dinosaur ever found and one of the best dinosaur specimens in the world."
The fossil is a newly discovered species of tuberous dragon that lived in the middle of the Cretaceous period between 110 million and 112 million years ago.
It was extremely well preserved and shocked the researchers, who described it as "truly breathtaking."
The herbivorous dinosaur fossil is the best-preserved fossil of its kind ever found, according to the National Geographic Journal.
On March 21, 2011, Shawn Funk discovered the fossil while digging at the Suncor Jubilee Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada.
At the time, he came across something that seemed very different from the rocks around him, so he decided to take a closer look.
After that, the fossils he found were sent to the Royal Tyriel Museum of Paleontology in Canada.
It took the researchers six years to show the beast, which was hidden inside the 2,500-pound (1,100 kg) block of soil, its true face.
After such hard work, the final results are only now being announced.
"If you look at it, you almost believe it's sleeping," said Caleb Brown, a scientist and first author at the Royal Tyriel Museum, where the creature is on display
"It will be one of the most beautiful and well-preserved dinosaur specimens in the history of science - the Mona Lisa in the dinosaur world."
By studying its skin, the researchers found that the herbivorous creature, although clad in armour, like a walking tank, had the potential to be under significant threat from carnivorous dinosaurs.
The heavily armored dinosaur uses red and white camouflage to avoid predators and uses a covert technique known as "anti-shading," which is also used by many modern animals.
In this way, experts say, it is better able to blend in with its surroundings and thus avoid the enemy, suggesting it was preyed on by larger dinosaurs.
The 1.1-billion-year-old creature, which is part of the tuberous dragon family, made headlines for the first time in May and is currently on display at the Royal Tyriel Museum of Paleontology.
After Mark Mitchell, a Museum technician who was part of the team, took 7,000 hours to carefully unveil the giant beast, researchers have now studied it and named it "Borealopelta markmitchelli."
The samples were extremely well preserved, allowing Dr. Mitchell, as well as an international team of scientists, to record the patterns and shapes of the scales and armor on his body.
They discovered "anti-shading," a common form of defense in the animal kingdom, which means the creature's back is darker than the color on its side.
Although "anti-shading" is common, the findings are surprising because the dinosaur is far larger than the existing animals that use it.
The dinosaur was under pressure to be hunted by meat-eating dinosaurs and thus evolved in a favorable direction, allowing it to hide in a confrontation as a means of survival.
But most of the existing animals that use anti-shading, such as deer, zebras or armadillo, are as small and vulnerable as prey, suggesting that the creature is under real pressure to survive.
"The frenzied predation of large heavy armour dinosaurs shows how dangerous carnivorous dinosaurs were in the Cretaceous period," Brown said.
Chemical analysis of the organic complex in its scales also showed that the dinosaur's skin color was reddish brown.
Scientists are continuing to study the creature's life clues, including its retained stomach contents, to find the last food to eat.
They believe that the dinosaurs fell into the River at the time of their death, were then washed into the sea and eventually sank to the bottom of the sea with their backs down.
At the time, the climate in Alberta was as warm as it is in southern Florida today, and rivers and oceans were probably deeper inland than they are now.
"This tuberous dragon is truly stunning because it is completely covered by preserved scaly skin and, to this day, has been preserved in dimensional space, thus allowing its original shape to be preserved," Brown said.
"As a result, the creature is now in almost the same shape as it was during the Cretaceous period.
You don't have to rebuild it with too much imagination; if you look at it, you'll almost believe it's sleeping. "
The Cretaceous period was a period when large bipedal foot dinosaurs roamed the Earth.
Although the Tyrannosaurus rex was the king of the dinosaurs, it appeared hundreds of thousands of years after the armour dinosaurs, which may have been killed by some of the Tyrannosaurus rex's ancestors.
They include the high spines, a giant beast that weighs up to six tons and is 38 feet (11.5 meters) long.
New research has found that scientists appearing in the journal current Biology believe that tuberous dragons were washed into the sea after their death and later formed mummies in the soil.
On March 21, 2011, Sean Fink excavated the creature at the Jubilee Mine near Fort McMurray, Alberta, Canada.
It is the best-preserved armored dinosaur in the world, with complete skin and armour in areas ranging from the nose to the buttocks, according to the Museum.
The creature is about 18 feet (5 meters) long on average and weighs 3,000 pounds (1,300 kilograms).
It has two 20-inch long sharp corners protruding from the shoulders.
The researchers believe the herbivorous dinosaur operated in what is now western Canada before being washed into the sea by rivers that burst into floodwaters.
But the dinosaur was buried at the bottom of the sea to keep its armour intact.
The fossilized remains of this particular sample are so well preserved that the remaining skin is still covered with bumpy armour from the dinosaur's skull.
As Michael Greshko wrote in the Journal National Geographic, this level of preservation, like winning the lottery, is very rare.
The more I look at it the more I find it unbelievable.
Leftover skin fossils still cover the mottled armour on the dinosaur's skull.
Its right forehand is located on its side, with five toes spread upward.
I can count them out. "
The reporter learned that traditional urea could be modified by adding natural or plant-based trehalic acid, humic acid and amino acid efficiency carriers into the urea production process, and that the utilization rate of trehalic acid urea, zinc humic acid urea and glutenin urea was 5 to 10 percentage points higher than that of ordinary urea.
Environmentally friendly, crop production potential is obvious, especially large particle value-added urea is a high quality raw material for BB fertilizer.
This total number of security personnel is double the number of security personnel at the 2012 London Olympic Games.
To ensure the safety of the Rio Olympics, Brazil will launch the largest security linkage plan ever.
Previously, the Brazilian government said a total of 85,000 people from the army and police would fight in concert, including 20,000 military and 65,000 police.
Most of the troops will be responsible for defending the Olympic venues, while the additional 3,000 troops will be responsible for security at international airports, subway stations and streets.
Police, in turn, patrol other parts of the city, including subways, buses and streets.
It is reported that 6,000 troops have arrived in Rio to provide security for the Olympics.
In addition to being in charge of the four major competition areas of the Rio Olympics, they are also responsible for patrolling the airport as well as the main roads linking the airport and Olympic venues.
The introduction of evaluation mechanisms in the service industry is not new. For evaluation mechanisms to be effective, it is important to make regulation more effective and not formal.
How do activists learn to answer the question: "Whose streets?"
On 8 months and 9 days in 2014, Brittany Ferrer was in a state of trepidation.
On the first day of his trip to New York City, the St. Louis man sat on Epeying's rented bed, browsing Facebook on his mobile phone.
She stumbled upon a post from a high school student.
It read "the police have just killed an 18-year-old and the child is still lying in the street".
She was baffled to find that no one else on the feed had posted the message. She shut down Facebook and turned on the push.
One @ TheePharoah user kept pushing her the dynamic Times.
The rapper in the St. Louis area pushed live the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old black man who was killed by a White police officer in Ferguson, Missouri.
He posted a picture of Brown's lifeless body lying in the Street, where his body lay for four hours.
"Crazy," Ferrell thought.
But death is nothing new to her and her community.
She put her phone down and didn't open it again until that evening to read the tweets about the crowd gathering on Canfield Avenue.
There were police videos and pictures of people shouting, as well as a picture of a man claiming to be Brown's father, with the words: "Ferguson police just killed my unarmed son!"
She saw a live feed, with a police officer standing in front of a group of protesters with a barking dog.
In another video, she said, another police officer held up his rifle and screamed, "I will kill all of you...... animals."
"It wasn't normal," Ferrell recalled.
"This is not something we take for granted and can be called a typical murder."
At that moment, I felt a shudder.
I'm angry and crying with anger. '
She booked a return flight and went home the next day.
After landing at 11pm, she picked up her six-year-old daughter from her father's House and decided the pair would head to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson over the next three years was the subject of a new documentary, "whose Street?," which was released in theaters on 8 months and 11 days.
It's a story about survival and protest, love and loss, strength and tenacity from the perspective of the people who live in this community and fill the streets demanding answers.
As Ferrell drove to Ferguson with his daughter (in a floral dress and with a crown accessory), the pair revisited a topic they had discussed countless times before that morning - "about the black experience and the black situation."
"Do you remember when I taught you when black people had to fight for what they believed in?" She recalled.
'We're going to Ferguson now because it's not right that the police killed an 18-year-old boy.
I had to take her with me, "Ferrell said later.
'What's happening today is the culmination of all the things that have happened in the past...
She wants to know, see and rise from this.
She needs not only to be well developed in terms of radicalism and organization, but also to understand the different dimensions of the black experience and the black situation, and what we must do to be free and liberated.
Even if I had the privilege of providing her with experiences of racism that she had not experienced firsthand, she was no different from other black girls.
If I protect her in this matter, I feel like I'm hurting her. '
They arrived at Ferguson's first stop at a site opposite the South Florida Road police station, which became their camp after the militants waited for the eventual non-prosecution of police Officer Darren Wilson.
Ferrell and her daughter got in touch with a local business owner who made a bagged lunch.
They prepared the bags and were responsible for passing them to the protesters.
Slowly, Ferrell began to form a new type of activism.
"My radicalism changed after eight months and nine days," she said, noting that when she was an undergraduate at Missouri State University in St. Louis, she was president of the Minority Nurses students Association and focused on food justice and health disparities in the black community.
"I have no organizational experience.
That's how it all came. '
A few weeks later, Ferrell met with the film's co-director, Sabah Foleyan, during a night parade.
Foleyan said she and her director of photography, Lucas Alvarado Faller, were "just trying to document" what happened.
A question came to Ferrell's mind: "Do you want to record or do you want to find a story that you can take advantage of?"
This suspicion stems from many of these cases: People - usually white - enter a community to benefit from their pain and tenacity.
As Foleyan explained in a recent interview, "we heard that the native-born people in Ferguson didn't focus their voices, and we wanted to do it in a different way."
Foleyan has been in touch with co-director Dimon Davis, a regional artist known for his radicalism against dead prisoners.
His involvement led Ferrell, along with six other locals, to join the "whose Street?" Project team, which remained in place for years after Brown's shooting.
"This documentary is not someone speaking for us or talking to us, this is our statement," Davis said.
'I'm mainly focused on how these characters are presented because that's how I'm presented as well. '
While the goal was not to focus on Ferrell's experience - but to show that the movement was "not about savior leaders, but about community cohesion," Foleyan said - she proved to be the most open of the film's participants.
As a result, "whose Street?" Is a surprising record of Ferrell's personal life, such as falling in love and stepping into marriage.
"I feel naked," Ferrell laughed the first time he saw the finished product.
"But I understand that there has to be a degree of vulnerability to do this job and humanize black people."
In addition, Ferrell's story reaffirms and relocates the role of Black cool women in the broader movement of Black life events.
Two of the movement's three founders - who created # BlackLivesMatter on social media in the wake of the 2012 shooting of black teenager Trevor Martin - were identified as cool.
"The Black cool women in the leadership have supported the movement in general," Ferrell said, "and that's because we keep fighting on multiple fronts.
Black cool women have to live with all this, "he said.
Foleyan agreed and mentioned that "the movement really has the support of black women and a lot of black cool women."
Ferrell was chosen to be at the heart of the film because of her identity. However, she insists "it's not affirmative action for things."
"She's the one who inspires that energy," she says.
'While she's on the front line, it's no coincidence because you've got a lot to do as a black cool woman in the life of these intersections.
You can feel her energy through the screen, "he said.
Meanwhile, in Ferguson, the news cameras are long gone, but the tense race relations between the community and the police remain.
Ferrell was sentenced to more than two and a half years of probation for trying to block the motorway during a March.
She described the socio-political atmosphere in the area she called home: "A mess."
Still, since taking to the streets of Ferguson three years ago, she has stuck to the chants she has tried to remember.
"It is our duty to fight for freedom.
We have a responsibility to win.
We must love each other and support each other.
We have nothing to lose but the shackles of our bodies. "
In fact, online translation services were already available on the Internet a decade ago, and there was a lot of talk that "machines are about to replace humans for translation" a long time ago.
Similarities: The artist uses Chelsea Manning's DNA to create portraits
There are multiple faces in the middle of the Pavilion at the Friedman art Gallery in New York: White, black and Brown, each with an almost imperceptible resemblance to each other, tied by a cord dangling from the ceiling.
The 30 portraits were created by the artist Dewey-Hagborg using cheek tampons and hair crumbs sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent hair crumbs from Livingworth prison, where the former intelligence analyst was sentenced to 35 years for leaking classified diplomatic cables through the WikiLeaks website.
The exhibition opened on 8 months and 2 days under the title "similarities."
It was the result of two years of correspondence between Dewey Hagburg and Manning, who combined his discipline with his own in technology, computer science and the arts, and Manning, a prominent dissident who had been jailed and completed a sex change operation in prison, and former U.S. president Barack Obama pardoned the remainder of her sentence three days before the end of her term.
By analyzing the algorithm from Manning's DNA, and thus creating 30 portraits of a "likely appearance," Heather Dewey Harborg made a scathing and somewhat heartless comment, both on the polysemy of DNA and on the very concept of identity.
Manning, who was born with the name Bradley Edward and had publicly admitted to thinking of herself as a woman at puberty, was convicted in 2013 on 20 charges, including six Espionage law violations, computer fraud and theft.
In prison, her image was subdued, with only one photo, a granular black-and-white self-photo, looking visibly uneasy, sitting in a driving seat and wearing a platinum-colored wig.
In 2015, Heather Dewey Harborg was a huge success in her 2012 project, "the faces of strangers."
In that piece, she uses DNA from cigarette butts and gum medium court exhibits, extracted from crumbs, to create portraits of 3D characters that may be similar in appearance.
It was just in time for her to receive an email from Paper Magazine.
"They want to interview Chelsea Manning in prison and need a portrait photo," Heather Dewey Harborg told the media at the opening of the exhibition.
Chelsea Manning couldn't visit or take pictures at the time, so they contacted Chelsea to ask if she was interested in making a DNA portrait.
So the artist and her jailed muse became impossible pen pals, exchanging many letters with each other over the course of two years.
They even created a comic book, "the repressed head," by Shoili Kanungo, which envisaged that the president could grant privileges to Manning in the future and that she would be able to see the exhibition in prison.
And it may be a coincidence that Obama called for her release just a few days after the book was published, when Manning spent seven years in a Kansas military prison.
Moreover, the exhibition has another deep meaning, because in the contemporary United States, the Trump administration is constantly declaring war on government leakers and transgender military personnel, while looking for new ways, which can be hyped on the push, to nakedly foment division, which this exhibition is intended to heal.
Asked about the particular timing of all this, Heather Dewey Harborg said, "anything happens for a reason."
In the artist's statement, written on the Wall of the gallery, Manning's oversized signature is below (the "I" in the name is drawn with a heart), calling for an end to "partisan chaos based on gender, sexual orientation and culture."
On the opposite wall is a sequence of her mitochondrial DNA, written in a pencil twist with the symbols of Cs, Gs and as.
By containing 200 letters (or nucleotides, the complex scientific dictionary of each artist), Heather Dewey Harborg hopes, by depicting these surprisingly similar portraits, to express that, at least physiologically, everyone is.
"I want people to get out of this mess, our genomes won't care about who we are, how the publicly available genetic data is interpreted and how subjective it is," said Heather Dewey Harborg, whose 2007 video work, "false memories," is also on display.
"DNA data can tell us a lot of different stories, so this is 30 of them."
The last work in the exhibition, inside a room, comes from a page in the story in the previous illustration.
Shows the pompous, King Kong styled Manning under a megaphone held by soldiers in the United States.
"When they make your speech stop, they win," the Wall reads.
"So, never shut up."
"The content came directly from a letter she wrote to me," said the artist from Philadelphia.
"I'm just scared again, and I'm still going to say it."
Manning has not yet seen the exhibition in person, as so foreseen in the cartoon, but when she does, she will be cheered by her own DNA portrait mask, like a group of protesters in the Center of the Pavilion.
It was also purposeful and, as with all the items in the exhibition, reached the height of the genetic haploid group information she had written in pencil (5.2 feet, Manning's height).
"In the past, I hung them on the wall, but I wanted them to feel like a group," Dewey Hagburg said of the portrait.
"But I wanted them to feel like a group of protesters following Chelsea, just as people were protesting at the time to release her."
Northwestern University Professor and Oxford University employee wanted for Homicide
A Northwestern University professor and an Oxford University employee were subsequently wanted after a man was found fatally stabbed inside a luxury apartment in Chicago, and suspects are being sought across the country, police said.
On Monday, Wyndham Lessem, 42, and Andrew Warren, 56, were issued a first-degree non-bail murder warrant in connection with the death of Trenton H. James Connell Duranlo, according to Cook County court records.
According to the documents, Cornell Duranlo, 26, died as a result of multiple stabbings.
The body was found on seven months and 27 days, according to a community alert issued by the Chicago Police Department.
Police arrived at the Grand Plaza apartment after receiving the call and found multiple lacerations on the victim's body.
Connell Duranlo died at the scene and detectives are investigating the killing, while police are actively looking for two suspects, police said.
Lessem has been an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Kauberge, deputy director of the campus relations service, said in an emailed statement that Lessem has now been removed from his post and has been banned from the Northwestern University campus.
"This is now a criminal case that is being investigated by the relevant authorities and Northwestern University is actively cooperating with the investigation," Mr Kaubetch said.
Warren is a senior finance assistant at Oxford University.
"We have been in contact with the British police and stand ready to assist U.S. investigative agencies as required," a spokesman for the University of Oxford's Somerville College said in an emailed statement.
The statement added that Warren's colleagues were deeply shocked and hoped he would be able to turn himself in.
The Chicago Police Department's chief Liaison Officer, Anthony Gulelmi, said he strongly encouraged the suspects to turn themselves in to authorities.
Mr Gulelmi said "the Police already have a general idea of their whereabouts and we are trying to locate possible locations."
Mr Gulelmi said local, regional and national authorities were fully assisting in the search for the suspect.
Mr Gulelmi said police had received a call from the manager of the Grand Plaza apartment, who had just received a secret tip that something had happened to apartment 1008.
Police said the situation was dire.
Mr Gulelmi said it was still unclear whether the incident also took place on seven months and 27 days.
He said it was confirmed that Lessem and Warren were in the building at the time, according to security cameras.
"We believe Professor Lessem had something to do with the victim," Gulelmi said.
"Police are currently studying the victim's timeline and context of the crime and are investigating various motives, including a possible domestic incident," Grand Plaza's management team said in a statement to residents.
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mutko said "we will complete the World Anti-Doping Agency road map in the near future"
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said it would not take too long to implement the remaining standards of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) aimed at restoring the rights of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA).
"The implementation of the road map standards has reached A certain stage, and RUSADA has been granted the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD (UK Anti-Doping Agency).
The WADA roadmap has been updated in this regard, "Mutko said on Thursday.
Deputy Prime Minister Mutko made the statement when commenting on part II of the World Anti-Doping Agency's road map, "Compliance," which sets out the criteria for restoring RUSADA's rights and was recently posted on the organization's website.
According to Mutko, the standards do not contain anything that could be of concern to Russia.
He added, "everything has to be announced and everything will be implemented.
And the results will be presented to the IOC [IOC] and WADA in the near future, "he said.
However, one of the criteria mentioned in the list is that the Russian anti-doping agency must publicly accept the findings of an investigation approved by Canadian lawyer Richard McKaren on WADA regarding Russian state support for the use of doping in sports in their own country.
Speaking about the matter, Mutko said: "We are investigating and there is no doubt that our anti-doping system has failed.
All measures have been implemented.
But there is no national plan behind this, and we will not acknowledge what does not exist, "he said.
Mutko's words echoed those of Vitali Smirnov, the head of Russia's Independent Public anti-doping Commission.
In a visit to the media Russian outlet RSport earlier in the day, Smirnov acknowledged past problems with the Russian anti-doping agency, but added: "We have said on various occasions that the report contains controversial positions and provisions.
No one plans to accept the report unconditionally, "Smirnov said.
In the wake of the 11-month doping scandal in 2015, WADA suspended RUSADA's right to carry out doping checks in Russia.
But in June, RUSADA was allowed to plan and coordinate testing this year under the supervision of international experts and UKAD.
During a visit to the group's headquarters in Moscow in July, WADA Director General Olivia Negri said RUSADA was "moving in the right direction" in an effort to restore its rights.

You don't have to look for a surrogate again! These 8000 kinds of products have zero tariff
At a regular press conference held by the Ministry of Commerce on January 11, a spokesman for the Ministry of Commerce said that so far, China has put into effect 15 Free Trade Agreements involving 23 countries and regions, covering more than 8,000 imported products with zero tariffs.
At the same time, imported cosmetics, Icelandic salmon, Chilean red wine, ASEAN tropical fruits...... you don't have to pay a lot of money for these products anymore.
At present, China has signed 16 free trade Agreements with 24 countries and regions, and 15 have entered into force, covering more than 8,000 imported products with zero tariffs.
In the case of agricultural products, with the implementation of the FTA, consumers can taste agricultural products of different origin and good quality and low price all year round.
In ASEAN, for example, import tariffs on tropical fruits such as durian, lychee and fiery fruit have been reduced from 15% to 30% to zero.
The import tariff on Icelandic salmon was reduced from 10 to 12 per cent to zero;
For red wine in Georgia and Chile, import tariffs were reduced from 14 to 30 per cent to zero;
And New Zealand's special agricultural products, such as beef and milk powder, have been subject to larger tax cuts.
In the case of industrial goods, for example, import tariffs on some cosmetics in Switzerland have been reduced to zero;
Import tariffs on some watches have been reduced by 50% and will be reduced to zero in a few years;
South Korea's import tariffs on products such as refrigerators, rice cookers, massages and beauty machines have been reduced by 40% and will be reduced to zero in a few years;
There are also larger tax cuts such as consumer electronics.
At the same time, the zero-tariff products under the FTA also include the intermediate products and raw materials needed for the manufacture of many domestic terminal consumer goods, which has also contributed to the structural upgrading of domestic consumer goods to some extent.
A spokesman for the Ministry of Commerce said that nearly one third of China's total imports can enjoy preferential tariffs under the FTA, most of which are terminal consumer goods, bringing tangible benefits to consumers.
Further reduction of import tariffs on consumer goods
Since December 1, 2017, China has adjusted the import tariffs on some consumer goods to further reduce the import tariffs on consumer goods, covering all types of consumer goods such as food, health products, medicines, daily articles, shoes and hats, household equipment, cultural entertainment, daily groceries, etc., involving a total of 1878-digit tariff numbers.
The average tax rate on this batch of consumer goods will be cut straight from 17.3 per cent to 7.7 per cent, almost "halved"!
From January 1, 2018, our country has also made partial adjustments to other import and export tariffs.
The import duty on some cosmetics such as lipstick, eye shadow and perfume was reduced from 10% to 5%;
The reduction in tariffs means that consumers do not have to buy on their behalf, let alone travel all the way abroad to buy favorite foreign products.

At the end of the year, American shopping malls require caution when returning large purchases
Zhongxin net December 29
Just after Christmas, there was a wave of returns, according to the World daily.
More than half of the goods sold last Christmas were refunded, according to the ABC.
In addition, there are readers who have been tricked into buying online, and consumers need to pay more attention when shopping on informal websites.
In general, large shopping companies have formal and reasonable return procedures, but if you buy gifts or electricity from some small stores, you must be careful.
Ms. Hou of Luo Langgang bought a coat for 60 multiple (US dollars, the same) at an online shop specializing in printed coats on December 1 local time, and it has not been sent yet.
She emailed the customer service and there was no reply.
Another netizen, who traveled to the United States last year, bought a mobile phone from a third-party seller and sent it to find it was a box of Rubber mud.
After knowing you've been scammed, apply to the website for a refund and it's good to get a full refund.
But there are also customers who believe that the website refund service is not 100 per cent perfect.
Mr. Wang, a Chinese resident of Northern California, said he had twice purchased an emergency distribution service for a website, an emergency service of four yuan, but both times it was not delivered on time.
He then applied for a refund and did not receive a reply.
Large shopping malls or shopping malls have a better return policy.
Macy's (Macy's) has a full refund within 180 days for most of its goods.
However, the goods must remain "original" and must have a purchase voucher such as a receipt or a bank purchase record.
If there is no voucher, customers can also get mall points, which can be used to buy other goods.
Target usually has a 90-day return period for general merchandise and 15 days for electronic goods.
But the return period for electronic, entertainment goods purchased between November 1 and December 25, 2017 was extended to 30 days.

Extreme shopping experience, the advent of a new era in the development of shopping in the business circle
More than a decade ago, our country was generally in the seller's market, with limited options and limited demand.
But after a decade of development, the market has long been transformed from a seller's market to a buyer's market, and today's consumers' tastes have become more distasteful, and they are no longer content with the simple act of "delivering with one hand."
So how to give consumers an extreme shopping experience becomes the next point of competition for real estate developers.
And among the many factors affecting the consumer shopping experience, the shopping center in the business circle has the most significant impact.
See how city builders everywhere focus on the shopping experience.
There are no two identical leaves in the world, much less two identical shopping malls, a famous shopping mall must have its own characteristics.
For example, Turkey's world-famous Kanyon Shopping mall, whose unique wavy architectural design is inspired by the Grand Canyon, is named Kanyon, and walks in Kanyon's 200-meter footpath as if it were inside the Grand Canyon.
In addition to the canyon design, there is a large concave oval performance venue in the middle of the shopping centre, which is unique in shape and often features performances.
Because of the open platform design, visitors can walk on each floor to look down at the activities carried out in the "Canyon" and have the effect of changing the scene.
At home, Nanjing Forest Moore Commercial Street, known as China's first Forest walk, combines shopping with ecology and fairy tales.
The 7,000-square-metre green square, the 3,000-square-metre rooftop water platform, the project consists of nine single buildings, the air corridor between the buildings, the overall sinking courtyard design, taking the French sycamore tree as the building epidermis, the rooftop water rooftop, to create a forest-like feeling.
Walking into the Forest Moore is like accidentally falling into the rabbit hole in Alice's roaming adventure. Climbing along the trunk surrounds the building against the grass and the clear spring, bringing people into a Forest full of life and vitality.
Also in Chongqing, Longhu built Lijia Waterfront Business circle, planning 100 square Commerce, plans to introduce in the future more than 50 international top exclusive flagship stores, more than 100 top international brands and more than 500 famous domestic and foreign brands, to become a service industry agglomeration, thematic characteristics of the Business centre.
Not only that, the Lijia Waterfront Business circle also integrates ecology into architecture, is guided by Tod public transport, and integrates fashion shopping, life services, catering, entertainment, education and sports. While giving consumers the best shopping experience, it also leads them to enjoy the unique "Waterfront culture" of Chongqing, integrating shopping with water entertainment and leisure.
It can be found that, at present, a number of housing companies have an insight into the discovery trajectory of this new urban business, and insiders say that this consumption model centred on consumer experience and how to combine shopping with experience will also be the mainstream of urban development in the future.
The current business circle is not only a gathering place for goods, but also a comprehensive place for the integration of artistic culture and creative themes. It also carries people's responsibility for urban residence.
Therefore, while meeting the one-stop-shop material needs of consumers, maximizing the transmission of the multi-level spiritual needs of culture and art and giving play to the demand for liveable residence is bound to be the high point of the future development of the business circle.
In Chongqing, Guoxing's north shore Jiangshan, located in the north of the River, near the Guanyin Bridge, a collection of the best of the world's business, international giants around the left and right, first-class brands together, closely connected with international fashion.
Here step by step prosperity, the essence of the world;
Dongyuan Jin Yue has a better shopping environment, Dongyuan Jin Yue near the Nanping Business circle, alone enjoy the Western and even the country's leading four-storey three-dimensional transportation system, enhancing shopping comfort.
In addition, the landscaping and landscaping of the two pedestrian streets of Huiyong Road and Wanda Square have been upgraded, about 300 trees have been planted, 40,000 square metres of ground have been transformed, and the image of the Nanping Business circle has been enhanced;
And Longhu Yu Lake No. 1, near the first low-density Waterfront Business circle in Chongqing - Lijia Waterfront Business circle, surrounded by nine parks, the low density and high degree of openness of commercial blocks make people more willing to stay, stop and slowly enjoy shopping when shopping, rather than being hurriedly driven forward by the flow of people behind, the real realization of "walking shopping".
Today's business competition will only become more and more intense, how to kill a blood road in a heavily homogenized market and win the reputation of the "shopping mecca" in the hearts of future consumers, it is worth all real estate developers to think seriously.
A differentiation strategy alone is far from enough. Only those developers who really put consumers in their hearts, are anxious about what consumers want, and provide consumers with an extreme and simple shopping experience will be able to laugh in the stormy market.
Of course, at the end of the day, I think the most happy is the people of Chongqing, with such a good shopping experience and business circle, 10 years ago no one could have imagined the prosperity of today.
Festival of things: Consumerism revelry conceals real environmental prices
168.2 billion yuan, which is the amount of turnover consumed by Sky cat users within 24 hours of the "Sky cat double eleven Global carnival" on November 11, 2017.
Specifically, after the start of "double 11", cat turnover topped 10 billion in just three minutes, more than 20 billion yuan in 6 minutes and 05 seconds, and broke 100 billion in nine hours.
On that day, the total number of payments completed by consumers worldwide through PayPal reached 1.48 billion, up 41 percent from last year.
These purchases will result in 812 million logistics orders.
And whether it is the Sky Cat net purchase platform or the PayPal payment platform, all belong to Ma Yun's Ali Group.
Ten years ago, no one would have thought that the "Singles Day" subculture, created by single youth out of self-deprecation on November 11, would be adopted by electricity merchants as the "double 11" shopping carnival, which is now a phenomenon.
On November 11, 2009, Alibaba used a "Singles Day" marketing stunt: No one is in love with you, so "single dogs" come and buy it online.
The results came as a surprise, with the trading value of Taobao Mall (the predecessor of the Sky Cat) exceeding 52 million yuan on that day, 10 times the amount of daily transactions at the time.
Since then, "double 11" has become a shopping carnival created by Alibaba, from the beginning of the domestic buyer sellers amuse themselves, to now the influx of global merchants, nine years have passed, the sky cat "double 11" hundreds of billions of transactions have been more than 3,200 times that year, making "Black Friday" out of reach.
With the wind sky cat "double 11" promotion, there are also a large number of electricity merchants, among which "Jingdong" is the strongest.
"Jingdong" has its own shopping festival "6.18," but no "double 11" impact, this year from November 1 to 11, "Jingdong" cumulative sales reached 127.1 billion yuan.
And "double 11" was followed by a similar "double 12" discount binge, Christmas New year shopping stalls.
Across the New year, waiting for Chinese consumers are the annual shopping stalls before the Spring Festival, Valentine's Day shopping stalls, consumption, will not be a holiday.
The environmental problems brought about by instantaneous mass consumption have attracted the attention of professionals and institutions.
According to a conservative estimate by the usual standard of 0.2 kg per packing box in the industry, at least more than 300,000 tons of garbage were generated during the "double 11" period this year, the Xinhua Daily Telegraph reported.
Liu Hua, Director of the pollution Prevention and control Program at the Greenpeace East Asia division, told the Chinese-foreign dialogue that orders for "double 11" cats alone would generate 160,000 tons of packaging waste this year.
The national Post office had issued a report in 2016 stating that there were about 780 million express items during the 2015 "double 11" period (November 11-16), using more than 3 billion woven bags, 9,922 billion packing boxes, 16,985 million metres of tape, and that the length of tape could circle the Earth's equator 425 times.
And this year, the National Post Office expects the "double 11" express business volume to exceed 1.5 billion units.
Wang Shi, manager of a garbage incineration centre in Beijing, told Xinhua that more than 2,000 tons of garbage came in every Day after "double 11", which also exceeded the treatment capacity of the incineration station.
Express delivery companies have realized that the environmental pollution caused by the express industry cannot be underestimated.
Before "double 11", some electric logistics companies, including Suning, have introduced recyclable plastic express boxes, recycled packaging bags that can be reused as shopping bags and garbage bags, etc., but the acceptance of troublesome consumers is not high.
Ma also called on the logistics industry to support "green packaging" and "green logistics" in Weibo.
The tweet reaped more than 68,000 "praise."
What kind of mobile payment do Germans want?
Zhang Dongfang: The opening of the mobile payment war in Germany is not expected.
Microcredit payment and PayPal have only moved the battlefield to Europe, the competitors have not changed, the grabbing positions have not changed - Chinese, this is also global?
Where there is a PayPal, there must be a microletter payment.
Under an agreement with Wirecard, the German electronic payment provider, Microcredit officially began landing in Germany in November and is gradually being laid out in businesses across Europe.
This exotic reunion of the two "old folks" took place in Europe.
All the while, PayPal and microletter payments have been singing all the way down the road of globalization.
For China's approach to the globalization of Mobile payments, the "China third Party Mobile payment Industry Research report 2017" is summarized in two ways: First, through strategic investment, experience export, equity participation and support of foreign local Mobile payment enterprises.
The second is to promote mobile payment services to foreign merchants through the consumption behavior of Chinese tourists abroad, thus changing the recognition and acceptance of Chinese mobile payments in foreign countries.
Indeed, the Chinese get the world.
China's rapid economic growth, coupled with a large population base, makes the spending of Chinese tourists in Europe an attractive figure.
But it is also doomed, this time in Germany to open the China Mobile payment war is not expected.
Microcredit payment and PayPal have simply moved the battlefield to Europe, the competitors have not changed, the position of grabbing remains the same - or the Chinese, which is also global?
A more groundbreaking discussion is whether China's mobile payments can open up territory in Europe?
Consider Germany.
The enchanted "New Retail"
Chen Lei and Yang Kaihan: Amazon's announcement of its foray into bookstores and grocery stores as it pushes into the world's top 10 retailers is well worth playing with, both in terms of timing and motivation.
In November 2015, Amazon opened a physical bookstore in Seattle, followed by two bookstores in Portland and San Diego.
Amazon opened stores in New York at the start of 2017 and plans to have at least eight stores by the end of the year.
Around the same time, Amazon announced that its Amazon go was operating on a trial basis, that customers would not have to queue or checkout to get to the store, that it would be enough to come in and sweep the code and take the desired item away, and that the amount of shopping would be automatically deducted from the customer's Amazon account.
In the case of Amazon, the sudden movement on top of brick-and-mortar stores in recent years has been a great surprise.
Because in his "open letter to shareholders" back in 2007, CEO Jeff Bezos stressed that Amazon will not easily open a brick-and-mortar store unless the following four conditions are met at the same time:
1. We must be confident that this new opportunity will give shareholders a return on their investment;
2. We must be convinced that this new opportunity is of great significance to the company as a whole;
3. We must be convinced that this new opportunity is being ignored by the market;
4. We must be sure that in this market we have sufficient resources to make customer-oriented differentiation.
Bookstores and grocery stores, the most shaky categories of both brick-and-mortar retail, were the first rivals to fall after the rise of Amazon.
Amazon's announcement of its foray into these two brick-and-mortar markets as it pushes into the world's top 10 retailers is well worth playing with, both in terms of timing and motivation.
Does Amazon's approach run counter to the assurances in the shareholder letter?
A similar voice was heard at the other end of the globe, where Ma Yun, the Chairman of Alibaba's board of directors, delivered a keynote speech at the 2016 Hangzhou cloud habitat Conference on the morning of October 13, 2016.
"From next year, Alibaba will no longer mention the term 'e-commerce'," he said.
The era of pure electricity merchants will soon come to an end, and there will be no e-commerce for the next decade or two, replaced by 'new retail'.
It takes a combination of offline and logistics to generate new retail, "he said.
For a time, the three words "new retail" as if by Magic, by the industry frequently hang in the mouth.
But what exactly does "new retail" mean?
If it only refers to the combination of online and offline, then the concept is not novel.
After tracking 180 of the largest electricity vendors in 2016, eMarketer estimated total sales at about $200 billion, with the largest 25 accounting for more than $15.9 billion.
Of these 25, 18 are traditional retailers that have only started operating online in the past five years (such as Macy's, Nordstrom, Target, Gap, etc.).
And Alibaba Group 28.3 billion yuan to take a stake in Suning cloud merchants, is also in sight.
Globally, retailers and electricity traders are moving from a single channel to a full-channel retail system that covers brick-and-mortar stores, electricity dealers, mobile terminals, and social media.
Is Ma's "new retail" more of a summary than a vision of the future?
If not, what is the difference between the whole channel concept and "new retail"?
Perhaps the crux of the matter is not whether online and offline will merge, but how.
Looking back over the past 20 years in retail, the rise of electricity merchants, like the rise of discount retailers in the early years, has focused on price and convenience.
Relying on these two pain points, the electrician moved highly standardized products, such as books and CDs, from the line down to the line.
With the development of online consumption habits and the continuous improvement of customer experience, electricity traders extended their tentacles to other categories and began to improve efficiency.
In the words of Alibaba CEO Zhang Yong, "use the ideas and technologies of the Internet to overhaul and upgrade the existing total of about 30 trillion social retailers, so that the escalating consumer demand of Chinese consumers can be effectively met, making the entire process of commodity production, circulation, and services more efficient because of the widespread use of the Internet and big data."
Therefore, the electricity quotient's road, is a surface light assets, the actual heavy assets of the road.
"Light" means that the burden of fixed assets, staffing, management processes and so on is not as large as the traditional retail industry; "heavy" refers to the need for huge investment in logistics, warehousing and so on.
The change of the logistics mode ensures the high efficiency of the electricity dealer.
According to the Chinese Government network, Premier Li Keqiang chaired an executive meeting of the State Council on April 28, which considered the expansion of domestic consumer demand to be an important measure to stabilize growth and adjust the structure.
The meeting determined that the departments concerned should urgently come up with concrete plans on the basis of scientific assessment.
For some foreign daily consumer goods with high demand from domestic consumers, a pilot reduction of import tariffs will be launched by the end of this year, gradually expanding the range of tax-reducing commodities;
Combined with the tax reform, improve the consumption tax policy of clothing, cosmetics and other mass consumer goods, and adjust the tax scope, tax rate and collection link in an overall way;
Add and restore entry duty-free shops at ports, reasonably expand duty-free varieties, increase a certain amount of duty-free shopping, and make it easier for domestic consumers to buy foreign products in China;
We will further promote the facilitation of customs clearance and tax rebates for overseas passengers and strictly implement the requirements for voluntary declaration and tax payment of imported goods in accordance with the law.
To formulate inspection and quarantine policies to support the import of cross-border electricity traders and clean up unreasonable fees at the import link;
Accelerate the promotion of Chinese product brand upgrading project, support the development of brick-and-mortar stores, achieve online and offline interaction.
Regulate the market order, strictly fight fake and shoddy, promote superiority and inferiority.
So that consumers can be near comfortable, convenient shopping.

On January 18, Alibaba held a summit dialogue on the eradication of Poverty in Chongqing, announcing that it would help promote accurate Poverty eradication and rural revitalization by exploring a new model of "Internet + Poverty eradication".
This is after the introduction of the Rural strategy, the launch of the Rural Taobao project, the online agricultural Poverty alleviation platform, the establishment of the Alibaba Poverty eradication Fund, Ali once again "added" to the fight against Poverty.
The fight against poverty is one of China's most important national strategies today.
Total poverty eradication has never been achieved in China in the past few thousand years.
"Electric business Poverty alleviation is a new round of innovative measures for Poverty alleviation and development. It is an important hand in achieving precise Poverty alleviation and accurate Poverty eradication.
The Central Government attaches great importance to and points out that it can give play to the role of the Internet in helping to lift people out of poverty, promote accurate poverty alleviation and accurate poverty eradication, and get agricultural products out of the countryside through the Internet. "
As a result, Ali proposed a rural strategy as early as 2014, alongside big data cloud computing and globalization as Ali's three core strategies for the next 20 years.
In the same year, Ali launched the Rural Taobao (village panning) project to recruit "village sophomore" in the countryside to lead farmers out of poverty and get rich through electricity traders.
In 2017, Ali worked with business departments to create a pro-agriculture poverty channel, which is now connected to a total of 13 provinces and 120 state-level poor counties.
The village of Taobao, spawned by the Ali platform, already has 2,118.
Of these, nearly 400 appeared in provincial poor counties and 33 in 13 national poor counties.
In 2017, national Taobao village sales reached 120 billion yuan on Alibaba's Chinese retail platform.
In the face of a national strategy to fight poverty, Ali has been thinking about how to use the innovative capabilities of Ali's economy, such as technology, big data and cloud computing, to make a new way out of poverty, Mr Zhang said.
Among them, the village Amoy is the main carrying platform for Ali's electricity traders to lift themselves out of poverty, and went through a new Internet link for direct sales to lift themselves out of poverty.
In the planting link, village Amoy and Ant gold clothing jointly carry out agricultural tools and small loan support.
In 2017, Ant gold suits served 795 of the 832 state-level poor counties, providing them with convenient payment, credit and other Services.
Rookie solves warehousing and logistics, Sky Cat is in charge of sales, and Ali Yun's big data feeding guides agricultural production, further improving the supply standards, quality and market competitiveness of agricultural products.
The development of the electricity business out of poverty requires not only products, sales channels, industrial planning, but also talent.
By offering electricity business courses at Taobao University to teach farmers Standardization, quality and scale planting methods, Ali achieved a combination of "Poverty alleviation + helping the mind" to enable farmers to lift themselves out of Poverty on a sustainable basis.
These courses already cover about 92% of the poor counties at the national level.
And the idea of "public welfare mentality, business means" can also guarantee Ali to achieve "real poverty alleviation" in poverty alleviation.
Ma Yun, Chairman of Alibaba's board of directors, has said that poverty eradication should be divided into three stages: Poverty alleviation, poverty eradication and enrichment.
To alleviate poverty is to give people fish, to get out of poverty is to give people fishing, to get rich is to build a "fish pond" for farmers to have fish to raise.
Electricity-driven industry poverty alleviation, is the construction of fish ponds.
In terms of industrial poverty alleviation, the poverty alleviation model of the Luochuan Apple industry, created by Ali in cooperation with Luochuan, Shaanxi Province, has been replicated throughout the country as an example by the relevant departments.
Ali electricity business poverty alleviation work has also been recognized at the decision-making level.
Electric business enterprises, represented by Alibaba, have been sent to ensure that farmers increase production and income through online and offline channels.
Some village sophomore and Ant gold suit employees have also been invited to the United Nations and Africa to share the experience of electricity traders out of poverty.
At present, the China office of the United Nations World Food Programme has worked with the village to alleviate poverty in the electricity industry in Anhui and other places.
The "third Congress of the New Economic think Tank", co-organized by the Ali Research Institute and the China Vision think Tam, was held on January 16. Zhang Li, Director of the electricity Research Institute of the Ministry of Commerce, attended and made a statement.
She believes that our globalization actually ignores the most important issues, the question of the body and use of globalization, as well as the stage of globalization.
In this way, many people believe that globalization has stalled and that many developed and developing countries, in the new phase, have different attitudes towards globalization and different models.
The second concept is the question of the medium-term phase of globalization. What are the constraints on the medium-term phase of globalization?
Constrained by the basis of the economic environment, it is precisely because of changes in the economic base that globalization has taken place.
Zhang Li believes that the global economic adjustment is largely over at the end of 2017 and will enter a new period of growth after 2018, and that the next round of growth must be driven by raw products.
Beijing East's first fresh supermarket, 7 fresh, has officially opened recently, with plans to lay more than 1,000 stores across the country over the next three to five years.
With the addition of Ali's box Ma Xiansheng, Yonghui's superspecies, Suning's Su Xiansheng, the American regiment's paw fish, etc., "new retail stores" began to pile up and "call each other" on innovative models and even prices.
The escalation of the battle for fresh supermarkets has become a phenomenal topic in the new retail field. Where exactly is the new retail?
"We will enter the country quickly in 2018, and morning stores will be opened in Beijing, Shanghai and Hangzhou before the Spring Festival."
Box Ma Xiansheng CEO Hou Yi revealed the "New way to play" in 2018 at the second New Retail Summit on the 10th.
"Starting in 2018, the box horse is not just a fresh electricity dealer, but a life class electrician who meets the immediate service of consumers.
Below the core mode line is the drainage, the experience, and on the line is the real sale, "he said.
Different from the traditional big stores, supermarkets, box Ma Xiansheng is a fun and delicious "net red shop" in the eyes of many consumers, and even an intermediary has hit out the concept of "box area house".
On-line power business platforms and offline retailers have their own advantages and disadvantages, but consumers appear in a variety of channels, so both sides are experimenting with the full-channel model.
The industry believes that, in the broader context of the consumption upgrade, there will be more and more "box horse" stores in 2018.
And the box horse continues to explore from the initial fresh to more areas of consumption, heralding that in the new year, there will be more innovation in the retail market.
"For example, the online integration of the business model, has attracted the attention of consumers, the opening of fresh supermarkets in all parts of the call and good."
"But no matter how much these relationships are said, it doesn't work, and in the end it comes down to the fact that you don't bring a good experience to the consumer, and I'm willing to pay for it when I experience it."
In the new retail environment, consumer habits have changed and the demand for purchases has changed, according to Yuan Bing, co-CEO of Da Runfa Buffalo Network.
The original pure line, below the line is divided, under the line to beat the line, the line to counter-attack under the line, is now hand in hand, because consumers no longer have the distinction under the line.
The scramble to enter the capital, so that the current fresh supermarket as a representative of the new retail fire full.
According to the analysis, at present, the competition of new retail in first-tier cities is far from the pattern of the Red Sea, and there are still large areas of second-tier cities to be excavated, and there is still a lot of opportunity and space in the market.
Different types of industries for the layout of new retail, will bring the development of new retail into a diversified state of development.
CCTV financial channel in conjunction with the Institute of Financial Strategy of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, combed a dry goods, is this heavy annual development report of the Chinese electricity business.

Help you avoid the company becoming the next best start-up
Amy Elrett once wanted to survey employee happiness at her e-commerce start-up, but the survey didn't help.
The responses received are often vague, unhelpful and, even worse, deceptive.
Even if she promises anonymity, some employees still don't trust the process.
Elrett, who manages Madison Reed, a 75-person e-commerce hair care company in San Francisco, said there was "a lack of consistency and objectivity in the responses received."
So she called for help.
A slew of new human resources start-ups have sprung up to help companies understand how their employees feel.
They build and authorize software specifically designed to measure employee participation, allowing companies to quickly poll specific teams and population groups, provide employees with anonymous and complaint hotlines, and, in some cases, allow whistle-blowers to bypass executives to report directly to the board.
"Now, you can track your health with tools such as Strava and Fitbit, but where is the company's Fitbit?" Says Jim Barnett, co-founder and chief executive of Redwood City startup Glint, which is used by companies to measure employee professionalism.
Within three years, Elrett says, she used Glint to gain more insight into what employees think and feel.
In addition to quick surveys and opinion polls by specific teams, Glint provides a heat map of the company, which units complain the most and which managers have low approval scores - which gives her an insight into why.
Companies are beginning to realize that they must master the company's workplace culture so as not to be the next best step, which is mired in scandal after the former employee published a blog post describing the harassment environment and the speakers were punished by the company.
For start-ups like Glint, the company's desire for oversight is a lucrative business opportunity.
According to the financial technology analysis website Let 's Talk Payments, the global governance, regulatory and compliance industry is likely to be worth more than $1187 billion by 2020.
Convercent, a start-up in Denver, Colorado, which works to help companies prevent and detect bad behavior, saw an increase in interest and activity during the damage to its reputation earlier this year.
Convercent has nearly 600 customers, including love Peter, Microsoft and Tesla.
Good step recently signed up as a customer.
Like Glint, Convercent allows companies to send customized "diagnostic" surveys, collect confidential responses in real time and view heat maps of their problem areas.
Convercent also offers an anonymous text message hotline for employees to report bad behavior.
If the chairman is implicated, then the complaint will go straight to the board.
"The court of public opinion has usurped the powers of the regulator," said Patrick Quinlan, founder and chief executive of Convercent.
If a company is found to be treating its employees badly or behaving unethically, even if regulators don't step in, the company could face the high consequences of consumer resistance, staff loss and involvement in litigation, Mr Quinlan said.
Ruby Tuesday, a catering chain that spans more than 500 places and has more than 25,000 employees, has used Convercent for more than a year to ensure that employees understand work guidelines and work protocols and provide an easy way to contact the company's headquarters.
Until then, if employees want to report a problem, they must find the company's head office phone number or email, file a formal complaint and hope that the head office will take it seriously.
It's often a daunting and unsettling experience, says James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesday's general counsel, who doesn't think there's a good way to track employees' complaints.
But now that the company uses Convercent, it can more quickly detect and address issues - such as discrimination, harassment, or unfair wage practices - that were previously unknown to executives located in remote offices, cities, or states.
"I can get a closer, 360-degree overview of the work experience," said Vitrano, who runs the Ruby Tuesday risk management team.
"We are protecting our shareholders from employment litigation."
Mr Quinlan said companies had placed greater emphasis on ethics, values and employee professionalism since 2002, following the collapse of the Andorran accounting firm as a result of the Enron scandal.
But it wasn't until "social media went into their own world" that companies realised they couldn't stop their blasts from spreading the virus online.
"Until technology is used to monitor ethics, people see hope as a strategy," he said.
Both Glint and Convercent provide their software as a service and charge companies recurrent fees for the use of their products.
This business model and business opportunities are supported by venture investors who already support the two start-ups.
In February, Convercent raised $10 million from companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, and its total Capital rose to $47 million.
In November, Glint received $10 million from Bessemer Venture Partners, for a total of $60 million.
Given the interconnectedness of companies, culture and venture capital, these investments will hardly come as a surprise.
A growing body of research shows that today's employees have higher expectations of the workplace than before.
In a competitive market like Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are just bets.
Employees want to feel that they are accepted, valued, and that their time is spent with a company with a positive mission.
"When people are happy to join the company and feel that their voices are being heard and the work they do is beneficial, they are more committed to making the company a success," said Nina McCartney, vice president of global welfare and employee experience at LinkedIn, which uses both Convercent and Glint.
Investors achieve returns when their portfolio companies do well; companies do well when their employees are loyal and dedicated.
If third-party analysis tools promise to increase the loyalty and professionalism of their employees, it is not surprising that they will look for financial support.
Workplace culture experts say it is important to have data on employee professionalism.
But the data are useless unless the company's administrators take action.
In fact, if a company asks employees for feedback, it can be expected to be making changes.
If change is not moving fast enough, or if there is not a modicum of progress, it can lead to disappointment and cause employees to leave the company.
"If you want to seek 4,000 pieces of advice, then you need to be ready to have 4,000 conversations," said Russell Rath, head of consulting at business management firm Cotter International, who has seen the mistakes of some companies relying too heavily on data acquisition.
'Because if it doesn't follow up all the way through, employees will think, 'did you really hear what I said?
Do you care?
If you don't care, why should I care? '"
Mr Elrett said Madison Reed, which now conducts a monthly staff survey, had been able to take action on the day Glint reported the problem.
After collecting feedback from employees that they were frustrated by the speed of decision-making and the quality of communication, she was able to solve the problem by reorganizing the company's internal team and increasing communication training.
Ruby Tuesday is gaining new insights into its employees and, in the long run, they want to be able to make a shift to better retain staff in an industry known for its high turnover rates.
"If you're not committed to creating a culture of transparency, you're going to lose talent," Vitrano said.
"If you lose talent, you will lose customers.
And when you lose customers, you're going to lose the company, "he said.

The NCAA cancelled training twice a day and extended the bears' training time during the day
It was close to 11 p.m., and members of the UCLA football team lingered and chatted next to the team's new campus practice field.
Some players have taken off their sweatshirts to reveal their sweaty bodies after a hard day of training at the camp.
For a large part of the team, this free few minutes is a break.
Players taking the summer course will return to the dorm to prepare for the final exam after three hours of practice, and then return to the Wasserman Football Center for the meeting at 6: 30 a.m. on the second day.
"The next three days are a grind for these guys," bears coach Jim Mora said as he headed into Tuesday on Monday.
The NCAA cancelled two exercises a day (designed to ease the burden on players), but actually extended their training during the day - at least until the end of Friday.
That's why UCLA's first three training sessions are scheduled to begin at 7: 15 p.m. to accommodate the already crowded schedule of players.
From cancelling training twice a day to training more once a day, the bears began training almost a week before last season, and Mora trained at summer school for the first time in six seasons at Westwood.
They plan to start 18 training sessions in eight months and 20 days before they begin to prepare for the official race against Texas farm workers in the ninth month.
Mora said he supported the NCAA's rule tweaks, although it would have added another item to the player's busy itinerary.
"In three or four days, we'll put a huge amount of training on them, very challenging," Mora said.
'They've just passed, too. They're honing, they're all great kids.
I think about Saturday and we'll have more time and it's really great. '
As soon as the camp is over, UCLA will stop training. This is not an easy task, given the adjacent parking lot and the clear view of the Luskin Center, which has been bruised by football thrown through the protective net behind the goal post.
The bears players will be staying at the hotel starting this weekend, but Mora admits there could be problems once the rooms are vacant during the season.
"We'll take security measures," Mora said.
"This is a real concern, and the idea that someone might rent a room and sit in a room and record training scenes is not far-fetched.
If you have a training tape, it's pretty good, too.
But we will take security measures there, and we will take security measures in parking lot 8.
We will make the best use of available resources.
I wouldn't worry too much about that.
We've got a plan in place. '
Home values across Australia rose by an average of 1.5 per cent to 2 per cent in the second quarter of this year, an annual increase of 3.5 per cent, the lowest annual increase since March 2013, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS).
Just as estate agents are looking to sell more properties during the festive season, Aussie House price growth has hit its lowest level since 2013.
It House reported in the morning that the Wall Street Journal news said at & T had canceled plans to sell Huawei's new flagship smartphone in the United States.
Huawei had planned to announce the partnership on CES this week, and at & T canceled it at the last minute.
In response to this situation, Huawei said on January 9 that on January 9 local time, Huawei will release new products and specific listing information to the US market.
Huawei said it had proved its strength over the past five years by launching high-end products in the global and US markets.
According to previous reports by it House, Huawei will unveil a "best phone you've never heard of" at the CES show in Las Vegas on the afternoon of January 9, and the phone's renewal capacity can support two days of use.
The industry generally believes that Huawei's upcoming flagship phone is Huawei Mate 10 Pro, which carries the Android Oreo system.

Feng Xiaogang said he took the work as a debut, learned how to make a circular picture with the photographer, and even spent hundreds of thousands of yuan for the photographer to make a 10-minute test film.
Facebook will launch a fact-checking feature to crack down on fake news
Facebook, the world's largest online social network trying to crack down on so-called fake news, announced on Thursday that it would send more potential prank articles to third-party testing agencies and display the results below the original post.
Face books will start using updated machines to learn to detect possible pranks and send them to fact-checkers, and may display fact-checking results below the original post, the company said in a statement on its website.
The Facebook has been criticized as one of the main points of transmission of so-called fake news, and many believe it influenced the 2016 U.S. presidential election.
The issue has also become a major political topic in Europe, with voters facing a flood of false stories in the run-up to France's presidential election in May, and Germany taking the lead in passing support for a fine scheme ahead of September's election, with fines if social media networks fail to remove hate posts in time.
The Facebook said in a separate statement in Germany on Thursday that a new fact-checking function test was being launched in the United States, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
"In addition to seeing which stories are being questioned by third-party fact-checkers, people want more context to help them make informed decisions about what they read and share," Sarah sue, Facebook news feed product manager, said in a blog.
She added that Facebook would continue to test its "related articles" feature and make other changes to its news feed to reduce fake news.
Creating a drawing novel: The story of the Castle of England
More recently, the tiny Skotney Castle was featured in a compressed version of the music film and at one point became a refuge for Lady Margaret Thatcher during the 70s and 80s.
But Skotney, who has witnessed 700 years of tumultuous history in the comfort of the Belle River Canyon in Kent, is now the inspiration for a graphic novel written by Jamie Rhodes, a Yorkshire man with a special interest in historical documents and a mop head.
"I can see the handwriting of the ancients 300 years ago, and I find it so beautiful," he said wistfully.
"What kind of human fate is this to have this letter in my hands."
Across the Middle ages until the time of Edward, the reading of "an England Castle" recorded the families living in Skotney, each story by different, future British artists such as Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer, and Isabel Greenberg.
This is not a book by Rhodes that uses archives as a raw material: He also wrote "the teeth and other stories of the Dead in 2014," a book inspired by the literature of the British Library, a work he completed with an uncontrollable creative passion.
"I couldn't contain my urge to write from the moment I saw the thumbprint left on the side of the letter, written by a double agent who worked for the Jacobites in the 18th century," he said.
"That's his fingerprint!
And the letters have always smelled of smoke, because at that point, you need to light a fire to have light.
For us 300 years later, the smell makes it feel like they're there for us, too.
Oh, I like archival literature! "
For those who were struck by the old paper, it seemed so great to have the support of England's National Trust and Arts Council and to have lived in the Castle for nearly four months ("to be honest, I've been around for a bit of a long time") that I just couldn't believe it was serious.
Rhodes spent days visiting Victoria's "new" Castle, going through the archives, studying many of the estate's treasures and antiques, such as the heads of hyenas hanging on the walls, and bottles that had spent centuries in the moat.
He strolled through the land and ruins of the old castle, chatting with rangers, gardeners and sometimes with the artists who illustrated his books.
Then in the evening, he would "drink some whisky and write."
Skotney's secretive history is not yet clear, because the "National Trust" entered fully only after the death of its last heir, Elizabeth Hersey, in 2006.
It was only ten years later, when Rhodes arrived, that staff began to process the files, which he described as "hundreds of years ago the Lords were going:" Oh, put it in the attic '. "
Diaries, letters from the days of the British empire, maps of the territories of various countries: "You would think a land dispute would be boring," Rhodes said, "but there would be two families fighting over a birch tree.
Let it go, guys! '
Some of the stories in the work take the Castle as a starting point and move on to a broader study of British history, including "the laborer," which leads to a man who left the new Castle to take part in the peasant uprising of 1381.
"The story in the book called" the Knight families of Kent and Sussex "documents a riot in the Castle in 1380," Rhodes said.
"The peasant uprising began in that area, and I thought it was a good place to start it.
Perhaps there is a correlation between the two? "
Other stories are deeply rooted in the history of the castle, such as "the Priest," which tells the story of the Darrell family hiding a Jesuit Priest for seven years during the British Reformation.
Or "the Smuggler," which is owned by 18th-century Smuggler Arthur Darrell, who is thought to have given himself a funeral by filling his coffin with stones (his coffin was exposed to the ground years later before it was discovered).
"The Darrells" is Rhodes' favorite Skotney Castle family: "These gentlemen seem to be rogue, always borrowing money and paying for things they can't afford.
Generation after generation of Darrell men solve their debt problems by marrying rich old women, and I think they should be a bunch of handsome lads who know how to go after women, "he said.
As his mission in the Castle came to an end, Rhodes began to look for other exotic writing experiences.
He spent two weeks in the wilderness of Finland completing a drawing novel on "El?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
But Skotney has a special place for him.
"I was devastated to leave," he said.
"It's like: 'Oh, I have to face the real life of the trough cake.'"

The big energy companies are all "rich to the enemy", so which of the many energy companies around the world makes the most of the money?
Yesterday, the famous PFC Energy company published a ranking of the Top 50 listed Energy companies in 2011, with US oil and gas producer ExxonMobil winning the title with a market value of $406.3bn, followed by PetroChina and Royal Dutch Shell.
In the PFC list, PetroChina won twice in 2007 and 2009, with ExxonMobil taking the top spot in all other years.
In the Top 50 list in 2011, a total of three companies from mainland China were shortlisted, in addition to PetroChina, which ranked second, Sinopec, which ranked ninth, and PetroChina, which ranked 15th.
According to the PFC, however, although current oil prices are far higher than they were four years ago, the CEO of PFC Energy points out that there are a number of reasons for the low total market capitalisation, including mainly lower gas prices in North America and low activity in global stock markets.
The heavily polluted weather in Beijing Jin-Ji and surrounding areas, which began on the 16th, was further intensified by the 19th, and an "explosive watch" appeared in AQI in the Hebei cities of Shijiazhuang, Xinji and Handan, Xinhua reported.
US changes to Green Card rules
The United States will roll out a new immigration program and change the Green Card rules, the media said, citing President Donald Trump's remarks.
The plan aims to reduce legal immigration to 50,000 a year, with tighter restrictions on temporary work visas and family-oriented visa applications.
The new rules were proposed by Republicans and supported by the president.
The draft law will be discussed in both houses.
US media quoted Trump as saying, "this law will reduce poverty, raise wages, save taxpayers tens of millions of dollars, and achieve these benefits by changing the way the United States issues Green Cards to citizens of other countries."
The law would replace the current programme and reduce chain migration.
This new application process benefits applicants who speak English, have financial support and have skills conducive to economic development, "he said.
On May 29, the first China fireworks Safety and Environmental Protection Expo will be held in Liuyang.

And bringing up the upcoming 2017, Zhao Lei confessed: "After finishing the tour next year, I want to clear myself and then settle down and write more new works."
In order to optimize the scenic spot environment and build a beautiful Nanyue, recently, the "636" voluntary service brigade of the South Yue District Tobacco Bureau (Branch) launched the environmental protection activity of "Mountaineering to protect the forest and care for the Homeland".
The activities not only received the support of all the cadres and staff of the District Tobacco Bureau, but also attracted retired old cadres and workers' families to participate in environmental protection practices. The three generations of old and young people worked together to protect the forests and clean up the garbage, so as to contribute their share to the construction of "Beautiful Nanyue".
This voluntary service activity aims to protect the landscape resources of Nanyue and promote the concept of "caring for others, caring for society and caring for nature". It also allows the next generation to receive education from an early age and pass on the virtues of voluntary service.
It is reported that since its establishment at the beginning of this year, the "636" voluntary Service brigade has developed a total of 16 members. It has carried out a series of voluntary service activities such as visiting disabled retail customers, helping tobacco farmers care for tobacco leaves and Ya'an earthquake love donations, becoming a volunteer force dedicated to delivering positive energy.

Sex robots are indeed on the rise, but we should be cautious
Just when you don't think 2017 will be any more bizarre, a new technology development report has been released in the field of sex robotics.
Yes it is.
Sex robots are a big deal now.
Recently, the responsible Robotics Foundation (FRR) released a report looking ahead to the development of sex robots over the next five to 10 years.
We need to start taking the rise of sex robots seriously, according to Noel Sharkey, emeritus professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of FRR.
Customers can choose the robot's eye color, nipple shape and nail type.
"People are laughing behind their backs, but companies do launch a lot of sex robots, and we'll see more," Sharkey said at the time of the new report.
Modern sex dolls have evolved from inflatable dolls to robots, which have silicone skin, are warm to touch, and have made a point of using artificial intelligence to set up a human-like sexual response.
Users can also "customize" their robots to suit their preferences, ranging from eye color, nipple shape to nail type or color.
But even more disturbing is the fact that many robots with a "personality" will make "replicating a petite wife" look advanced.
Modern sex toys have evolved into robots with silicone skin.
Realbotix robots, for example, are able to come from definitions based on characteristics that users find attractive, such as shyness.
There is also the Roxxy Gold sex robot, developed by True Companion, which can pre-set personality traits, including a slightly sheepish "chilly Farah" and a "Wild Wendy" who is "adventurous."
"The Roxxy Gold robot has a personality that is as commensurate with you as possible," the True Companion website relishes.
So she loves what you love and hates what you hate.
She also has the same little emotions as normal people in those days!
She can be lazy, she can be talkative, or she can be 'sexually ambitious!'
The rise of sex robots brings a lot of uneasiness - not just a substitute for real human relationships - and the subservient femininity and the suggestion of rape twitching on the cold (read: Resist) Farah are the most worrying.
On its website, True Companion compares Roxxxy to a man's vibrating stick.
"If a woman has a vibrator, then why can't a man have Roxxxy?" The site says.
Yet these sex robots are not a mere love object, nor are they just a sex toy.
Their emergence and growing maturity point to the darker, deeper part of our culture: The escape from perfect gender equality to sex with submission as an additional option.
Of course, most men don't have sex robots, and while the FRR points out that sex robots are becoming more popular, they are still on the fringes of consumer culture.
But what seeps through the edges allows us to see the course of the era in which we live.
A lot of people weren't weird or aggressive until the free market gave them a chance to become so.
It is no coincidence that these elaborate sex robots come at a time when the rights of women around the globe are at stake, and that the White House also has a president boasting about sexual violence against women.
The most frightening part of the TV series "the story of the maid" lies not in the realistic picture, not in the hanging body, not in the gouged eyes, but in the overly real imagination.
The Republic of Gilead was a jump, but now it doesn't look far away.
The goal behind these sex robots is to do what is technically possible to create the body most similar to that of a real woman (albeit in proportion to a porn star).
The creators of these robots want them to have a human touch and mimic real human movements.
But to put it bluntly, their "personalities" are not representative of real women.
They can't break up or run away.
They have no recourse or follow-up story, no independence at all, and nothing that could break the illusion of total slavery.
In other words, they are spice slaves.
Or in the popular parlance of 2017: Maids.
"The Great Wall" tells the story of an elite Chinese force engaged in a life-and-death battle with monster gluttony on the world-famous Great Wall to defend humanity in ancient times.
The last issue of the four seasons has been recorded, and Deng Chao, the captain of the running Men's Regiment, gave a microletter interview to the Shenyang Evening News and Shenyang net reporter on May 30, from "learning bully" in "running male" to "hilarious Villain" in "Villain Angel" to "Decadent male" Chen Mer, Deng Chao gave the audience the impression of "Baixingjun", constantly changing.
"When it comes to acting, I'm not going to do the same thing, keep it up to date," Mr Deng said.
Trump's great exploits?
Let Mitt Romney be the epitome of common sense
It is no surprise to the Trump era that political divisions have polarized American voters and, from a micro point of view, have undermined American family harmony.
Around Christmas and Thanksgiving, major newspapers in the United States were filled with opinion columns about how to respond to the fear of voting for Trump's relatives.
It is often assumed that we are doing everything we can to puncture our "filter bubble."
Even less vocal is the power of Trump to bring his family together.
I mention this because my cousin, a left-wing poet living in Chicago who has long been at odds with the Republicans in our family, is coming to visit me in New York this week.
She reminded me that uniting against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.
By working with Trump in the White House, everyone she knows, even relatives of Republicans who have been engaged in political bickering for decades, is now suddenly and strangely on the same front.
It's certainly a good thing if it's all at the dinner table, but it's shocking to me that, from a broader perspective, it raises significant risks.
While leftist figures have always been abetted by Trump, the warping effect of his presidency has pushed us all to the right.
When we talk about "normalisation" and Trump, we are referring to the possibility of concern that his outlandish behavior may one day stop.
There is a more worrying long-term scenario, however, in which what Trump wants to "normalize" is relations with right-wing Republicans who had previously opposed Mr. president's standards and now suddenly look like a symbol of reason.
I find myself recently somewhat nostalgic for the Mitt Romney version of craziness: Putting the dog on the car, the 14% income tax (but at least we know his tax returns), for the crime of both moves does seem too minor compared to Trump.
After the Trump era has passed, the next Republican candidate will only need to sensibly qualify for immeasurable improvement.
When my cousin lived in the town, we took our kids to the merry-go-round in New York Park, the biggest merry-go-round run by New York's Central Park administration, and these three-dollar tickets are your most consumer value in the city if you don't need coffee.
The sound of the Trojan horse was as loud as thunder, the central cylinder was designed for fiberglass, and all the clowns and animals turned their heads and looked horribly and sinister at their shoulders, while the jingling music sounded strangely.
Too many vulgar cities are disappointing: The landscape overlooks from high-rise buildings has become old-fashioned, the skyline has become too familiar to provide too much stimulation, and the reality of the city has not sustained the dream.
Thirty-five years later, I haven't quite forgotten the day when I discovered that this "Swiss Cottage" was not really a Swiss Cottage, but a "Ye Olde Swiss Cottage" located in the theme bar, I remember, but near a junction in North London.
The merry-go-round in Central Park, however, is still a magical experience, with everyone having a great time for two 2-year-olds, an 11-year-old, and four events open to both girls in their 40s.
If I could evaluate the merry-go-round, I would give it full marks, but thankfully no one asked.
But this week at a Department store, before swiping my credit card, I was asked to rate my trading "experience" on a scale of one to five stars.
The same is true in the coffee shop in the corner of my Street, in addition to the option of scoring with a 15 per cent tip, which is for shopping over the counter.
The effect of this is not only to slow down what is supposed to be a neutral deal, but also to put pressure on waiters to add personal factors to an unwanted scenario.
The poor woman in the department store smiled apologetically, while I was tired, and the credit card trading experience gave her a five-star rating.
Oscar Pistolis transferred from prison to hospital with chest pain
This is the second time Pistolis has left prison and transferred to hospital.
He was taken to hospital last year for treatment for a cut to his wrist, which prison officials said was the result of his fall in his cell.
Pistolis was convicted of murder after prosecutors appealed the original manslaughter ruling.
In the early hours of Valentine's Day 2013, he repeatedly shot Stinkamp through the toilet cubicle door at his home in Pretoria until his death.
Pistolis claimed to have mistaken his girlfriend for the intruder who was hiding in the cubicle at night.
Prosecutors have announced their intention to appeal again, this time for a six-year prison sentence against Pistolis, which they believe is too lenient.
The National Public prosecutor's Office said it would appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa and that the appeal could be heard this year.
If prosecutors win, Pistolis faces an increased sentence of 15 years.
South Africa does not have the death penalty.
Under the financial environment, alcohol and electricity companies in order to achieve a breakthrough, on the one hand tightly grasp upstream resources, on the other hand actively plan their own brand.
Chen Haifeng, a 26-year-old actor in the Wenzhou Yue Troupe, is the only female floral face in the class.
Two Bulgarians have been detained in Greece for illegal Camping
Two Bulgarians have been detained in Greece for illegal camping, bTV said, citing the Foreign Ministry.
On the morning of 8 months and 1 day, Sisonia police detained a group of illegal campers, including two Bulgarians.
The detainees were released the same day and the investigation is still ongoing.
Two Bulgarians were subsequently released, the foreign Ministry revealed to bTV.
The Greek authorities have tightened controls on casual camping and will impose hefty fines on anyone who rests in a non-designated campsite.
Inspections will continue for one season.
The foreign office said the court could impose fines on casual campers.
On May 18, the Ministry of Finance promulgated the measures on the Administration of Supplementary funds for the Special Award for structural adjustment of Industrial Enterprises, which will arrange Special award supplementary funds to promote the resolution of overcapacity in the coal and steel industries, for a total amount of 100 billion yuan.
Recently, a number of local governments, including Shanghai, Shanxi, Shandong, Jiangsu and Heilongjiang, have put forward reform proposals on defusing excess capacity.
Among them, many provinces have even proposed to actively seek financial support from the Central treasury for the de-capacity of their provinces.
One supporting evidence is that the coal de-capacity targets announced by just eight provinces stand at 90% of the national plan to cut coal production.

Do meat, dairy products and chocolate help relieve inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)?
Meat and chocolate may sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.
But a new study shows the opposite: A diet rich in meat protein and dairy products can help relieve symptoms in patients with inflammatory bowel disease.
The incurable disease affects the lives of about 1.3 million Americans and about 300,000 British people, leading to stomach cramps and abdominal distension, recurrent or hemorrhagic diarrhoea, weight loss and extreme tiredness.
Researchers at the University of Washington typically advise patients to avoid eating meat and dairy products to ease symptoms, but researchers have found that tryptophan, a key amino acid of the protein, helps boost the growth of immune cells, which boost tolerance in the gut.
Dr Marco Colonna, the lead researcher, explained that immune cells patrol the gut to ensure that harmful microbes hidden in food do not creep into the body.
Maintain a balance between the cells that trigger inflammation and those that enhance tolerance, protecting the body without damaging all types of sensitive and vulnerable tissues.
Inflammatory bowel disease may occur when the equilibrium state is too skewed towards inflammation.
In the experiment, a cell that promotes immunity was found in mice carrying special bacteria.
Bacteria need tryptophan (one of the components of a protein) to form the appearance of cells.
Professor Corona said: 'We have established a link between a population of bacteria (Lactobacillus Roy, which is a normal part of the gut microbiome) and the development of a population of cells that can promote tolerance.
The more tryptophan the mice consumed in their diet, the more immune cells they had.
He suggests that if humans use the same method, a combination of Lactobacillus Lactobacillus and a tryptophan rich diet may create a more tolerant, less inflamed gut environment.
Luisa Cervantes-Barraganwas, a postdoctoral researcher, studied an immune cell that increased tolerance when she found that one group of study mice had such cells, but another group of the same strains were raised separately.
She suspects the difference is related to the community of gut microbes (bacteria, viruses and fungi that usually live in the gastrointestinal tract) in mice.
DNA sequencing of cholesterol in mice revealed that six bacterial populations were present in mice with immune cells, but not in mice without immune cells.
Mice are raised in a sterile environment, so they lack gut microbes and cannot develop such immune cells, which are produced by the presence of Lactobacillus.
To understand how the bacteria affect the immune system, the researchers cultured Lactobacillus in the liquid and then transferred a small amount of the bacteria-free liquid to immature immune cells isolated from the mice.
The immune cell develops into a tolerant cell.
When the active ingredient is purified from the liquid, it can be shown that the active ingredient is a by-product of tryptophan metabolism, known as indole-3-lactic acid.
When the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the mouse feed, the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent, but when tryptophan levels were halved, the number of cells was halved.
'People, like mice, have the same cells that enhance tolerance, and most of us have Lactobacillus in our gastrointestinal tract, 'Dr Cervantes-Barragan explained.
It is not known whether humans can induce the development of tryptophan by-products from Lactobacillus in the body, as in mice in the experiment, but genetic defects associated with tryptophan have been found in patients with inflammatory bowel disease.
She said: 'The development of these cells may be exactly what we want to get because these cells can control the inflammatory response on the inner surface of the gut.
It is imprecise to say that the presence of high levels of tryptophan in Lactobacillus may lead to an increase in the number of the species.
Jose Mourinho believes Manchester United have signed "genius" Nemania Matic
After Nemania Matic made his debut against Sampdoria on Wednesday night, Mourinho decided that Manchester United had signed a "talented" midfielder.
Matic, who is from Chelsea and signed for a whopping £40m, opened 2-1 in the League's final pre-season game ahead of the European Super Cup against Royal Madrid in Dublin on Tuesday, winning the favour of Paul Bogba and Andreas Pereira.
However, on the Bruce pre-season Asian tour, Matic was woefully out of form, completing just 45 minutes, and Mourinho admitted he needed to improve before the start of the Premier League season.
"He needs time, but he has experience, intelligence and a genius way of thinking - - he thinks about football," Mourinho said.
"We'll help him get ready as soon as possible." "
Mourinho began arranging his starting line-up at the start of the season and, like Matic, new signings Viktor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku started the game at the Injiva Stadium.
The Independent reported this week that Mourinho still wants to bring in three more signed players, but he insists the club is "doing a great job" and that he has four first-choice signings in mind and the club has brought in three of them.
"I am very grateful to the club for bringing in three of the contracted players," he added.
'I would have been happier if the club had been able to bring in all four players, but they've worked so hard for me. '
Will China fall behind if it does not build this type of warship at the height of the global frigate?
With the recent announcement of plans by the world's major naval powers to build a new type of frigate, as if the frigate had become the focus of the naval attention of the major powers overnight, first Japan's decision to procure two new frigates in the 2018 defense budget finally led to a substantial breakthrough in the Japanese DEX frigate plan, and then the recent announcement by the United States Lockheed Martin of the latest plan for the United States FFG frigate, where should China's new frigate go?
With the launch of the latest type 054 A frigate in late 2017, marking that the 054 A frigate has built as many as 29, has come close to the sum of the 053 H series of frigates, and the construction of 054 A has been 12 years since the launch of a 054 A in 2006, and even worldwide, the construction of such a large number of high-performance general purpose frigates, with the exception of China, can be compared to the "Perry" class frigates built by the United States in the 1970s and 1980s.
And the reason for building so much 054A is simple: It is affordable, easy to use, plus replenishing years of Naval arrears.
The frigate 054 A has been favored by the Chinese Navy for many years on the basis of better value for money and good fighting power, with a displacement of about 4,000 tons, carrying a 76-millimetre main gun, a 32-unit sea red flag-16 and Fish-8 anti-submarine missile joint launch system, eight Eagle strike 83 and a straight-9 helicopter, although it began construction in 2006 and was designed to be an early ship, but its combat capacity is not too bad even today, and the frigates around the world can reach the upper level.
But this is, after all, a ship designed in the early 2000s, with its weapons configuration on one side, its power systems and electronic radar equipment are far from the current mainstream frigates in the world, and it is time to develop new models when the same type of frigates in Europe are already equipped with full electric propulsion, small multi-function phased array radars, and large-size helicopter decks.
So how China's new frigate should develop is directly related to its future positioning and the strategic approach of our Chinese navy.
The future development of the Chinese Navy is bound to become a blue-water Navy, and the future is also bound to go to the ocean, with rapid deployment in areas where China's vital interests are at stake, a show of force and, if necessary, a strong fighting force to ensure that China's vital interests in the region are not damaged, so it seems that the new Hu Weijiang is bound to move towards large-scale, ocean-going development.
Looking at the positioning of the new frigate in the future Chinese naval sequence, the future Chinese Navy should be similar to the United States Navy. In addition to the necessary offshore defence vessels, other main ships will form carrier battle groups or amphibious Assault ship strike groups as required.
And the role of the new frigate in the future carrier battle group should act as the anti-submarine main force and the middle and near area release position, in the amphibious attack ship strike group should act as an escort ship class, then according to this demand, the new frigate must have a strong anti-submarine capability and a good medium-range area release capability.
Based on the above positioning, it is possible to boldly imagine the general appearance of the domestic frigate in the future.
First, there will be a significant increase in the displacement of water relative to the current type 054 A frigate, and it is estimated that the displacement of the new frigate will reach about 500-6,000 tons; the power system will use an integrated electric propulsion system consisting of a QC 280 modified gas turbine and two diesel engines, with a high speed of about 30 knots, and a large degree of continuity will be increased; as for the weapons configuration 76 mm and 1130 near-anti-gun will be retained, but there will be a 32-48 red flag and 16 additional units behind the main gun.
In this way, the overall level of the new frigate will reach the current first-class level in the world, even when compared with the FFG of the United States.
Of course, the above concept is only the author's conjecture of the new domestic frigate, exactly how we can only wait until the launch of the new frigate, let us look forward to it.

In recent years, our city has encouraged enterprises to actively participate in the construction of national, industry and regional group standards, giving 300,000 yuan to enterprises that mainly or participate in the formulation of standards for manufacturing groups in Zhejiang, and 500,000 yuan to enterprises that have passed the certification of manufacturing brands in Zhejiang, the highest amount of the award in the Province, stimulating enterprises to participate in enthusiasm for the target.
Before the day, Wang Li Group production workshop, the head of the Group's system, Gao Jian, together with employees, is packing an anti-theft safety door seal box as a standard standard working sample for participating manufacturing groups in Zhejiang, ready to be sent to Shaoxing quality testing Center.
Just two days ago, Wang Li has passed the "made in Zhejiang" certification expert group's on-site audit.
Gao Jian said the professional team, composed of industry technical experts and quality certification organizations, praised the Group's achievements in core areas such as quality excellence and independent innovation, and agreed that it fully met the standard. Next, as long as the product passed the inspection, Wang Li would be one of the first enterprises to pass the standard.
Wang Li Group is just a microcosm of the upgrading of the standard pry industry.
Our city simultaneously carries out the Zhejiang manufacturing Group standard standard and the standard work also has the step Yang, the Group ascending Group.
Since the establishment of the Zhejiang manufacturing team standard set by the anti-theft safety door industry in our City last year, Xingyue, Xindo and other enterprises are also actively applying for docking matching work.

China's household debt ratio close to the United States is more frightening than buying a house is unable to pay the debt?
In recent times, everyone has been discussing the recent changes in real estate policy. Is real estate policy going to be loosened again? Will the diversification of the supply of land policy lead to a decline in house prices?
However, at a time when we are worried about real estate prices, about macroeconomic regulation and about the future direction of the real estate market, the people's Daily wrote again. Last time we specifically discussed the tone of the people's Daily commentary on the regulation of real estate, but now the people's Daily is writing about a more serious topic than not being able to afford to buy a house, that is, even if you can afford to buy a house, can you afford the debt?
Today, we come to talk about a more serious problem than buying a house: Loan repayment.
I. China's growing housing debt crisis
In November 2017, the third quarter China deleveraging process report, released by the National Finance and Development Laboratory of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences and the National balance sheet Research Center, noted that the leverage ratio of the residential sector continued its upward trend, rising from 47.4 percent in the second quarter of 2017 to 48.6 percent in the third quarter, an increase of 1.3 percentage points and an increase of 3.8 percentage points in the first three quarters of 2017, according to data in the article published in the overseas Edition of the people's Daily on January 17.
The residential sector accounts for a larger share of debt in the overall real economy, and the leverage ratio is rising faster.
Studies show that Chinese households' liabilities in financial institutions are dominated by consumer loans, accounting for about two thirds of residents' debt, or about twice as much as operating loans.
Among them, among consumer loans, medium- and long-term loans dominated by housing loans accounted for about 80%, but in terms of increment, short-term consumer loans grew faster than medium- and long-term loans.
On top of that, China's household debt ratio only counts the total amount of credit that the household sector receives from financial institutions, while Chinese households have a lot of private borrowing, including borrowing from relatives and friends, with massive hidden debt.
According to statistics from the Suning Institute of Finance, China's resident leverage ratio was only 3% in 1996 and only 18% in 2008, but it has begun to grow rapidly since 2008, doubling to 36.4% in just six years, and reaching 48.6% by the third quarter of 2017.
Let's compare another figure. Last May, HSBC released a survey of nearly tens of thousands of respondents across nine countries.
The report was aimed at the "Jubilee generation" of young people (born between 1980 and 2000) in nine countries.
The report notes that China's home ownership rate for young people after 80 and 90 is as high as 70 per cent, well ahead of Mexico (46 per cent) and twice that of the United States (35 per cent).
These figures tell us one of the most likely problems is that the largest potential "Grey rhino" of Chinese residents at this stage is expected to be unable to pay their debts compared to buying a house.
II. Why is the housing debt crisis the most serious problem?
As we have previously analysed, although we have been saying that Chinese house prices are higher, the rate of home ownership in China is actually quite high compared to other countries in the world, so instead of saying that house prices are high, I'm afraid the question to ask many friends now is do you have to pay for a loan?
We look at the real estate market around the world. China's real estate market, because of its late start, has not had a major real estate crisis except for Hainan, as we said before, but the origin of the worldwide financial tsunami just a decade ago in 2008 was the real estate crisis in the United States.
And the cause of the US housing crisis has been blamed on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
At that time, in the golden age of the United States, real estate companies sold their homes to low-income people in the United States at a very low down payment in order to expand sales, and the housing market was booming at a time when the US economy was good, but not for long, as the US economy stagnated, causing a decline in the income of home buyers, and a large amount of household consumer spending began to fall.
At that time, however, the status quo in the United States was an integral part of American household assets financial and real estate assets, and almost all of the household assets of low-income groups in the United States were real estate, while most of the assets of the top 20% of high-income groups were financial assets, resulting in higher debt ratios in real estate for the poorer people in the United States.
It is a serious fact that these people bought their homes at a better time in the economy, so the money to pay the mortgage is also calculated in terms of their better income. When there is a decline in income, the pressure on the mortgage is not only not reduced or even increased because some subprime schemes have become floating, so the real estate problems of these American families have gradually turned into a real estate crisis.
As a result, some people cannot afford to pay their mortgages because their incomes are too low, so banks begin to take back their properties, and when banks take back their properties from buyers who have defaulted on their loans, they sell them at very low prices, leading to a gradual decline in house prices in the region. This process has triggered a further decline in house prices, creating a vicious circle. When house prices fall to a certain extent, more and more buyers find that the value of their homes is even lower than their loans, so more people stop continuing to pay their mortgages, causing more bad debts.
As a result, a huge vicious circle is formed:
"The economy is in a slump - a decline in income - some people can't afford to pay their mortgages - banks are selling people's homes at low prices - House prices are falling - more people stop paying their mortgages - banks are selling again - House prices are falling again..."
And the problem is more than that, because house prices continue to fall, it's not that you don't have debt after you stop lending your home to the bank, if the money you get from the bank auction doesn't pay back the loan you owe to the bank, then you still need to pay it back, in a nutshell if you use a down payment of 600,000 and a loan of 2.4 million to buy a home worth 3 million at the time, when the house price falls to the value of only 2 million, you don't pay back the house to the bank, after the auction of the house, you not only lose your own down payment of 600,000, you still owe 400,000 to the bank.
So, in one vicious circle after another, the US economy gradually collapsed, eventually triggering the US financial crisis of 2008.
Therefore, the fact that China's household debt ratio has reached a high of 46.8% at this stage is a matter of great vigilance. This figure is still lower than that of developed countries, but the beginning of the problem has begun to emerge. The country has repeatedly emphasized the issue of deleveraging since last year, which is a very prescient judgment. If the household debt ratio is allowed to continue to rise, it is bound to give rise to great risks, so guard against the emergence of financial risks.
So after the house is used to live, not to fire the positioning, the state is faster to establish multi-agent supply, multi-channel security, rent and purchase and other multiple measures to further defuse potential risks.
For our individual families, we must abandon real estate speculative thinking, buy a house when we can, to avoid their own families into a huge burden, only a reasonable assessment of their own income and debt levels is a healthy path to the development of family wealth.

White House props cost thousands
According to military records released by time magazine, last month the White House decided to ship a Marine helicopter to the South Lawn to highlight the great glory of American manufacturing, at a cost of up to $24,000.
The green-and-white Sikorsky VH-3D (also known as Marine one at the time of the President's ride) is an important exhibit on the White House's seven-month, 17-day campaign to highlight construction projects in the United States.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and senior White House officials toured manufactured products from all 50 States.
Among the exhibits are helicopters made in Connecticut, a yacht in Maine, a fire truck in Wisconsin and a forklift in Mississippi.
The White House military Office asked the helicopter to show up by daily order (FRAGO), just 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn for the "special" event, according to records from the force Marine helicopter's first flight team (HMX-1), which operates the helicopter.
The day before the event, commander HMX-1 said in an email to his superior Marine Corps flight Deputy commander that "I just want to make sure you know because this event is highly valued."
The information indicated that the helicopter would arrive on the South Lawn at approximately 7 a.m. on 7 months and 17 days for the 3 p.m. event, leaving only after the Lawn had been emptied from 6 to 9 p.m. on the same day.
The message also said that in the event of a delay in departure from the White House, the return flight would require a second crew because of duty time constraints.
The original crew was on standby at the side of the helicopter during the event, while security forces personnel were on standby nearby while the aircraft was on the ground.
The records obtained by time magazine did not make it clear whether a second crew was ultimately needed.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using government property for political purposes.
The records state that HMX-1 had asked if the event was a violation of the act.
"One of the questions we asked was whether this was a violation of the Hatch Act and was told there was no violation," the commander wrote.
"Sounds like you're locked up," the Deputy commander replied.
The White House defines the "made in America" event as an official event and is therefore not governed by the Hatch Act.
But even official activities have political overtones.
At the event, the President pushed the then-Senate issue: Health care reform and touted the regulation of government regulations.
The use of Marine one or Air Force one aircraft for political propaganda purposes is nothing new.
Successive presidents have been required to travel on these planes.
But it is not common to expropriate them for photo purposes only.
Trump received attention in February, when it was in Melbourne, Florida, when the presidential plane slowly glided and eventually stopped at the background cloth of one of his campaign rallies, and his push account was filled with complaints about the previous president's use of the presidential Jet.
"The White House is excited by the 'made in America' exhibition, which shows products from all 50 states that are made by American workers using American materials," said Lindsay Walters, deputy White House press spokesman.
The HMX-1 crew regularly conducts flight training near the Washington area and on the South Lawn, practicing the accurate placement of the President of the United States in the White House.
HMX-1 practiced 58 landings at the White House during Trump's participation in the G-20 summit in Germany at the beginning of the seventh month.
The U.S. manufacturing activity flight is included in this month's crew training requirements, an official said.
The helicopter unit also flew an additional 11 hours of "non-presidential support missions" that day.
The White House said taxpayers did not bear the cost of any other props at the event.
A Sikorsky spokesman said the company was not involved in arranging the South Lawn helicopter display.
HMX-1 does not keep budget records for presidential flights, so it is very difficult to determine the exact costs incurred by the event.
But according to the MoD's hourly cost records for fiscal year 2017, the MoD reimbursable cost for VH-3D is $24,380 per flight hour.
The force recorded a 30-minute flight each time the plane flew from its base at the Marine Corps airport in Quantico, Virginia.
The White House says the cost of operating the helicopter is well below that cost.
Walters said "it is very misleading to estimate the costs incurred by taxpayers on the basis of reimbursable expenses.
These estimated costs include personnel costs, maintenance costs and many other sunk costs included in the annual allocation.
A 2015 RAND study showed that the MoD's reimbursable costs do not include personnel costs, but do include oil, maintenance and contracting costs.
At the time, former White House press spokesman Sean Spicer defended the use of the helicopter for the event,
And said "the idea is to show what's made in America this week,
And I know both Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are proud of it, they both contribute to our national security, and I'm guessing there are hundreds of people whose jobs depend on it even without thousands.
And I feel that, like most Americans, we are all proud of this helicopter and other military equipment, a result that countless Americans have gone out of their way to make.
So it's certainly not out of place to highlight that, "he said.
It's not clear to us whether Trump interacted with the helicopter as he toured the South Lawn at the event, but he did get into the driving seat of the fire truck.
Inside the White House, Trump spoke to representatives of the Sikorsky company, joking with the media about the company's aircraft, which he owns himself.
He said, "I know Sikorsky very well. I have three."

According to the Market Star, from 2005 to 2011, our Province's GDP rose from the middle to the bottom of the table.
However, Economic growth in our Province still suffers from low investment efficiency and lack of core competitiveness in the industrial economy. For this reason, the latest issue of the Economic Blue pages of the Provincial Economic Information Center recommends improving the quality and effectiveness of Economic growth.
Based on some representative indicators of our provincial economy in 2005 and 2011, it is compared with the national and Central regions.
In terms of industrial economic benefits, in 2011, a considerable proportion of high energy-consuming industries such as industrial energy and raw materials in our Province were affected by market fluctuations and the "double pressure" of overcapacity. At the same time, the innovation capacity of leading industries such as home appliances and automobiles was insufficient, resulting in meagre profits.
And a large amount of investment has not brought corresponding economic benefits, which is an important reason for the low quality and efficiency of economic growth in our province.
To this end, experts suggest that effective measures should be taken to encourage enterprise innovation, and the scientific and technological achievements of universities and scientific research institutes should be "transferred" to enterprises in a timely manner.
For the industrial economic benefits are not high, experts say, we should also actively promote industrial merger and reorganization, optimize industrial layout and extend the industrial chain.

The British General Trade Union (GMB) is concerned about investment in McVitie's Glasgow plant
The union wants the management of McVita, the biscuit maker, to pledge a long-term commitment to production at the Rasco plant.
The company has been silent about the future of investment in the Tollcross plant, according to TUC Scotland.
The factory, which has more than 500 employees, produces oat biscuits (Hobnobs), strong Tea biscuits (Rich Tea) and other products.
Mr Pladis, owner of McVita, said the company had invested more than £5m in the plant over the past few years.
He added that employees and union representatives "would be the first to know" if there were changes in factory operations.
In a letter to the company's director, TUC Scotland called on McVita to "address the issue of funds that have not been carried over to the modernization of the production line."
Drew Duffy, senior sponsor of the British general Union, said: 'Our members are deeply concerned by our inability to get a clear picture of Tollcross's future business needs and investment plans from the general manager of the plant.
Generations of families work here, and the high concentration of labour in the local community and the greater Glasgow area is an important pillar of decent employment in areas of high unemployment and social deprivation.
So, from the point of view of jobs, pay and economic prosperity, against the backdrop of Brexit, the rising cost of living and a prolonged decline in manufacturing, there is an urgent need for the eastern part of Glasgow to keep expanding its production network, "he said.
A spokesman for Pladis said: "The director of Tollcross has just received a letter from TUC Scotland yesterday and the company will respond immediately because of the importance we attach to maintaining continuous contact with employees and trade union representatives.
Two months ago, we had a regular meeting with employees and representatives of the British General Trade Union in Tollcross, where a number of issues were openly discussed.
We had discussions with our employees and then, like all other companies operating in a highly competitive and economically uncertain environment, we reviewed the ongoing operating model we applied to businesses and factories in order to remain competitive.
She added: "In recent years we have invested more than £5m in the Tollcross plant, particularly in production lines and operational improvements.
We are fully aware of the historical position of Tollcross as a production base, and if there is any change in our operations at the plant, employees and union representatives will be aware of it, "he said.
Nima Tsering, Deputy Director of the Sports Bureau of the Tibet Autonomous region, said at the Base Camp on the northern slope of Mount Everest on May 10 that in the future, the removal of domestic waste on the northern slope of Mount Everest will move from public welfare actions in the past to normalized behavior led by the Chinese government with the participation of the international community.
On May 10, environmental volunteers loaded classified garbage into trucks.
In recent years, with the rapid increase of Mount Everest explorers and tourists, the problem of environmental protection at the site of the peak has become increasingly prominent.
In the Spring of 1997, the Tibet Autonomous region Mountaineering Association launched a cleaning campaign on the Northern slope of Mount Everest, cleaning up a batch of household waste such as oxygen cylinders left over from the 1960s and 1970s. The video was also broadcast at the World Climate Conference in Tokyo that year and attracted world attention.
According to Nima Tsering, after 1997, the public welfare team cleaned the Northern slope of Mount Everest, but most of the participants were non-professionals.
Paris Saint-Germain warned Barcelona three years ago to sign Nemal?
The Spanish may regret offering an olive branch to Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain will not give up signing for Nemal after making an offer of £189m in an attempt to get it to exercise the exemption clause, but did they warn Barcelona before three years to launch an attack on the world record raider?
The sensational approach has opened up the summer transfer window, with the French club poised to break the world transfer record for more than twice the previous transfer record, with Paul Bogba returning to Manchester United last season for a whopping £89m.
Once the transfer is completed, Nemal will jump to become the most expensive player in the world and the highest paid professional athlete in the world - Paris Saint-Germain offers an after-tax salary of more than £500,000 a week.
Barcelona are angry at the manner of Nemal's attack and the way out, and sources with knowledge of the Catalan team's board insist that the club has been doing its best to take care of him since his arrival from Santos in 2013.
But did the president of Paris Saint-Germain make such a prediction about the world of football three years ago?
When Manchester City expressed an interest in signing Bryce Mattedi in 2014, Nasser al Hlefi issued a scathing warning to any club that wanted to sign the best player in Paris Saint-Germain.
"I'm not worried because they know that if they come into contact with any of our players, we are bound to go up against them and we will contact their players as well," al Hlefi said.
"We respect all clubs.
But if they try to sign our players, they will also have to fend for themselves, "he said.
The Spanish club appeared to have crossed the line earlier this summer, with Barcelona offering an olive branch to Paris Saint-Germain midfielder Marco Villarty.
Paris Saint-Germain has made it clear that they will not allow the Italian international to leave anyway, and Barcelona are likely to be affected by the loss of Nemal, the talent in the game.
