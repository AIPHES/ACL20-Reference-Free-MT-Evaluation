Civil rights groups issue travel warning for Missouri
As a result of discriminatory policies and racist attacks in Missouri, the American Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) issued a travel warning to colored people preparing to travel to Missouri.
"The NAACP Missouri travel advisory, which came into force on August 28, 2017, calls for special attention and extreme caution for all African-American travellers, tourists and Missouri travellers in Missouri due to a series of suspected racial incidents in Missouri in the near future," the group's statement declared.
NAACP noted that a recently passed Missouri law made it harder for people to win discrimination lawsuits and that state law enforcement was partly targeting minorities, a phenomenon that prompted the organization to issue travel warnings.
Civil rights violations are happening to people.
They were stopped for questioning because of their skin color, beaten or killed, "Missouri NAACP Chairman Rod Chappell told the Kansas City Star.
"We have received a lot of complaints, in an unprecedented number," the statement read.
This is the first such warning issued by the organization in the United States against a state.
The group cited the University of Missouri's racial slurs against black students and the death of 28-year-old Tennessee black male Tori Sanders.
Sanders, who died in suspicious circumstances earlier this year, ran out of fuel while traveling in Missouri and was detained by Missouri police without charge of a crime.
The advisory also noted that a recent report by the Missouri Attorney General's Office showed that "black drivers in the state are 75 per cent more likely to be stopped for check-ups than whites."
"The advice was to raise awareness and warn their families, friends and colleagues about what might happen in Missouri," Chappell said.
"People need to be prepared, whether to carry bail to Missouri or to let relatives know they're traveling within the state," the statement read.
Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest data from the FBI's hate crime reporting program; the state ranks 16th in the nation, depending on the amount of crime.
The travel warning is also a response to a new Missouri law that would make it more difficult to prosecute housing or employment discrimination businesses.
Previously, U.S. states passed immigration enforcement laws requiring local law enforcement to detain immigration offending personnel, and the ACLU said the move would increase the number of race lawsuits and issue travel advice for Texas and Arizona.
Travel warnings are usually issued by the U.S. government against other countries, but more recently, advisory groups have taken this approach in response to certain laws and trends in the United States.
After the "golden age" of the 2015 box-office surge, the overall film market in 2016 has entered a cool period, and the ability to break through last year's total box office record of 440.69 million yuan is a suspense.

The BBC calls Beijing the most exciting city: To make old people feel "living in a new era"
Beijing may have a long history of three thousand years, but it is also rapidly becoming today's modern glamour city, according to media.
The Chinese capital, with its stunning internet, sophisticated technology such as face-recognition software, invested heavily in artificial intelligence and has unrivalled international energy, is one of the most exciting cities for spiritual foreigners.
"If I can succeed there, I will succeed anywhere later," said German expatriate Clemens Seshi, citing singer Frank Sinatra's lyrics to New York City.
"If Sinatra lived to this day, he would probably sing a city like Beijing," he said, adding that living in the city would make you feel "living in a new era" and always keep up with the tide.
Simon Norton, who is based in England but recently lived in Beijing, wrote on the personal blog site 4Corners7Seas: "There is a sense of being at the centre of something grand, which is hard to say, but it leaves many foreigners there for a long time.
The city's high-quality, high-speed internet and technology-friendly environment make everyday life easier than ever, the report said.
"Beijing is rapidly transforming into a cashless society, where the internet integrates the functions of traditional wallets into smartphones, making it easier for everyone to make many deals," said Andy Pe√±a Fuerte, who is from Manila and currently serves as deputy editor-in-chief of the Beijing Children's website.
But smartphones are just the beginning of Beijing's technological ambitions, with facial recognition software already popular and many mobile apps using the technology to make bank transfers and payments, get people into apartments and offices, and even use it to verify the identity of a cyber driver, the report said.
Beijing recently announced plans to spend 13.8 billion yuan to build an artificial intelligence technology park, where more than 400 businesses will be built, to focus on developing artificial intelligence technologies ranging from biometrics to self-driving cars.
Food is also at the heart of many of the major festivals of China's calendar year, and participation in these celebrations has been praised by foreigners, with the Spring Festival being the most important social and economic holiday and one of the most accessible to foreigners.
"I suggest helping Chinese friends prepare for the New Year, cleaning the apartment and posting a New Year's Eve to all the family members on New Year's Eve, when all the family members come together for a big meal, and then stay at midnight and greet the New Year with brilliant fireworks.
Beijing has a large and growing number of foreigners, but language barriers in China and the ease of communication between expatriates can easily be an excuse for their lack of full integration into local culture, the report said.
"Some foreigners have been living in China for many years, but have little experience of their host country. If your initial attempts to reach the Chinese are not successful, it is easy to get along with other foreigners.
In these so-called "exogenous bubbles," where foreigners mingle only among foreigners without touching locals and local cultures, foreigners are in their communities, eating in Western restaurants, and only foreigners among their friends.
The easiest way to overcome this is to learn a little Mandarin - which is simpler than people might think.
"One or two hours a week of Chinese private teaching or learning entry-level radio dramas should suit everyone's busy schedule," Seshi said.
Even a few classic short sentences can help with shopping, booking in a restaurant or chatting in a taxi.
Stubborn air pollution is also a fact of daily life, though government efforts in recent years have curbed some problems, the report said.
Residents stress the importance of outdoor activities during warmer months, when pollution is often lighter, as a chance to roam the long-standing alleyways or explore the much-loved Tribune Park.
"Beijing is a Chinese city that can find the most things below the surface, and you can find great art and music events, crisp nightlife, historical wonders, ultra-modern commercial areas and ancient alleyways," Norton said.
The report argues that ageing has become increasingly a barrier to human capital growth, particularly in the north-east, where the average annual contribution of ageing to human capital growth is -1.28 per cent.
Mr Pan noted that the current risk of cross-border capital flows was manageable and that the underlying factors underpinning the balance of payments remained long-standing.
Beijing, December 17 (Xinhua) -- The world is renowned for its heritage - the 2016 International Peak Forum for the Restoration and Protection of Old Book Paintings in China opened at Renmin University on December 17.
In April, the European Commission accused Google of forcing handset makers to pre-load software such as Google Search and Chrome browsers or not allow them to use other Google apps.
The European Commission considered the move to be detrimental to consumer interests and hindered competition.
EU regulators initially asked Google to respond by July 27.
Google faces a 10 per cent fine for its global revenues of about $7.4 billion if antitrust charges are established.
Google was not immediately available for comment.
Google is also facing an EU investigation for favouring its own shopping services in search results.
Zhang Yanning's retention is solid, and it is not accidental to say that he achieved the "jump" from the country to the country, and that the extent of his growth remains surprising.
A picture read: Bitcoin's legal status around the world
Abstract: In addition to the price correction naturally triggered by speculative properties, this round of digital currency falls has nothing to do with "predator" - regulatory risk.
From the visualization map, the East has a more conservative attitude towards Bitcoin than the West, and the countries that make up the global subject are still watching the legitimacy of the digital currency, representing the "black swan risk" still high.
:: This article is from Wall Street, Editor Wang Mu. For more information, please go to wallstreetcn.com or download the Wall Street App. *
The global digital currency, led by Bitcoin, has suffered a bloodbath this week as regulatory storms in Bitcoin's main markets, such as China, South Korea and the European Union, fell below the $10,000 psychological integer on Tuesday, the biggest one-day drop in three years.
In addition to the price pullback naturally triggered by speculative properties, the tumble in the digital currency has nothing to do with the long-standing "predator" - regulatory risk.
At this important juncture, the visualized Big Data website HowMuch.net has produced a map showing the legitimacy and regulation of bitcoin across the globe.
Green represents the legal market for Bitcoin, as shown in the figure below; Orange represents a neutral market, although it has not publicly legalized Bitcoin status, but there are no major restrictions on use; pale pink represents restricted markets, where local governments try to use red-line policies or regulations to use digital currencies; deep pink represents the country where Bitcoin is defined as illegal; and gray is a country that has not yet commented.
(Pictured above from HowMuch.Net visualization team on January 15)
The paper points out that the traditional oriental countries have a more conservative attitude towards Bitcoin than the West.
Russia is by far the largest country to define Bitcoin as illegal, and China is one of Bitcoin's biggest restricted markets, and India is one of the largest countries that has not commented on Bitcoin and has yet to put in place policies.
North America and Western Europe are the regions with the highest levels of acceptance of Bitcoin, where green blocks are more concentrated.
The views of the countries of the Middle East and Latin America on Bitcoin have been sharply divided, and the distribution of color blocks in these areas is more mixed.
Of these, Iraq, Iran, Turkey, Brazil are all legitimate Bitcoin markets, and Afghanistan, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Bolivia, and others have some degree of restrictions on their transactions and use, and more Latin American countries have yet to vocalize about bitcoin.
Combined with the above data, 99 countries (or 40 per cent) of the 246 countries in the world statistics have no restrictions on Bitcoin transactions and use, namely, green and orange areas.
Seven countries (or 3 per cent) were restricted markets (pale pink), while 10 countries (or 4 per cent) defined Bitcoin as illegal (deep pink) and 130 countries (or 53 per cent) did not treat digital currency information more (grey).
This suggests that countries with global subjects (53 per cent, more than half) are still watching the legitimacy of Bitcoin-led digital currencies within their borders, and that the "black swan risk" of Bitcoin remains high, as some of them may eventually make legislative decisions to limit digital currencies.
The article argues that global regulators have not fully understood the emerging category of digital currency, and may be the main reason most countries have yet to make a statement.
While Bitcoin's "popularity" has grown exponentially since last year and does not represent an interest in all countries, there may be concerns that local coins are therefore threatened or more concerned that digital currencies are being exploited by criminal organizations.
Wall Street has written a detailed summary of international regulatory news against Bitcoin since last week, including the start of China's crackdown on off-site online platforms for centralized services and mobile App, South Korea's ongoing consideration of closing digital currency exchanges, the EU's belief that Bitcoin has not been widely accepted and warning investors of the risk of "losing blood."
The New Year of the Digital Currency The year 2018 will be the year of the global central bank's digital currency from any point of view of regulation, acceptance / criticism and adoption.
The criticism of Bitcoin's legitimacy by major powers such as Russia is also intended to make way for official digital money.

Now Playing: Trump's White House Is Targeting the Statue of Liberty
The most definitive sign of regime change is when they start attacking statues.
Americans share this with anyone else, so Saddam Hussein of Baghdad's Paradise Square in 2003 was orchestrated.
Stephen Miller, one of the key thinktanks of the Trump administration, is sure to know what will happen when he heats up with CNN's Jim Acosta about the president's proposal to severely restrict legal immigration.
To be fair, Miller did not attack the statue itself.
If he does, then a bunch of cruise ship owners and liberal followers will surely swallow him.
But he did attack the significance of the statue, especially when Emma Lazarus's poem was engraved on the pedestal in 1903 (the monument was built 17 years later).
As Miller rebuked Acosta: "I don't want to talk about the full facts of history here, but the Statue of Liberty is like a symbol of America's freedom to illuminate the world...
The poem you are referring to, which was later added, is not part of the original Statue of Liberty.
In fact, Miller is right, but as he himself says, it's not really about history.
This involves the modern echo of Lazarus's thrilling words, the only country that seems to invite not only any old immigrant but also the poorest of the poor: "Your exhaustion, your poverty, or your huddled population's desire to breathe freely, / The suffering people reject your crowded beaches."
There is no such thing as a moment when "suffering people refuse" to become more piercing on our screens.
Miller, who has not worked on literary reviews, made it clear that these people would not be welcome in the Trump-era America.
This conflict over the significance of statues is part of a broader political and cultural war: It is actually in conflict with the American spirit.
Lazarus, and her friends who held events after her death to engrave her verse on the pedestal, were well aware of the highly political nature of the behaviour they were engaging in.
The sculpture is intended to express the connection between French and American republicanism through the old classic metaphor of the female incarnation of the Statue of Liberty.
Lazarus changed the meaning: In her poem, the female image is no longer abstract, and she wants to voice.
She gave herself a very different name: The mother of exile.
The poem's combination with the painting was a successful feminist coup and a devastating blow to nativism.
Just as Lazarus changes the meaning of the statue, the right-wingers have always wanted to get it back.
The great speaker, Rush Limbaugh, a baptist who came to Trump as a makeshift, argued in 2010 that liberalism was not inviting anyone, and that he was now an early neo-conservative who brought the American flame of wisdom to the world of folly: "The Statue of Liberty is brave.
She was meant to bring the torch of freedom from America to the rest of the world.
The torch is not the way to illuminate America.
Unusually, Limbo was actually struck by something.
The meaning of the statue depends entirely on the perspective of cognition.
Lazarus's imaginative approach is to be able to see it. When tired, poor but hopeful people can see it on the deck of a ship after a long and often terrible journey.
On the face of it, this involves the view of the world by those who seek refuge and have the opportunity to improve their lives.
Her statue conveyed to them the hope and welcome they needed to hear.
Of course, this is not a view that Miller and Trump once wanted to acknowledge.
They torch not to illuminate the road, but to ignite the hatred of their only source of power.

World Championships 2017: Neil Black highly praised for Scotland squad in England squad
Eilidh Doyle recalled that there were only two Scots in the England squad at the time.
Neil Black, executive director of the British Athletics Association, said a team of 16 strong Scots in the World Championships team would make a huge contribution to the national team.
The number of Scottish field athletes selected for the 2017 London Athletics World Championships, which opens on Friday, is the most in history.
Blake believes "Scotland is making extraordinary progress" and British track and field athletes must learn from it.
"We accept and try to understand that and we will stick to it until we succeed," Black said.
'i'm talking to people at the Scottish Institute of Sport who think it's related to their actions.
Scottish track and field athletes believe it is linked to their actions.
The British Athletics Association believes this is related to their actions.
Even street people think so.
Whatever the case, it's extremely brilliant. '
Multiple Scottish track and field athletes are medal contenders, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart, who will be at 5,000m with Mo Farah, while Eilidh Doyle is selected as captain by the team.
'Eid was a bit humble.
Her captain's speech was incredible, "Black said.
"Many track and field athletes, whether they are Scots or wherever they live or train, walk out of the door with pride and drive out of the door.
The passion and real affection that Eriad naturally puts in is pretty good.
The Commonwealth silver medallist, who will compete in the 400m hurdles at its fifth world championships, said it was "inconceivable" that there were 16 Scots in the British national team.
Previously, the largest number of Scottish track and field athletes who took part in the World Series was seven, the number of entries made in 1983 and 2015.
The runner, Muir, is the leading man. She has set five British records and two European records in the past year.
She will compete in the 1500m and 5000m projects.
Chris O'Hare, who competed in the 1500m project, was another worthy Scottish player before she scored well in the season to win both the British national qualifiers and the Olympic anniversary.
Doyle recalled her participation in the first world championships when the only other Scot on the team was Lee McConnell.
The captain said she was deeply proud that so many of her compatriots would not only join the team but, in some cases, would challenge for medals and compete for the finals.
"What's special about being captain of the national team is that it's voted on by the rest of the national team, so it's a great honor to know that your teammates voted for you to achieve something extremely unusual," she added.
"Of course, I am very proud of all the Scottish players," he said.
It just shows how far we've come.
And they are the established track and field athletes here, the track and field athletes who are on the verge of moving on to the podium.
My captain's message?
Well, I think it's fantastic.
I have just referenced the fact that we were very fortunate in this situation because we had the world championships at home.
So it's really important that we build on our home support and get back to the Olympic Stadium.
I will get a second chance to compete and the atmosphere there will be fantastic, "he said.

Shielding critics on face books: Don't run for office if you can't stand the blame of voters
Our father knows the bad press.
Americans love Washington, but soon after, major newspapers began to lash out at him for everything from domestic policy to political principles.
He was annoyed by the criticism, no doubt about it.
But he did not silence the critics.
Because as far back as 1783, Washington said, "Freedom of expression is denied - we will be slaughtered in silence and ignorance like lambs."
That reminds me of Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, who needs to learn from Washington.
Hogan's staff shielded and deleted posts from at least 450 people as they shared their views on his Facebook official home page.
The ACLU filed a lawsuit against him earlier this week.
The governor's staff described the lawsuit as hasty, and online reports flooded with their backlash: "Who cares?"
A lot of people say "it's just Facebook."
But that's important.
That's especially important because facing someone like Hogan.
This is a Republican who has served as governor in a Democratic-majority state and is surprisingly popular.
Of the country's 50 governors, he received the second highest rating.
Hogan is not a reactionary impatient.
He took charge of Maryland smoothly and strictly followed the rules.
He was also very adept at using Facebook as the primary way to connect with voters, parody on the home page for the first time showing his bald head after chemotherapy.
So it's completely unnecessary and ultimately dangerous to shield people who come to the governor's homepage, a public forum that is the official management platform for public tax-fed staff.
In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan's spokeswoman, Amelia Shares, defended the governor's actions, saying she thought shielding them from comments was simply trying to show them restraint.
But they overtly describe it as a flood or cynic sweeping the web.
The Washington Post spoke face-to-face with people who were shielded by Hogan.
They are just ordinary people talking to their elected leaders: Their identities are teachers, small business owners and priests, and they are not a torrent.
They say their comments are deep, respectful and not indecent.
The priest, in his post, quoted the Bible as calling on Hogan to remember his Catholic faith.
Maryland Bowie's barrister Lakshmi Salma Ramani was not cynical, but she asked questions about hate crimes.
"I commented politely that I was disappointed that he did not respond to hate crimes and other recent news events," she wrote in the Washington Post news story commentary section.
I also dislike a group of people commenting on the same topic, because these people are directly ignored by some as the so-called public psyche, rather than as a group of worried citizens.
What the governor's staff call "intensive garbage information bombing" may seem to others to be "insisting."
The Facebook era made it easy to modify a message, only to shield a critic or delete a negative comment.
And it is far more clean than it used to be, and to do the same in the past is to send staff out to collect and burn newspapers with critical comments or to arrest or silence protesters.
But that really is happening right now, but on a digital level.
Hogan is not the first public official to be blamed for silencing others on Facebook and other social media.
President Trump is being sued by Twitter users for shielding them on Twitter.
A landmark ruling in Virginia last week was about such issues.
The president of the Lauden County Supervisory Board, who shielded voters from her Facebook page, violated the First Amendment, according to District Judge James c Cabaris of Alexandria.
Kentucky Gov. Matt Bevin (R) has also been patronised by the ACLU for its use of Facebook and Twitter.
It shouldn't be so hard.
In the Washington era, affordable postage and the Internet had similar clout.
The number of news newspapers quadrupled between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letters sharply criticized his leadership.
And even at that point, Washington had an anonymous torrent against him.
People used pseudonyms such as Yurikla, Valerius, Belisaremain, and Bogus to write to the newspaper to severely criticize Washington's decision-making.
According to historical documents collected by the George Washington newspaper Online Project, his office was inundated with petitions, both criticizing his approach to the Treaty between His Majesty the King of England and the United States of America on Friendship, Trade and Navigation, signed with Britain.
But he did not silence them.
Freedom of expression, dissent and freedom of speech are the foundation of this country.
And real leaders need to accept that.
The wind blowing in the property market is holding people's sensitive nerves.
Limited purchase is a hard bar for many urban real estate control policies.
In May 2017, Jinan introduced rules for undergraduate students to pay social security for half a year and enjoy the same home ownership policy as local residents;
In June, Wuhan introduced a policy that requires college students to leave their homes with a diploma and employment certificate within three years of graduation.
Then the policy was added, with the official saying that "college students can buy a house at a price of 20% below the market price";
In July, Chengdu introduced the requirement that young people with undergraduate and higher education in the field can apply for a residence permit.
In addition, cities or regions, such as Kunshan and Shanghai, have introduced "talent introduction" policies to reduce the threshold for people to buy homes.
Mr Zhang believes that this is actually the battle of the big cities for the population, especially talent, to retain the population, especially talent, and the city to be competitive.
Some even argue that this means the time has come for the market to be "restricted" from cancellation.

Ronan Lafferty looks forward to enjoying home at Renaissance Club
East Lothian Renaissance Club hosts the 25th Scottish evergreen Open, with former European champion Ronan Lafferty set to enjoy a home feel for the next three days.

"I have witnessed the Renaissance Club set up and we will witness its glory through this tournament," Rafferty said.
The players will see the best look and best of the pitch.
Jerry started the place unmatched.
He is a passionate advocate of the tournament and is very proud of what has been achieved here.
It's the best stage to showcase this stadium, "he said.
Englander Iris is looking forward to defending his title for the first time despite winning both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour in 32 years.
"It was really very special," the Socceroo player said.
I didn't defend the Estramadura Open because the game was cancelled in the second year of my win.
It feels amazing to be here,
It's wonderful to play golf here.
Last year's recollections came to light, and for me and my wife Sharon, last year's win had special significance for us.
That was really a special memory and we'll always remember, "he said.
Back in the home race was Gary Orr, who had just turned 50 earlier this year and then played on the European evergreen Tour.
This time it was his first Scottish game since the 2013 Scottish Golf Open.
"There's always a lot more to come home," says Helensburg man Orr.
You want to do well; but feel the extra pressure.
Being able to play again I'm really enjoying it and I've been playing golf.
I'm happy with the current situation, "he said.
Joining the three-man squad are former Masters winner Ian Wootham and evergreen champions Paul Brodhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNeath.
A total of six Scottish players on the pitch, Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are two of them, and the other four are Andrew O'Donnell, Stephen McAllister, Bill Lang and Ross Draymond.

China's environmental protection department, the head of the Environmental Inspectorate, said in Beijing that in August, a total of 57 cases of day-to-day continuous punishment were implemented nationwide, and the new amendment to the Environmental Protection Law introduced earlier this year clearly added to China's environmental enforcement efforts.
At present, environmental protection organs throughout China may use the means of punishment, such as day-to-day continuous punishment, seizure, suspension of production and transfer of administrative detention, to investigate environmental violations and cooperate with judicial organs in punishing environmental crimes.
In August, 335 cases of seizure and seizure were carried out in various parts of China, 177 cases of limited production and cut-off were carried out, 189 cases of administrative detention were transferred and 166 cases of suspected environmental pollution were transferred.
Among them, Henan has imposed seven consecutive punishments on a daily basis. At present, China is in the process of managing from the end to the whole of the country, and fully enhancing environmental pollution control.
Despite the downward pressure on the economy, the Ministry of Environmental Protection has made it clear that China should properly handle the positioning of environmental protection in economic development, enhance the "green force," and the more the economy grows, the less it will be able to relax the environment and play a good role in optimizing the economy.
No tallest, only higher, Guizhou Maotai share price can not stop at all on the path of high innovation.
On January 9, shares in Guizhou, the A-share "king," hit a record high, closing at 782.52 yuan, with a total market capitalization of 98.3 billion yuan, just one step away from the market capitalization.

Russia says Putin will have a new home-grown car: The unit price is 15 percent cheaper than Mercedes-Benz
Russian Industry and Trade Minister Manturov said President Vladimir Putin's "convoy" had a unit price of 6-7 million roubles, according to Russian media.
The budget goal is to keep prices at 15% lower than Mercedes-Benz S-Class cars.
At the end of February and early March, the Russian National Academy of Automotive Engineering (NAMI), the president's main research and development unit, will deliver 16 vehicles to the Federal Security Service, the Russian company said.
According to the report, the "convoy" project calls for a unified module platform to create three cars for the country's top figures - a longer sedan, a three-van and a minibus.
News of the president's first home-grown sedan since the Soviet Union came about five years ago, according to a plan by the research and development unit to install 800 horsepower engines and armor, weighing six tons.
It is understood that the engineering team of the German company Porsche was involved in the development of the power plant.
In addition, Manturov told reporters that the "convoy" series of cars will be retail from 2019, with various configured models available.
"From next year, all interested people can order, whether bulletproof or luxury, without any sales restrictions," the minister said.
The Russian Ministry of Trade and Trade plans to increase the annual production of the fleet of cars to more than 1,000 by 2020.
"We are now full of 18 production, more than 70 this year, 200 next year and 300 or even more in the next year," Manturov said.

Zhejiang Province vigorously promotes the spirit of the Red Ship, with firm action, let work be at the forefront of the times.
A new batch of water samples had just been collected and Liu and his colleagues were busy.
While daily monitoring
This year they are trying to conquer the intellectual management of rural sewage
How to manage it well is actually a very serious challenge.
Zhejiang Tsinghua Long Triangle Research Institute of Ecology is located in the birthplace of the Red Ship spirit.
From nothing more than a decade ago to today
Zhejiang Tsinghua Long Triangle Research Institute has developed into a three-state key innovation platform, and nearly 400 overseas students fall into Zhejiang's regional innovation gathering power.
Red boat spirit is a force we must follow and understand, and innovation is really tough
Every innovation in this
All feel insoluble, and at this stage you're going to stick around, just keep walking.
It was the people who went to the door, and now it is up to the bottom, that is to say
Doing business for the people
So far, in this way, Xiaoshan has collected a total of 5,985 problems, of which 3,868 have been resolved and 1,496 are being processed.
Our cadres in Zhejiang have one word
The geographical advantage is inferior to that of cadres, the policy preferences are not as good as the service quality, and the spirit of the Red Boat Spirit is the inspiration that allows us to move forward, even more so.
Fight hard
In recent days, XIX representatives and prominent artists from the literary and art circles of the Chinese Federation of Chinese Arts and Arts have formed a group to tour the Nineties, Heilongjiang, Gansu, Shanghai, Guangdong and Guizhou.
They went deep into the grass-roots mass art galleries, local colleges and universities in Inner Mongolia, Heilongjiang and Gansu, and took on a new cultural mission for literary and art workers in the XIX spirit
I am deeply proud and happy, and I am willing to sink down again and write down the fate of the little people of the great age
There are some good suggestions for this grassroots literary development
Now the popular literature and art is very busy, there is a point in popularization
Keep rolling out the boutique works worthy of the times.
It should be rooted and grassroots, deep in life, and then make works with a certain cultural thickness, positive, with constant artistic charm.
Twenty-eight of them have been measured for a total area of 15.2 billion acres, of which 11 billion acres have been completed.
Eighty-two percent of the contracted arable land in two rounds of households and seven provinces, including Sichuan, have reported to the State Council of the Central Committee of the Party.
It is expected that by the end of 2008, the country's right to contract land will be basically completed
In the future, the Ministry of Agriculture will explore the results of the right
The starter of our space science satellite series and the world's first dark matter particle detection satellite
Over the past two years, four scans of the full-day area have been carried out, and more than 3.5 billion high-energy particles have been detected, the most accurate in the world
The results were published in the international academic journal Nature
In space, we have observed a new one that has not been observed before, and which cannot be explained and explained by the existing theory
The significance of this research is multiple, and most importantly it shows the most cutting-edge technology used by Chinese scientists
The ability to manufacture scientific instruments to detect a very difficult scientific problem.
Looking for the toilet by the nose, this is the last century, many people have memories of Chinese toilets.
Also integrated into more and more humanized designs
Impressed by many visitors, the toilet is often ventilated and unpleasant
Now you don't have to find the toilet by the nose
Not only does the hardware change, so does the software
The tourism department requires that the toilet should be equipped with toilet paper and hand sanitizer
But in some areas
Do you stop this civilian service because of the uncivilized behavior of others
Managers everywhere make choices
On the one hand, the promotion of economy through civilized cues, on the other hand, technological innovation.
Public latrines in Nanjing, Jiangsu, the city, etc.
Brush your face for three seconds and get a toilet paper for free, but you need to wait ten more minutes to get a double
Avoid misuse of public resources
Custom, maybe some tourists really want to take the paper back, but on the other hand we have to reflect
Is there no paper for the next toilet that our tourists want to enter, so that's what we put special emphasis on in the new three-year plan
We need to solve this imbalance
To push the toilet revolution deeper is to think more about what the masses think.
There must be a third bathroom for the family to accompany the elderly and children to the toilet.
We take the baby, boys' bathroom We're sorry to go in
Women's toilets are so small as to know a little embarrassment, that board is particularly comfortable, it is very convenient for us to bring the children.
People feel civilized and become builders of civilization. In the countryside, villagers in the Guangxi river pool are building new flush toilets at home
Much has been achieved, and actively promoting the toilet revolution will not only help people stay away from disease, but also drive economic development to narrow regional development gaps.
This toilet problem is a programmatic problem, a node of social development.
It is a national civilization project that guides the layout from a national perspective, and then every aspect addresses small social problems from varying degrees of participation.
That makes all our short patches.

Poverty and Death in Jinzhou, Indonesia
Budtina Daijer doesn't use the stove when cooking.
She doesn't even use pot.
Her wooden house is located in the capital of Paniai County, Papua, Indonesia, where the housewife usually simply puts a sweet potato - known as "nota" - into the fire.
Half an hour later, the charred sweet potato was rushed out by a pair of unwashed hands and gobbled up.
Dai Jie sat on the mud - she had no furniture, and here was where she did everyday household chores, such as washing clothes, and the water was so muddy that it came from a nearby swamp.
There's a bucket in a room without a roof, which is the outdoor toilet.
She was the youngest of her husband's four wives, so she was not assigned to the fields for care.
Polygamy is common here.
Of course, it's dangerous to work at a party: Most of the men in the village don't work, and many are drunk, plus there are a lot of soldiers here.
"Nobody dares to walk around the village after 5pm," she said.
It was a rare glimpse of daily life in the upland of Papua, once a colony of the Netherlands and incorporated into Indonesia after the 1969 referendum, when only 1,026 elders were forced to vote by show of hands in front of the army that occupied it.
The current campaign for independence and opposition to Dutch rule is quickly targeting the Jakarta government, which has imposed high pressure on the region, isolating foreign journalists and activists.
In 2003, the province officially split into Papua and West Papua, while Papua New Guinea independently controlled the eastern part of the island.
Einarotali is remote and deserted; to get here, a 90-minute flight from the provincial capital, Chayapura, to Nabre, and a five-hour rented car, tumbles through the stomach.
There is no public transport here.
In this town of about 19,000 people, the wooden huts are surrounded by bamboo fences, and folded tin roofs are a variety of yellow-brown covers made from rust.
Few Indonesians come, let alone journalists, and few foreigners.
Before the arrival of the Christian evangelist, the Mee Pago Papua practiced a god called Uga Tamee.
There are other changes here too.
"We don't get used to these clothes," she said, referring to her brightly colored hand-knitted hijab, dark shirt and bright half-skirt.
"We used to cover our bodies with leaves."
Papua is the poorest province in Indonesia, where 28 per cent of people live below the poverty line and the region with the highest infant mortality rate and lowest literacy rate in Asia.
But it's also Indonesia's golden continent.
Located in the Highlands, it is about the same size as New Jersey and has 153,000 people. The largest and most lucrative gold mine in the world, Glasberg, is only 60 miles from here, owned by Phoenix-based Felipe McMoran Copper.
In 2015 alone, Philips mined about $3.1 billion worth of gold and copper mines here.
In addition, Papua is rich in timber resources with an estimated value of $78 billion.
Yet these rich resources are also a source of tragedy for the Papuans, and Indonesia's powerful military forces have been able to silence them all the time.
A 2005 New York Times investigation reported that Phillips paid nearly $20 million to local military personnel and troops between 1998 and 2004, up to $150,000 alone.
The increasing appeal of the Papuans to independence threatened the gold lord, who was subjected to cruel treatment.
More than half a million Papuans have been killed since 1969 and thousands have been raped, tortured and held by Indonesian troops, according to campaigners.
According to the Asian Human Rights Commission, the mass killings in the Papua tribal highlands in the 1970s had escalated into genocide.
Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful protesters last year alone.
A 2016 report by the Catholic Brisbane General Diocese, "We Will Lost Everything," encapsulates the evidence of the previous year's havoc, such as extrajudicial killings, torture - another report that rape and electricity are particularly prevalent - and a brutal crackdown on peaceful demonstrations.
"Violence is happening every day, so it is difficult to calculate the number of victims," said Andreas Halsoo, an Indonesian researcher at Human Rights Watch.
Oppression began when Papua's resources brought in large numbers of migrants outside Indonesia.
While 83 per cent of the province's 3.5 million people are Christians, the demographics of Muslim economic migrants have changed from the densely populated islands of Java, Kalimantan, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Java's snack stall sells fried chicken and vegetables mixed with Gardoga with peanut butter.
Locals struggle.
"Those immigrants started selling chicken and vegetables at a lower price than the local Papuans in the traditional market," Apos Yau, a 24-year-old Paniai native, moved to the provincial capital, Chayapura, to find work.
That leaves the local Papuans - the Papuan women (mama-mama) - out of their market.
Indonesian President Zorko Vidodo, commonly known as Jokowi, vowed at his 2014 campaign to address inequality and abuse of power in Papua.
The former carpenter's road to the presidential palace in Jakarta has been supported by 27 of the 29 regions - including Paranai.
But Papua has changed nothing, and today the locals feel betrayed.
Yau said "we are heartbroken and in 2014 we voted for Jokowi in the hope that he will achieve our desire to regain fairness."
Indeed, just two months after Jokowi took office in October, Paniai suffered the worst nightmare.
On December 7, 2014, 11 children in Einarotali sang Christmas carols in front of a campfire outside, and two Indonesian soldiers burst on a motorcycle.
Frightened children told they should turn on the headlights.
One of the soldiers was dissatisfied with their tone and then returned with four soldiers, according to local pastor Yavitte Tebba.
Victims and witnesses said the drunk soldiers chased the group with their guns.
Then one of the soldiers fired a gun at the group of children.
Yulianus Ye, 16, was left unconscious after being hit badly.
Hours later, a fire broke out in the nearby government agency's Electoral Commission building, and the incident escalated the following day.
About 1,000 young Papua men, women and children gathered at a football stadium in front of the local police station and military command center to demand justice.
With a ceremonial bow, they danced the waita dance of the Papua Mee Pago tribe - running around and mimicking birdsong.
Some of the protesters began throwing stones at military regular posts.
According to an official document seen by Time Magazine, soldiers received orders via internal radio when the mood continued to inflame: "If the crowd resists more than three times, it is immediately shot," but the document was not released to local media.
Jeremias Kaya, 56, the head of the Kego Koto neighbourhood of Einarotali, felt the imminent danger and called on the crowd to calm down and plead for them to come home.
But no one was in the mood to listen to him.
Standing on the porch of his brightly coloured wooden house, he told Time magazine "When I look back, my left wrist is suddenly shot."
Kayaku still doesn't know who fired the gun, but said the bullet came from the assembled soldiers.
"It was so crowded, they fired a lot of guns," he added.
According to the cousin of the locals, Olfyus Jul, he witnessed the shooting and saw three shots in Olfus Jul.
"I ran over and checked his body to see if it was him," Juhanes sadly told Time magazine.
I found out he was dead... I kissed him. '
Papua police Ch Insp Eugene Mende told reporters his subordinates were only "protecting" the police station because of the attack.
A 2015 Papua police spokesman, Chief Constable Phugio Sullivan, said "when someone threatens to kill us, we have to defend ourselves.
It's about life and death.
Five young protesters were killed and many more injured, according to Human Rights Watch.
The next day's news about the killing spread slowly in Jakarta.
Three weeks later, Jokowi gave a lavish speech in Chayapura, expressing deep sympathy for the victims' families and vowing to address the abuse of power left over by Papua's history.
"I hope the case will be resolved as soon as possible so that this will not happen again in the future," he said.
In October 2016, Security Minister Virado said he would set up a non-judicial mechanism to address the historical legacy of human rights abuses.
But the excuses of the tweet almost rattled.
"Most of the violations occurred a long time ago," he said.
Some were in the 90s and early 2000s.
The focus is that we are committed to addressing these violations, but it still needs a process, "he said.
Then on June 5 in Jakarta, Verlando went out of his way to talk to Time magazine, saying he had no plans to establish a complaint mechanism in Papua.
Instead, he said "everything will be settled by law."
The United Nations has filed a complaint against Verlando for "anti-human rights crimes" over the deaths of more than 1,000 people in the bloody independence vote in East Timor in 1999, but said 11 human rights violations in the Papua region had been resolved, including the Paniai incident.
The families of the victims of the Paniai incident scoffed at the remarks.
"I've been interviewed four times over the last three years, but things have completely gone nowhere," Juhanes said.
Years later he said "I'm tired."
He still lives in fear now.
He said "I'm scared.
I was scared of being arrested by the army and scared of being shot, "he said.
His brother, Yucatoos, also believes the people of Paniai are afraid to talk about the incident.
He said he was beaten by the military after helping to bury four victims.
He said "after buried the body, the military came to me."
The shooting didn't stop.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police shot villagers in Deayi County, a neighborhood of Paniai.
A construction company manager who refused to help transport an unconscious man to hospital has clashed, killing one person and injuring 17 others, among them children.
The 24-year-old man, Lavianus Dorwood, drowned while fishing near the river and died on his way to hospital.
Angry villagers protest in front of the company's live office.
Police said the villagers threw stones at police, so police fired warnings.
But riot mobile units (Indonesian paramilitary police) began shooting at the crowd and one was killed.
"We were all panicking at the time and are now terrified that they will retaliate," Domingo Buddy, 29, told Time magazine, adding that he lived near the hospital when he witnessed the wounded being rushed to hospital.
'i've been hiding at home for two days. '
The Deayi parliament has called for the police involved to be brought to justice and to evacuate riot mobile units from the area.
Paniai has always been a place for the Indian government.
The absence of effective development has nourished the grievances of the Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal tribal peoples scattered across the lush central highlands of Paniai.
Many joined the Free Papua Movement (OPM), a rebel army that claims to protect the rights of Papuans by dispersing attacks and raids to kidnap Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the senior leaders of the Free Papua Movement were born in Paniai, including Tadius Jugi and Daniel Yudas Kogaya.
As a result, in recent years thousands of Panias have been arrested and deliberately detained by the military under the guise of "safeguarding national sovereignty."
Some didn't show up again.
In the eyes of Papuans, Paniai is a "forgotten place of tragedy."
Poverty grows discontent.
The rice that Einarotali is selling is so poor that locals simply can't afford it.
Bread is out of reach at all.
People here grow everything they can eat: Mainly sweet potatoes and some fruit and leafy vegetables.
Farming is a woman's job, and every woman can care for four or five sweet potatoes.
They usually leave most of their harvests for writers and the rest for sale on the local market.
Ten sweet potatoes are worth only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Over time, economic inequality has opened up among local Papuans and newcomers, and the number of these migrants has increased significantly since the opening of the new route to the airport.
The small amount of work available usually falls to better educated and wealthier migrants.
Papuans rarely have the funds or the necessary skills to run competitive companies.
"Young people don't want to stay in the village... because there's no work and no money here," said John Gobbay, president of the Paranai Tribal Council.
Papua is isolated.
In addition, restrictions on international media coverage remain tight.
Earlier this year, French journalists Frank Escudi and Basel Longchamp were deported from Papua because they "did not cooperate with the relevant agencies," even if they had been given rare filming authorizations.
Jokowi's election vows to withdraw reporting restrictions to promote transparency and development have not materialized, according to Human Rights Watch's Asia deputy director, Felim Kane.
"If foreign journalists try to cover Papua and West Papua, Indonesia's easternmost disgruntled provinces, they are at new risk: Refusing visas and pulling in blacklists," he said in a statement.
The absence of media oversight means that international pressure on the government is largely confined to Papua's neighbours.
In March, six Pacific nations - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands, the Solomon Islands - asked the UN Human Rights Council to investigate "all kinds of widespread human rights violations" in Papua, including the Paniai shootings.
These countries have also supported the Free Papua Movement.
Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesman Almanata Nassir, who did not care about the group's allegations, told reporters in Jakarta that "Indonesia is still practicing democratic institutions and freedom of the media, so evidence of human rights violations is hard to hide."
Locals want more foreign government attention.
When Dutch human rights ambassador Keith Wan Barr led the official delegation to Chayapura on May 4, local people broke their silence and cried "We want freedom," according to a person familiar with the matter, who also attended the meeting but requested anonymity.
Indonesia will hold its next presidential election in 2019, but Papuans say they are unlikely to throw Jokowi again.
Tribal Council President Gobi said "Jokowi's intentions were good, but he was surrounded by people who were involved in the Paniai shootings."
He wanted Jokowi to know that the Paniai people lived not only under the threat of greedy armies, but also with nothing, a region with little education and a lack of public health care.
Gobi said the Paniai people, like other Papuans, thought the votes they cast for Jokowi were debts he had to repay.
He said "they don't need money, they need justice."
Even under threat and intimidation, the families of the victims of the Paniai shooting continued their last symbolic revolt: Burying a victim's body opposite the military police post.
They know that justice may never come, but at least they won't let those culprits forget their crimes.
"My family was killed," he said.
What else can we do? '

3 (Xinhua) -- Samsung Electronics Inc on Tuesday released its first self-driving vehicle component, developed jointly with Harman International, as well as an information entertainment solution, an important move for the company to move into the vehicle electronics market, Reuters reported.
Samsung Electronics acquired Harman International about a year ago.
At this week's Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas, Samsung released car cameras with collision alerts, lane deflection alerts, cruise control features developed in partnership with Hamman.
Samsung plans to start shipping the camera system this year, which is built on technology such as automatic learning and augmentation.
Samsung also shows the "digital cockpit," even if the driver is not the owner, making the vehicle more personal, as it allows users to download drivers' information from mobile devices and clouds.

Blaze once again engulfs Dubai 'torch' skytower
A fire at a world's tallest residential building in Dubai on Friday forced hundreds of residents to flee the 337-metre, 79-storey ultra-high-rise building.
It was the second blaze to sweep a high-rise building in just two years, and happened to be a skytower known as the torch.
The building has been evacuated and no injuries have been reported and no cause of the blaze has been found.
'we were sleeping and then we were woken up by the fire alarm and people started screaming.
We ran down the stairs and it took about 10 minutes to run down the 50 floors, "a resident named George told Reuters.
Dubai's civil defence authorities said the fire brigade extinguished the blaze at around 4pm local time (00000 GMT) and was working to cool the building.
The Government indicated that efforts were being made to provide shelter for those affected.
The accident could reignite concerns around the world about the safety of high-rise buildings using exterior wall materials.
A survey conducted by the management of the Torch skyscraper following its 2015 fire found that most of the damaged objects were cladding exterior walls for decoration and insulation.
British police have said they believe problems with the thermal insulation and cover panel system at London's Glenfern building may have contributed to the rapid spread of fire in June, which killed about 80 people.
The Williams team also hinted that Massa might return, though he has announced his retirement.
With only a month to go until the opening of the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea on January 9, the atmosphere in South Korea has become increasingly thick as the Olympic torch is preheating from the south to the north and preparations are underway.
South Korean opinion expects the long-running inter-Korean talks to bring a "egg" to the countdown to the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang.
Pyeongchang Winter Olympics torch arrives in South Korea on November 1 last year.
The torch's upsurge was directly reflected in ticket sales at the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang.
Just over two months ago, sales of tickets to the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang also hovered at 32%, and the winter Paralympic ticket sales rate was only 4.3%.
But as the Winter Olympics organising committee chairman, Li Xuan, recently predicted to reporters, "with the Winter Olympics torch passing across South Korea, the heat of the Winter Olympics is rising and it is believed that ticket sales will soon improve."
According to South Korean media, as of January 3, ticket sales for the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang had reached 64%, and the winter Paralympic ticket sales had exceeded 50%.
In an effort to encourage foreigners to travel to the ROK, the Ministry of Justice also announced that foreigners visiting Korea to watch the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang would be extended for up to 120 days.
More than a fifth of US travellers carry contraband on board, survey finds
A survey of plane passengers found that more than 20 percent of passengers had intentionally or unintentionally taken illegal items through the U.S. Transportation Security Administration checkpoint, at least 6 percent of whom had unintentionally carried prohibited knives or other blade-edged objects.
Less than 1 per cent of passengers claimed that they had subsequently discovered that they had been travelling with firearms, ammunition or explosives.
The survey of more than 1,000 people by charter services firm Stratos Jet Charters Inc. also found that young travellers were more likely to blatantly ignore regulations.
Acknowledging that 19.7 per cent of respondents who tried to intentionally carry TSA contraband on board were millennials, compared with less than 15 per cent of the X generation population.
The most common items that deliberately slip through the TSA screening staff are food and drink.
More than 3 per cent admitted to having deliberately carried a blade through security, while 2.2 per cent of female respondents and 3.7 per cent of male respondents also indicated that they had deliberately carried a prohibited drug on board.
The company said the survey was conducted by travelers across the country to learn about the number of people who accidentally carry and intentionally carry contraband on board a plane.
Not surprisingly, the people most likely to carry the contraband through security - intentionally or unintentionally - are those who fly most frequently.
However, the company points out that the TSA guide is a bit complicated.
People are often unsure what and how much liquid they can carry.
So it is no surprise that the TSA has seized the most illegal liquid.
It was once thought that the TSA might have used books as contraband.
Domestic flights are allowed to carry liquids, but international flights are not allowed to carry them.
EPA chief Pruitt changes ideas on Obama-era emissions reduction regulations
A day after being sued by 15 states, EPA Director Scott Pruitt changed his earlier decision to delay implementation of Obama-era regulations to reduce emissions from smog air pollution.
Pruitt offered to make the change because, compared to previous governments, the Environmental Protection Agency was able to respond more quickly to the needs of environmental regulatory state agencies.
He did not mention the legal challenge brought by the federal appeals court against his former position.
The dispute focused on setting October 1 as the deadline for states to start meeting the 2015 ground ozone standards.
In June, Pruitt announced he would delay compliance for a year to give the Environmental Protection Agency more time to study the program and avoid "disrupting local decision-making or hindering economic growth."
Pruitt, who was Oklahoma's attorney general before being appointed by President Donald Trump, has long opposed the strictness of environmental regulations.
Since arriving in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly turned to blocking or delaying regulations opposed by the chemical and fossil fuel industries.
Wednesday's sudden reversal was the latest legal hurdle on Pruitt's regulatory return agenda.
Last month, a federal appeals court in Washington ruled that the head of the Environmental Protection Agency overstepped his authority in an attempt to delay implementation of the Obama administration's requirement that oil and gas companies monitor and reduce methane leaks.
In a statement released Wednesday night, Pruitt made a big turn in his approach to ozone standards, saying he wanted to strengthen the EPA's commitment to working with states to adopt complex procedures to reach new standards.
"Under previous administration, the EPA generally did not meet the specified deadline and then waited for activist groups and others to sue and then agreed to set a specified timetable by agreement," said Pruitt, who initiated more than a dozen prosecutions against the Environmental Protection Agency in his previous work.
"We don't believe in regulation through litigation, and we take the deadline seriously," he said.
We also take regulations and authorities seriously, "he said.
Despite this, the EPA statement said Pruitt may again use his "extension authorization and all other legally available authorizations" to ensure the provisions meet "good policy and the best information available."
Republicans in Congress are pushing for a broad rewriting of ozone layer regulations.
The House bill, approved last month, aims to delay the 2015 rule by at least eight years.
The measure has yet to vote in the Senate.
New York State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman led the state coalition to sue the EPA this week, saying it intends to maintain legal pressure.
"The EPA inversion - after we filed the lawsuit - was a significant victory for the health and safety of 6.7 million New Yorkers, with more than 115 million American communities directly affected by smoke emissions," Schneiderman said.
California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington state, as well as the District of Columbia, joined New York State in the case.
Ground ozone is formed by the reaction of common pollutants emitted by automobiles, power plants, refineries, chemical plants and other sources under sunlight in the atmosphere.
The resulting smoke can cause severe breathing problems for sensitive people, causing thousands of premature deaths each year.
Of course, public health advocates and environmentalists cheered Pruitt's surprising turnaround.
Lori Ann Bird, of the Center for Biological Diversity, said: "It is disturbing that this common-sense measure has come under intense pressure from the head of the department that protects the air we need to breathe."
"We have to fight to the end with the Trump administration's ideological campaign to cater to polluters and special interest groups," the statement read.

With the good sales situation, Xiaoshan flower wood production has also developed rapidly, said Shi Haiyong, deputy director of the Xiaoshan Forest Service.
In the past two years, Xiaoshan has expanded its area by 30,000 acres and has a total area of 180,000 acres.
Along with the expansion of planting area, the quality of seedlings is constantly improving, nursery nursery storage value is increasing, large size, high-quality seedlings are retained more, some seedlings are sold.
He also cautioned that, in the face of the current boom, producers should be calm and objective in their analysis, both to see that society's demand for flowers will be long-term and increasing, and to recognize that competition in the market will be more intense.
Beijing, July 13 (UPI) -- Somaltus filed a lawsuit in the Eastern Texas District Court accusing Apple of violating a battery technology patent it applied for in 2010.
The company has also previously sued Asus, Lenovo, Samsung, Sony and Toshiba with the same patent.
The lawsuit alleges that the iPhone 6s and similar Apple devices violated the U.S. patent of 7,657,386, known as the Integrated Battery Services System.
The plaintiff would like to receive cash compensation or a patent fee for tort equipment after the decision was announced.
Judging from the indictment, the plaintiff appears to believe that the iPhone's fast-charging feature violated the company's patent.
An iPhone with a fast-charging feature will quickly charge up to 80% of the electricity, followed by a trickle-down charge.
Somaltus is actually a so-called "patent hooligan" because the company does not offer obvious products and services and it is difficult to find relevant information online.
However, they have successfully reached out-of-court settlements with automakers such as Ford and Nissan over the patent.
The meeting considered that accelerating the development of informationization, promoting the integration and efficient utilization of resources, and upgrading the digitization and intelligent level of the industry are of great significance to the promotion of "China-made 2025" and mass entrepreneurship, innovation, and the development of new kinetic energy to improve the quality of life of the masses.

Trump has pressured Mexico to pay for border building walls, according to leaked phone records
The Washington Post leaked transcripts of calls between US President-elect Donald Trump and leaders in Mexico and Australia.
On January 27, in a call to Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto, Trump urged him to stop publicly saying he would not pay for the proposed border wall.
The US president reportedly expressed dissatisfaction with his public attack on the wall, which Putlant allegedly said to him: "You don't tell the media."
Trump pledged during the presidential campaign to build a wall along the southern border of the United States and solemnly announced that Mexico would pay for the project.
A transcript of his call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull was also released, which showed a tense exchange between them.
Trump told Turnbull that the US deal to deport refugees to Australia was "ridiculous," "obnoxious" and "stupid," and that he had advised the United States to ban refugee resettlement and now stick to a deal brokered by the Obama administration that would make him look like a "fool."
Trump hung up after telling Turnbull "this is the most unpleasant call today."

Moore Beach tragedy: Activists recreate racist lynching, justice
A 1948 Ford Mercury car passes through a crowd of onlookers in the small town of Monroe, Georgia, to rumble toward the tiny Moore Beach Bridge.
The vehicle contained four black passengers and a white driver, before the car arrived at the bridge and a group of white men with guns headed in front, blocking the car's way forward.
The head of the mob - a middle-aged man in a pinstriped suit - took a deep cigar and glimpsed the windscreen.
Passengers in the car were full of fear.
"We want - Roger!" The man shouted.
'drag him out of the car! '
A young black man was dragged down from the front passenger seat and screams pierced silence.
Fortunately, the horrific scene on July 22 was just a repeat.
But when "Roger" had a sleeve around his neck, almost all the onlookers gave a real gasp.
Since 2005, civil rights activists have returned to Moore Beach Bridge to recreate the scenes of two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Marcon, and George and Merry Dorsey - who were lynched by the Three K Party in 1946.
No one has ever been charged with murder.
"While we know who they are and even though we've seen them in the community, it's unbelievable that none of them have been arrested over the years," said Tyrone Brooks, who helped organize the repeat.
"It's a stain on history, a burden on our souls," said Sophie.
Brooks, 71, is a former Georgia congressman and lifelong activist.
For him, the repeat was a compelling call to action that reminded people in the Monroe community every year that injustice had never been corrected.
"We want to sue, we're going to close, we're going to heal, we want reconciliation, but we have to get justice first," he said.
"Unless we get justice, we will not be cured and reconciled," the statement read.
On 27 July 1946, the coroner put a sheet over the body of a Moore Beach vigilante victim.
According to FBI files obtained by NBC News, more than 50 men from Monroe and surrounding counties are suspected of involvement in lynching.
But none of them have been prosecuted.
While the suspect has been on the loose for decades, civil rights activists say the dual motive for carrying out lynching is well known throughout the town: Politics and sexuality.
In April 1946, a Supreme Court ruling allowed black citizens in Georgia to vote in primaries for the first time later that summer.
Around the same time, black tenant farmer Roger Malcolm stabbed white landlord Barnett Hirst in a fight that looked like it was for a woman, according to the FBI.
Brooks said the rumor in town was that Hearst slept with Malcolm's wife, Dorothy, and that her baby was not her husband's.
On July 25, 1946, prominent white landlord Loy Harrison spent $600 to bail Malcolm out of jail, the FBI said.
Dorothy and cousins McMurray and George Dorsey accompanied him to prison.
But as they returned from prison, fast to Moore Beach Bridge, a group of vigilante thugs surrounded the car.
"It turns out that it was Harrison who organized and ordered the murder," an FBI report concluded.
"It is clear that there is a conspiracy between state and local law enforcement that they are not only involved in the murder, destroying the evidence, but also concealing the identity of the witness," the statement read.
Brooks was very brief.
"This is a voting tragedy," he said.
"They were brutally murdered and it was the killer who sent a message to black people in this community: 'If you sign up and vote, you will have the same ending.'"
For nearly a decade, Cassandra Green has been responsible for dominating the annual repeat of the Moore Beach Bridge lynching.
Her expressive style is stark, gripping, with a deeply racist background that many hope is no longer in America.
It's hard to watch, it's harder not to look, but Green says that's the key.
"We don't want to talk about lynching because lynching makes us face the ugly face of all," she said.
'but if you don't listen to me or don't hear me tell my own experiences, I can't build relationships with you. '
This year's show began in June with nearly 30 actors - a dozen whites and the rest black - huddled in a room to hear an overview of Green's rehearsal performance.
Wade Malbaugh as co-director of Green.
He has been acting as a three-K party for years, but says the role is never easy.
"I feel dirty because I'm not," Malbaugh said.
"But I think it's very important to keep this history alive, because we don't want to go back to that era again," he said.
In the room, actors Darios Bradshaw and Nick Lascoe, who play Roger Malcolm and Barnett Hearst, rehearse their lines.
The play begins when Malcolm yells and pushes Hirst, resentful that he has slept with his wife, Dorothy.
"I said," Get out of my turf! "
Lascoe hit back.
Then they hit.
Then everyone (at least all black actors) erupted into laughter.
Green laughed the most.
"What's going on?!," Lascoe asked.
He was alarmed and confused.
Did I go too far?
"No," Green laughed.
"I just think white people don't say 'ah' when they hit back."
"Yes," another black actor quipped.
"Your tone has to be tough.
In this way, the energy in the room changed; the feeling of fraternity drove away discomfort.
Everyone tried to do so, not only to perform the play, but also to honour the four victims.
The scene starts again.
This time, Lascona said the word "ah" was sharp and powerful.
No one laughed.
The repeat was strong and swift.
Screams, gunshots, and then silence.
A woman in a funeral black dress stood by the actor's body and sang Billy Haldeau's mourning words "strange fruit."
Her voice crushed other words.
A hundred yards away, about forty spectators kept wiping sweat and tears.
Almost half of the audience was black and white.
There was a couple who had come to see the show from Ithaca, New York, and many were living near the road.
Brooks took them to Malcolm and Dorothy's cemetery for nearly eight hours, and everyone was suffering from Georgia's uncomfortable humidity.
Until then the murderer was still a fan, but now, standing on the same land where lynching took place, there was anxiety in the air.
When the song's final note disappears, Green asks people to get closer to the bodies that check the cast.
The children leaned over and looked at fake blood and bodies, whispering to each other.
"They're not really dead," a little boy muttered as if reminding himself.
Minutes later, Green thanked the crowd and then the show ended.
The actor threw away the lynching rope and wiped away tears.
Bradshaw hugged Mal Pao, the man in the suit who played the three-K party.
Nick Lascoe hugs his two colleagues and cries in their arms; the emotion in the performance eventually infects him.
"That's OK," one of the women whispered.
'we know your heart isn't like that.
You do it for a reason. '
After that, the audience sat down for dinner with the actor.
At the same table, a white couple from Atlanta chatted intimately with a black couple they had just met to talk about a repeat.
Dennis DuPrinsky had difficulty finding words to describe how she felt after watching.
"It's hard to imagine those horrible words and behaviors... that people like you speak out and do it because they look like you," she said.
"It really made me think lynching was still going on for me," she added, "and now this kind of thing is only called police shootings."
In the room, Tyrone Brooks sits on the table watching, tasting and echoing civil rights.
He said he had started planning for next year's show.
"Repeating is an inspiring way, because it describes the horrors we've experienced, but it's also very educational," he said.
'If you don't learn from it, this kind of thing could happen again.
Those who do not study and know their history are doomed to repeat it.
For the reform of gas market, the importance of the reform of "network independence" is self-evident.
7 (Xinhua) -- 13 operators were trapped in an explosion at the emulsification workshop of Kailuan Group Chemical Co. Ltd in the ancient metallurgical area of Tangshan City, Hebei Province, at 11: 25 a.m.
So far, one of the 13 people trapped has been rescued, rushed to hospital, and the remaining 12 are in intensive search and rescue.
It is understood the scene has now been cordoned off and local public security, fire and medical services are on scene to rescue.
According to eyewitnesses, there was a loud bang and a mushroom cloud emptied in time.
Tangshan Kailuan (Group) Chemical Co. Ltd. is located in Zhao Zhuang North, the ancient metallurgical region of Tangshan City, Hebei Province. It is the state-approved fixed-point production enterprise for civilian blasting equipment.

Beauty: Chinese Air Force Engineering University scientists study laser satellites used to clear space junk
Chinese scientists have come up with a bold and innovative proposal to use large lasers to clean up messy Earth orbits and destroy old satellites and their sky trash, according to the media.
Researchers at the Chinese Air Force Engineering University have written a paper titled "Study of space-based laser removal of small-scale space debris variant models," which describes how space debris can be irradiated by lasers into smaller, less harmful debris by using space-based platform lasers.
Space junk has been a concern for international space agencies for years, with NASA considering multiple options to track, detect and remove artificial debris, the report said.
The removal of large-scale space debris includes mega-networks used to clean and collect waste, as well as magnets that can be used to suck them out of orbit. Chinese scientists have conducted laser simulation studies to conclude that this would be an effective way to clean up Earth's orbit.
"(The simulation study) provides the necessary theoretical basis for the application of space debris removal technology for space-based platforms," the paper's summary said.
A 2014 study by U.S. defense giant Lockheed-Martin found about 200 threats a day for satellites that are running along the track.
High-speed debris moving along the Earth's orbit is seen as a serious threat to future space missions, described by experts at the European Space Agency as a "deadly series of threats," with high-speed debris increasing steadily over the past year.
Space is largely empty, but space next to Earth is becoming more crowded. Every satellite we send into space will eventually become another piece of debris orbiting the Earth, and over time the pieces will pile up.
The more debris, the higher the chance that a satellite still functioning would be hit by debris, thereby damaging or destroying a multimillion-dollar investment.
All space agencies have plans to clear space junk in the future, the report said.
NASA is considering using jet gas to reduce the speed of debris from orbit, and Europe is considering launching a satellite carrying a large net to capture debris and bring it back to Earth, with the Japanese idea of capturing debris with an electric chain.
For now, China has also proposed a solution to space junk by using a large laser to smash floating space debris into less harmful pieces.
Installing such a laser on a satellite would be enough to effectively clean up space, at least according to simulations, according to a paper published in the German journal Optics by a group of researchers at the Chinese Air Force Engineering University.
The only way to prove effectiveness is to conduct tests, and there are no arrangements for such tasks, but perhaps sooner or later someone will install a laser on a satellite and send it into space, the report said.
Once that is done, we can finally begin to eliminate space junk once and for all.

Person Group to reproduce 3000 jobs, slash dividend to revive business
On Friday, the British education group Person Group said it would cut 3,000 jobs and cut its interim dividend by 72 per cent, as it began another restructuring project to deal with operational pressures.
Chief executive John Fallon said most of the job cuts would take place in the second half of 2018 and the first half of 2019, following a reduction of 4,000 jobs in the previous restructuring.
Person Group announced in May that it plans to cut another ¬£300m ($394 million) in costs in its third cost-cutting project to revive operations hit by the rapid development of digital learning.
Last month, the company agreed to sell its stake in Penguin Langdon Books to partner Bertelsmann and published a report that its underlying sales rose 1 per cent to ¬£2.05 billion in the first half, but said the outlook was unchanged this year.
A few days ago, the IAAF gave a serious notice to fight the phenomenon and was prepared to impose a heavier penalty on offenders for life.
NATO soldiers killed in suicide bombings in Kabul
A military convoy was attacked by suicide bombers in the Afghan capital Kabul, killing a NATO soldier and wounding several others, officials said.
The NATO statement said five soldiers and an interpreter were wounded.
According to unconfirmed local reports, three civilians also died in the incident in the city's Karabag district.
It is the latest violent attack in Afghanistan - the Herat mosque bombing on Tuesday killed more than 30 people.
A suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul on Monday.
The bombings late Thursday saw joint Afghan and NATO coalition patrols hit by "individuals carrying improvised explosive devices," according to a NATO statement.
All of the injured are currently in stable condition and are being treated at a U.S. military hospital at Bagram Air Force Base, the statement said.
The growing Taliban and so-called Islamic State (IS) organization in the Karabakh region has raised serious concerns among NATO forces stationed near Bagram, according to reporters.
At least 1,662 civilians died in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, according to the United Nations, while the death toll in the capital was about 20%.
At least 30 people were killed in a suicide car bomb attack in Kabul's predominantly Shiite region at the end of July.
The Taliban claimed they carried out the attack.
A huge explosion in central Kabul on May 31 killed more than 150 people, the deadliest militant attack in the country since the U.S.-led multinational force toppled the Taliban in 2001.
The violence highlights the perilous security situation in the country as President-elect Donald Trump weighs whether to increase Afghanistan's support for its troops and police.
The suicide bombings in Kabul in recent weeks have also sparked a crisis of public confidence in the government and its policies, particularly Ashraf Ghani's reputation as president, according to reporters.
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) lawsuit overturns resolution to delay smog regulations
In his time in office, Obama imposed regulations requiring states to curb emissions that cause smog, and 15 states sued the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency for that provision, a day after the lawsuit was filed.
The EPA announced on Wednesday its decision to continue the so-called "2015 ozone-compliant zone" and promised the EPA would work with the states.
"We are confident in dialogue with our national partners and are committed to responding to it," EPA Director Scott Pruitt said in a statement.
Pruitt announced in June that the EPA planned to delay the implementation of the ozone-compliant zone standards until October 2018, with a delay of one year - according to which existing smog pollution in some areas should be measured to determine which areas should reduce emissions that cause smoke pollution to meet air quality standards.
Fifteen major Democratic states, as well as the District of Columbia, filed a lawsuit on Tuesday declaring the act illegal.
As part of the broader agenda, President Donald Trump's authorities have been working to revive various environmental regulations introduced by former President Barack Obama to spur economic growth.
But those efforts have sparked opposition from Democrats and conservative groups worried that more emissions could affect public health.
The EPA website claims that breathing air containing ozone "reduces lung function and increases respiratory symptoms," such as asthma.

Micky Garcia and Vasily Lochenko meet for first time to explore possible future showdown
The most high-profile 147-pound boxing match will be held soon after, with Vasily Lomachenko and Mackie Garcia, currently in a state of potential conflict, meeting for the first time on Thursday.
In their separate room at the ESPN office in Los Angeles, the unbeaten World Boxing Council lightweight champion Garcia pioneered down the corridor to greet World Boxing Organization ultra-featherweight champion Lomachenko.
At the Showtime boxing event on Saturday, the referee agreed that Garcia had beaten four-time world champion Adrian Broona to victory, and that the two boxers had become the top five in the heavyweight list.
Garcia stretched out his right hand and said, "Champion, how are you?
Good luck.
Lomachenko's victory over Miguel Marija in Saturday night's 7pm ESPN game preserved his status.
When the two of them were photographed, Lomachenko's agent, Ergis Clemens, noted that the potential confrontation between the two contestants depended on the "perfect size."
"I was lightweight before," Garcia said.
"I raised the level to fight Battarona (140 pounds), but I didn't weigh that much," said Klopp.
Compared to 140 pounds, I'm still a little worse off.
I want to go back to lightweight.
And he has to reach lightweight (135 pounds) and then we can fight.
And that's what fans want.
Then we will satisfy them.
Lochenko agreed.
"The boxing community needs this fight." "
Clemens asked him if he should press the charge, part of his strategy of having to make his debut with a 135-pound player later in the year to agree a date with Garcia (37-0, 30 knockouts) next summer, and Garcia is also interested in a fight against Jorge Linares-Luke Campbell after the Tribune lightweight championship on September 23.
"Because all the fans are asking this question, the fight may be on a sub-charge," Garcia said, after which he was open to playing on the network that offers the best financial options.
"We are the main characters.
It's impossible for others to have such a big focus.
As long as they're ready... "
Garcia admired Lomachenko as "a brilliant player" and could be on the scene to watch his boxing match on Saturday.
But Lomachenko hesitated to praise Garcia, saying he thought the three-point zone winner from Riverside looked "slow. Sorry, Mackie... you're going to be out."
Garcia said the focus was on showing the power of the fist and then boxing.
They all said they could feel the momentum of their boxing.
"This is a battle that must be fought,
Attention and warmth are beyond the reach of other boxing matches.
I'm very happy to compete, "Garcia said.
"I've been waiting for the top fighters and this time it's Mackie's turn," Lomchenko said.
It's going to be a great fight. '

Officials of the China Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) expressed strong expectations of a return to production in the steel industry, which has been suppressed by limited electricity production.
Although at present the steel mills have not received a clear notice from the local government that energy conservation and reduction efforts have been completed, the industry estimates that around 15 December 2010, the original production of steel mills will be completed and steel prices will begin to bear pressure.
There has been no notification of the end of the limit, but in practice the pressure is already much smaller than in September and October, a private steel company in Hebei province told reporters.
In some parts of Hebei, there have been a number of documents of limited production, and at one time the production of enterprises has been restricted by forced slugging.
Journalists know from local enterprises that steel mills in most parts of Hebei have been reworked and the pressure to limit production has eased.
My steel network analyst Zhang Tianshan predicts that the end demand for building steel will gradually weaken because of the winter in the north.
Combined with the gradual end of energy conservation and reduction, most steel mills will be largely reproduced by December 15, and products will reach local markets by New Year's Day.
The increase in the supply of resources will put some pressure on the price of steel, which is now on the rise.

Latest results from Sweden's age assessment test for asylum seekers released
Swedish asylum-seekers tested the latest method of medically assessing their age, with the latest results showing that more than 80 per cent of participants were judged to be over 18, but not everyone believed in their accuracy.
The Swedish National Centre for Forensic Medicine began the test earlier this year.
After being accused of failing to accurately assess the age of some of the refugees who claimed to be minors, the Swedish Migration Board (Migrationsverket) designed the tests to allow for more accurate age assessments during the asylum process.
To date, the Swedish Migration Board has sent 6,880 testers, and the Centre for Forensic Medicine has now published results for a total of 2,481 testers between mid-March and 31 July 2017.
Eighty per cent (2002) were convicted of being 18 years of age or older, while in another 25 cases, the Swedish National Centre for Forensic Medicine found that subjects "may be 18 years or older."
In 432 tests, the result was that the person was "probably under 18."
Tests are only for people with age doubts.
The results are consistent with those of previous months, according to John Gramson of the Center for Forensic Medicine.
He told The Local: "The data is not very different from the previous months and the numbers are very consistent."
The high percentage of cases judged to have reached the age of 18 does not necessarily mean that the asylum-seekers lie about their age.
In May, the ACCC published 581 test results and said 442 "indicated that the subjects had turned 18 or older."
News newspaper Svenska Dagbladet investigated the results of 581 tests published and found that 243 of them had publicly said they would turn 18 this year.
An X-ray examination of wisdom teeth, an MRI scan of the joints, followed by an analysis of the results by dentists and radiologists, has also been questioned in some areas.
One of the skeptics is Claude Marcus, an endocrinologist at Caroline College whose work includes assessing people's biological maturity to determine whether they experience puberty earlier or later than normal.
He told news.com.au Metro: "I have reason to think so, and I don't think the measurements used should be.
It is inaccurate to determine the biological age in this way.
If we can't guarantee accuracy, we shouldn't pretend we're doing it. '
But Grayson, of the Centre for Forensic Medicine, defended the accuracy of the tests: "By and large it can be said that the risk of determining a child as an adult is small."
The greatest risk is that the person is just under 18 years of age, which is about 10 per cent.
West Virginia governor announces change of party
On Thursday night, West Virginia Democratic Governor Jim Justice announced at a Trump rally that he would change the party.
"Like it or not, the Democrats are gone," said the governor.
"Today, after a lot of prayers and a lot of thinking, I'm going to tell you... today I'm going to tell you, as West Virginia, that I can no longer help you as a Democratic governor."
The rally erupted in cheers.
"So tomorrow, I'm going to change the party to the Republican Party," Justine added.
"As a coach, I'm going to tell it's time to start another game," said Klopp.
Trump earlier promised a major announcement at a rally in West Virginia.
Mr. Trump won 42 percent of West Virginia's votes, and Justine did not support Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justine was named the state's only billionaire in 2016, according to Forbes.
Forbes noted that he inherited his father's coal industry and owned coal mines in all five states.
He is currently worth about $1.59 billion.
Meanwhile, the Republican National Committee issued a statement late Thursday saying: "Governor Justine's change of party is another blow to the Democratic Party, which, far from preventing our country from becoming great again, will make our country great again."
"The Democratic Party currently has only 15 governors and has the lowest number of control of state legislatures, and Governor Justine's statement is the latest rejection of such a party that has lost leadership from top to bottom and cannot find positive unifying slogans," Republican National Committee chairwoman Rona McDaniel said in a statement to CBS News.

Sebastian Coe praises Russia for 'frank' apology over doping scandal
On Thursday, the president of the International Association of Athletics Federations, Sebastian Coe, praised Russia's apology for the doping scandal and said the apology was "candid" but reiterated that it was not the time for Russia to rejoin the sport.
Russian Athletics Federation president Mitri Chirac told the IAAF conference on the eve of the World Athletics Championships that his country was right to be banned from the sport and he was determined to fight doping.
He said he regretted that "all athletes who have won gold and silver in the competition have been denied medals."
Despite his comments, the IAAF General Assembly voted in favour of maintaining the ban after the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) report found evidence of Russian state-sponsored doping, which was imposed in November 2015.
"I think today's response was very candid, very candid introduction," IAAF President Cho told reporters.
"The whole council and the IAAF are pleased... the Russian Federation has admitted to having experienced a very scorching period and is doing everything possible to ensure that Russia is able to re-enter the race," it said.
Ko said he was also "delighted" that Russia accepted the criteria for re-entry.
"I think it was a very constructive day and thought we had made some progress, but the IAAF General Assembly supported the panel's recommendation and it is not yet time to reinstate Russia's eligibility," said Ko.
"We need to do what we can in the next few months to normalize this situation," he said.
Our guiding principle has always been the desire to separate clean athletes from contaminated systems, "he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes meet the IAAF's strict standards and will compete as neutral players at the World Athletics Championships in London on Friday.
The head of the IAAF panel, Vladimir Anderson, said on Monday that Russia had not yet met a number of criteria to resume entry.
Speaking to the IAAF Council in London, he told reporters that drug testing was still underdone and banned coaches were still coaching.

On January 18, the yuan was trading at 6.4401 against the US dollar, with the median price falling 66 basis points on the previous trading day, ending its previous five-year surge.
Overnight markets, the greenback, the dollar index out of the V-word shape, as of 07: 30 BST on 90.8900.
The Fed's publication of the economic brown paper showed that almost all of the 12 Fed regions reported moderate to moderate growth in economic activity in early 2018 and remained optimistic about the outlook for the year.
Meanwhile, the U.S. unemployment rate remained at 4.1% in December, the lowest since 2000, and companies are expected to raise wages in the coming months.
Fed officials generally agree that tax changes are a factor in supporting this moderately stronger economic outlook, with the Fed predicting a 2.5 per cent growth in 2018 and three rate hikes.
Market sources point out that, in recent times, the ECB's monetary policy has tightened expectations of a rise in the euro, the dollar index has slipped and the renminbi has risen sharply against the dollar, but it is unlikely that the ECB will soon adjust its policy stance, after short-term fluctuations in the foreign exchange market will return to fundamentals and the continued smooth operation of the renminbi is a big probability event.
It is worth noting that the attractiveness of renminbi assets to foreign investors has become increasingly apparent as markets have been more stable in their expectations.

This morning, the site of the explosion was a chemical plant in Xiaoji Town, Xinxiang County, Henan Province, according to netizens.
The new Beijing News reporter learned that the chemical plant is a new township of Henan Province six-way industrial company.
Public information indicates that the above-mentioned enterprises were established in February 2002 and include the manufacture of chemical products.
This afternoon, the Propaganda Department of Xinxiang County Council responded that the explosion occurred at 7: 50 a.m. and that the fire was under effective control and that one person suffered minor injuries.
The Beijing News reporter noted that as early as 2015, the chemical plant had been exposed by the media, including Henan TV, for irregularities.

How does football's financial rules affect Neymar's move to Paris?
Rules designed to prevent unrestricted spending by European giants football clubs will not prevent Nimal from moving to France's Paris Saint-Germain Football Club (PSG) at a record price.
The result is a further relegation of the European Football Association (UEFA) to Paris Saint-Germain Football Club, the governing body of European football matches, which has the power to ban teams from the Champions League.
The 2011 UEFA Financial Fair Race Rules (FFP) means Paris Saint-Germain Football Club must finally prove that Nemar's transfer is funded without huge losses.
The Barcelona club has paid 22 million euros ($262 million) to cover only the cost of the Brazilian player's settlement, and Nemar's salary will be as high as tens of millions of dollars a year.
Here are some of the financial implications of Nemal's move to France.
Given that the team is funded by the coarse Qatari ruling family, Paris Saint-Germain Football Club can certainly sign Nemar with cash and incorporate him into other star-studded battles.
Clubs can spend huge sums of money on players, but they have to use legitimate sources of income to make up for the huge sums they spend, allowing them to break even in football-related business.
The Financial Fair Race Rules were conceived by Michel Platini after he was elected president of UEFA in 2007.
The former French player believes that for clubs that are heavily indebted for the pursuit of success, if banks or owners withdraw their support funds, they are actually cheating, putting clubs at risk of destruction.
In 2011, the focus of the Rules shifted from club debt to club loss monitoring.
The change means that Roman Abramovich, the business model used by Roman Abramovich when he bought the Chelsea club in 2003 to buy a club with potential and then spend heavily on improving the team and building it into a global brand, is now facing a tougher situation.
Clubs could lose ‚Ç¨30 million in the three-year rule assessment period as of 2018.
Although Abu was derogated from by the then-chairman in 2015, UEFA successor Aleksander Ceferin remains committed to stopping excessive spending.
"Of course the Rules have not lapsed and we will certainly strengthen future regulations," Andrea Traverso, UEFA's director of rules-related affairs, told The Associated Press last week.
While the Paris St Germain Football Club will pay off Nemar's buyout clause in a lump sum, it can also be allocated for an amount based on accounting purposes within the contract period.
Nemar has signed a five-year deal, so the transfer fee could show up to ‚Ç¨44.4 million in annual accounts over the next five years.
The first wave of rule sanctions imposed in 2014 brought the most severe sanctions against the Paris St Germain Football Club, as well as the Manchester City club of Abu Dhabi.
Paris Saint-Germain Football Club was fined ‚Ç¨60 million ($82 million at the time), later reduced to ‚Ç¨20 million, and called for the team to reduce players to 21 in the 2014-15 Champions League rather than the normal 25.
UEFA is staring at clubs that are trying to raise revenue by hook-up with club owners to deceive financial regulators.
While Qatar's companies can sponsor the Paris St Germain Football Club, UEFA will not see it as a legitimate income if the amount of sponsorship is deemed to exceed the standard market price.
It was something that happened in 2014, when UEFA ruled that the Qatar Tourist Board's sponsorship of the Paris St Germain Football Club was overstated.
It was reported that part of Nemar's income at Paris Saint-Germain Football Club could come from payments made by the 2022 Qatar World Cup organising committee.
But both the Paris St Germain Football Club and the organising committee have denied that Nemar will serve as World Cup ambassador, and it is easy for UEFA regulators to make such a move.
Recent sanctions against Paris Saint-Germain Football Club mean UEFA will be more vigilant about any attempt to bypass the rules.
A person familiar with the matter said on Thursday that UEFA had not had a pre-discussion with Paris Saint-Germain Football Club about Nemal's transfer.
All of them contacted the Associated Press only in an unnamed capacity because they were not authorized to discuss the situation at Paris Saint-Germain Football Club.
Last published accounts showed Paris Saint-Germain Football Club had operating income of ‚Ç¨542.4 million in 2015-16, making a profit of more than ‚Ç¨10 million.
The accounts for the previous fiscal year have not been released.
Paris Saint-Germain Football Club expects Nemar's joining will bring the gospel to sponsorship events, franchises and jersey sales.
The club expects to grow at least 30 per cent after the signing of Neimal.
It was clear that the Spanish league was furious to see one of its biggest players leave, trying to block Nemar's move and claiming that the Paris Saint-Germain Football Club violated the rules.
"This is a clear illustration of a 'financial doping' that is the same for the club and the country," said Javier Tebbas, president of the Spanish league, referring to Qatar, which has ultimate ownership of Paris Saint-Germain Football Club.
Arsene Wenger, the head coach of the Arsenal team (the club's owner is the US sports tycoon), has reservations about the state-funded club's attitude to the Western Bulldogs.
"It is the consequence of ownership that has revolutionised the whole ecology of football over the past 15 years," Wenger said on Thursday.
"Once the country owns the club, then something will happen," he said.
That would make it very difficult to comply with the rules, because there are many different ways or interests for a country to ask big players to represent a country, "he said.

According to Apple, the iCloud service in mainland China will be transferred to Guizhou, the cloud, from February 28.
"Cooperation with Guizhou on the cloud will allow us to continue to improve the speed and reliability of iCloud services, as well as the new rules that China's cloud services must be operated by local businesses," Apple said.
The data that the user previously stored on iCloud will also be kept in iCloud during the deactivation and will not be lost.
If the user wishes to use the iCloud service after 28 February, new terms and conditions will need to be accepted to ensure that the account is reactivated and relocated to Guizhou.
Meanwhile, Apple stressed in its statement that "Apple has a strong data privacy and security protection mechanism and will not create a back door in any of our systems."
The iCloud Guian New Area main data center will also be Apple's first data center project in China and will be used to store data from Chinese Apple users.
When built and put into use, Chinese users upload and download data without having to travel back and forth across long distances between China and the US, increasing speed and reducing delays.

The 3D Carnival animated film "Bean Fu" premieres in Wuhan on the 25th day of the premiere of "Beanfu" director Zou Xuan, the animated director of "Beanfu," the film soundtrack producer and Emmy winner Tom Disher.
Based on the story of Liu Ann, Huainan Wang of the Han Dynasty in traditional Chinese culture, "Liu Ann makes tofu, because of the wrong," it tells the story of the protagonist "bean fu" from a beans into a human form, overcoming difficulties and insisting on the dream of the fairy.
Wudang Mountain in Hubei is one of the world's cultural heritage sites published by the United Nations and the birthplace of Taoist culture and martial arts.
The director, Zou Xu, revealed that he had travelled with the team to Wudang Mountain in the early part of the film.
He said that the story of "Beanfu" took place during the period of the West Han Emperor, in the background of Huainan Wang Liu'an, the hero of "Beanfu" was a beans that accidentally turned into a human form in Liu Anan's refinery.
In addition to Wudang Mountain, the birthplace of Taoist culture, Hubei also has deep roots with China's long-standing traditional instrument, the clock.

Nostalgia contagion sweeps the market - Hatchimal and Detective Double
Retelling the story is a nostalgia for the actors "80s scenery and the rubbish era of the '90s (David Wayne and Michael Showalter made the sketch comedy" The Nation "for MTV); as well as nostalgia for nostalgia itself, nostalgia for 2001; a year before many stars such as Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Luther had yet to wind up.
As a cultural artwork, it is a parody and embodiment of the permanent memories of our Facebook era.
But as a series, it feels like time isn't enough.
The first day of the camp came back strongly, but not only because of its absurd humor (the plot is about an original story about a canned vegetable that speaks, dubbed by H Jon Benjamin).
Doubling up on the plot - the middle-aged actor playing a child at the age of mash-ups - makes the inability to return to the past a funny part.
Ten years later, when adults actually play adults, the mood is not too deep-rooted, and imitation is more diffuse, including improvisation of 90s-tracking films such as "The Hands of the Cradle."
At one point, a character caught up in an Apple notebook, some straight-line skates and "some other 1991 stuff."
Many of the core stories are the same.
Mr. sweetheart (Mr. Thwaite) has now become a novelist, but he still hasn't forgotten Katie (Margaret Morrow).
Victor (Ken Marino) still holds the man.
There is another sinister conspiracy involving Ronald Reagan (also played by Mr. Showalter), instigated by George H.W. Bush (Michael Ian Blake).
As always, the best part of this series is interlude.
It was particularly interesting to see the forever young Mr. Luther, who flaunted Matt Dillon's soul patch in the film "The bachelorette," before Andy in the campus giant now feels like a giant.
It was a moment of random madness that might have powered the film, like the recursive "Seven Years of Life" series, until it came to what I thought was the logical conclusion: "Ha Ha Camp: Twenty Years Later," its final act of getting the cardboard to see the film premiere of "Hatch Camp."
Meanwhile, Amazon's "Detective Double" tells different nostalgic content: The Cold War revisionist "American Spy Dream," the film "The City of the Pole" and even the East-West wrestling imagery "GLOW: Gorgeous Women's Wrestling League."
The comedy, created by Brian Gatwood and Alexandro Tanaka, was pushed onto the TV screen by director Rhys Thomas: A sibling comedy set in the 1980s in Romania, telling the story of two Bucharest officials fighting for truth, atheism and the Marxist-Leninist route.
The main characters - the hard-line Grigor and the idealistic Ethel - are played by Little Floyd Pierce and Cornelius Ulich respectively, with dialogue by Channing Tatum (also executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt in English.
It's a wonderful idea.
But it's not just an idea.
There are some good visual gimmicks (police watch chess on TV, because Americans like to play football).
And there are a host of celebrity actresses - including Jenny Slater, Nick Offerman, MahSarah Hashbaz Ali and Kolo Sevigny - who have forged a wonderful vocal extravaganza.
But Detective Double is so committed to creating a noisy propaganda comedy - there's a Reagan mask-wearing killer - and it usually plays.
The six-episode-long television was slightly dragged and the comic effect was not released fast or frequently.
"Detective Twin" was edited tighter, and there was a better satirical effect when Gregor Ethel repeatedly visited the US embassy, where two fat men gobbled up a pile of burgers.

In recent interviews, journalists have learned that there has been a general decline in the benefits of steel, rail transit, ships and machinery manufacturing in the Northeast.
Some experts believe that in the current situation, the new revival of the northeast industry is not only related to the national economic recovery, but will also have an impact on the long-term development of China's manufacturing industry and international competitiveness.
The general decline in the benefits of enterprises in traditional industries and the serious decline or even loss in the manufacturing benefits of the raw materials industry and heavy machinery equipment are the first manifestations of the northeastern industry in the current downturn.
In the past, low-end and primary products have been the main characteristics of the economic downturn, but the high-end, low-end industrial products of the northeast traditional industries have been affected.
In previous years, Angang Group (Weibo) has focused on the development of high-end panels such as container boards, steel rails, boatboards and civilian home appliances in recent years, but sales of these varieties have declined significantly this year, particularly as the sales of ship boards have fallen by 50% from the same period last year.

Japan's Olympic Committee said recently that the Japanese delegation's gold medal target for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics was 30 and advanced to the top three in the gold medal table.
Last October, the head of Japan's Olympic Committee's sports committee, Shan Yu-yu, said he expected the total number of gold medals at the Tokyo Olympics to be 2.5 times higher.
At the 2016 Rio Olympics, the Japanese delegation finished sixth with 12 gold medals.

Yesterday, the second meeting of the four people of Guang'an was simple.
Walk into the Canton Convention Center, there are no signs, no teacups, not even a bottle of ordinary mineral water.
Instead, a simple banner, a meeting place, a simple green paper bag containing conference material, a green paper cup-filled tea.
The conference material was a little thinner than it had been before, and a few papers summarized the theme and agenda of the meeting.
"To save for the people, to be frugal is to be frugal," said Wang Cheng, a representative of the People's Congress of Guang'an.

Bank of England to maintain 0.25% interest rate
The Bank of England will announce at a later date that interest rates will remain unchanged after weak economic growth and loose inflation have dashed hopes of a hike.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain "weak" as it controls interest rates while tightening household incomes.
Policymakers at the bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted 6-2 to maintain a 0.25% interest rate, while a handful of members this month called for higher interest rates, even as weak economic growth has weakened the boost.
In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank of England reduced growth forecasts for 2017 and 2018 to 1.7 per cent and 1.6 per cent, respectively, warning that household income tightening would continue, while inflation would soar to nearly 3 per cent in the fall.
But it says interest rates will need to be raised in the next few years to curb inflation from Brexit, while borrowing costs may need to be raised more dramatically than expected in financial markets.
Large-scale economic promotion policies were implemented a year ago by Brexit, and members voted to withdraw it.
The Bank of England will announce a halt to its regular funding plan to provide cheap money to banks from February next year, although the bank said it now needs an additional ¬£15bn under the scheme.
In the minutes of the interest rate decision, the Bank of England said: "Gross domestic product (GDP) remains weak in the near term in the MPC's core forecast, as households' real income tightening will continue to suppress consumption."
On interest rates, the bank repeatedly reiterated the need for "a certain monetary policy tightening" to suppress inflation, and that it needed to be "greater" than market expectations.
The market is now expected to achieve its first increase in the third quarter of next year and a second in 2020.
But the bank stressed that any hike would be "slow" and "restrained."
Growth forecasts for this year and next are on a downward trend, compared with 1.9 per cent and 1.7 per cent in May.
The bank maintains a 1.8% growth forecast for 2018.
The pound fell against the dollar and the euro followed.
Sterling fell 0.5 per cent to 1.31 against the dollar and 0.4 per cent to 1.11 against the euro.
Before the decision to remain unchanged, rising expectations were dashed by recent unpromising growth figures, with GDP rising to 0.3 per cent in the second quarter and 0.2 per cent in the previous three months.
The bank said third-quarter growth is likely to remain at 0.3%, although it will rise slightly by the end of the year.
Ordinary households have been hit by inflationary surges, while wage growth has been negligible, and the Bank of England's recent inflation report did not bring them any good news, as it said austerity would be worse before it got better,
And saying monetary policy "cannot prevent" a blow to earnings over the next few years, but wages are expected to recover "on a large scale" at the end of the three-year forecast.
At the same time, the economy will be spurred to offset the impact of some of the low consumption, as the value of the pound weakens and demand for British goods soars.
The decision came a year after a shocking EU referendum sent the pound plummeting, cutting interest rates to 0.25 per cent in August.
The Bank of England estimates it could take four years to fully influence prices and the UK economy.
The call for an interest rate hike before the bank unveiled its latest interest-rate ruling came as inflation made it worse for the already stressed average household, while three policymakers called for an interest rate hike to 0.5 per cent in July.
Inflation retreated from 2.9 per cent in June to 2.6 per cent last month, although the Bank of England said it was expected and would rise again in the coming months.
The bank said that, relative to its 2 per cent target, the excess was already the final bottom of the weak pound.
Andrew Monterrey, director of the Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: "Given the recent fall in swaps, the mortgage market appears to be becoming more competitive again as lenders strongly appeal for more business and look forward to a positive posture for this year.
Such a market looks particularly favorable for those who may be close to ending existing deals, as remortgages (many of which are free of fees and low interest rates) are becoming more popular.

NHS England's controversial HIV drug kicks off
Patients will be able to get "transformative" HIV prevention treatment starting in September after the dust settled on the High Court's offer of drug funding for the NHS.
NHS England has announced that pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), a drug that can be taken before sex, has been shown to reduce the risk of infection in high-risk populations by about 86 per cent, with the health service now offering the drug to an estimated 10,000 people through a three-year preliminary trial.
It agreed to fund the trial after the Court of Appeal last year backed a High Court ruling that said the NHS was entitled to pay for PrEP despite the NHS claiming local authorities should fund the drug.
The move announced on Thursday was called a "major new intervention" by NHS chief executive Simon Stevens, while the National AIDS Trust (NAT) described it as a "critical moment."
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to register sexual health clinics, with more clinics to join in October, followed by full implementation across England in April 2018.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is an HIV drug taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
Tests showed that PrEP could significantly reduce HIV transmission among people at risk of infection.
Taking PrEP before sex means there are enough specific drugs in the body to prevent HIV infection.
The drug can be taken daily or two hours before sexual intercourse.
Those eligible for treatment included gay, bisexual men, transgender people and positive HIV carriers who were not successfully treated.
The clinic will identify those who are eligible and who agree to the test, including men, women, transgender persons and their sexual partners, whether HIV infection status receives antiretroviral treatment for unknown persons.
People who live in England and are registered as GPs can also sign up at a sexual health clinic where they attend.
The scheme will cost ¬£10m and the NHS England branch has signed a contract to buy the drugs this week after international competitive procurement.
The test aims to assess the full potential of PrEP by collecting clinical evidence on how it is positioned, absorbed and implemented on a large sample basis.
Mr Stevens said: "This major new intervention should be a broad and increasingly successful complement and reinforcement to HIV prevention.
This is yet another milestone in more than 30 years of action worthy of progress in addressing the major health challenges of humanity. "
"This is a critical moment in the fight against AIDS," said Deborah King, chief executive of the British AIDS Trust (NAT).
If it does target populations in need and at risk, pre-exposure prophylaxis offers the possibility of changing the AIDS epidemic in the UK.
Starting in September, people at high risk of HIV will have access to a new tool that is permitted through the NHS-funded experiment in England, which is truly self-executing and does not require consultation with sexual partners, which will lead to improvements in the lives of many.
We are both in favour of this announcement.
Ian Green, chief executive of the Terrence Higgins Trust, said: "The priority now is to make sure that trials are pushed out quickly across the country and that none of the people infected with the virus can fall.
Now that we have bought PrEP test drugs, we are ready to protect more than 10,000 people at high risk of HIV, "he said.
The shadow public health minister, Sharon Hodgson, claimed: "After months of delays and government procrastination, the start of PrEP's first trial is popular and should come sooner.
The evidence shows how this drug can bring about change as part of our approach to preventing HIV and ending the spread of this deadly infection.
This test will give us a further and full understanding of PrEP's strengths.
It is important now to launch this test nationwide as soon as possible in order to protect people exposed to HIV and to help us further end the spread of HIV in society. "

High-quality living: Apply loft and clever design to make the Earl's House small apartment a spacious home
Joanne Ray, a former banker, was keen to renovate the house, and in 2014 she moved from her big house in Knightsbridge to the Earl's House.
The apartment is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne-style terrace - Joanne doesn't pack up to sell it, which is a powerful testament to the new design.
"Before that, I lived in a bigger house in Knightsbridge with my ex-boyfriend," says Joanne.
"I was looking for the right house for the offer.
I saw this apartment in the Earl's Palace, and it had high ceilings.
I would like to make an offer that day.
The 1,000-square-foot apartment has now completed a thorough overhaul since its first visit.
The apartment was originally a complex single room - needed to cross the kitchen to get to the bedroom - and Joanne then wanted to add storage space and loft to take full advantage of the plentiful ceiling height.
"I want high ceilings, big windows, plenty of light.
That's my request, "she said.
To that end, she hired Elvan Azadi from the Duck & Shed Building and Design Studio (located in Notting Hill) to use the 12.5-foot-high ceiling to elaborate a home that was not just a development project, but a place where Joanne lived.
The height of the ceiling is not enough to add two up and down spaces, so the architectural challenge is to create a loft that is high enough to stand.
Elvan must play creative thinking so that this can be solved.
"The steel structure is quite complex," he explained.
"We have to arrange the space, make it up and down, and don't need to shrug our shoulders.
It's not just about building a simple platform, it's about starting the steel so that it's at the right height to achieve it.
Through this arrangement, Ervan is able to get two full-body rooms in the space - which can add many interesting elements.
The loft uses Retrouvius-branded retro copper windows overlooking glamorous living areas.
Gold furniture with mirrors, silver small pieces of furniture and Serge Mouille retro lighting laid the overall style.
The use of mirrors plays an important role in increasing the atmosphere, space and light.
Putting a mirror on both ends of the short corridor can make it look longer.
In the kitchen, a splash board with a mirror is like a window to another room.
In the basalt, a small lattice with a mirror provides a storage space for Joanne to store cutlery and glassware.
The beautiful living room has an engrossing sense of space, which can be collected when the kitchen is unused.
The folding kitchen is nothing new.
But what's unique about this folding kitchen is a garage-style lift door.
"There is some engineering knowledge involved here," Ervan explained to the reinforced-reinforced MDF door.
"It's using the principle of balance, so it's easy to slide when you push the door," he said.
With the ingenious use of space and possessions, Joanne gained an extra 16 square metres, an extra bedroom and an improved layout.
"Ultimately, what you sell is the size of the house - or your property valuation is based on the size of the house," says Elvan.
"Basically, a real estate agent would walk into the room and calculate it based on the size of the floor," he said.
They will try to increase the occupancy space while using high-quality materials, thus bringing luxury to this space.
"The material is all you pick for yourself, so it helps create an emotional bond at home," says Elvan.
'you don't fall in love with the power on the wall.
These things are important, but they don't hold your heart.
It turns out that by good design and adding extra acreage, standard apartments can shake up and make you marvel.
In fact, you might, like Joanne, choose to live.

Two brothers staged $500 million real estate empire for fight
Forty years after its Italian family founded the dynasty, the brothers fought for more than $500 million, one of Victoria's largest real estate empires.
Colin De Lutis, a former Carlton Football Club director and developer, lives in a mansion in the Tucala district, while the three doors are left at the residence of his brother Paul, who took him to the Supreme Court over the division of their real estate and business assets.
Paul had been hoping to get out of the family business since 2014, but the brothers had a heated argument about the asset split in the Supreme Court.
The brothers, as well as their mother, have 38 real estate properties worth more than $500 million that have been accumulated since the family bought Smith Street in Collingwood in 1973.
There, the family founded Westco Jeans and gradually developed it to the size of 160 retail chains.
In 1999, the company sold for $85 million.
After that, the money was put into real estate, and the De Rutis family's portfolio now includes city office buildings, the Brunswick and Sorrento development projects, the Gold Coast and Buller Hill apartments, and suburban shopping centres.
Under an agreement with his late father, Colin, who is known by his younger brother Paul as the "prime mover and dominant figure" of the De Rutis family, owns about two-thirds of the company's assets, while Paul accounts for about a third.
Documents filed with the court said Colin owned the property, which was converted, for $316 million, while Paul owned property worth $176 million.
Paul came to believe that the division of real estate and cash proved to be the crux of the talks.
"Colin's proposal for a division of property left him with what I thought was the best property," he wrote in a first court affidavit in 2015.
On Friday, the Supreme Court held its first hearing after several mediation failures.
Now the brothers are still vying for control of the existing business, with Paul claiming Colin has kicked him out.
Colin denies this and accuses Paul of poor management of certain real estate.
In an early affidavit filed by Colin, he expressed a desire to settle the dispute.
"My Italian tradition dictates that the family is the most important option," he wrote.
The cost of the case keeps climbing, and there are hundreds of pages of affidavits, emails, and company reports from Deloitte, Pitcher Partners, Charter Keck Cramer, Allan Myers, QC, and senior lawyers hired by both sides.
Ms. De Rutis and her late husband, Luigi, both immigrants from Italy, ran the popular food and delicatessen from the late 1950s and bought a shop in Brunswick in the early 1970s.
They used collateral to buy the Collingwood property, where Colin opened the family's first jeans shop.
Colin said, "I read high three," where he founded Westco, "when Paul was still small (about 10 years old)."
Anna de Rutis said she and Luigi, who died in 2012, wanted to be able to pass the property peacefully to their son
"Luigi often said to me that he would never want the brothers to end up in court," she wrote.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, were no longer members of the De Rutis group, and Colin said Mark paid him $10 million when he left the company and paid $26 million to Luke.
Paul said both Luke and Mark had "expressed dissatisfaction with their property division clause."
According to TV star Eddie McGuire's biography, published in 2015, although Colin is a former AFL club board member, he has kept a low profile.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul on Friday, as well as their lawyers.
But only Colin responded via text message, saying that because the case had been brought to court "I can't really say too much."
"It is very, very sad that my brother Paul chose to sue me and bring our family affairs to court," he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote in a court filing that he had tried to meet his brother's demands.
"Our father did not want to see Paul and I finally have such a dispute," he said, adding that he "remains hopeful that the dispute will be resolved."
On Friday, that hope seemed dashed.
"Our problems will be resolved through the courts in the near future," Colin wrote.

Trump's new chief of staff plans to limit presidential media time
Others tried but failed.
John F. Kelly might really be able to.
If that's true, then he's the first person.
The new White House chief of staff plans to limit the flow of information to President Trump - including news media reports - in a bid to keep big bosses smoother, according to Politico, a US political news website.
Here's a quote from journalist Josh Dowsey:
"When the new White House Chief of Staff, John F. Kelly, began his first day of work with senior officials to gather for discussion, he pointed out that he was going to address one of the main issues of President Trump's admission to the White House: Bad information going to the president."
Kelly told the officials that receiving good information would help the president make better decisions, so that information would need to be in his hands - either in writing or in the form of a briefing.
Kelly's diagnosis seemed like a mould, but others had tried to tame it by spying on Trump's media time, but ended up in failure.
President Trump has a long history of TV addiction - and now in the White House, his habit of watching TV is still deepening.
In February, former campaign adviser Sam Neberg told Politico: "If candidate Trump is frustrated with unfair coverage, it would be helpful to let him know that he has also received positive coverage in credible channels.
Politico's Tara Palmeeri wrote at the time that "based on the experience of six former campaign officials, the habit of controlling Trump's tweets is focused on ensuring that the media messages he personally receives have always contained some praise."
It's completely out of the question.
But the notion that Trump's Twitter habits were once "controlled" is laughable.
It's possible these campaign officials know something we don't know - that Trump's tweets are even more flashy if not for their intervention.
We probably never knew those tweets that Trump didn't send.
If his staff were able to save him from the flames, even a few times, their efforts were worth it.
But no one has been able to keep Trump from controversy.
Part of the problem is that in a White House made up of competing groups, people promote their world views by presenting information to Trump that may be reliable and potentially unreliable.
Politico - all about the story - reported in May that advisers had a penchant for strategically providing suspicious information to the president.
This is an example described by journalist Shane Goodman:
"Current and former Trump officials say Trump's response to negative news clips, such as volcanic eruptions, especially those with damaging information, will frantically want to find out its sources.
At the end of February, someone maliciously photocopied an article on GotNews.com, the website of cyber-demagogue Charles C. Johnson, accusing Deputy Chief of Staff Katie Walsh of "a vast source of information leaking" for the White House, as Trump did at the time.
Even if Johnson had been permanently banned from Twitter for harassment, no concrete evidence had been provided, and he had blasted out a lot of false quality control, which he later blatantly denied.
Trump read the article and then began asking officials about Walsh.
Goodman also said that then-Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and White House Secretary Rob Porter "had tried to establish a system to manage and document the documents Trump received."
The result?
Kelly intends to do the same, three months later.
Maybe he can prove himself to be a more efficient manager than Priebus, but Trump is the impulsive Trump, and his aides are still competing for influence.
These timeless factors will make Kelly's task difficult.
Tourist town: How to get drunk
The potential of Zhejiang town is gradually awakened.
Now these small towns are important destinations for Zhejiang tourists to enjoy Zhejiang Mountain, to read Zhejiang culture and feel Zhejiang homesickness.
Winning in the wind
"The social play is accompanied by the moon, sausage scented with the wind.
Walking around the ancient town of Anchang, Shaoxing, the traditional artisanal skills of hoops, bamboo, iron, shoes, lace, spinning cotton, and other traditional artisanal techniques have fully demonstrated the intangible cultural heritage of Anchang ancient town.
More than 65,000 visitors to Anchang town during the three-day holiday on New Year's Day.
In Zhejiang, a unique town such as Anchang Town is a star-studded town: The glittering glow of Jiaxing Xi Tong, which flows through Jiangnan Water Township, and Diva, the white wall of Quzhou XXVIII.
In recent years, the potential of Zhejiang town has been gradually awakened with the development of tourism in our province.
In 2016, the provincial government office officially issued the "Implementation Measures for the Creation of a Tourist-style Town in Zhejiang Province," which proposed the adoption of a five-year period for the acceptance and acceptance in the province of 100 or so provincial tourism-friendly towns with a strong, eco-friendly environment and a rich tourism industry.
Now these small towns are important destinations for Zhejiang tourists to enjoy Zhejiang Mountain, to read Zhejiang culture and feel Zhejiang homesickness.
The head of the provincial tourism bureau said that under the craze of the tourist-friendly town, the townships in our province now pay more attention to the creation of personalized tourism industry.
Promotion
Recently, hosted by Zhejiang Province Tourism Bureau and Zhejiang Daily News Group, the Zhejiang Group Travel All-Media Center hosted the "Towntown x Future Artist" Share Hui-cum "Poetry Painting Zhejiang? Township" 2017 Zhejiang Tourism Fantasy Town Promotion Season Closing Ceremony at Zhejiang Exhibition Gallery.
"The town has artistic beauty and living temperature.
The style of the town lies in the original juice, the original taste, the original township, the pure of the original ecology.
"The small town in the lens," "Little Village Alteration," and other small-town cross-border stories, such as "Little Village Alteration," were told by experts such as Shi Hanfeng, a film and television director at the Chinese Academy of Fine Arts, and a director of the Chinese Academy of Art and Communication.
Zhejiang's many amorous tourist towns have deep cultural resources, and the small town representative of Nan Xun, Huzhou City, was newly built on the scene to read the national painting Nanjing.
Jiangnan Water Township has been popular with the painter since ancient times.
Tourist style town must be prepared with the elements of wind, tourism, service and environment.
The services and environment of tourism are also very important.
A timely umbrella on a rainy day will also allow visitors to experience the town better.
In this era of sharing, Zhejiang Group Travel All Media Center joined forces with the hottest shared umbrellas to customize a collection of "Zhejiang" versions of shared umbrellas, hoping to promote the idea of "sharing? Green" and promoting a culture of tourism awareness and public morality among tourists and small-town residents.
This became a bright spot in the 2017 Zhejiang tourism-friendly town promotion season.
Looking forward
So far, Zhejiang Province has issued the first 21 provincial tourism-style town creation lists and 115 provincial tourism-friendly town-building lists.
As the priority area for the development of rural tourism during the "13th Five-Year Plan" period, the town will eventually complete 3A-plus tourist scenic spots, which will become a new model for the diversity of tourism products, outstanding tourism benefits and win-win industrial integration.
The key to the attraction of a tourist town is its original taste.
The beauty of the tourist town is not only the small bridge flowing from the smoke and rain, but also from the long cultural tradition.
Throughout the world, the Dutch town of Leiser, the small town of Hallstadt, Austria, and the French pumpkin town, with tulips, "salt" and pumpkins as their core attractions, attract a large number of visitors from all over the world each year, bringing tourism to the economy.
The emphasis of "highlighting characteristics and retaining homesickness" has given the town a distinct personality and soul, and it is more about providing cultural immersion, carrying local culture, and highlighting the country civilization.
The tourist-friendly town, with culture and homesickness as the link, with the humanities and scenery as the carrier, connects the Quartet tourists, let the traditional style and culture pass on and innovate in the shared sharing.
In essence, the tourist-friendly town is a complex open-plan tourist scenic area. It should be a shared living space for local residents and foreign visitors and even travellers.
As the main battleground for the future growth of tourism, it is not only possible to change the ecological face of the country, the mode of economic and social development, the direction of the flow of industrial factors, but also to eliminate the urban-rural infrastructure gap and awaken the country's cultural recovery.
In the rush of the country's accelerated revitalization, Zhejiang tourist-friendly town will deduce a richer story.
According to data, 70 per cent of China's travel needs are concentrated within a 3-kilometre range, as a result of which the entire short-haul travel market is a shared cycle.
The Japan Financial News reported that inflationary pressures will intensify as a result of the fiscal expansion of Trump's next regime, and that rate hikes in 2017 will accelerate.
The annual International Consumer Electronics Show (CES) opens in Las Vegas on January 9 (Beijing time January 10).
According to the list of exhibitors released on 9 January by CES's official website, the 51st CES has a total of 4,577 national enterprises.
Compared with the huge production of 13,000 episodes of TV dramas broadcast each year, these "halves" are just a drop in the ocean.
Car passenger talks over ditch to return to Rich Street
Some of the wealthiest landlords in the West Midlands region have had another dispute with staunch tenants who have consulted on a government-made ditch to return land outside the mansion.
The occupants parked their 20 trailers on a vacant lot outside the busy Solihull Street, which was named Rich Street.
Caravans, holding horses, carrying babies and leading a car convoy, returned after being driven out in May, and the city department dug out "moat" didn't stop them from entering.
The slick and sophisticated team found a gap in the line of defence, and although there was no roadblock for passage, their vehicles squeezed through the gap.
Angry residents have criticised the Solihull Council, saying it was "poor at dealing with it."
One resident, who did not wish to be named, said: 'They were there on Monday night before coming to Bentley Heath Street to throw stones at passing passers-by.
The council should be ashamed of their actions because they are simply nothing to deal with.
The occupants arrived here in May and were then driven away, and now they are back.
A lot came last night and it could have been more today. '
She added: "Birmingham City Council knows how to deal with it by implementing a long-term ban to protect its parks.
I live on Streetsbrook Road and if Parliament can't stop this, I'm not willing to continue paying municipal taxes.
One local resident, who did not wish to be named, said: "It's ridiculous, we've just seen the last batch of cars go away, just for another batch to destroy.
This time there was an increase in numbers and someone even saw horses on the park lawn eating grass.
A Solihull council spokeswoman said: "We are aware that there have been unauthorized camping on a vacant lot on the Springbrook Road and now we work with Solihull Police and take the necessary legal action to get them removed as soon as possible.
To support us in gathering evidence, it is important to ask as many local residents as possible to report any anti-social or criminal behaviour to the police by calling 101.
This helps us to outline the situation when we submit a case to the Court for consideration. "
On 15 March, the Fifth Session of the Twelfth National People's Congress held its closing meeting at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing.
This was an interview with the Director of the National Post Office, Ma Jun.
Xinhua News Agency (Xinhua) (Xinhua) - The Fifth Session of the Twelfth National People's Congress (NPC) held its closing meeting in the Great Hall of the People at 9 a.m.
In an interview with the Minister's Channel before the closing, the National Post Office Director, Ma Jun-wen, said in an interview on the "Ministerial Gateway" that this year, in response to outstanding issues such as express delivery delays and the loss and destruction of express items in the express delivery industry, the state will strengthen supervision and guide the strengthening of industry self-discipline.
China's express delivery industry is now in the fast lane, Ma said.
In 2012, the number of Chinese express delivery was 5.6 billion, and the number of express tricycle vehicles on the road, with uniform standards, unified markings and uniform insurance, facilitated both delivery and security.

Italy tough on NGO migrant rescue boat
Italy has issued a warning to NGOs operating migrant rescue boats in the Mediterranean that they will not be allowed to continue their rescue unless new operational management norms are signed.
"If non-governmental organizations do not sign new codes of conduct, it is hard to see how they will follow," Interior Minister Marco Minniti told the Turin Daily News.
The day before Minniti's warning, Italian officials seized the crew of a German aid organization, Youth Rescue, on suspicion of actually colluding with traffickers to assist illegal immigrants.
The aid group operated for only a year and declined to comment on the subject of specific allegations by Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.
In a social media statement, the group said that "for us, saving lives is now and will be the most important thing, so we regret not being able to operate in the search and rescue area at this time."
"After all the information has been collected, we can currently only assess all the allegations and the situation," the statement read.
Italian officials have been spying on the Youth Rescue group's boat Iuventa since October.
Its crew is suspected of carrying migrants who had been transported directly by small boats by traffickers and allowing smugglers to rush away and reuse the ship.
At least one such meeting allegedly occurred at sea 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast, according to prosecutors' documents, which were published by Italian media.
Its crew is suspected of blatantly ignoring the authority of the Italian coastguard, which oversees rescue operations in the area for humanitarian enthusiasm rather than any other motive.
According to the code of conduct, vessels such as Iuventa clearly need an Italian police officer to oversee their activities on board.
Currently, only three of the nine non-governmental organizations involved in search and rescue operations have agreed to comply with the code of conduct, namely, Save the Children, the migrant maritime aid station based in Mart√≠n and the Pro-Activa Open Arms in Spain.
The latter said on Thursday it believed the new rules, while unnecessary, were acceptable because they would not bring any "significant changes and obstacles" to its rescue operations.
Among the organizations that refused to sign was the Nobel Prize-winning organization MSF.
Meanwhile, Minniti says the number of migrants arriving in Italy in recent weeks has plummeted, suggesting that efforts to bolster Libyan coast escorts and unite local mayors are beginning to bear fruit.
The minister said: "In recent days we have begun to see the dawn at the end of the tunnel."
He unveiled plans for this month's deep talks: Discussing economic development activities with Libyan mayors, and discussing with Chad, Niger and Mali how to reduce the number of migrants who want to leave those countries for Europe.
In December, industrial added value growth is expected to accelerate to 6.6 per cent as industrial value added in the first three quarters of 2017 is marked by the end-of-season upturn, said Liang Ping, chief financial scientist at the Bank of Communications.
Fixed-asset investment is expected to grow at a cumulative rate of 7.2 per cent in December, down from last month.
Industrial production, though weaker than October, is essentially flat with November.
While manufacturing investment in China was running at a low level in December, there was a modest improvement in investment in infrastructure, so fixed-asset investment is expected to remain flat in November.

New initiative of Beijing "university alienation": Tens of thousands of teachers and students of Northern Chemical Industry will be admitted to the new campus in Changping
The opening ceremony of the new campus of Beijing University of Chemical Engineering took place in Changping District, Beijing, on Tuesday.
In order to strengthen the core functions of the capital and manage the "big city disease," the reporter was informed that in recent years, in the context of the coordinated development and non-capital functions of the capital, Beijing has accelerated the expansion of the central urban colleges to the suburbs.
The new campus of Northern Chemical is located in the southern town of Changping, covering 1,800 acres and 40 km from the city.
The construction of the new campus has been completed in three phases, and the second phase is expected to be fully launched by the end of this year.
Looking back at this year's film market, we found that the original text of the film and the two groups of fans who had joined the star became an important part of the film's expected audience.
At 1710 hours today, the 119 Command Centre in Shaoyang City was alerted to a fire in the storage of tetrahydrofurans at the Hengzhi chemical plant in Longshu Tong, Shuangqing District of the city.
Shaoyang City Fire Brigade immediately sent five squadron 20 fire engines to the scene, carrying heavy anti-chemical clothing and anti-chemical cleaning vehicles.
After preliminary investigation, the fire was caused by small storage tanks containing chemicals such as tetrahydrofurans, which produced large smoke.
As of the time of the press release, fire officers were on the lookout, and the municipal health, safety, environmental protection, public security and transportation departments were on the scene. No casualties were found.
Michelle Carter sentenced for texting Conrad Roy to suicide
A Massachusetts woman has been sentenced to two-and-a-half years for encouraging her boyfriend to commit suicide by text message and phone.
Michelle Carter, 20, will serve a 15-month sentence, which can be converted to probation after the expiration of the term, plus a five-year suspended sentence.
Carter was sentenced in June to charges of intentional non-premeditated homicide against Conrad Roy, who committed suicide on July 13, 2014.
Roy's father said at the hearing on Thursday: "My family is heartbroken.
My son is my best friend.
While awaiting appeal, Carter was granted personal freedom.
She faces up to 20 years in prison, but her lawyers believe both she and Mr Roy are mentally ill.
At the sentencing, Carter stood, wearing red trousers and beige blouses, clasped hands, tears in his eyes and eyes down.
"Her actions killed Conrad Roy," prosecutors told the court.
'she ended his life for the better of herself.
She was not responsible, "the prosecutor said.
'she didn't have any remorse. '
But Carter's lawyer said it was "a terrible consequence and she felt very sorry."
However, Judge Lawrence Moniz said he did not find her "age or maturity or even her mental illness would have any significant impact on her behaviour."
A prosecutor read a statement from Roy's mother, Lynn Roy, saying, "I don't have a day to be sad about losing my beloved son.
I hope he is proud of me and what I have done and I am trying to stand with his sisters in all my pain that will accompany us forever, "the statement said.
Mr Roy's sister, Camdyn Roy, testified that she was "in a trance" for realising she could never attend her brother's wedding or become his child's aunt.
"It is a pain to lose someone who has been with me since I was born, and for the rest of my life," she said.
The case seems to set a legal precedent because the Massachusetts law does not provide for encouraging others to commit suicide.
In 2014, Roy was found dead from carbon monoxide poisoning in his car; this year, Carter was 17.
The case sparked national attention after Carter's text message revealed she had encouraged him to commit suicide.
"There are many ways to hang, jump, stab yourself," she said in several text messages sent two weeks before his death; he was on holiday with his family.
In the period before his suicide, she wrote, "You need to do this, Conrad," and "all you have to do is start the generator and get free and happy."
Judge Moniz said Carter drew attention through Mr Roy's death and ordered her not to profit from the case through any media.
There are legal differences of opinion in this case.
One of the few to defend Carter, Amanda Knox, who was accused of murdering her British roommate in Italy in 2007, was acquitted two years later.
"Michelle Carter deserves sympathy and help, not imprisonment," Ms. Knox, 30, said in an op-ed published in the Los Angeles Times.
Zhang was destined to be a controversial film artist, and from the time he started filming the first film, "Red sorghum," he had been leading the Chinese cinema with a lot of criticism.

Carmakers face shock, Audi to retrofit up to 850,000 diesel cars
The day before Audi announced the conversion, BMW said it would provide software upgrades for more than 350,000 vehicles.
The BMW chairman said BMW believes "driving has more smart options than restrictions," meaning that European big cities - including Munich, where BMW is headquartered - consider banning or restricting diesel vehicles.
Daimler on Tuesday announced it would retrofit three million Mercedes cars in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions.
No company has declared the move a recall.
European carmakers are heavily promoting the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the US to help meet carbon dioxide emissions regulations.
But nitrogen oxides emitted by diesel engines are considered carcinogenic and can cause asthma.
The cost of installing equipment to offset emissions from diesel cars is also increasing, making it difficult to keep diesel cars competitive on price.
As the German carmaker faces scrutiny, the government led by Chancellor Angela Merkel has also been accused of overletting these powerful car companies and ignoring signs of the problem.
The car companies are trying to avoid a repeat of Volkswagen's use of so-called defeat devices, adjusting emissions to comply with regulations during car tests and returning to normal under normal driving conditions.
Multiple Volkswagen executives have been charged in the United States and other executives are being investigated by countries on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former head of thermodynamics at the Audi engine development department was arrested in Germany.
Former manager Zachiro Giovanni Palmio is Italian and therefore not protected by extradition and may face trial in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi was embroiled in a German criminal investigation involving Volkswagen, with the German government accusing the Audi of installing systems to evade European emissions claims, expanding the scope of an investigation previously limited to the United States.
Audi's investigation could have a major impact on Volkswagen: Luxury carmakers share a disproportionate share of Volkswagen's profits.
It is common for a film to go from preparation to release for a year or two or even years.
The animated film "Big Fish" has been announced for release on July 8, 12 years from preparation to release!
Liang Jin, 21, from Tsinghua University's thermal power profession, founded the other side with his close friend Zhang Chun. In 2008, he won a $1 million venture to launch the animated film debut "Big Fish."
The film has won numerous awards at home and abroad during the creative sample stage, and is also credited by the Pompidou Centre for Contemporary Art in France as "one of the most outstanding works of art."
For six years, from creativity to production, the film has been dubbed "the pit" by millions of fans who expect to be released.
"The Big Fish" tells a fantasy story that belongs to the Chinese. With the release of the trailer, it brings new expectations to all viewers.
Liang said: 'These 12 years have only done this and now it's gone from a dream to a reality and I'm both nervous and excited.'
"Always thinking about using one-tenth of someone else's budget and making the same picture as anyone else, the team is going to be driven crazy by me," Zhang said.
Dongguan, a "world factory" that once relied on processing and large numbers of workers, is setting its sights on the high-level talent that can lead the city to reposition itself.

Provence lavender threatened by climate change
Lavender has become a symbol of the city of Provence in southern France, but now there is bad news that it is under threat from climate change.
Lavender is decaying due to persistent droughts and the emergence of insects carrying the virus, causing headaches for scientists and farmers trying to find solutions.
Eric Chaisse, an expert at the Agricultural Research Institute (CRIEPPAM) in Provence, said: "Lavender in Provence is facing a huge threat as the plant has been affected by climate change in recent years, with a sharp reduction in spring rains and a rainy fall.
This affects the life cycle of lavender.
There is also an individual smaller cicada, a leaf cicada that can spread tiny bacteria, and in very dry weather they appear in large numbers. "
The key is the sheer volume.
In addition to attracting holidaymakers, lavender oil is being pursued by the perfume and cosmetics industry.
Eric Chase said: "In contrast to plants that can open many large flowers and have a long grain spike, we have smaller, stunted, missing or weak individuals.
So we have fewer essential oils, "he said.
Solutions being studied include better irrigation techniques and mitigation of soil moisture evaporation, the spraying of protective mixtures of clay and water on plants and the development of more drought-tolerant varieties.
In contrast to the sci-fi elements of the film, the two starters are more attracted to the story.
On the afternoon of September 5, a reporter from the Huawei Metropolis newspaper, interviewing a number of celebrities in a row, as well as two acoustic performers, was surprisingly silent.

Mexico dangerous, journalists killed
The entire staff of the Riodoce weekly newspaper usually rallies on Wednesday to recall their plans for coverage of the Sinaloa riots, which were caused by criminal organizations, corrupt officials and an endless war on drugs.
But today, the shadow of tragedy hangs over themselves, and they come together to discuss security.
They were told it was important to change their daily habits.
Two senior journalists discussed what was more secure: Whether to bring their children to the office (where the office had been hit by grenades in 2009) or to leave them at home.
Security experts wrote three words on the blackboard in front of the room: Enemies, neutrals and allies.
They let these reporters name each column - no evidence, observation and intuition.
There are suspected drug dealers, politicians, businessmen and journalists on the government list, or cartels, who make Mexico's coverage dangerous.
Violence has never been halted, and the country has suffered a growing number of journalists: According to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists, at least 25 journalists have died since President Enrique Pe√±a Nieto came to power in December 2012; 589 journalists are under federal protection following attacks and threats; and at least seven journalists have died in seven states so far this year.
The last one to die was their editor and inspiration, along with Javier Valdez Cardenas, co-founder of Riodoce.
Valdez, who has written many books about drug violence, wrote in one of them: "The biggest mistake is living in Mexico and becoming a journalist."
There was a deep sense that he had left, although he was ubiquitous - a huge photograph hung on the front of the Riodoce office building, Valdez erecting the middle finger, the word "justice"; the T-shirt worn by Aaron Iwara and Miriam Ramirez, two 30-something journalists wearing glasses or his signature Panama straw hat.
The seminar took place less than two months after his death; journalists were discussing their shared trauma, nightmares, insomnia and paranoia.
Although a special federal prosecutor's office was set up in 2010 to deal with journalists' cases, the office sued only two people, according to records from the Committee to Protect Journalists.
Most of the thousands of crimes committed each year involve drug trafficking and organized crime, so that the perpetrators of killings of journalists are rarely brought to justice.
In "Riodoce," they insist on reporting on the violence in Sinaloa, although they are already heartbroken, though the land is already in a thousand holes.
'There is no information about the killer and no justice is done, 'he said.
He said it was foolish to waste time in such seminars.
As long as we don't know why, you don't trust anyone, "he said.
On the morning of 15 May, Valdez left the office of Riodoce in the capital, Kuliakan.
His red Toyota Carola was stopped by two men just a few blocks away; they forced him to get out of the car and fired 12 shots, speculating that it was because of the newspaper's name - translated as "The 12th River."
The gangster drove his car away and crashed it nearby.
Valdez is 50.
Leaving behind his wife and two grown-up children.
Kuliakan rumbled.
But the conversation about Valdez actually has nothing but silence.
Since Guzman's arrest last year and his extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa has become the country's bloodiest battleground, with hostile forces fighting wildly.
The streets of Sinaloa, where one or more people are shot every day, and cemeteries filled with drug lords' gorgeous two-story mausoleum, are commonplace.
Temporarily forgetting the state of "calm" is when only one cartel controls this seaside state and its ports and drug trafficking routes to the United States.
Even so, even if Valdez was well aware of the dangers of the job, the 60-year-old co-founder and director of Riodoce, Ismail Pohoqui, was guilty of failing to protect his friends.
He believes two mistakes caused the tragedy.
The first, in February, was the publication of an interview with Damaso Lopez, who led a cartel group that fought with several of Guzman's sons.
The report may have infuriated the sons; the newspaper was bought by suspected gang members as soon as it was sent to the newsstand.
The second mistake was not to force Valdez to leave Mexico for his own safety after another newspaper covering the same story was seized.
Valdez is a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his death is of great significance to Mexico's violence against journalists.
His spirit is long and his friends and colleagues believe he has been with us.
He was also a senior correspondent for Noroeste in 2003, when he joined five colleagues to start the Riodoce, selling a $50 stake.
In Sinaloa, "it's impossible to step into journalism without dealing with the drug problem," Pohoqui said.
Over time, the paper has gained a good reputation for bold and honest reporting, with sales and advertising also increasing.
Journalists like to be able to publish reports of direct attacks without fear of censorship, and readers like newspapers to publish stories that others are afraid to report.
Five years after it was founded, Riodoce won the Latin American Maria Moscapo News Award.
In the same year, the Association for the Protection of Journalists awarded the Valdez International Press Freedom Award for his courage in pursuing the most authentic Mexican drug reports.
He admitted he was scared too.
When the Association for the Protection of Journalists awarded the award, he said "I want to continue to live."
Later in October, he said in an interview on local television station Rompevento TV that "in Sinaloa, drug trafficking is a way of life,
You have to take on the task that falls on your shoulders as a journalist - either so, or deaf.
I don't want to be asked 'What did you do in the face of so many deaths... why don't you sound about what's happening?'
All the staff at Riodoce miss Valdez, miss him as a docker, miss the friend who never stinks in hugging and advice, and miss the teacher who knows how to live.
They rely on his habits.
He used to wear that hat.
The El Guayabo bar, often opposite the office, always sat on the same table.
Now, they will ask: Is it his routine that caused his meteoric fall?
His death also left them having to think about how to do well and live well.
'They don't like the fact that you're causing trouble for their women and children, or the legal companies you affect them and the secret airports used to transport drugs, 'Pohoqui said.
These are all over their bottom line.
The result is to maintain a high degree of self-censorship and self-protection even in the safest of times.
Trust your instincts.
If you smell dangerous, get away.
The problem, says Andr√©s Villaire, editor of Riodoce, is that "breath is a feeling of being cheated... and then something like Javier happens."
He and others have said that previous rules no longer apply to Sinaloa - just as they no longer apply to Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states, where smuggling routes are lucrative, and institutions are weak, government officials corrupt and smoky.
The situation is changing.
The use of mobile phones was suddenly not allowed in the room where Riodoce employees attended security training; a few days earlier, spyware allegedly sold to the government alone had been used in Mexico to spy on journalists and activists.
Outside, two police officers took a cool ride under the shade of the tree, dodging 104 degrees (40 degrees Celsius) of heat.
They are the offices of the state government sent to protect Riodoce, a four-storey building in the middle-class neighborhood of Kuliakan.
Some reporters, half-jokingly, wondered whether the police would be 50% of what the governor himself said.
It has been months since journalists went to the mountains, where drug cartels are under actual control.
This week's Riodice featured three major events.
Among them was the killing of the brother of Sinaloa's great former boxer Julio Cesar Chavez,
And the governor's hometown government funding disclosure,
As well as the kidnapping in an expensive restaurant in Kuliakan, the restaurant is only a block from the prosecutor's office.
Officials have not released information about the kidnapped objects and the kidnapping process, so write down what the city knows: The restaurant is where drug dealers and officials love to go.
A journalist learned from public records that the restaurant was registered in the name of a politician from the ruling Revolutionary Institutional Party (PRI), which dominates the political class almost throughout the upper discipline.
Recently, several PRI governors have been accused of corruption in several high-profile cases.
Villaire asked reporters to write about what happened at the scene before, including one of Mexico's top drug lord Guzman's sons dodging a military attack.
If, a few months ago, readers would look at Valdez's column to find the most powerful message about the kidnapping.
Villaire, 46, who has a thin build and is known as "lean," said that "before, we already knew what was going on.
Now all our sources of communication are choked.
Valdez's office is now used to store signs and stickers protesting the killing of journalists as employees become what they never wanted to be: Activists representing the media.
The next morning, journalist Miriam Ramirez took a handful of logos out of the room and went to the local prosecutor's office for a parade related to another journalist.
El Salvador Adam√© disappeared in the western state of Michoacan three days after Valdez was killed.
Officials found a charred body and said it was his body, according to DNA tests.
Across the country, journalists have become more outspoken, organising protests and painting the words "save the media" on sidewalks and buildings.
That day, the director, Pohoqui, was not in Washington, and he was trying to get justice for the Valdez case for international support.
The day after Valdez was killed, during a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa, Ramirez accused the official of spying on journalists and killing them for telling the truth.
Given that her anger had affected her objectivity, she also asked to resign from her post covering government affairs.
Valdez has repeatedly reiterated that journalists in Mexico are "surrounded" by organized crime, homegrown government officials and indifferent societies.
In his last book, "Drug News," he wrote that journalists were not only maimed by drug cartels, but also on the list of politicians and security forces that were complicit in organized crime.
Media watchdog group Articulo 19 blamed police and public officials for more than half of last year's attacks on journalists.
"In Mexico, they let you die just to shut you up," Ramirez said.
Clearly these murders are chilling.
Nobody forgot that six years ago, blogger Maria Elizabeth Masias died at the border north of Tamaulipas.
Her body was beside a note allegedly signed by the Zetas cartel: "I came for my coverage."
Her skull was cut off, alongside a computer keyboard and headphones.
After the killing of Milos Rava Bresch in March, some newspapers chose to close, such as the El Norte newspaper on the northern border of Chihuahua.
Others continued, and the director of the 2014 El Manana of Nuevo Laredo was killed, but they continued.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juarez used a headline to open a conversation about drug cartels with the headline "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists fled their hometowns or even left the country.
It's a tough choice.
It is difficult to find work in exile, and they still need to be careful and vigilant on the streets.
Sometimes they would be arrested, reportedly in 2015 when photographer Reuben Espinosa was killed along with four women in a Mexican city three months after fleeing Veracruz.
For those who stay behind the scenes, it's the daily dance of high-risk decisions.
Iwara, who had wanted to be a poet, admitted that reporting on the drug trade frightened him.
He said "Mexico is turning into hell, so I became a journalist."
On a recent Friday in the middle of the night, the latest edition of the newspaper had already been printed, and the editors of Riodoce were sitting on the aisle outside the office drinking beer and suddenly their phones rang.
A series of gun battles between gang antagonists and security forces near the beach resort city of Massatran have confirmed 19 deaths.
The fighting is still escalating, as a series of cartel information found in the region foreshadowed.
They uploaded the news to Riodoce's website by phone on the side of the road.
The next day's headlines had to be changed.
The siren sounded nearby - there was another shootout in the area.
Pohoqui glanced at the policemen standing there guarding them to see if they were alert.
If they had a bit of fear, they didn't show it.
The founder of the newspaper is dead, and in his large portrait, his middle finger points to the entire Sinaloa state needing to look out, and the entire staff of Riodoce follows him.
"How can you even want to shut down? The same day Javier was killed, the intern asked me to send her to the streets to get involved in the coverage," Pohoqui said.

But at the same time, the market for self-driving travel, which is expected to break through the trillion-size scale, faces a double challenge, with the development of self-driving industries not in direct proportion to market demand, self-driving clubs and travel agencies and other self-driving organisers facing weak earnings and, on the other hand, the infrastructure and services they face.
60% of total domestic travel, and market size is expected to be broken
With 4.44 billion domestic tours in 2016, self-driving travel accounts for about 60 percent of all domestic tourism, and the size of the self-driving market is expected to break through trillion by 2020.
According to the statistics on the number of self-driving tourists in China, the number of travellers from the country has continued to increase over the past five years, and the proportion of visitors to domestic tourism has stabilized at more than half.
At the same time, there has been increased attention and support at the regional and national levels in the emerging area of self-driving travel, with policies and regulations related to self-driving, travel and camping tourism being introduced in 2016 and 2017.
In July 2017, eight departments, including the National Tourism Administration and the State General Administration of Sports, jointly issued a plan for the development of self-driving motor camps.
The introduction of policy provides opportunities and policy guidance for domestic self-driving development.
Self-driving clubs are very profitable, complete industrial chain is key
Although the domestic market for self-driving travel has great potential and the national policy is actively guided, the self-driving industry is still in its infancy.
According to China's Annual Development Report 2016-2017, there are thousands of domestic self-driving clubs, auto clubs, car friends, etc., but the proportion of tourists self-driving is the majority, with only about 15 per cent of visitors to various institutions, such as car friends and self-driving clubs.
At the same time, online tourism enterprises and traditional travel agencies that independently develop self-driving products are numbered, and many online travel platforms sell only self-driving products offered by some suppliers, and some self-driving clubs are important suppliers.
In terms of organizing self-driving activities, it covers "eating, living, walking, swimming, buying and entertaining," with a high degree of fragmentation, a heavy upstream supply chain and a randomness of tourist consumption.
Li Guojie, founder and CEO of Beijing Automotive Club, believes that self-driving clubs are essentially similar to travel agents, and that the main profit patterns in the early years were based on offline activities, with the core being self-driving line products and lead service.
However, the self-driving club is faced with the need for re-transformation.
It can be seen that self-driving travel is not an independent industry in itself, but it is important to form a complete industrial chain with the displacement characteristics of its self-driving travel.
Experts point out that in addition to basic tourism consumption, experience is a more important consumer element.
Therefore, for the development of the self-driving industry, we should enhance the experience characteristics, develop the theme of "self-driving travel +" and the IP of self-driving products.
Scenic lanes are not just roads; car camps should not only satisfy accommodation
In the face of the rise of self-driving travel, the basic supporting development of self-driving travel is also relatively junior.
Mr Li pointed out that the tourism landscape is not just a road, but that there is a need to integrate the elements of transport and tourism, but road repairs and tourism itself are the responsibility of the two departments, with the transport sector increasing the tourist element and also staying in facilities such as building toilets, counselling centres, posters and other facilities.
Compared with the well-known self-driving route "America 66 Highway," the construction experience is worth drawing on.
The landscape design is no longer the most direct and fast path between the point of departure and the destination. Instead, it follows the concept of "experience driving fun" and provides self-driving visitors with the best enjoyment of the beauty of the road.
In addition to the scenic road, the camp is an important supporting facility for self-driving tours.
But among the self-driving tourists known to the Beijing newspaper reporters, there are few consumers who choose to stay in the camp.
In their view, many camps are biased towards basic construction and can only satisfy the need to eat, to have a low grade, to have a single product and to meet the many elements of self-driving.
Industry insiders, who did not wish to be named, said many of the businesses that had been in the camp in previous years had been trying to get the land, and that the late-stage supporting infrastructure and services had failed to keep up, with a lot of losses and no late-stage capital injection.
Consumer group
According to data released in 2017 by the China Tourism Vehicle Association, self-driving groups are concentrated in the 21-40 age group, especially between 31 and 40 years of age, with a certain economic base and a higher demand for personalized tourism, as well as more family and child travel.
From the accommodation survey, the self-driving population is more likely to prefer non-standard accommodation.
From the self-driving type, perimeter self-driving is the main type of self-driving travel, accounting for 84.32 percent.
Outbound self-driving is the aspiration of many, but it is still smaller.
At the same time, as consumer demand improves, tourists who used to enjoy self-driving "sightseeing attractions" are beginning to change their minds about "getting out of the car, taking pictures, getting on the bus" and focusing more on travel experiences and processes.
Dinosaurs use camouflage to evade enemies
At first glance it was awful, but it looked like a statue.
The researchers published the first results of the discovery of a rhinoceros-sized, incredible biofossil found by Canadian miners, pointing out that the fossil is well-preserved, so experts call it the Mona Lisa of the dinosaur community.
The fossil is so well preserved that it can even conclude that its scaly skin is reddish-brown, suggesting that it has had some "troubling experiences."
Related reports in the journal Current Biology describe it as "the best preserved manicured dinosaur ever discovered and one of the best dinosaur specimens in the world."
The fossil is a newly discovered type of nodular dragon that lives in the mid-Cretaceous period between 110 million and 112 million years ago.
Its preservation was extremely well-preserved and shocked researchers, who described it as "truly breathtaking."
According to National Geographic Magazine, the fossil of the grass-fed manicured dinosaur is the most intact of its kind ever discovered.
Shawn Funk spotted the fossil while digging at Suncor Millennium Mine near Fort McMurray, northern Alberta, Canada, March 21, 2011.
At the time, he came across something that seemed very different from the surrounding rock, so he decided to take a closer look.
After that, the fossils he discovered were sent to the Royal Tyrell Museum of Paleontology in Canada.
It took six years for the researchers to expose the beast hidden inside the 2,500-pound (1100-kilogram) block.
After such hard work, the final results are now being made public.
"If you look at it, you almost believe it's sleeping," says Caleb Brown, a scientist and first author of the Royal Tyrell Museum, which is on display at the exhibition
"It will be one of the most beautiful and well-preserved dinosaur specimens in the history of science - the Mona Lisa in the dinosaur community."
By studying their skin, the researchers found that the grass-eating creatures, though covered in armor, were like walking tanks, but were at risk of major threats from carnivorous dinosaurs.
The heavy-clad dinosaur uses red and white camouflage to evade predators and uses covert techniques known as "anti-shade," which are also used by many modern animals.
This way, experts say, it is better able to blend in with the surroundings and thus avoid the enemy, suggesting it is preyed on by larger dinosaurs.
The 110-million-year-old creature, which belongs to the nodal dragon family, made headlines for the first time in May and is currently on display at the Royal Tyrell Museum of Paleontology.
When Mark Mitchell, a museum technician who was one of the team members, took 7,000 hours to meticulously unveil the behemoth, the researchers now looked at it and named it "Borealopelta markmitchelli."
The samples were well preserved, allowing Dr Mitchell, and the team of international scientists, to record the patterns and shapes of the scales and armor on them.
They found "anti-shade," a common form of defense in the animal world, which meant the creature's back was darker than its side.
Although "anti-shade" is common, the findings are surprising given that the dinosaur has far more body size than existing animals using anti-shade.
The dinosaur is under pressure to be hunted by carnivorous dinosaurs, thus evolving in a favourable direction, allowing it to hide in the opposite base as a means of survival.
But most of the existing anti-masking animals, such as deer, zebra or armadillo, are as small and vulnerable as prey, suggesting that the creature is under real pressure to survive.
"The insane predation of large heavy-armor dinosaurs shows just how dangerous the Cretaceous carnivorous dinosaurs are," Brown said.
Chemical analysis of organic complexes in their scales also suggests that the dinosaur's skin color is reddish brown.
Scientists are continuing to study the life trail of the creature, including its reserved stomach contents, to find out what food to eat last.
They believe that the dinosaur fell into the river at the time of death, then washed into the sea and ended up sinking back down.
At the time, Alberta's climate was as warm as it is today in southern Florida, and rivers and oceans could be deeper inland than they are now.
"This nodular dragon is truly stunning because it is completely covered by preserved scaly skin and, to this day, is preserved in the space, allowing its original shape to be preserved," Brown said.
"So the creature is now shaped almost the same as it was in the Cretaceous period.
You don't have to use too much imagination to rebuild it; if you look at it, you almost believe it's sleeping.
The Cretaceous period was a time when two-legged, large-scale animal-foot dinosaurs roamed the Earth.
Although Tyrannosaurus was the king of the dinosaurs, it emerged millions of years after the manicured dinosaur, which may have been killed by some of Tyrannosaurus's ancestors.
They include Hawthorn Dragon, a behemoth that weighs six tons and is 38 feet (11.5 meters) long.
New research has found that scientists who appeared in the journal Current Biology believe the nodular dragon died after being washed into the sea, after which mummies formed in the dirt.
Sean Fink excavates the creature at the Millennium Mine near Fort McMurray, Alberta, Canada, March 21, 2011.
According to the museum, it is the world's best-preserved manicured dinosaur, complete with skin and armour in the area from nose to hip.
The creature averages about 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighs 3,000 pounds (1,300 kilograms).
It has two 20-inch-long, sharp angles from the shoulder.
Researchers believe the grass-fed manicured dinosaur was active in what is now western Canada after it was washed into the sea by flooded rivers.
However, the dinosaur was buried on the bottom of the sea to preserve its manicure.
The fossilized remains of this particular sample are very well preserved, leaving the remaining skin still covered with bumps on the dinosaur's skull.
As Michael Gresko writes in the journal National Geographic, this level of preservation is as rare as a lottery.
The more I looked, the more I thought it was unbelievable.
Residual skin fossils are still covered in mottled armour on dinosaur skull.
Its right front palm sits on its side and five toes roll up.
I can count the pieces.
The reporter learned that traditional urea can be modified by adding natural or plant-based seaweed acid, humic acid and amino acids to urea production process.
Environment-friendly, crop production potential is obvious, especially large particle value-added urea is the quality raw material of BB fertilizer.
The total number of security personnel is double that of the 2012 London Olympics.
To ensure the security of the Rio Olympics, Brazil is set to launch the largest-ever security linkage program ever.
Previously, the Brazilian government said a total of 85,000 people from the army and police would fight together, including 20,000 troops and 65,000 police.
Most of the military will be responsible for defending Olympic venues, while the additional 3,000 will be responsible for security at international airports, subway stations and streets.
Police patrolled other parts of the city, including subway, bus and street.
It is understood that 6,000 soldiers have arrived in Rio for Olympic security services.
In addition to being in charge of the four major races at the Rio Olympics, they are responsible for patrolling the airport and the main roads connecting the airport and Olympic venues.
The introduction of evaluation mechanisms in the service sector is not new, and it is important to make the evaluation mechanism more effective and not in form.
How activists learn to answer the question: "Whose street?"
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrer was distraught.
On the first day of his trip to New York City, the St. Louis man was sitting on a bed in Epsom, browsing Facebook on his mobile phone.
She stumbled upon a post from a high school student.
It read: 'Police have just killed an 18-year-old and the child is still lying on the street'.
She was confused when she found that no one else on the feeds had posted the message. She shut down Facebook and opened Twitter.
One @ ThePharoah user kept pushing her Dynamic Times.
The St. Louis-area rapper live-tweeted the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old black man who was killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri.
He posted a picture of Brown lying on the street with his body, which had lost his vital signs, for four hours.
"Crazy," Ferrell thought.
But death is nothing new to her and her community.
She put down her mobile phone and did not turn on Twitter again that night, reading tweets about the crowds gathering on Canfield Avenue.
There were police videos and pictures of people shouting and a picture of a man claiming to be Brown's father, with the caption: "Ferguson police just killed my unarmed son!"
She saw a live feed and a police officer stood in front of a group of protesters with a barking dog.
In another video, she said, another officer raised his rifle and screamed, "I will kill all of you... beasts."
"It's not normal," Ferrell recalled.
"This is not what we are accustomed to, what can be called a typical murder."
At that moment, I shuddered.
I was angry and cried.
She booked a return flight and went home the next day.
After landing at 11 p.m., she picked up her six-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided the pair would travel to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson over the next three years was the subject of a new documentary, "Who's the Street?," released in theaters Aug.
It's a story about survival and protest, love and loss, strength and tenacity from the perspective of people who live in this community, packed with streets and alleys demanding answers.
Ferrell and daughter (dressed in floral skirts and crown accessories) drove to Ferguson when the pair revisited the topic they had discussed countless times before that morning - "about black experiences and black conditions."
"Do you remember when I taught you that black people had to fight for their faith?" She recalled.
'we're going to Ferguson now because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and it's wrong.
I had to take her, "Ferrer said later.
"What happened today is the climax of everything that has happened in the past.
She wants to know, see and rise from it.
Not only does she need to develop well in radicalism and organization, but to understand the different dimensions of black experience and the black situation and understand what we have to do to be free and liberated.
Even if I was lucky enough to provide her with a racist experience she hadn't experienced firsthand, she was no different from other black girls.
If I protect her on this matter, I feel like I'm hurting her, "she said.
They arrived at Ferguson's first stop at a site opposite the South Florence Road police station, where the militants waited until police officer Darren Wilson finally failed to prosecute the result, which became their camp.
Ferrell and her daughter were in contact with a local business owner who made a bag lunch.
They prepared the bag, which was responsible for passing the bag to the protesters.
Slowly, Ferrer began to form a new type of activism.
"My radicalism changed completely after August 9," she said, noting that while studying at the University of Missouri State University in St. Louis, she was president of the National Association of Minority Nurses, focusing on food justice and health gaps in black communities.
'i have no organizational experience.
That's how it all came about. '
A few weeks later, Ferrell met with the film's co-director Sabah Falayan during a night parade.
Faleyan said she and her photography director Lucas Alvarado Fall "just wanted to record" what happened.
Ferrer had a question in his mind: "Do you want to record or want to find a story you can use?"
This suspicion stems from many of these cases: People - usually white - enter a community to benefit from their pain and tenacity.
As Faleyan explained in a recent interview, "We heard that people who were native to Ferguson didn't concentrate their voices and we wanted to do it differently."
Faleyan has been contacted by co-director Devon Davis, a regional artist known for radicalism against dead prisoners.
His involvement led Ferrell, along with six other locals, to join the "Who's the Street?" Project team, which has remained unscathed for years after Brown was shot.
"This documentary is not about someone speaking for us or talking to us, that's our statement," Davis said.
"I'm mainly concerned about how these characters are presented, because that's the way I'm presented," he said.
While the goal is not to focus on Ferrell's experience - but to show that the campaign is "not about the savior leader, but about community cohesion," Faleyan says - it turns out she is the most open-minded of film participants.
As a result, "Who's the Street?" Surprisingly recorded Ferrell's personal life, such as falling in love and stepping into marriage.
"I feel naked," Ferrell laughed when he first saw the finished product.
"But I understand that there has to be a degree of vulnerability to doing this work and humanizing the black people," he said.
In addition, Ferrell's story reaffirms and relocates the role of black cool women in the broader Black Lives Matter movement.
Two of the campaign's three founders - who created # BlackLivesMatter on social media after the 2012 shooting of black teenager Trevor Martin - have been identified as cool.
"Black Cool Women in the leadership have generally supported this campaign," Ferrell said, "and that's because we're constantly fighting on multiple fronts.
Black women have to endure it.
"This movement really has the support of black women and many black women," Faleyan agreed and mentioned.
Ferrell was chosen to be at the heart of the film because of her identity, however, insisting "it's not an affirmative action for things."
"She was the one who inspired that energy," she said.
"Although she's on the front line, it's no coincidence that you have a lot to do as a black cool woman in these intersection lives," she said.
You can feel her energy through the screen.
Meanwhile, in Ferguson, news cameras have long since disappeared, but tense race relations between the community and police remain.
Ferrer was sentenced to more than two-and-a-half years of probation for trying to block the highway during a march.
She describes the socio-political atmosphere in the area she calls home: "A mess."
Still, since taking to the streets of Ferguson three years ago, she has stuck to the chants she has struggled to remember.
"We have a responsibility to fight for freedom.
We have a responsibility to win.
We must love each other and support each other.
We have nothing to lose but the shackles.
In fact, online translation services were already available on the web a decade ago, and the argument that "machines are about to replace humans for translation" was a long time ago.
Similarities: Artist uses Chelsea Manning's DNA to create portraits
There are multiple faces in the middle of the pavilion at the Friedman Gallery in New York: White, black and brown, with almost imperceptible similarities between each of the faces, which are tied by lines hanging from the ceiling.
The 30 portraits were created by artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg using Chelsea Manning to send her cheeks and hair crumbs.
Manning sent hair crumbs from Livingsburg prison, where the former intelligence analyst was sentenced to 35 years in prison for leaking classified diplomatic cables through WikiLeaks.
The exhibition, which opens Aug.
It was the culmination of two years of communications between Dewey Hagenberg and Manning, who combined their disciplines with their own in technology, computer science and art, while Manning, a prominent dissident who had been in jail and completed a transgender operation, pardoned her remaining sentence three days before the end of his term.
Heather Dewey Harbaugh made a scathing and slightly ruthless comment by analyzing the algorithms from Manning's DNA and creating a "likely appearance" of 30 portraits.
Manning, who was born Bradley Edward, had publicly admitted to thinking of himself as a woman during adolescence and was convicted in 2013 of 20 charges, including six counts of espionage violations, computer fraud and theft.
In prison, her image was suppressed, with only one photo, with granular black and white self-photographing, looking visibly upset, sitting in the driver's seat and wearing a platinum-colored wig.
In 2015, Heather Dewey Harbaugh had a huge success in her 2012 project The Stranger Vision.
In that piece, she uses the DNA from the crumbs to create a 3D portrait that may resemble a look, using a medium court physical evidence from cigarette butts and gum.
That's when she just received an email from Paper magazine.
"They want to interview Chelsea Manning in prison and need a portrait photo," Heather Dewey Harbaugh told the media at the opening of the exhibition.
Chelsea Manning couldn't visit or take pictures at the time, so they contacted Chelsea to ask if she was interested in making a DNA portrait.
So the artist and her incarcerated muse became Ben's unlikely pen pal, exchanging numerous letters over two years.
They even created a comic book, "Depressive Head," drawn by Shoili Kanungo, which foresaw that the president could grant privileges to Manning in the future and that she could see the exhibition in prison.
Obama asked for her release just days after the book was published, perhaps a coincidence when Manning spent his seventh year in Kansas military prison.
In addition, the exhibition has another layer of deep meaning, because contemporary America, where the Trump administration has constantly declared war on government leaks and transgender soldiers while searching for new, can-be-hype-hype, to nakedly incite division, is just about bridging that divide.
When asked about all this particular timing, Heather Dewey Harbaugh said "anything happens for a reason."
In an artist's statement written on the gallery wall, Manning's oversized signature is underneath (the "i" in the name is painted with a heart), calling for an end to "partisan strife based on gender, sexual orientation and culture."
On the opposite wall are her mitochondrial DNA sequences, with pencil-twisting tunes written with Cats, GPs and As symbols.
By containing 200 letters (or nucleotides, each artist's complex science dictionary), Heather Dewey Harbaugh hopes to express, at least in physiological structure, that everyone is, by depicting these strangely similar portraits.
"I want people to get out of this predicament, our genomes don't care about who we are, how open genetic data is read, how subjective it is," said Heather Dewey Harborg, whose 2007 video work, "False Memory," is also on display.
"DNA data can tell us a lot of different stories, so this is 30 of them," said Davis.
The last piece in the exhibition, in a room, comes from a page in the previous illustrative novels.
Showcasing the pompous, Kim-Gang-styled Manning in American soldiers holding loudspeakers.
"When they make your speech stop, they win," the wall wrote.
So don't shut up.
"The content comes directly from a letter she wrote to me," the Philadelphia-based artist said.
"I'm afraid again, I still have to tell."
Manning hasn't seen the exhibition in person, as foreseen in the comics, but when she does, she will be masked by her own DNA portrait as a group of protesters get cheers at the pavilion center.
It was also purposeful, as with all the items in the exhibition, reaching the heights of the genetic single-fold information she had written in pencil (5.2 feet, Manning's height).
"In the past, I hung them up against the wall, but I wanted them to feel like a bunch of people," Dewey Hagburg said of the portrait.
"But I want them to feel like a group of protesters following Chelsea, just as people were protesting to release her."
Northwestern University professor and Oxford University employee wanted for homicide
A Northwestern University professor and an Oxford University employee were subsequently wanted in connection with the fatal stabbing of a man inside a luxury Chicago apartment, police said, and are currently searching for suspects nationwide.
Cook County Court records show that Wyndham Latham, 42, and Andrew Warren, 56, were issued with a first-degree no-bail murder arrest warrant on Monday in connection with the death of Trenton H. James Cornell Durandro.
Cornell Durant, 26, died from multiple stab wounds, according to documents.
A community alert issued by the Chicago Police Department said the body was found on July 27.
Police arrived at the Grand Plaza apartment after receiving a call and found multiple fractures on the victim.
Police said Cornell Durlano died instantly and detectives are investigating the killing, while police are actively searching for two suspects.
Latham has been an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Corbett, deputy director of the campus relations department, said in an email statement that Latham has now been separated and has been banned from the Northwestern campus.
"Now this is a criminal case, the authorities are investigating and Northwestern is actively cooperating with the investigation," Mr Corbett said.
Warren is a senior finance assistant at Oxford University.
"We have been in contact with the British police and are ready to assist the US investigative agency as needed," a spokesman for Oxford University's Somerville College said in an email statement.
The statement added that Warren's colleagues were deeply shocked and wanted him to turn himself in.
Chicago Police Chief Anthony Guglielmi expressed strong encouragement for the suspect to surrender to authorities.
"The police have had a presumable idea of their whereabouts and we are trying to locate the possible location," Mr Guglielmi said.
Local, regional and national authorities are fully assisting in the search of the suspects, Guglielmi said.
Mr Guglielmi said police received a call from the manager of the Grand Plaza apartment, who had just received a secret tip that there was a situation in the 1008 apartment.
Police said the situation was horrific at the time.
Guglielmi said it remains unclear whether the incident also occurred on July 27.
He said that, according to security cameras, it was confirmed that Latham and Warren were in the building at the time.
"We believe Professor Latham has something to do with the victim," Guglielmi said.
"Police are currently studying the victim's case time line and case background and are investigating various motives, including a possible domestic incident," Grand Plaza's management team issued a statement to residents.
"We will complete the World Anti-Doping Agency Road Map in the near future," Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mutko said
Russia's deputy prime minister, Vitaly Mutko, said it would not take long for the implementation of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) remaining criteria for restoring Russia's anti-doping agency (RUSADA) rights.
"The implementation of road map standards has reached a certain stage and RUSADA has been granted the right to work with UKAD (UK Anti-Doping Agency) on planning and testing," the statement read.
The WADA road map has been updated in this regard, "Mutko said Thursday.
The statement was made by Deputy Prime Minister Mutko in commenting on the second part of the World Anti-Doping Agency's Road Map Compliance, which sets standards for the restoration of RUSADA rights and was recently posted on the organization's website.
According to Mutko, the standards do not contain anything that might raise concerns in Russia.
He added that "everything has to be announced and everything will be implemented.
And the results will be presented to the IOC [IOC] and WADA in the near future, "he said.
One of the criteria mentioned in the list, however, is that the Russian anti-doping agency must publicly accept the findings of a WADA-approved investigation into the Russian state's support for doping in national sports.
Speaking about the matter, Mutko said: "We are investigating and our anti-doping system has undoubtedly failed.
All measures have been implemented.
But there's no national plan behind this, and we're not going to admit something that doesn't exist, "he said.
Mutko's words echoed those of Vitaly Smirnov, head of Russia's Independent Public Anti-Doping Commission.
Smirnov acknowledged the past problems with Russia's anti-doping agency during a visit to the media's Russian outlet RSport earlier in the day, but added: "We have said on numerous occasions that the report contains controversial positions and provisions.
No one plans to accept the report unconditionally, "Smirnov said.
After the November 2015 doping scandal, WADA suspended RUSADA's right to carry out doping tests in Russia.
But in June, RUSADA was allowed to plan and coordinate testing this year under the supervision of international experts and UKAD.
WADA Director-General Olivia Nigel said during a visit to the group's headquarters in Moscow in July that RUSADA was "moving in the right direction" in an effort to restore its rights.

No more buy-to-let! These 8,000 products have zero tariffs
At a regular press conference held by the Ministry of Commerce on January 11, the Ministry of Commerce's press spokesman said that as of now, there are 15 self-trade agreements in force in China, involving 23 countries and regions, covering more than 8,000 zero-tariff imports.
At the same time, imports of cosmetics, Icelandic salmon, Chilean red wine, ASEAN tropical fruits... these products you want don't have to be bought at a great price.
At present, our country has signed 16 free trade agreements with 24 countries and regions.
In the case of agricultural products, with the implementation of the FTAs, consumers can taste products from different places of origin and quality and cheap products all year round.
For example, in ASEAN, tropical fruits such as durian, lychee and dragon fruit have been reduced from 15 to 30 per cent to zero tariffs.
The import duties of Icelandic salmon were reduced from 10 to 12 per cent to zero tariffs;
In Georgia and Chile, import duties were reduced from 14 to 30 per cent to zero tariffs;
There is also a significant tax cut for New Zealand's specialty produce such as beef and milk powder.
In the case of industrial goods, for example, the import tariffs on some cosmetics in Switzerland have been reduced to zero;
Import duties on some watches have been reduced by 50 per cent and will be reduced to zero tariffs in a few years' time;
In South Korea, import tariffs on refrigerators, rice cookers, massage machines and cosmetics have been reduced by 40 per cent and will be reduced to zero tariffs in a few years' time;
There is also a larger tax cut for consumer electronics.
At the same time, the zero-tariff products under the FTA also include the intermediate products and raw materials needed for the manufacture of many domestic terminal consumer goods and, to some extent, the upgrading of domestic consumer goods.
A spokesman for the Ministry of Commerce said that nearly one-third of the country's total imports could be treated with preferential tariffs under the FTA, most of which were terminal consumer goods, with tangible benefits for consumers.
Further reducing import tariffs on consumer goods
Since December 1, 2017, China has adjusted import tariffs on some consumer goods, further reducing the import duties of consumer goods, covering all kinds of consumer goods such as food, health products, pharmaceuticals, daily products, clothing and shoes, household equipment, cultural entertainment and daily goods.
The average tax rate for this group of consumer goods will fall from 17.3% to 7.7%, almost halted!
As of January 1, 2018, we have also partially adjusted other import and export tariffs.
The import duties of some cosmetics, such as lipstick, eye shadow and perfume, fell from 10% to 5%;
Lower tariffs mean that consumers don't have to buy and go abroad to buy preferred foreign products.

Year-end U.S. mall rules vary big shopping returns need caution
CNN 29 December
According to the US-based World Daily, Christmas is just over, and a return is welcome.
About half of the goods sold last Christmas were refunded, according to ABC.
In addition, there are a number of readers who have been duped into buying online, and consumers need to be careful when shopping on informal websites.
In general, large shopping companies have formal and reasonable return procedures, but be careful when buying gifts or dealers from small shops.
Ms. Hou of Roland Gang bought a coat for more than 60 yuan (US $, down) at an online shop specializing in print coats on December 1, local time.
She emailed the customer service and did not reply.
Another netizen popped up, traveled to the United States last year, bought a mobile phone from a third-party seller and sent it to find a box of rubber mud inside.
When you know you've been cheated, apply to the website for a refund.
But there are also customers who believe the site refund service is not 100 per cent perfect.
Mr. Wang, a Chinese-American resident of Northern California, said he had twice bought an emergency delivery service for a site, one for four dollars, but not twice.
A refund was later applied and no response was received.
Large malls or shopping sites have better return policies.
Macy's gets a full refund for most of its merchandise within 180 days.
However, goods must remain "original" and require purchase vouchers such as receipts or bank purchase records.
Without a voucher, customers can also get mall points that can be used to buy other goods.
Target typically has a 90-day return period for general merchandise, and electronic items typically 15 days.
However, the period of return for electronic and recreational goods purchased between 1 November and 25 December 2017 is extended to 30 days.
It is important to note that the 30-day refund period starts on 25 December and is meant to be returned by 25 January 2018.
The Extreme Shopping Experience, Business Circle Shopping Development
More than a decade ago, our country was generally in the seller's market, with limited choice and limited demand.
But after a decade of development, the market has already achieved a shift away from the seller's market to the buyer's market, and today's consumer tastes are becoming more tasty, and they are no longer content with simple "hand-to-hand" shopping.
So how to get consumers to get an extreme shopping experience becomes the next competitive point for property developers.
Among the many factors affecting the consumer shopping experience, shopping centres in the business circle have the most significant impact.
See how city builders focus on the shopping experience.
There are no two completely identical leaves in the world, not two completely identical shopping malls, and a famous shopping mall must have its own features.
For example, the world-famous Kanyon shopping centre in Turkey, whose unique wavy architectural design is inspired by the Grand Canyon, makes Kanyon, known as harmonic, walk in the 200-metre footpath of Minister Kanyon as if in the Grand Canyon.
In addition to the canyon-style design, there is also a large elliptical performance venue in the middle of the shopping centre, which is unique in appearance and often features performances.
Because of the open platform design, which allows visitors to walk on each floor overlooking the activity in "Canyon," there is the effect of a shift change.
At home, the Nanjing Forest Moore mall, known as China's first forest-style stroll, combines shopping with ecology and fairy tales.
The 7,000-square-metre Green Place, 3,000 square metre rooftop water platform, is composed of nine monomer buildings, with an aerial link between the buildings and a whole sinking courtyard design, taking the French sycamore as the architectural epidermis and roof water rooftop to create a forest-like feeling.
Walking into the forest Moore is like accidentally falling into the rabbit hole in Alice's Wonderland, the trunk of the trunk lining the building around, the grass, the spring, bringing people into a vibrant forest.
Also in Chongqing, Longlau has built a courtesy water business, planning a 100-side business. It plans to introduce more than 50 international top-selling flagship stores, over 100 international top brands and more than 500 famous brands at home and abroad in the future.
Not only that, it has integrated ecology into buildings, guided by TOD public transport, set up fashion shopping, life services, catering, entertainment, education and sports, and has led them to enjoy the unique "waterfront culture" of Chongqing, combining shopping with water entertainment and leisure.
It can be found that a number of housing companies now have insight into the trajectory of this new urban business, and insiders say the consumer-experience-centric model of how to combine shopping with experience will also be the mainstream of future urban development.
Today's business circle is not only a gathering place for goods, but also a comprehensive place for the integration of artistic culture and creative themes.
Therefore, while satisfying the consumer's demand for one-stop-shop, maximising the spiritual needs of cultural and artistic multi-layered and liveable residential demand is necessarily the high point of the future development of business circle.
In Chongqing, Jiangshan, on the north shore of Guanshing, is located in the north of Jiangbei, near the Guanyin Bridge.
Here is the world's essence;
Dongyuan Kam Yue has a better shopping environment, Dongyuan Jinyue near the South Ping Business Circle, exclusive to the western and even the national leading four-storey three-dimensional traffic system, enhance the shopping comfort.
In addition, the landscaping and landscaping of the two pedestrian streets of Wanda Road and Wanda Square have been upgraded, with some 300 trees planted and 40,000 square metres reconstructed to enhance the image of the South Ping business circle;
The Longlau Lake, near Chongqing's first low-density waterfront business circle, is surrounded by nine parks with low density and high openness, making it easier for people to stay, stop and enjoy their shopping, rather than being driven forward in a hurry by the people behind them.
Today's commercial competition will only become more and more intense, and how to kill a blood path in a homogeneous market, to capture the reputation of the "shopping mecca" in the minds of future consumers, is worth thinking about.
It is not enough simply to rely on a differential strategy, and only developers who are really putting consumers in their hearts, anxious consumers, thinking about what consumers want, and giving consumers a very simple and simple shopping experience can laugh at the stormy market.
Of course, at the end of the day I would like to be most pleased with the people of Chongqing who have such a good shopping experience and business circle that no one could have imagined today's prosperity 10 years ago.
Festivals: Consumerist spree masks real environmental prices
1682 million yuan, the turnover of Skycat user consumption within 24 hours of the Skycat Twenty20 Global Carnival on November 11, 2017.
Specifically, after the start of "Double 11," the number of cats reached 10 billion in just three minutes, more than 20 billion yuan in 6 minutes and 05 seconds, and 100 billion in nine hours.
The total number of payments made by consumers around the world through Alipay reached 1.48 billion on the day, up 41 percent from last year.
Those consumption will bring 812 million logistics orders.
And whether it is the Skycat online purchase platform or Alipay payment platform, all belong to Ma Yun's Ali Group.
No one would have thought a decade ago that the Single Youth subculture, created by self-deprecation on Nov. 11, would have been compiled by an electrician to become the "Double 11" shopping carnival.
On November 11, 2009, Alibaba first used the marketing stunt of "Hockey Day Big Promotion": No one is in love with you, so "Single Dog" is coming to the net.
The results came as a surprise, the day Taobao Mall (the "Skycat" predecessor) traded for $52 million, 10 times the daily turnover.
Since then, the "Double 11" has become a shopping carnival built by Alibaba, from the start of domestic buyer sellers to amusement, to the current influx of global merchants, nine years on, and the Skycat "Double 11" billion is already more than 3,200 times that year, leaving Black Friday in the dust.
There are also a large number of electric dealers, among them the strongest in Beijing.
"Beijing Dong" has its own shopping festival, "6.18," but there is no "Double 11" impact. This year, from November 1 to 11, the cumulative sales of "Jingdong" reached 1.71 billion yuan.
After "Double 11," it was followed by the same "Double 12" discount spree, Christmas New Year shopping.
After the New Year, the Chinese consumers are waiting for the pre-Spring Festival purchase period, the Valentine's Day shopping period, consumption, not holidays.
The environmental problems caused by the instantaneous consumption of large quantities have attracted the attention of professionals and institutions.
According to the NSW Daily Telegraph, at least 300,000 tonnes of rubbish were generated during the "Double 11" period this year, according to a conservative estimate of 0.2 kilograms per pack in the industry.
Liu Hua, director of the pollution control program at the East Asia Division of Greenpeace, told the China-Foreign Dialogue that the order of the "Double 11" cats this year would produce 160,000 tons of packed waste.
The National Post Office issued a report in 2016, pointing out that the 2015 "Double 11" period (11-16 November) contained about 780 million pieces of express goods, using more than 3 billion woven bags, 99.22 million packing boxes and 169.85 billion metres of tape, with tape length that could circle the Earth's equator 425 laps.
This year, the National Post Office is expecting more than 1.5 billion pieces of express business.
Wang, the manager of a garbage incineration center in Beijing, told Xinhua that more than 2,000 tons of rubbish came in daily after the "Double 11" and more than the processing capacity of the burning station.
Courier companies have realized the environmental pollution caused by the express delivery industry cannot be ignored.
A number of electric-dealer logistics companies, including Suning, have introduced recyclable plastic courier boxes, recycled bags that can be repeated as shopping bags and garbage bags, etc., but troubled consumer acceptance is not high.
Ma also called on the logistics industry in Weibo to support "green packaging" and "green logistics."
The tweet harvested more than 68,000 "zings."
What kind of mobile payments do Germans want?
Zhang Winter: The mobile payment war bureau in Germany is not expected.
Micro-trust payments and Alipay have moved the battlefield to Europe, the competitors have not changed, and the grabbing positions have not changed - the Chinese, this is globalization?
Where there is Alipay, there must be a microletter.
According to the agreement with the German electronic payment service provider Wirecard, the microletter paid for a formal start to Germany in November this year and has gradually been laid out in Europe.
The exotic reunion of the two "old townships" took place in Europe.
All along, Alipay and Microtrust pay to sing along the path of globalization.
As for the globalization of China's mobile payments, Erie advises China's third-party mobile payment industry research report 2017, summed up in two ways: First, through strategic investment, experience output, equity and support for domestic mobile payment companies abroad.
The second is to promote the mobile payment service to foreign merchants through Chinese tourists' consumption abroad, thus changing the cognition and acceptance of China mobile payments.
It is true that the Chinese have the world.
China's rapid economic growth, coupled with its large population base, is a tempting figure for Chinese tourists to spend in Europe.
But it was also doomed, and the China Mobile Payment Battalion, which opened in Germany, was not expected.
Micro-trust payments and Alipay are just moving the battlefield to Europe, the rivals haven't changed, the grabbing positions have not changed - or the Chinese, that's globalization?
More pioneering is the question of whether China's mobile payments can land in Europe.
Take Germany for example.
The Magic's "New Retail"
Chen Xin Lei, Yang Kaihan: Amazon announced its foray into bookstores and grocery stores when it crammed into the world's top 10 retailers, and it's worth playing with both timing and motivation.
Amazon opened its first physical bookstore in Seattle in November 2015, followed by two bookstores in Portland and San Diego.
At the start of 2017, Amazon opens storefronts in New York and plans to have at least eight stores by the end of the year.
At almost the same time, Amazon announced that its unmanned supermarket, Amazon Go, would not need to line up or check out, enter the door to sweep, pick up the desired merchandise, and the amount would automatically be deducted from the customer's Amazon account.
As far as Amazon is concerned, it is a surprise that in recent years it has been a surprise to move on top of physical stores.
Because as early as 2007, CEO Jeff Bezos stressed that Amazon would not easily open physical stores unless it met the following four conditions:
We must be sure that this new opportunity will reward the investment of shareholders.
We must be sure that this new opportunity is of great significance to the whole company.
We must be sure that this new opportunity is ignored by the market.
We must be sure that in this market we have enough resources to make customer-oriented differences.
Bookstores and grocery stores are the most crumbling categories in the retail of both entities, and the first to fall after Amazon's rise.
Amazon announced its foray into the two entity markets as it crammed into the world's top 10 retailers, both timing and motivation.
Is Amazon's approach contrary to the guarantees in the shareholder letter?
A similar sound is heard at the other end of the planet. On the morning of October 13, 2016, the chairman of Alibaba's board of directors, Ma Yun, delivered a keynote speech at the 2016 Hangzhou Yunnan Congress.
"From next year, Alibaba will no longer mention 'e-commerce'," he said.
The era of pure electricians will soon be over, and there will be no e-commerce for the next decade or two, replaced by 'new retail'.
Line-up and logistics combine to generate new retail.
For a while, the words "new retail" were as magical as they had been, and they were often hung by the industry.
But what exactly does "new retail" mean?
The concept is not novel if it is simply a combination of a line and a line.
In 2016, eMarketer, which tracks 180 of the largest electricians, estimated total sales at about $200bn, while the largest 25 accounted for more than $159bn.
Of the 25, 18 are traditional retailers that have been operating online for the past five years (like Macy's, Nordstrom, Target, Gap, etc.).
Alibaba Group's 28.3 billion yuan into the Su Ning cloud dealer, also has a history.
Globally, retailers and electricians are moving from a single channel to a full-channel retail system that covers physical stores, electricians, mobile ends and social media.
Is Ma Yunti "new retail" more a summary than a vision for the future?
If not, what is the difference between the whole channel concept and "new retail"?
Perhaps the key to the problem is not how the line and line will blend, but how.
Looking back over the last 20 years in retail, the rise of electric dealers, like the rise of discount retailers in the early years, has focused on price and convenience.
Relying on these two pain points, the electrician moved the standardised products, such as books and CDs, down the line.
With the development of online consumption habits and the increasing customer experience, the electrician reached out to other categories and began to improve efficiency.
In the words of Alibaba CEO Zhang Yong, "Using the ideas and technologies of the Internet to overhaul and upgrade the existing total of about 30 trillion social retailers can effectively satisfy the increasing consumer demand of Chinese consumers, making the whole process of commodity production, circulation and services more efficient because of the widespread use of the Internet and big data."
So the path of the electrician is a path of light assets, real assets.
"Light" means that the burden of fixed assets, staffing, management processes, etc., is not as large as traditional retail; "heavy" refers to the huge investment required in logistics, warehousing, etc.
The change of logistics mode ensures the efficiency of the electrician.
Beijing, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Premier Li Keqiang hosted an executive meeting of the State Council on April 28, arguing that expanding domestic consumer demand is an important step towards steady growth and restructuring, according to a government network.
It was determined that specific programmes should be drawn up on the basis of scientific assessments.
To increase the range of tax-reducing commodities by the end of June of this year by piloting the reduction of import tariffs for some foreign consumer goods with large domestic consumer demand;
Combined with tax reform, we should improve the consumption tax policy of popular consumer goods, such as clothing and cosmetics, and adjust the tax scope, tax rate and collection link in an integrated way;
To establish and restore port-entry duty-free shops, rationally expand duty-free varieties, increase the amount of duty-free shopping, and facilitate domestic consumers to purchase foreign products in China;
We will further promote the facilitation of customs clearance and tax refund for overseas travellers, and strictly implement the requirements for the voluntary filing of tax returns according to law.
To formulate a inspection and quarantine policy to support cross-border electrician imports and clean up unjustified charges for import links;
We will speed up the promotion of Chinese product brands, support the development of physical stores, and realize line-line interaction.
We will standardize the market order, fight fake and inferior, and promote the winners and losers.
Let consumers be comfortable and convenient shopping.
BlackBerry (BlackBerry) phones have not been won by hardware, but there is always a decent amount of peer-to-peer crowding, so there's Passport, which was released last September.
SONY (Sony) often has a variety of black-tech products, such as the flagship 4K-reflective ultra-short scorched head that was released early in the year.
Of course, the price of such high-end atmospheric products is natural, and 5 million yen is about 250,000 renminbi.
Big-size luxury TV has always been a representative of the technical prowess of major manufacturers, and the 77-inch curved 4K OLED TV, brought by the soft LG, is typical of such products.
This is not just a simple fixed angle surface TV, but a complex device for users to allow themselves to adjust curvature according to location!
Based on an ultra-thin display panel of 9mm, LG makes the deformation of the entire tablet difficult to detect by the naked eye, thus achieving the maximum variable of 4000R.
Users simply need to be comfortable to press the remote, allowing the best view of the 77-inch screen to go with it, making it suitable for any viewing scene.
Leica (Leica) doesn't have to say much about its position in the field of cameras, which was released last year with the launch of a brand new T-card as a lens card.
In addition to the T-card 23mm coke and the 18-56mm zoom two shots released during the same period, the Leica M series can be used via the M-Adapter T transfer ring.
Triumph (Diane Finn) captured exactly the key to the problem and developed a new Magic Wire underwear.
With the use of good supporting silicone resin material as lingerie enclosure, the wearer not only enjoys the comfort of no steel lingerie, but also has the full support as the steel ring underwear.
Coupled with a built-in grid stability network that provides more support, the perfect fit of the underwear is achieved, creating plump chest lines.
Now LG's home appliances are quite distinctive, with the CordZero C5 vacuum cleaner playing wireless tracking.
The vacuum cleaner itself is unambiguous, with a maximum of 200 watts of suction, and a KOMPRESSER dust compression technique that can aggregate dust into ash and solve the dust problem.

On 18 January, Alibaba held a high-level dialogue on the eradication of poverty in Chongqing, announcing the promotion of precision poverty eradication and rural revitalization by exploring a new model of "Internet + poverty eradication."
This is the second "addition" to the fight against poverty following the introduction of the village strategy, the launch of the rural Taobao project, the platform for poverty alleviation on the line and the establishment of the Alibaba Poverty Reduction Fund.
It is one of the most important national strategies in China.
Total poverty eradication has never been achieved in China for thousands of years.
"Electrician poverty alleviation is a new round of innovation in poverty alleviation and development, and is an important grab in achieving accurate poverty alleviation and poverty eradication.
The central government attaches great importance to and points out that the role of the Internet in boosting the fight against poverty can be realized, so as to push forward the precision of poverty alleviation, precision removal from poverty, and let agricultural products go out of the countryside via the Internet.
As a result, in 2014, Ali proposed a rural strategy, with big data cloud computing and globalization, as Ali's three core strategies for the next 20 years.
In the same year, Ali launched the Rural Taobao (Village Taobao) Project, which recruited "village two" in the countryside to lead farmers out of poverty and get rich through electricity.
In 2017, Ali worked with the business sector to create a pro-poor channel for agriculture and agriculture.
Ali's platform spawned the Taobao village, which already has 2,118.
Of these, close to 400 appeared in poverty-stricken counties in provinces and 33 in 13 poor counties.
In 2017, the national Taobao Village sales reached 120 billion yuan on Alibaba's Chinese retail platform.
Mr Zhang said that, in the face of a national strategy to fight poverty, Ali had been thinking about how to take a new path out of poverty by using innovation capabilities such as technology, big data and cloud computing in Ali's economy.
Among them, the village is the main carrying platform for the Ali electric dealer to lift out of poverty, and has gone through a new direct-selling Internet link.
In the planting link, village and ant gold uniforms are jointly supported by agricultural tools and small loans.
In 2017, in 832 state-level poverty-stricken counties, ant gold suits served 795, providing them with convenient payment, credit and other services.
Rookies solve warehousing and logistics, Skycats are responsible for sales, and Ali Cloud's big data backup guides agricultural production, further improving the supply standards, quality and market competitiveness of agricultural products.
The development of the electrician out of poverty requires not only products, sales channels, industrial planning, but also talent.
Ali, through the Taobao University, runs an electric business course to teach farmers standardized, qualitative and scale-based cultivation methods.
These courses already cover about 92 per cent of the country's poor counties.
And the idea of "pro bono mentality, commercial means" of poverty eradication can also guarantee Ali's "real poverty reduction" in poverty alleviation.
Alibaba Board Chairman Ma Yun has said poverty eradication should be divided into three stages: Poverty alleviation, poverty eradication and enrichment.
Poverty alleviation is to give people fish, to get out of poverty is to give people fishing, to get rich is to create a "fish pond" for farmers to have fish.
An electrician-led industry that is pro-poor is a fish pond.
In the industry poverty alleviation, Ali and Shaanxi Lochuan co-founded the Lochuan Apple industry pro-poor model, has been replicated across the country as an example.
Ali's work on poverty reduction was also recognized at the decision-making level.
Alibaba-represented electricians have been mailed to ensure farmers increase production and income through line-up channels.
Some village and ant gold uniforms have also been invited to the United Nations and Africa to share their experiences in poverty eradication.
At present, the Chinese office of the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) has been working with the village to reduce poverty in the electric industry in places like Anhui.
The third new economic think tank conference, co-organized by the Ali Institute and the Chinese Vision think tank, was held on January 16, attended by Zhang Li, director of the Electrical Business Institute of the Ministry of Commerce.
She believes that our globalization ignores the most important issues, namely the question of the body and use of globalization, and the stage of globalization.
This looks like many people believe that globalization has stalled, and that many developed and developing countries, in the new phase, have different attitudes towards globalization.
The second is the question of the medium-term phase of globalization, and what are the constraints of the medium-term phase of globalization?
Constrained by the economic environment, it is because of the change of the economic foundation that globalization has been constrained.
According to Zhang, the global economic adjustment is largely over in late 2017, with a new round of growth after 2018, and the next round of growth must be raw product pulling.
Beijing's first fresh supermarket, 7FRESH, has recently opened and plans to lay more than 1,000 stores nationwide over the next three to five years.
Along with Ali's box of marshmallow, Yonghui's superspecies, Suning's Su Feng, the American League's palm fish, and so on, "new retail stores" began to stack up and "yell at each other" on innovative models and even prices.
Raw supermarket battle escalates, has become a phenomenon-level topic in new retail, where is the new retail?
"In 2018 we will enter the country quickly, and there will be a lot of shops in Beijing, Shanghai and Hangzhou before the Spring Festival."
Box Horse CEO Hou Yi revealed the 2018 "new play" at the second new retail summit.
"Starting in 2018, the box horse is not just a raw electrician, but a life-class electrician who meets consumer instant service.
The core model line is drainage, experience, online is the real sale.
Different from the traditional big-selling, supermarket, box-horse fresh life in the eyes of many consumers is a delicious "red shop", even the intermediary has the concept of "box room."
Online and offline retailers have advantages and disadvantages, and consumers appear in multiple channels.
Industry believes there will be more and more stores in 2018 for "class box horses" in the larger context of consumer upgrades.
And box horses are exploring more consumer areas from the original raw, heralding more innovation in the retail market in the new year.
"For example, the business model combined under the line attracts consumers' eyeballs, and fresh supermarkets are called all over the place."
"But these relationships say so much that it doesn't work, and finally it comes down to whether you're giving consumers a good experience, and I'm ready to pay for it."
In the new retail environment, consumer habits have changed and demand for purchases has changed.
On the original line, the line is cut, the line is to be defeated, the line to counter the line, now is to hold hands together, because the consumer already has no line-line distinction.
Capital's race to the top, the new retail powder that is currently represented by raw supermarkets.
The analysis suggests that new retail competition in frontline cities is still far from the Red Sea pattern, and that there are still large swathes of second-line cities still to be dug up, and the market still has great opportunities and space.
Different types of industry for the new retail layout, will bring new retail development into a diversified state of development.
CCTV Financial Channel combined with the Institute of Financial and Strategic Studies of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, to comb a dry goods, is the heavy annual development report of the Chinese electrician.
What kind of report card did the Chinese electrician come up with this year?
What are the trends of global electric traders?
Let's make it known.
Total sales break record growth back to accelerated track
Since 2006, online retail sales in our country can be said to have been growing at an ultra-high speed.
But since 2013, online retail growth has begun to fall below 50%, with growth below 40% for the first time in 2015 and 26.2% in 2016.
But things are different this year, with online retail sales accelerating again, with growth picking up to 34.2 per cent in January-September.
Significantly higher than the 2015, 2016 growth rate.
It may be that everyone spins around and finds it more enjoyable to buy and buy.
Among them, online retail sales of goods in kind amounted to nearly 5.08 trillion yuan, while online retail sales of services amounted to nearly 1.49 trillion yuan.
The share of total retail sales of social goods reached 13.6 percent, up nearly 3 percentage points year-on-year.
Classmates, don't doze off, focus, service online retail sales is definitely a great credit!
Second, French netizens, who love to chop hands, have a net purchase of $1,925 per person, while their net purchase of the most goods is clothing, a country that loves fashion.
Is it a young man who loves the net?
Help you avoid the company becoming the next good start-up
Amy Erett had wanted to investigate staff happiness at her e-commerce start-up, but the investigation didn't work.
The responses are often vague, unhelpful and, worse, deceptive.
Even if she promises to use anonymity, some employees still don't trust the process.
Erett, who manages 75-person San Francisco-based e-commerce hair care company Madison Reed, said "the responses received lacked consistency and objectivity."
So she called for help.
A new set of human resources start-ups has sprung up to help companies understand how employees feel.
They build and authorize software specifically designed to measure employee participation, allowing companies to fast-track opinion polls targeting specific teams and population groups, provide anonymous and complaint hotlines for employees, and in some cases allow whistleblowers to bypass executives "direct reporting to the board.
"Right now, you can track your health with tools such as Strava and Fitbit, but where is the company's Fitbit?" Said Jim Barnett, co-founder and CEO of Redwood City startup Glint, which is used by companies to measure employee professionalism.
Mr Erett said within three years she had gained more insight into staff thinking and feeling with Glint.
In addition to quick surveys and polls by specific teams, Glint also offers company heat maps, which units have the most complaints, and which managers approve low scores, at a glance - which gives her insight into why.
Companies are beginning to realize that they have to be skilled at taking control of the company's workplace culture, lest they become the next best step.
For start-ups like Glint, the company's desire for oversight is a modest business opportunity.
The global governance, regulatory and compliance industry is likely to be worth more than $18.7 billion by 2020, according to financial technology analysis website Let's Talk Payments.
Convergent, a start-up in Denver, Colorado, is committed to helping companies prevent and detect bad behavior, and they saw an increase in interest and activity during the damage to their reputation earlier this year.
Convergent has nearly 600 customers, including EpiPen, Microsoft and Tesla.
He recently signed up to become a client.
Like Glint, Convergent allows companies to send customized "diagnostic" surveys, collect confidential responses in real time, and view heat maps of their problem areas.
Convergent also provides an anonymous text message hotline that lets employees report bad behaviour.
If the chairman is implicated, the complaint will go directly to the board.
Patrick Quinlan, founder and chief executive of Convergent, said: "The court of public opinion has usurped the powers of the regulator.
If a company is found to be treating staff poorly or performing immoral to employees, even if regulators don't step in, the company could face the high consequences of consumer boycotts, staff loss and involvement in litigation, Mr Quinlan said.
Ruby Tuesday, a catering chain that spans more than 500 locations and has more than 25,000 employees, has used Convergent for more than a year to ensure staff are aware of work guidelines and work protocols and provide easy access to company headquarters.
Until then, if employees want to report problems, they must find a company headquarters phone number or e-mail to file a formal complaint, and hope that they will be taken seriously by Headquarters.
It's often a daunting and unsettling experience, says James Vitrano, general counsel for law at Ruby Tuesday, who doesn't think there's a good way to track staff complaints.
But now that the company uses Convergent, it will be quicker to spot and address issues previously unknown to executives in remote offices, cities or states - such as discrimination, harassment or unfair wage behaviour.
"I could have a more near-Earth, 360-degree view of the work experience," said Vitrano, who runs Ruby Tuesday's risk management team.
"We are protecting our shareholders from employment litigation," the statement read.
Mr Quinlan said companies had paid more attention to ethics, values and employee professionalism since 2002, following the collapse of Andorra's accountancy firm for ethics violations in the Enron scandal.
But it wasn't until "social media went into their own world" that companies realised they couldn't stop their bursts from spreading viral online.
"Before using technology to monitor morality, people see hope as a strategy," he said.
Both Glint and Convergent offer their software as a service and charge companies a recurring fee for product use.
This business model and business opportunities are supported by venture investors who already support both start-ups.
In February, Convergent raised $10 million from companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, and its total capital rose to $47 million.
In November, Glint received $10 million from Bessemer Venture Partners for a total of $60 million.
Given the interconnectedness of companies, culture and venture capital, these investments are hardly surprising.
A growing body of research shows that today's employees expect more from the workplace than before.
In a competitive market like Silicon Valley, high-paying and interesting projects are just bets.
Employees want to feel they are accepted, valued and feel their time spent on a company with a positive mission.
"When people are happy to join the company and feel that their voices are being listened to and the work they do is beneficial, they are more committed to making the company successful," said Nina McCartney, vice president of global welfare and employee experience at LinkedIn.
Investors return when their portfolio companies perform well; companies perform well when employees are loyal and dedicated.
It is not surprising that third-party analytics tools promise to increase staff loyalty and professionalism.
Workplace culture experts say it is important to have data on employee professionalism.
But the data is useless unless the company's administrators take action.
In fact, if a company asks employees for feedback, it can be expected that the company is making changes.
If change is not going fast enough, or without a bit of progress, it could lead to disappointment and lead to staff leaving the company.
"If you're looking for 4000 recommendations, then you need to be ready for 4000 conversations," said Russell Rath, head of consulting operations at business management firm Cotter International, who has seen companies rely too heavily on data collection errors.
"Because if you don't follow it all the time, the staff will think, 'Do you really hear me?
Do you care?
Why should I care if you don't care? '

NCAA cancels twice-daily training to extend bear's day training
As the clock neared 11pm, UCLA football players wandered around to chat around the team's new campus practice range.
Some players have taken off their sweatshirts to reveal the sweaty body of the first day of training.
For a large part of the team, this idle few minutes is a break.
Players taking the summer course will return to their dorm for final exams after three hours of practice, and then return to the Wasserman Football Centre at 6: 30 a.m. the following day.
"The next three days are a grind for these guys," Bear Coach Jim Mora said as he approached Tuesday.
The NCAA canceled two daily exercises (designed to ease the burden on players) but actually extended their daytime training hours - at least until the end of Friday.
That's why UCLA's first three training sessions are scheduled to start at 7: 15 p.m. to accommodate a schedule that players have already squeezed.
From cancelling two training sessions a day to more one-day training, the Cubs began training almost a week before last season, with Mora training for the first time in six seasons at Westwood.
They plan to start 18 training sessions starting Aug. 20 before starting their pre-match preparations for the inaugural game against Texas farmworkers in September.
Mora said he supports the NCAA's rule tweaks, although that would add another item to the player's busy schedule.
"In three or four days we're going to put a huge amount of training on them and it's very challenging," Mora said.
'They've just passed. They're honing, they're great kids.
I thought about Saturday and we'll have more time, really great, "he said.
UCLA stopped training at the end of the training camp, which was not an easy task given the clear view of the adjacent parking lot and the Luskin Center, which had been thrown all over the field by the football in the defensive net behind the goal post.
The Cubs will be staying at the hotel starting this weekend, but Mora admitted there could be problems once the rooms are vacant during the season.
"We will take security measures," Mora said.
"It's a really worrying question. It's not far-fetched to think that someone might rent a room and sit in a room recording a training scene.
If you have a training tape, it's pretty good.
But we'll pick up security there and there will be security measures in parking lot 8.
We will use existing resources to do our best.
I don't worry too much about that.
We've made plans, "he said.

Facebook to launch fact-checking feature to crack down on fake news
Facebook, the world's largest online social network, is trying to crack down on so-called fake news, Facebook said on Thursday, sending more potential prank articles to third-party testing agencies and showing results below the original post.
Facebook will begin using updated machines to learn to detect possible pranks and send them to fact-checkers, and may display fact-checking results below the original post, Facebook said in a statement on its website.
Facebook has been criticised as one of the main transmission points for so-called fake news, with many believing Facebook influenced the 2016 US presidential election.
The issue has also become a major political topic in Europe, with voters experiencing a flood of false stories ahead of France's presidential election in May, with Germany taking the lead in passing support for a penalty scheme ahead of the September election and a fine if the social media network fails to remove hate posts in time.
In a separate statement in Germany on Thursday, Facebook said it was launching a new fact-checking functional test in the United States, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
"In addition to seeing which stories are being questioned by third-party fact inspectors, there is a desire for more background to help them make informed decisions about what to read and share," Facebook news feed product manager Sarah Sue said in a blog post.
She added that Facebook would continue to test its "relevant article" features and make other changes to its news feed to reduce fake news.
Writing a graphic novel: The story of England's castle
Recently, the tiny Scottney Castle featured in compressed music films and was once a haven for Margaret Thatcher during the seventies and eighties.
But Scott, who has witnessed 700 years of turbulent history in the comfort of the Bee River Canyon in Kent, is now the inspiration for graphic novels written by Jamie Rhodes, a Yorkshire man with a special interest in historical documents and a dragging head.
"I can see the handwriting of the ancients 300 years ago, and I find it so beautiful," he said, looking forward.
"What kind of human fate is it to let this letter fall on my hands?"
Spanning the Middle Ages until the Edwardian era, "An English Castle" reads the families that live in Scottney, each with different, British future artists such as Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer, and Isabel Greenberg.
This is not Rhodes's first book with archives as raw material: He also wrote "The Dead Man's Tooth and Other Stories of 2014," a book inspired by the literature of the British Library, a work he completed with uncontrollable creative passion.
"I couldn't contain my impulse to write when I saw the thumb mark left on the side of the letter," wrote a double agent who worked for Jacobs in the 18th century.
'that's his fingerprint!
And the letter always smells of smoke, because then you need to ignite to have light.
For us 300 years later, the smell makes it feel like they're also around us.
Oh, I like archival literature!
For those who were moved by the old paper, could be supported by the National Trust and Arts Council of England and lived in the castle for nearly four months ("to be honest, I stayed a bit longer") seemed awesome and simply didn't believe it was true.
Rhodes spent days visiting Victoria's "new" castle, flipping through archives, studying the manor's many treasures and antiques, such as hyenas hanging on the walls, and bottles that had been in the moat for centuries.
He strolled through the land and ruins of old castles, chatting with vagrants, gardeners, and sometimes with illustrators for his books.
Then at night, he would "drink whisky and write."
Scott's secret history is not yet clear, as the National Trust is only fully in place after the death of the last heir, Elizabeth Hersey, in 2006.
A decade later, when Rhodes arrived, staff began processing the files, describing them as "hundreds of years ago the aristocracy was going:" Oh, put it in the attic. "
Diaries, letters from the British Empire, a map depicting the boundaries of various countries: "You'd think land disputes would be boring," Rhodes said, "but two families would fight for a birch.
Let go, guys!
Some of the stories in the work take the castle as a starting point, leading to a broader study of British history, including The Labourer, a man-made clue to a 1381 peasant uprising that left a new castle.
"The book" Knight Family of Kent and Sussex "chronicles a riot in the castle in 1380," Rhodes said.
"The peasant uprising began in that area, and I think it was a good place to start an uprising," said the president.
Maybe there's a correlation between the two? '
Other stories are deeply rooted in the history of the castle, such as The Priest, which tells the story of the Darrell family hiding a Jesuit priest for seven years during the British Reformation.
Or "The Smuggler," the story's protagonist as 18th-century smuggler Arthur Durrell, who is believed to have given himself a funeral by filling a coffin with stones (his coffin was discovered years later).
The Darrells are Rhodes's favourite Scott Castle family: "These gentlemen seem rogue, always borrowing money and spending money on things they can't afford.
Generations of Darrell men solve their debt problems by marrying wealthy old women, and I think they should be a bunch of handsome lads who know how to pursue women.
As his mission in the castle ended, Rhodes began looking for other fantastic writing experiences.
He spent two weeks in the wilderness of Finland finishing a graphic novel about "El Zehm?
But Scott has a special place for him.
"I left very sadly," he said.
"It's like: 'Oh, I've got to face the real life of slot cakes.'"

Big energy companies are all "rich," so who in the world's many energy companies is the most expensive?
Yesterday, the prestigious PFC Energy company unveiled its top 50 list of energy companies in 2011, with U.S. oil and gas producer ExxonMobil leading the league with a market value of $406.3 billion, followed by PetroChina and Royal Dutch Shell.
In the PFC's list, PetroChina came out twice in 2007 and 2009, with ExxonMobil at the top of the list for other years.
A total of three companies from mainland China were shortlisted in the top 50 list in 2011, in addition to No.2 PetroChina, the 9th-ranked Chinese petrochemical and the 15th-ranked Chinese marine oil.
But while oil prices are now far higher than they were four years ago, the CEO of PFC Energy points out that there are a number of reasons for the low overall market capitalization, mainly including a drop in North American gas prices and low activity in global stock markets.

U.S. changes green card rules
Media outlets quoted President-elect Donald Trump as saying the United States would launch a new immigration plan to amend green card regulations.
The plan would reduce legal immigration to 50,000 a year, and temporary work visas and family-oriented visa applications would be subject to stricter rules.
The new rules are proposed by Republicans and supported by the president.
The draft law will be discussed in both chambers.
"This law will reduce poverty, raise wages, save billions of dollars for taxpayers and achieve the benefits by changing the way the United States gives green cards to citizens of other countries," Trump was quoted as saying by US media.
The law would replace current programs to reduce chain immigration.
This new application process is beneficial for applicants who speak English, have financial support and have the skills to develop the economy.
On May 29, the first Chinese fireworks safety and environmental fair will be held in Liuyang.

In order to optimize the landscape environment and build a beautiful South Yue, recently, the "636" voluntary service brigade of the tobacco bureau of South Yue District carried out environmental protection activities.
The activities not only received the support of all cadres and staff of the District Tobacco Bureau, but also attracted retired cadres and family members to participate in environmental practices.
The volunteer service aims to protect the South Yue landscape resources, promote the concept of "caring for others, caring for society and caring for nature," and also allow the next generation to embrace the virtues of volunteerism from an early age.
Since its establishment in early April this year, the "636" voluntary service brigade has developed 16 members and launched a series of volunteer activities, including visiting disabled retail customers, helping tobacco farmers to care for tobacco leaves and Ya'an earthquake love donations.

Sex robots are emerging, but we should be careful
Just when you think 2017 won't be more bizarre, the sex robotics field has released a new technology development report.
Yes.
Sex robots are a big deal now.
More recently, the Accountability Robotics Foundation (FRR) released a report looking ahead to the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years.
We need to start taking the rise of sex robots seriously, according to Noel Sharkey, emeritus professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of FRR.
Customers can choose the robot's eye color, nipple shape and nail type.
"People are laughing at the back, but the major companies do launch a lot of sex robots and we'll see more," Sharkey said at the time of the new report.
Modern sex dolls have evolved from inflatable dolls to robots that have silicone skin, feel warm, and deliberately use artificial intelligence to set up human-like sexual reactions.
Users can also "customize" their robots to satisfy their preferences, from eye colour, nipple shape to nail type or colour.
But even more troubling is the fact that a lot of robots with "personality" make "replica petite wives" look advanced.
Modern sex toys have evolved into robots with silicone skin.
For example, RealBotix robots can come from definitions, such as shyness, based on what users consider attractive.
There are also Roxxy Gold sex robots developed by True Company, which can pre-set personality traits, including a slightly shy "Cold Farah" and "Wild Wendy" that are happy to risk.
"The Roxxy Gold robot has the personality to match you as much as possible," the True Company website said.
So she loves what you love.
She also had small emotions in those days as normal people!
She can be lazy, talkative, or 'lively'!
The rise of sex robots brings a lot of unease - not just to replace real human relationships - but the servile feminine traits and the rape cues pumped in the colourful (read: Resist) Farah are the most worrying.
True Company likened Roxxy to a man's vibrating stick on its website.
"If women have vibrating rods, then why shouldn't men have Roxxy?" The website states.
Yet these sex robots are not a mere fetish or a sex toy.
Their emergence and growing maturity refer directly to the darker, deeper parts of our culture: Fleeing from perfect gender equality and moving toward sex with subjects as additional options.
Of course, most men don't have sex robots, and while FRR points out that sex robots are becoming more popular, they are still on the verge of consumer culture.
But the penetration from the edges gives us a glimpse of the process of our time.
Many people are not bizarre or aggressive until the free market gives them the chance to become so.
It's no coincidence that these fine sex robots appear at a time when global women's rights are under threat, and a president in the White House brags about sexual violence against women.
The most chilling part of the TV drama "The Story of a Girl" lies not in the realistic picture, not in the hanging corpse, nor in the eyes that are dug out, but in the overly real imagination.
The Republic of Gilead is a jump, but it doesn't look far away now.
The goal behind these sex robots is to do the best they can to create the bodies that most resemble real women (though by porn stars).
The creators of these robots want them to have human touch and mimic real human movements.
But to put it bluntly, their "personality" does not represent real women.
They can't break up or leave.
They have no recourse agency and no follow-up story, no independence at all, and nothing that could break the illusion of complete slavery.
In other words, they are sex slaves.
Or according to the 2017 popular phrase: Maid.
"The Great Wall" tells the story of a Chinese elite force in ancient times who defended humanity and fought a life and death battle with a monster on the world-famous Great Wall.

"On the show, the same thing I'm not going to do, keep updating," Deng said.
Trump's great exploits?
Make Mitt Romney the epitome of common sense
Political disagreements have polarized the American electorate and, from a microscopic perspective, have undermined American family harmony.
Around Christmas and Thanksgiving, major American newspapers are awash in commentary columns about how to deal with the fear of voting Trump relatives.
It is often thought that we are doing everything we can to pierce our "filter bubble."
Less vocal is the strength of Trump's efforts to bring his family together.
I mention this because my cousin, a leftist poet living in Chicago, has long disagreed with the Republicans in our family, and this week he's coming to New York to visit me.
She reminded me that uniting against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.
Because of working with Trump in the White House, everyone she knows, even relatives of Republicans who have been in political spat for decades, is now suddenly and strangely on the same front.
It's certainly a good thing if it's all at the dinner table, but it's shocking to me that, from a broader perspective, there's a significant risk.
While leftist figures have been abetted by Trump, the warping effect of his presidency has driven us all to the right.
When we talk about "normalization" and Trump, we're referring to the possibility that his odd behavior might stop someday.
There is, however, a more worrying long-term scenario in which Trump wants to "normalize" relations with right-wing Republicans who previously opposed Mr. President's standards and now suddenly look like a symbol of reason.
I find myself recently nostalgic for Mitt Romney's version of the epic: Putting a dog on a car, 14 percent income tax (but at least we know his tax returns), and the crimes of the two moves appear to be too slight for Trump.
Once the Trump era has passed, the next Republican nominee just needs to be intellectually qualified for immeasurable improvements.
When my cousin lives in town, we take our kids to the carousel at New York Park, the largest merry-go-round run by New York's Central Park administration, and if you don't need coffee, the three-dollar ticket is the most consumer value you have in the city.
The sound of the Trojan horse is thunderous, the central cylinder is designed for fiberglass, all clowns and animals turn their heads and look at their shoulders in horror and menacing, while the jingle music rings strangely.
Too many vulgar cities are disappointing: The landscapes overlooking the high-rise buildings become old-fashioned, the skyline becomes too familiar to provide too much excitement, and the reality of the city doesn't support the dream.
Thirty-five years later, I haven't completely forgotten that day, and I found that this "Swiss hut" was not actually a Swiss hut, but an "old Swiss cottage" in the theme bar, which I can't remember, but near an intersection in north London.
However, Central Park's merry-go-round remains a magical experience for two-year-olds, an 11-year-old, and four 40-year-old two girls all having fun.
If I could evaluate the carousel, I would give it a full score, but fortunately no one asked.
But this week in a department store, before brushing the credit card, I was asked to rate my trading "experience" one to five stars.
The same can be said of the coffee shop in the corner of my street, in addition to the option of scoring with a 15 per cent tip, which is to buy at the counter.
The effect is not only to slow down what should have been a neutral transaction, but to put pressure on the waiter to add personal factors to unwanted scenarios.
The poor woman in the department store laughed apologetically while I was tired and the credit card trading experience gave her five stars.
Oscar Pistorius transferred from prison to hospital with chest pain
This is the second time Pietris has left prison to be transferred to hospital.
He was taken to the hospital last year for a wrist cut, which the prison official said was caused by his fall in the cell.
Pistorius was convicted of murder after prosecutors appealed the original manslaughter ruling.
On Valentine's Day 2013, he shot Stinkamp multiple times through a toilet cubicle door at his Pretoria home to his death.
Pistorius claims to have mistaken his girlfriend for an intruder hiding in a cubicle at night.
Prosecutors have announced their intention to appeal again, this time for a six-year prison sentence against Pistorius, who they believe is too benevolent.
The National Prosecutor's Office has indicated that it will appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa, which could be heard this year.
If the prosecutor wins, Pistorius faces an increase to 15 years in prison.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.

Recently, Shanghai, Shanxi, Shandong, Jiangsu, Heilongjiang and other local governments have come up with reforms to defuse excess capacity.
Among them, many provinces have even offered to actively seek financial support from the central government for the capacity of their provinces.
One example is that the coal-to-capacity target published in only eight provinces stands at 90 per cent of the national coal cut-off plan.

It was assessed that 134 of the 1251 enterprises listed on the Environmental Credit Management List had been suspended for reasons such as shutdown, non-acceptance and closure.
In the red card enterprises, mainly electroplating, dyeing, control and other heavy pollution enterprises, some sewage treatment plants are also on the list.
To reflect the principles of openness, fairness and impartiality and to accept public scrutiny, the results of the ratings are now published on the website of the Environmental Protection Department.
During the publicity period, the Environmental Protection Department receives public calls, letters, visits and other forms of reflection, and the Environmental Protection Department will investigate, verify and process the issues reflected.
Climate change may destroy a large number of species in an irreversible manner, including the resources and food on which humans depend.

Does lean meat, dairy products and chocolate help alleviate inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)?
Thin meat and chocolate may sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.
But a new study suggests the opposite: A diet rich in meat protein and dairy products can help alleviate the symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease.
The incurable disease affects about 1.3 million Americans and about 300,000 Britons, causing stomach cramps and bloating, recurrent or hemorrhagic diarrhea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
Researchers at the University of Washington typically advise patients to avoid eating meat and dairy products to relieve symptoms, but the researchers found that the protein's key amino acids - tryptophan - help boost immune cell growth, which can enhance gut tolerance.
Lead researcher Dr Marco Colona explained that immune cells patrol the gut to ensure that harmful microbes hidden in food do not go quietly into the body.
The cells that trigger inflammation maintain a balance between cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging various sensitive and vulnerable tissues.
Inflammatory bowel disease can occur when the equilibrium is too biased towards inflammation.
In the experiment, an immune-promoting cell was found in mice carrying special bacteria.
Bacteria require tryptophan (one of the components of the protein) to form the appearance of cells.
Professor Cologna said: "We have established a link between a bacterial population (Roy's lactobacillus, which is a normal part of the gut microbiota) and the development of cell populations that promote tolerance.
The more tryptophan the mice consume in their diet, the more immune cells they have.
He suggested that if humans used the same method, the combination of Lactobacillus lactic and tryptophan-rich diets could create a more tolerant, less inflammatory bowel environment.
Luisa Cervantes-Barraganas, a postdoctoral researcher, studied an immune cell that boosts tolerance, when she found a group of study mice had such cells, but the other group of the same strains were raised separately.
She suspects the discrepancy is linked to the gut microbes of mice (which refer to bacteria, viruses and fungi that usually live in the gastrointestinal tract).
DNA sequencing of mice 'cholesterol found six species of bacteria in mice with immune cells, but none in mice without immune cells.
Mice are raised in sterile environments, so they lack gut microbes and do not appear to be immune cells, while Lactobacillus is present.
To understand how bacteria affect the immune system, the researchers nurtured Lactobacillus in the liquid and then transferred a small amount of the bacteria-free liquid to immature immune cells separated from mice.
The immune cells develop into resilient cells.
When the active ingredient is purified from the liquid, it can be shown that the active ingredient is a byproduct of tryptophan metabolism called indole-3-lactic acid.
When the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the mice feed, the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent, but the number of cells halved when tryptophan levels halved.
Dr Cervantes-Barragan explained that people, like mice, have the same cells that promote tolerance, and most of us have Lactobacillus in our gastrointestinal tract.
It is not known whether humans can induce cell development from tryptophan byproducts from Lactobacillus, like the mice in the experiment, but the genetic defects associated with tryptophan are found in inflammatory bowel patients.
"The development of these cells may be exactly what we want to get, because these cells can control inflammatory reactions on the surface of the gut," she said.
It may be inaccurate to say that the presence of high levels of tryptophan in Lactobacillus may lead to an increase in the number of species.
Jose Mourinho believes Manchester United sign 'genius' Negan Martial
On Wednesday night, after Negan Martial made his debut against Sampdoria, Mourinho decided that United had signed a "genius" midfielder.
Martial, who is from Chelsea and signed for gold of up to ¬£40m, went 2-1 in the league's final preseason game before the European Super Cup against Real Madrid in Dublin on Tuesday, winning the likes of Paul Borgba and Andreas Pereira.
However, with the Bruins pre-season on the Asian Tour, Mattich is in a serious understate and has completed just 45 minutes, with Mourinho admitting there needs to be improvement before the start of the Premier League season.
"He needs time, but he has the experience, the wisdom and the genius to think - he thinks about football," Mourinho said.
"We'll help him get ready as soon as we can," he said.
Mourinho began arranging his starting line-up at the start of the season and, like Martial, new signing players Victor Lindlov and Romelu Lukaku have also started at Inverness Stadium.
The Independent reported this week that Mourinho still hopes to bring in three more signing players, but insists the club is "working brilliantly" with four first-choice signing players in his heart and the club has introduced three of them.
"The club has brought in three of these signing players and I am very grateful," he added.
"I would have been happier if the club had been able to bring in all four players, but they've made a lot of effort for me," said Klopp.
Will China be behind if it doesn't build this warship?
With the recent announcement of plans for the construction of new frigates by the world's major naval powers, as if the frigates had become the focus of major naval attention overnight, first Japan's 2018 defense budget identified two new frigates, making a substantial breakthrough in Japan's DEX frigate program.
With the launch of the latest Type 054A frigate in late 2017, marking the 054A frigate that has been built up to 29 times, the 054A has been built for 12 years, and the construction of such a large number of high-performance generic frigates, except for China, could be compared to that of the United States in the 1970s and 1980s.
And why it is easy to build so many 054A is that it is affordable, useful, and adds to years of naval arrears.
054A frigates have been favored by the Chinese navy for many years with higher value for money and good fighting power, with around 4,000 tons of water, a 76-millimetre gun, 32 units of sea red flag-16 and fish-8 anti-submarine missiles, eight hawks 83 and one straight-9 helicopter, although they were built in 2006 and designed for a very early time.
But this is, after all, a ship designed at the beginning of the 21st century, with weapons configured on one side, and its power systems and electronic radar equipment already very different from the current world's mainstream frigates, when the same type of frigates in Europe are equipped with full-power propulsion, small multifunctional phase-array radar, and large-size helicopter decks.
So how China's new frigate should develop is directly related to its future positioning and the strategic approach of our Chinese navy.
The future development of the Chinese navy is bound to be a completely blue-water navy, and the future is bound to move toward the ocean, with rapid deployment in areas of vital interest to China, a demonstration of the presence of force and, if necessary, a strong fighting force to ensure that China's vital interests in the region are not damaged.
Looking at the positioning of the new frigates in future Chinese naval sequences, the future Chinese navy should be similar to that of the US Navy. Apart from the required offshore defense vessels, other main vessels will form aircraft carrier combat groups or amphibious attack ships as required.
The role of the new frigate should be used as an anti-submarine main force in the future aircraft carrier battle group and the location of the near-regional emptying.
Based on the above-mentioned positioning, it is possible to imagine the future of the domestic frigate.
In the first place, there will be a significant increase in the volume of water from the current Type 054-A frigate, estimated to be about 5,000-6,000 tons of new type frigates; the power system will be equipped with an integrated electric propulsion system consisting of a QC280 modified gas turbine and two diesel engines, with a maximum speed of about 30 knots and a large increase in the capacity of the aircraft; and a red flag 10-launch system should be added to the rear of the ship, with a large-scale system of 8-16 units for the launch of Hawk-18 and new cruise missiles.
As a result, the overall level of the new frigate will reach the world's first-class level, even when compared with the United States FFG.
Of course, the above concept is only the author's conjecture about the new type of frigate, how we can only wait until the new frigate is under water.

In recent years, our city has encouraged enterprises to take an active part in the construction of national, industrial standards and regional group standards.
At the production workshop of Wang Li Group, the head of the group system, Gao Jian, with staff, is packing an anti-theft security door enclosure as a sample for the Zhejiang Manufacturing Group standard-to-standard work.
Just two days earlier, Wang had passed the "Zhejiang Manufacturing" Accreditation Group's on-site audit.
Mr Gao said a professional team of industry technical experts and quality certification organisations praised the group's performance at the core of quality excellence, autonomous innovation, and agreed that it was fully compliant and that Wang would be one of the first to pass the standard as long as the product was tested.
Wang Li Group is only the epitome of standard pry industry transition upgrade.
Our city and its synchronized Zhejiang manufacturing group standard-to-standard and compliance work also has the step-yang, the group rise group.
Since the development of the Zhejiang manufacturing team standard set by our city's burglar security door industry last year, companies such as Starmoon and new companies are also actively applying for docking.
In recent years, there has been a huge influx of capital into the film market, with celebrity actresses rising in popularity and pay-per-view. Producer Ho Jing once blasted that two actors in a hot film were paid nearly $100 million for a two-day play together.
At a time when the actors are in the middle of a series of plays, women are starring in different groups at the same time.

China's household debt ratio is closer to the US than it can afford to buy a house.
In recent times, there has been a discussion about the recent changes in real estate policy, whether real estate policies need to be loosened, and the diversity of the supply of land policies that will not allow house prices to decline?
But when we worry about real estate prices, about macroeconomic regulation, about the future of the real estate market, the People's Daily once again writes, the last time we talked about the tone of the People's Daily's comments on real estate regulation, and now the People's Daily writes about a more serious topic than buying a house, that is, even if you can afford it?
Today, we'll talk about a bigger problem than buying a house: Repaying.
China's growing housing debt crisis
In November 2017, the National Financial and Development Laboratory of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences and the National Balance Sheet Research Center issued a third-quarter report on China's deleveraging process, according to the paper.
The resident sector has increased its debt-to-debt ratio in the entire real economy and its leverage has risen faster.
Research shows that Chinese households' liabilities in financial institutions are dominated by consumer loans, which account for about two-thirds of residents' liabilities, or about two times the amount of operating loans.
Among them, medium- and long-term loans, dominated by housing loans, accounted for about 80 percent of consumer loans, but in incremental terms, short-term consumer loans grew faster than medium- and long-term loans.
On top of that, China's household debt rate is only a statistic of the total amount of credit that the household sector receives from financial institutions, while Chinese households still have many private loans, including borrowing from relatives and friends, and large-scale hidden debts.
According to statistics from the Suning Institute of Finance, China's leverage ratio was only 3 per cent in 1996 and only 18 per cent in 2008, but since 2008 it has started to grow rapidly, doubling to 36.4 per cent in just six years.
In May last year, HSBC released a survey of nearly tens of thousands of people across nine countries.
The report was visited by "millennials" young people in nine countries (born between 1980 and 2000).
The report notes that China has a 70% housing ownership rate for young people after 80 and 90, ahead of the second Mexico (46%) and two times the US target of 35%.
The data tell us the most likely problem is that the biggest potential "grey rhinoceros" of Chinese residents at this stage are estimated to be out of debt, compared to the unaffordable homes.
Why is the housing debt crisis the most serious problem?
As we have said before, although we have been saying that Chinese house prices are higher, China's home ownership rate is actually quite high compared to the rest of the world.
We look at the real estate market around the world. China's real estate market has not had an excessive real estate crisis since its late start, except for what we said before.
And the US real estate crisis is blamed on two houses: Fannie and Freddie.
In the golden age of the United States, real-estate companies sold their homes to low-income people in the United States at a very low rate in order to expand their sales, and the housing market was thriving when the U.S. economy was in good shape, but with a stagnant US economy and a decline in home buyers' incomes, large household spending began to fall.
But the state of the United States at the time was part of the financial assets and real estate assets of American household assets, and nearly all of the household assets of low-income groups in the United States were real estate, while most of the top 20 per cent of high-income groups were financial assets, thus creating a higher debt ratio for real estate in poorer households in the United States.
It is a serious fact that these people are buying houses when the economy is better, so the money to pay for a mortgage is also calculated by their better income, and when income falls, the pressure on mortgages not only fails to reduce, but even as some subprime schemes become more floating, the real estate problems of these American households have evolved into real estate crises.
So the banks began to recoup their properties because they could not afford them because they were underpaid, and when the banks recovered their properties from home buyers who were in arrears, they sold them at very low prices, leading to a step-by-step decline in house prices, a vicious cycle in which more and more homebuyers found their homes even lower than their loans, and more bad debts.
Thus, a huge vicious circle emerged:
"The economy is slumping - incomes are slipping - some people can't afford a mortgage - the banks are selling underpaid homes at low prices - house prices are down - more people are stopping lending - banks are selling again - house prices are falling again..."
And the problem is more than that, because of the continued decline in house prices, you don't have a debt after you stop repaying your house to the bank, and if the bank auction house doesn't have the money you owe to the bank, then you still need to pay back the money, simply assume that you paid $600,000 to buy a house worth 3 million, and when the house goes down to 2 million, you don't just lose your first $600,000, you owe the bank 400,000.
So, just under one vicious circle, America's economy gradually collapsed, eventually triggering the US financial crisis of 2008.
So, at this stage, the level of household debt in China, at 46.8%, is a matter of great vigilance, which is still below the level of developed countries, but the problem is beginning to emerge, and the country's repeated emphasis on deleveraging since last year is a very prescient judgment that household debt rates, if allowed to continue to climb, are bound to pose huge risks.
Thus, after the house is used for housing, not for stir-fried positioning, the state will accelerate the establishment of multi-subject supply, multi-channel guarantee, rent purchase and other measures to further defuse potential risks.
For our individual families, we must give up the speculative thinking of real estate, do our best to buy a house, and avoid a huge burden on your own family.

The British inventor implanted a chip in his body and waved it into the house
A British inventor installs chips for himself, just waving his hand to open his front door, enter the office and even start the car as the nation's first person.
Steven Northam, 33, implanted a small chip between his thumb and forefinger and is now offering the service to companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives, which is being implemented by his company BioTeq through technology.
He has joined forces with Dr Jeff Watson, a senior consultant anaesthetist at the Royal Hampshire Hospital in Winchester, Hampshire, to ensure the implant process meets medical standards.
The technique is similar to a cat-dog chip implant and takes just 30 seconds.
Mr Northam's company will also replace locks for rooms and vehicles to be compatible with the chip, costing ¬£300 per lock.

White House props cost thousands
The White House's decision last month to transport a Marine Corps helicopter to the South Lawn to highlight the huge glory of American manufacturing cost $24,000, according to military records released by Time magazine.
The green-and-white Sikorsky VH-3D, also known as Marine One when the president was on board, was the White House's July 17 highlight of American construction project activity.
President-elect Donald Trump, Vice President-elect Mike Pence and senior White House officials toured manufacturing products from all 50 states.
The exhibit features a Connecticut-made helicopter, a Maine yacht, a Wisconsin fire truck and a Mississippi forklift.
The White House military office asked the helicopter to show up as a daily order (FRGO), just 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn for the "special" event, according to records from the Force Marine Corps Helicopter First Flight (HMX-1), which operates the helicopter.
The day before the event, the HMX-1 commander said in an e-mail sent to the commander in chief of the Marine Corps, "I just want to confirm that you know, because this event is highly valued."
The information indicates that the helicopter will arrive on the South Lawn at about 7am on July 17 for the 3pm event and leave after the lawn is cleared from 6pm to 9pm that evening.
The message also said that in case of a delay in departure from the White House, the return flight would require a second crew because of the time limit on duty.
The original crew was on standby by helicopter during the event, while security forces personnel were on standby nearby when the plane was on the ground.
It was not clear from the records obtained by Time magazine whether a second crew would eventually be needed.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using government property for political purposes.
Records indicate HMX-1 had asked if the event violated the bill.
"One of the questions we asked was whether this violated the Hatch Act and was told there was no breach," the commander wrote.
"It sounds like you're locked," the deputy replied.
The White House defines this "Made in America" event as an official event and is therefore not governed by the Hatch Act.
But even official events have political overtones.
At the event, the president pursued the then Senate issue of health care reform and touted the regulation of government regulations.
It is nothing new to use Marine Corps One or Air Force One for political propaganda purposes.
Successive presidents have been asked to travel on these planes.
But expropriation for photographic purposes is not common.
Trump was in the spotlight in February when, in Melbourne, Florida, the presidential plane slowly glided, eventually stopping to the background of his first campaign rally, and his Twitter account was flooded with complaints about the former president's use of a presidential jet.
White House Deputy Press Secretary Lindsay Walters said the White House was so excited by the "Made in America" exhibition that showcased products from all 50 states that were manufactured by American workers using American materials.
HMX-1 crews often conduct flight training near the Washington area and on the South Lawn, practicing the precise placement of the U.S. president in the White House.
HMX-1 practiced 58 touchdowns at the White House during the G-20 summit in Germany in early July.
An official said the U.S. manufacturing flight was included in this month's crew training requirements.
Helicopter troops also flew an extra 11 hours of "non-presidential support missions" that day.
The White House said taxpayers did not bear the cost of any other props at the event.
A Sikorsky spokesman said the company was not involved in arranging the South Lawn helicopter display.
HMX-1 does not retain a budget record for the presidential flight, so it is very difficult to determine the exact cost of the event.
But the VH-3D Department of Defense can reimburse $24,380 per flight hour, according to the MoD's hourly cost for fiscal 2017.
Force records recorded the plane flying for 30 minutes each time it flew from its base at Marines Airport in Quantico, Virginia.
The White House said the cost of operating the helicopter was well below that.
"It is misleading to estimate the cost to taxpayers based on reimbursable fees," Walters said.
These estimated costs include personnel costs, maintenance costs and many other sunk costs, including in the annual appropriation.
A 2015 RAND study showed that MoD reimbursements did not include personnel costs, but did include oil, maintenance and contracting costs.
At the time, former White House press secretary Sean Spike defended the use of the helicopter for the event,
"The idea is to show what is made in America this week,
And I know that both Sikorsky and Connecticut are proud to have contributed to our national security, and I guess even thousands and hundreds of jobs depend on it.
And I think, like most Americans, we are proud of this helicopter and other military equipment, a result that countless Americans have come to terms with.
So it's certainly not out of place to highlight that.
It's not clear if Trump interacted with the helicopter while touring the South Lawn at the event, but he did sit in the driver's seat of the fire truck.
Inside the White House, Trump spoke to Sikorsky's representatives, joking with the media about the company's plane he owned.
He said "I know the Sikorsky plane very well. I have three."

UN says Afghan democracy depends on women's political status
The head of the U.N. Assistance Mission in Afghanistan said Wednesday that only elections involving all members of society, including women, are representative.
The head of the United Nations Assistance Mission, Nicholas Heissom, said hundreds of women were participating in provincial council elections, three women were in the vice presidential election and more than 30 per cent of newly registered voters were women.
"The status of women cannot be underestimated," he said in a statement Wednesday.
Only when women are fully involved and included in all stages of the electoral process are truly representative and credible elections.
Afghan provincial and presidential elections take place on April 5.
The Taliban intimidated an electoral process that coincided with the transition of international military action to the status of adviser.
This year's elections are the first peaceful transfer of power from a democratically elected government to the next democratically elected government.
Hayssom said the importance of women would promote democracy in Afghanistan.
The Independent Electoral Commission issued a report that 1.2 million of the 3.6 million registered voters were women.

13 developer scrambles to scramble land price in Tianhe district firm red chemical plant or will break $10,000 / m2
This afternoon, there will be no fewer than 13 developers scrambling to grab the chunks of the Hong Kong Chemical Plant. Today, there will be a land area of 17,304 square metres (15,178 square metres of land for construction) with a floor area of 45,534 square metres.
There is a small and medium-sized suite requirement for the plots, and the proportion of the total area under 90 square metres in residential development is not less than 60%.
Based on the maximum size of the small and medium-sized household, the plot will provide at least 303 small and medium-sized dwellings.
It is reported that the site is located on the east side of Huangpu, and across the road is the Tianhe Building Design Institute.
In addition, a second class of residential land (R2) will be available today for the Toad Stone North Road in Baiyun District and Dongpu, with a land area of 32,891 square metres (30,965 square metres of land for construction) and a floor area of 92,895 square metres with a starting price of $613.11 million, equivalent to $6,600 / m2.

Based on some representative indicators of our provincial economy in 2005 and 2011, it is compared with the national and central regions.
In terms of industrial economic benefits, in 2011, a significant proportion of energy-consuming industries such as industrial energy and raw materials in our province were under "double pressure" from market volatility and overcapacity.

GMB concerns investment in McVitie's Glasgow plant
The union wants biscuit maker McVeigh's management to pledge long-term commitment to production at the Rasgow plant.
UKIP Scotland said it had been silent about the future of investment in the Tollcross plant.
The plant, which has more than 500 employees, produces products such as oat biscuits (Hobnobs), strong tea biscuits (Rich tea).
Mr Pladis, owner of McVeigh, said the company had invested more than ¬£5 million into the plant over the past few years.
He added that staff and union representatives "will be the first to know" if there is a change in factory operations.
In a letter to the director of the company, the UK's General Trade Union Scotland called on Mr McVeigh to "resolve the issue of the lack of carry-over of funds to the modernization of the production line."
Drew Duffy, senior organiser of the UK General Trade Union, said: "We are not in a position to get a clear picture of Tolcross's future business needs and investment plans from the managing director of the plant, which is deeply worrying to our members.
Generations of families are working here, and the local community and the Greater Glasgow area have a high concentration of labour, a vital pillar of decent employment in areas with high unemployment and social deprivation.
So from the perspective of jobs, pay and economic prosperity, in the context of Brexit, rising cost of living and a long-term recession in manufacturing, Glasgow East desperately needs McVeigh's expanding production network.
A spokesman for Mr Pladys said: "The director of Tollcross has just received a letter from the Scottish branch of the UK General Trade Union yesterday and the company will respond immediately as we value the continued engagement with employees and union representatives.
Two months ago we held a regular meeting with staff and representatives of the UK General Trade Union in Tollcross to discuss issues publicly.
We had discussions with staff and then, like all other companies operating in a highly competitive and economically uncertain environment, we reviewed our continuing operating model for businesses and factories in order to remain competitive.
She added: "In recent years we have invested more than ¬£5m in the Tollcross plant, particularly in terms of production lines and operating improvements.
We are fully aware of the historical status of Tollcross as a production base, such as any changes in our operations at the plant, and staff and union representatives will be the first to know. "

Sigurdsson may regret throwing an olive branch against Marco Villa

"We respect all clubs.
But if they're trying to sign our players, they're going to have to go for it, too.
Earlier this summer, the Spanish club appeared to cross the line, with Barcelona throwing an olive branch to Paris Saint-Germain midfielder Marco Villa.
Paris Saint-Germain have made it clear they will not allow the Italian international to leave anyway, and Barcelona are likely to be affected by the loss of Nemal.
