Last week, the drama drama “Beauty Private Kitchen” was suspended temporarily. The accident triggered a lively discussion on the fraud of domestic TV drama ratings.
Civil rights groups issue travel warnings for Missouri
Due to discriminatory policies and racist attacks in Missouri, the American Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) issued travel warnings to colored people planning to travel to Missouri.
“The NAACP Missouri Travel Advisory, which took effect on August 28, 2017, called for a series of suspicious racial incidents in Missouri recently. All African-American travellers, tourists, and Missouri should pay special attention and take a very cautious approach when traveling in Missouri,” the group’s statement stated.
The NAACP pointed out that the recent adoption of a Missouri law made it harder for people to win discrimination lawsuits. The state’s law enforcement also targeted minority groups, which prompted the organization to issue travel warnings.
Infringement of civil rights is happening to people.
They were questioned by the parking lot and beaten or killed because of their skin color,” Miss Robber, the NAACP chairperson of Missouri, told The Kansas City Star.
"We have received many complaints, unprecedented in quantity."
This is the first such warning issued by the organization for a state in the United States.
The organization cited the University of Missouri’s racial slur on black students and the death of Tory Sanders, a 28-year-old Tennessee black man.
Earlier this year, Saunders died in suspicious circumstances, when he was running out of fuel in Missouri and was detained by Missouri police without charge.
The consultation also pointed out that a recent report from the Office of the Attorney General of Missouri shows that “black drivers in the state are 75% more likely to be checked for parking than whites”.
Chapel said: "This consultation is to raise people's awareness and warn their family, friends and colleagues of what may be happening in Missouri."
“People need to be prepared, whether it is carrying bail to Missouri or let their relatives know they are traveling in the state.”
According to the latest data from the FBI Hate Crimes Reporting Program, Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015; according to the amount of crimes, the state ranked 16th in the country.
The travel warning is also a response to Missouri’s new law, which will make it more difficult to prosecute housing or employment discrimination.
Previously, states across the United States passed immigration enforcement laws requiring local law enforcement agencies to detain immigration offenders. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) stated that it would increase the number of racial lawsuits and issued travel advice for Texas and Arizona.
Travel warnings are usually issued by the U.S. government for other countries, but recently the advisory group has taken this approach to respond to certain laws and trends in the United States.
After going through the "golden age" of the surge in box office in 2015, the overall movie market entered a cooling period in 2016. The ability to break through the total box office score of 44.069 billion yuan last year has become a suspense.
From the data released by the National Bureau of Statistics, Beijing’s new homes and second-hand housing prices both cooled in October, only up 0.6% and 1.1% month-on-month.

BBC Says Beijing as the Most Exciting City: Making Foreigners Feel “Life in a New Age”
Reference News Network reported on January 18 that the British media said that Beijing may have a long history of 3,000 years, but it is also rapidly transformed into today's modern glamour city.
The Chinese capital has an amazingly high-speed Internet, cutting-edge technology such as face recognition software, has invested heavily in artificial intelligence and has unmatched international energy. It is one of the most exciting cities for foreigners who are full of exploration spirit.
According to the BBC website reported on January 16th, the German expatriate Clemens Sese said: "If I can succeed there, I can succeed anywhere afterwards." He quoted singer Frank Sinatra singing songs praising New York City.
Sese, creative director of Traveler Archives, said: “If Sinatra lived today, he would probably sing a city like Beijing.” He said that living in this city will make you feel “live in a new age” and always keep up with the trend.
Simon Norton, who lives in England but recently lived in Beijing, published an article on personal blog site 4Corners7Seas: “People generally have a feeling of being at the center of something grand. This feeling is hard to say clearly, but it leaves many foreigners there for a long time. They want to see what it will become and want to witness it.”
According to reports, the city's high-quality, high-speed Internet and technology-friendly environment make everyday life easier than ever before.
Andy Peñafuerte, who is currently deputy editor-in-chief from Manila and currently on the Beijing Children’s website, said: “Beijing is rapidly transforming into a cashless society. The Internet integrates the functions of traditional wallets into smart phones, making it easier for everyone to conduct many transactions.”
According to the report, smart phones are just the beginning of Beijing’s technical ambitions. Face recognition software has become very popular. Many mobile phone applications use this technology to make bank transfers and payments, allow people to enter apartments and offices, and even use it to verify the identity of car drivers.
Beijing also recently announced plans to invest 13.8 billion yuan in the construction of an artificial intelligence technology park. When it is completed, more than 400 companies will settle there. They will focus on the development of artificial intelligence technologies ranging from biometrics to self-driving cars.
Food is also the core of China’s many major festivals over the years. Participation in these celebrations is highly respected by foreigners. The Spring Festival is the most important social and economic festival and one of the most popular festivals for foreigners.
Sage said: “I suggest helping Chinese friends prepare for the New Year. It is equally important to clean the apartment and put a New Year's greeting on the Red Spring Festival couplets. On New Year’s Eve, all family members must gather to have a sumptuous meal, and then celebrate the New Year with a gorgeous fireworks as they wait until midnight. For foreigners, spending the evening with friends and family is indeed an opportunity for integration.”
According to the report, the number of foreigners in Beijing is large and growing, but the language barriers in China and the convenience of exchanges between the expatriates can easily become an excuse for them not to fully integrate into the local culture.
Sage said: “Some foreigners have lived in China for many years, but they have little experience with their host country. If your initial attempt to contact the Chinese is not successful, then it is easy for you to feel more comfortable with other foreigners.
"In these so-called "Laowai Bubbles" ("Laowai Bubbles" refers to foreigners who only mix among foreigners without touching the locals and local culture - Translator's Note), foreigners huddle in their own communities, eat in Western restaurants, and only foreigners among friends.
The easiest way to overcome this is to learn a little more Mandarin – something that is simpler than one might think.
Sage said: “One or two hours of private lessons in Chinese every week or learning entry-level radio plays should suit everyone’s busy schedule.”
Even learning a few classic phrases will help with shopping, ordering a meal in a restaurant, or chatting on a taxi.
The report said that stubborn air pollution is also a fact of daily life, but in recent years the government has tried to curb some problems.
Residents emphasized that outdoor activities are very important in warm months when pollution is often light. It is important to consider those blue sky days as opportunities in historic hutongs or to explore the popular Ritan Park.
Norton said: "Beijing is the Chinese city that can find the most things below the surface. You can find very good arts and music activities, indulgent nightlife, historical wonders, ultra-modern business districts and ancient hutong areas."
The report believes that aging has an increasingly significant impediment to the growth of human capital, especially in the northeastern region, where the average annual contribution of aging to the growth of human capital is -1.28%.
Pan Gongsheng pointed out that the current risk of cross-border capital flows is controllable, and the fundamental factors supporting the balance of international payments still exist for a long time.
China News Service, Beijing, December 17 (Reporter Gao Kai) The world is paralyzed by heritage - The 2016 International Forum on the Identification, Restoration and Protection of Ancient Chinese Calligraphy and Painting was opened at the Renmin University of China on December 17.
The European Commission in April accused Google of forcing mobile phone manufacturers to preinstall Google search and Chrome browser software, or they would not be allowed to use other Google applications.
The European Commission believes that this move is detrimental to the interests of consumers and hinders competition.
EU regulators initially asked Google to respond before July 27.
If the anti-monopoly conviction is established, Google faces a maximum penalty of 10% of its global revenue, which is approximately US$7.4 billion.
Google has not commented on this immediately.
Google also faced EU investigations because of its preference for home shopping services in search results.

A picture to understand: Bitcoin's legal status around the world
Abstract: In addition to the natural price correction triggered by speculative properties, the current round of digital currency tumble has also been associated with the “alien enemy”—regulatory risk.
From the visual maps, the attitude of the eastern countries towards Bitcoin is more conservative than that of the West, and the countries that account for the global majority are still watching the legitimacy of digital currencies, representing that the “risk of the black swan” is still very large.
*This article is from Wall Street (wechat ID: wallstreetcn), editor Wang Mu.For more exciting information, please visit wallstreetcn.com, or download Wall Street News APP.*
With the overwhelming regulatory turmoil in major markets such as China, South Korea and the European Union, bitcoin-led global digital currencies have been bitterly washed this week. Bitcoin prices fell below $10,000 in psychological integers since Tuesday and the biggest one-day drop in three years.
In addition to the natural price correction triggered by the speculative nature, the current round of digital currency tumble has also been linked to the “rising enemy”—the risk of regulation.
At this important juncture, HowMuch.net, a visualization big data website, produced a map showing the legitimacy and policing of Bitcoin in countries around the world.
As shown in the following figure, Green represents the legal market for Bitcoin; Orange represents the neutral market, and although there is no public legalization of bitcoin status, there are no major usage restrictions; pale pink represents the restricted market, ie, the local government attempts to use digital currency through the redline policy or regulation; deep pink represents the country where Bitcoin is defined as illegal; gray is the country that has not yet been commented on.
(The above figure comes from the HowMuch.Net visualization team drafted on January 15th)
The article points out that from the distribution of non-green color patches in the graph, it can be seen that the Oriental countries in the traditional sense are more conservative towards Bitcoin than the West.
Russia is currently the largest country that defines Bitcoin as illegal. China is one of the largest restricted markets for Bitcoin, and India is one of the largest countries that have not commented on Bitcoin yet has introduced relevant policies.
North America and Western Europe are the regions that receive the highest level of Bitcoin acceptance, that is, the distribution of green blocks is more concentrated.
The views of the countries in the Middle East and Latin America on Bitcoin are clearly divided, and the distribution of color patches in these regions is more mixed.
Among them, Iraq, Iran, Turkey, and Brazil are all legitimate bitcoin markets. Afghanistan, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and Bolivia have some restrictions on their trading and use. More Latin American countries have not made any sound about Bitcoin.
From the above data, it can be seen that of the 246 countries that are subject to statistics worldwide, a total of 99 countries (or 40% of the total) do not impose restrictions on the transactions and use of Bitcoin, ie green and orange areas.
Seven countries (or 3%) are restricted markets (pale pink), 10 countries (or 4%) define Bitcoin as illegal (dark pink), and 130 countries (or 53%) have no more digital currency information (gray).
This shows that countries that account for the global majority (53%, more than half) are still watching the legitimacy of bitcoin-led digital currencies in the country, and also represent Bitcoin's "black swan risk" is still very large, because some of these countries may eventually make legislative decisions to limit digital currencies.
The article believes that global regulators have not yet fully understood the emerging category of digital currency and may be the main reason why most countries have not made a statement.
Although Bitcoin’s “popularity” has grown exponentially since last year, it does not mean that all countries are interested. It may be that some countries are concerned that the local currency is threatened or that digital currencies are used by criminal organizations.
Wall Street News once wrote an article summarizing the international regulatory news for bitcoin since last week, including China’s central online service platform and mobile app for combating over-the-counter exchanges, South Korea’s still considering closing digital currency exchanges, the EU’s view that Bitcoin has not been widely accepted and warns investors of the risk of “losing everything for nothing”.
The Wall Street News Editor's Selection "Reading News | 2018: The Global Central Mother Opens the First Year of Digital Currencies" has mentioned that from the perspective of supervision, acceptance/criticism and adoption, 2018 will be the first year of the global central bank's digital currency.
The practice of criticizing the legitimacy of bitcoin by big countries such as Russia is in fact to make way for the official distribution of digital currencies.
Xinhua News Agency, Madrid, January 8th (reporter Xie Yuzhi) Barcelona’s new aid Coutinho debuted in Barcelona on the 8th at Nou Camp.
Coutinho passed the medical examination of Barcelona on the morning and signed with Barça M. Bartome, the president of Barcelona, on a contract that will expire in the summer of 2023.
He then played as a Barcelona player before nearly 7000 fans in Camp Nou.
According to Spanish media, Coutinho's transfer fees totaled 160 million euros (1 euro is equivalent to 7.77 yuan), which is the history of Barcelona club and La Liga.
With Coutinho still hurting at the moment, he still needs to rest for nearly 20 days before he can greet his debut with a Barcelona jersey.
What else is sacred?
Trump’s White House is now aiming for the Statue of Liberty
The surest sign of change in regime is when they start attacking the statue.
The Americans share this with everyone, so Saddam Hussein in Paradise Square in Baghdad was overthrown in 2003.
As one of the key think tanks of the Trump administration, Stephen Miller knew he would know what to do about the symbolic axe of the Statue of Liberty when he had a heated argument with CNN's Jim Acosta about the president’s proposal to strictly limit legal immigration.
To be fair, Miller did not attack the statue itself.
If he does, then a group of cruise ship owners and followers of liberalism will surely swallow him.
But he did attack the significance of the statue, especially when the famous poem Emma Lazarus was engraved on the base in 1903 (the monument was built 17 years later).
As Miller denounced Acosta, saying: "I don't want to talk about all the facts of history here, but the Statue of Liberty is a symbol of America's freedom to light up the world....
The poem you pointed to was added later, not part of the original Statue of Liberty."
In fact, Miller is correct, but as he himself said, this is not really about history.
This involves a modern echo of Lazarus’s shocking words. The only country that seems to invite not only any old immigrants but also the poorest of the poor: “Your tiredness, your poverty, or your crowded people long for freedom to breathe, and/or the miserables reject your crowded beach.”
There is no moment when "those who suffer" refuse to get more glare on our screen.
Miller did not engage in literary criticism. He clearly showed that these people in the Trump era will not be welcomed in the United States.
This conflict about the meaning of the statue is part of a wider political and cultural warfare: it is actually in conflict with the spirit of the United States.
Lazarus, along with her friends who had an event after her death and engraved her poems on the pedestal, knew very well that the behavior they were participating in was highly political.
The purpose of this sculpture is to express the connection between France and U.S. republicanism through the ancient metaphor of the feminine incarnation of the Statue of Liberty.
Lazarus changed this meaning: In her poems, the female figure is no longer abstract, she wants to sound.
She gave her a very different name: mother of exile.
The combination of this poem and the painting is a successful feminist coup, and it is a devastating blow to American nativism.
Just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, the right-winger always wanted to change it back to its original meaning.
The great speaker Rush Limbaugh, who was a baptist at the time of Trump's arrival, thought in 2010 that liberalism did not invite anyone, but he is now an early neo-conservative, bringing the flame of American wisdom to the foolish world: “The goddess of liberty is brave.
She intended to bring the torch of freedom from the United States to other parts of the world.
The torch is not the way to light the United States."
What is unusual is that Limbo is actually touched by something.
The meaning of the statue depends entirely on the perspective of the cognition.
Lazarus’s imaginative approach is to be able to see it, and when weary, poor but hopeful people can see it on the deck of the ship after a long and often terrible journey.
On the surface, this involves the perspective of people who seek asylum and have the opportunity to improve their lives to see the world.
Her statue communicates to them and needs the original intention of hope and welcome they hear.
Of course, this is not what Miller and Trump once wanted to admit.
They are not to light the road but to lighten the hatred of their only source of power.

2017 World Championships: Neil Black highly praises the Scottish players in the British national team
Eilidh Doyle recalled that the British national team had only two Scots.
Neil Black, executive director of the British Athletics Association, said that the team of 16 strong Scots in the World Championships team will make a huge contribution to the "national team."
The number of Scottish field athletes selected to participate in the 2017 London Athletics World Championships opened on Friday set a record high.
Blake believes that "Scotland is achieving extraordinary development" and that British track and field athletes must learn from it.
"We accept and try to understand this, and we will continue until we succeed," Black said.
“I’m looking for people at the Scottish Institute of Sport. They think this is related to their actions.
Scottish track and field athletes think this is related to their actions.
The British Athletic Association believes this is related to their actions.
Even street people think so.
No matter what the situation is, this is extremely brilliant. "
A number of Scottish track and field athletes are medal contestants, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart, who will compete with Mo Farah at 5,000 meters, while Eilidh Doyle is captained by the group.
"Erid is a little modest.
It's incredible that her captain's speech is,” said Black.
“Many track and field athletes, whether or not they are Scots, or wherever they live or train, are proud to walk out the door and walk out of the room with enthusiasm.
The natural passion and true feelings Eric has invested in are very good."
The Commonwealth silver medalist who will participate in the 400m hurdles competition in his fifth world championships stated that there are 16 Scottish nationals in the British national team. This is "unbelievable."
Prior to this, the number of track and field athletes in Scotland participating in the World Championships was a maximum of seven, that is, the number of participants in 1983 and 2015.
Midfielder Muir was a leading figure and in the past year she had made five British records and two European records.
She will participate in the 1500m and 5000m project competitions.
Chris O'Hare, who took part in the 1500-meter event, was another Scottish player to watch. Before that, she achieved very good results in the season. She won the qualifier in the national and Olympic Games in the UK.
Doyle recalled her attending the first World Championships, when the only other Scottish player on the team was Lee McConnell.
The captain said that she was very proud that her many compatriots not only joined the team but also, in some cases, challenged the medals and entered the finals.
"What makes the national team captain special is that it is voted by the other members of the national team. Therefore, knowing that your teammates voted for you to win extraordinary achievements is, in any case, a great honor for me," she added.
"Of course, I am very proud of all the Scottish players.
This just shows how far we have gone.
And they are the old track and field athletes here. They are the track and field athletes who are about to ascend to the podium.
How is my captain's speech?
Well, I think it's great.
I have just referred to the fact that we are very fortunate in this situation because we are hosting World Championships at home.
Therefore, it is truly important for us to rely on home court support and to be able to grow as we return to the Olympic Stadium.
I will get a second chance to participate in the competition, and the atmosphere there will be wonderful."

Masking critics on Facebook: If you can't stand the blame of voters, don’t run for office
Our father-in-law knows the style of the bad media.
Americans love Washington, but not long afterwards, the major newspapers began to attack him violently, from domestic policy to political principles.
He is very annoyed with these criticisms, no doubt.
However, he did not boo the critics.
It was because as early as 1783, Washington said, “Freedom of speech is denied—we will be slaughtered in silence and ignorance like a lamb.”
This reminded me of Maryland Governor Larry Hogan, who needed to learn from Washington.
Hogan's staff blocked and deleted at least 450 posts because they posted their opinions on his Facebook official homepage.
The American Civil Liberties Union filed suit against him earlier this week.
The governor’s staff believes that the lawsuit is sloppy and online reports are full of their strong resistance: “Who cares?”
Many people say "This is just Facebook."
However, this is very important.
This is especially important because people like Hogan are facing.
This is a Republican who served as governor in a predominantly democratic state, and he is surprisingly popular.
Among the 50 governors in the country, he received the highest praise.
Hogan is not a reactionary impatient element.
He steadily controls Maryland and strictly follows the rules.
He is also very good at using Facebook as the primary way to connect with the electorate, and banterly shows his baldness after chemotherapy for the first time on the homepage.
So it's completely unnecessary and ultimately dangerous for people to be shielded from the governor’s home page.The homepage is a public forum, an official management platform advertised by the public’s tax-paying staff.
In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan’s spokeswoman Amelia Shas defended the governor’s actions and said that she thought that the comments to block them were simply trying to restrain them.
But they described it too rashly as the scourge or cynic who swept the network.
The Washington Post talked face-to-face with people who were blocked by Hogan.
They are just ordinary people talking to their elected leaders: Their status is teachers, small business owners, and pastors. It is not a flood.
They all expressed that their comments are deep, respectful, and not obscene.
The priest quoted the Bible in his post and called for Hogan to remember his Catholic faith.
The barrister Lakshmi Salma Ramani of Bowie, Maryland, was not cynical, but she asked questions about hate crimes.
She wrote in the "Washington Post" news story commentary, "I politely commented that I was disappointed that he did not respond to hate crimes and other recent news events.
I also don't like a bunch of people commenting on the same topic, because these people will be directly ignored by some people, thinking that they are so-called herd mentality, rather than treating them as a group of citizens worried about the country and the people."
What the governor’s staff called “intensified spam bombardment” may appear to others to be “advocacy”.
The FaceBook era made it easy to modify a message by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment.
It is also much clearer than it used to be, and in the past it was necessary to send staff to collect and burn newspapers with criticism or to arrest or boo the protesters.
But that is really what is happening now, but it is on the digital level.
Hogan was not the first public official to be blamed for booing others on Facebook and other social media.
President Trump is being sued by Twitter users because he blocked them on Twitter.
A landmark ruling in Virginia last week was about such issues.
According to James C. Katharis, a District Judge in the United States of Alexandria, the chairman of the Loudoun County Oversight Board has shielded voters from the Facebook page by violating the First Amendment.
The Governor of Kentucky, Matt Bevan (R), was also patronized by the American Civil Liberties Union for his use of Facebook and Twitter.
This should not be so difficult.
In the era of Washington, affordable postage and the Internet had similar influence.
The number of news newspapers quadrupled between 1776 and 1800. There were also people who wrote anonymous letters and fiercely criticized his leadership.
And even at that time, Washington had an anonymous flood of beasts against him.
People use euphemisms such as Yuriqra, Valerius, Pelelius, and Bojuss to write a letter to the newspaper to severely criticize Washington’s decision.
According to historical documents collected by the George Washington newspaper online project, his office was overwhelmed by petitions and he was criticized for his attitude towards the Treaty of Friendship, Trade and Navigation between the United Kingdom and His Majesty the United Kingdom.
But he did not say anything to them.
Freedom of speech, freedom of political dissident and freedom of speech are the foundations of this country.
The true leader needs to accept this.
The slightest turmoil in the property market has touched people's sensitive nerves.
Restrictions are a hard bar for many city real estate control policies.
In May 2017, Jinan promulgated the regulations that undergraduates will continue to pay social security for six months and enjoy the same home ownership policy as local residents.
In June, Wuhan introduced a policy that stipulates that graduates can settle in within three years of graduation with a diploma and an employment permit.
Then the policy was overweight, the official said, "college students can buy a house at a price lower than the market price of 20%";
In July, Chengdu introduced young talents with bachelor degree or above in foreign universities, who can apply to settle in Chengdu with a diploma.
In addition, cities and regions such as Kunshan and Lingang in Shanghai have also introduced the “Talent Introduced” policy to lower the threshold for talent purchase.
Zhang Hongwei believes that this is actually a competition for population, especially talents, in major cities. To retain the population, especially talents, the city is competitive. This is the most important significance of these real estate policies.
Some people even think that this means that the time has come for the cancellation of the “restricted purchase” of the property market.

Ronan Laforte looks forward to enjoying the feeling of returning home in the Renaissance club
The East Lothian Renaissance Club hosts the 25th Scottish Evergreen Open. Former European champion Ronan Lafferty will enjoy the feeling of returning home for the next three days.
The Northern Irishman led the next-door Archerfeld Links into the final last year but lost to Paul Illes, who now works for the new venue, representing the club’s founder and CEO Jerry Salvati as the tournament ambassador.
Lafferty said: "I have witnessed the establishment of the Renaissance Club. We will also witness its glory through this competition.
The athletes will see the best appearance and best condition of the course.
Jerry created this place unparalleled.
He is a keen proponent of this competition and he is also very proud of his achievements here.
This is the best stage to show this course.”
Englishman Iles is looking forward to defending for the first time, although in a 32-year career he has also won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour.
The southport athlete said: "This is really special.
I did not defend the Extremadura Open because in the second year of my victory, the game was cancelled.
It's magical to come to this place.
It's wonderful to play golf here.
Last year's memories surfaced one after another. For me and my wife Sharon, the victory last year has special significance for us.
That is really a special memory. We will always remember it."
Returning to his hometown game was Gary Orr, who was just 50 years old earlier this year and then also participated in the European Evergreen Tour.
This is his first time in Scotland since the 2013 Scottish Open.
Helensburgh Orr said: "There will always be more meaning in returning home.
You want to do well; but you can feel the extra pressure.
I can really enjoy playing again. I have been playing golf.
I am very satisfied with the current situation."
Joining the trio is the former Masters winner Ian Woosnan and the Evergreen Grand Prix winners Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNaughty.
A total of six Scottish athletes on the court, Ols and the former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrens are two of them, and the other four are Andrew Odd Cohen, Stephen McAllister, Bill Lang and Rose Drummond.

Zou Shuangmin, director of the Environmental Supervision Department of the Ministry of Environmental Protection of the People's Republic of China, introduced the case in Beijing on the 22nd. In August, there were a total of 57 cases that were punished by the law on a daily basis. The newly revised Environmental Protection Law implemented at the beginning of this year significantly overstates China's environmental law enforcement.
At present, environmental protection agencies in various parts of China may use penalties such as continuous punishments, seizures and detentions, production cuts and production suspensions, and administrative detentions on a daily basis to investigate and deal with environmental violations, and cooperate with the judicial authorities to punish environmental crimes.
According to Zou Shoumin, in August, a total of 335 cases of seizure and seizure were implemented in all parts of China; a total of 177 cases of restricted production or production suspension were implemented; 189 cases were transferred to administrative detention, and a total of 166 suspected environmental pollution cases were transferred.
Among them, Henan has implemented seven consecutive penalties on a daily basis. At present, China is embedding from the end of the control to the entire process, comprehensively increasing environmental pollution control.
Although the downward pressure on the economy has emerged, the Chinese Ministry of Environmental Protection has previously made it clear that China should properly handle the positioning of environmental protection in economic development, and enhance "green strength," the more the economic growth down, the more it can not relax environmental protection, play a good role in environmental protection for the economy.

On December 28, 2017, Kweichow Moutai issued an announcement stating that the research decided that the price of Moutai should be raised appropriately since 2018, with an average increase of about 18%.
This price increase stimulated the stock price of Guizhou Moutai to soar. The Beijing Morning Post reporter found that Kweichow Moutai rose 95 yuan, or more than 14%, since the 8 trading days of Kweichow Moutai price increase.

The spirit of the Red Boat is a force that we must follow and understand. Innovation is actually very difficult.
Every innovation here
I feel that I can't solve it. At this stage you have to hold on, and you are constantly on the move.
It was the people who came to the door and it is now up and down. That means
Do practical things for the people
Up to now, in this way, Xiaoshan District has collected a total of 5,958 problems, of which 3,868 are solved problems and 1,496 problems are being solved.
One of our cadres in Zhejiang is
Regional advantages are not as good as those of cadres. Policy preferences are not as good as service quality. The spirit of dedication in the spirit of the Red Boat Spirit allows us to work harder and further, and we have to be at the forefront of doing this.
Courage to struggle
Recently, the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles organized a group of representatives of some of the nineteen major arts and literary circles and well-known artists to travel to Inner Mongolia, Heilongjiang, Gansu, Shanghai, Guangdong, Guizhou and other places to tour the Nineteenth Congress.
They went deep into the grassroots mass art galleries, local academies, and some colleges and universities in Inner Mongolia, Heilongjiang, Gansu and other places, and shouldered a new cultural mission to the literary and art workers in the spirit of the 19th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party.
I am deeply proud and happy. I'm willing to sink and sink, and write down the fate of the big people
What are some good suggestions for this grassroots art development?
The people’s literature and art are now very lively and there is a little bit of popularity.
Constantly introduce quality masterpieces worthy of the times.
Should be rooted in the grassroots, deep in life, and then make a work with a certain thickness of culture, positive, and long-lasting artistic charm.
It has reached 28, and the measured contracted area is 152 million mu, of which 1.110 million mu have been confirmed.

The ability to manufacture scientific research instruments to detect a very difficult scientific problem.
Find the toilet by the nose, this is the last century, many people remember about the Chinese toilet.
It also incorporates more and more humanized designs
Many tourists are impressed with the year-round ventilation and no smell in the toilet.
Now don't rely on your nose to find a toilet
Not only change the hardware, the software must keep up
The tourism department requires that toilets in the scenic area should be equipped with toilet paper and liquid soap
But in some areas
Is it because of the uncivilized behavior of individual people that this convenient service is stopped?
Managers around the world made choices
On the one hand, civilization has prompted the promotion of conservation, and on the other hand, technological innovation has also been carried out.
Public toilets in Nanjing, Jiangsu, and other places
You can get a free toilet paper for 3 seconds when you brush your face, but you need to wait for 10 minutes to get double.
Avoid misuse of public resources
Habits may be that some tourists really think about paper to go back, but on the other hand we have to reflect on
Isn’t there a piece of paper in the next toilet that our tourists want to enter? This is why we’ve placed special emphasis on the new three-year plan.
To solve this imbalance is not enough
To deepen the toilet revolution is to think more about what the people think.
Must have a third bathroom to facilitate the family to accompany the elderly and children to the toilet.
We have a baby, we're sorry to accompany the men's toilet.
The female toilet child is so small that it is like knowing a bit of embarrassment. The board is very comfortable and it is very convenient for us to bring children.
At the same time as people feel civilization, they have also become civilized builders. In the countryside, villagers in Guangxi Hechi are building new flush toilets in their homes.
Already, great results have been achieved. Actively promoting the toilet revolution will not only help people stay away from disease, but also drive economic development to narrow the regional development gap.
This lavatory problem is an issue that is a guideline and a node for the development of social issues.
It is a national civilization project that guides the layout from the perspective of the state and then solves small social problems from various aspects.
This will put all our short fill.

Poverty and Death in Golden State, Indonesia
Badentina Daye does not need a stove to cook.
She rarely even uses a pan.
Her house is located in Enarotali, the capital of Panija County, Papua Province, Indonesia. The housewife usually puts a sweet potato - the locals call it "nota" - directly into the fire.
Half an hour later, this scorched sweet potato could not wait to be taken out by a pair of unwashed hands and devoured it.
Dai Jie sat on the mud – she had no furniture, and it was also where she used to do everyday household chores, such as washing clothes, and the water for washing clothes was very muddy. They were all taken from the nearby marshland.
There is a bucket in a room without a roof. This is an outdoor toilet.
She is the youngest of her husband’s four wives, so she has not been assigned to the fields for care.
Polygamy is common here.
Of course it is dangerous to work late at night: Most men in the village are not working, and many are drunk, plus there are many soldiers here.
She said: "No one dares to walk in the village after 5pm."
This is a rare sight in the daily life of the Papua highlands, once a Dutch colony that was incorporated into Indonesia after the referendum in 1969, but the referendum was also controversial, when only 1,026 elders were forced to vote by show of hands before the troops occupying the area.
The current strong demand for independence and opposition to the Dutch rule soon turned its finger on the Jakarta government because the government imposed high-handed rule on the region and cut off foreign journalists and human rights activists.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua, while Papua New Guinea independently controlled the eastern part of the island.
The location of Ennarotari is remote and uninhabited; to come here, you need to take a 90-minute flight from the provincial capital, Jayapura, to Nabiray, then rent a car for 5 hours, and you're all over the sea.
There is no public transport here.
In this town of about 19,000 people, the log house is surrounded by bamboo fences. The wrinkled iron roof is a variety of yellow-brown coverings made of rust.
Few Indonesians come in, let alone journalists, and few foreigners.
Before the arrival of Christian missionaries, Mee Pago Papuans believed in a god called Uga Tamee.
There are other changes here as well.
Dai Jie said, "We don't wear these clothes." She refers to her colorful hand-woven turbans, dark shirts and bright skirts.
"We used to cover only the body with leaves."
Papua is the poorest province in Indonesia, where 28% of the population lives below the poverty line and is the region with the highest infant mortality rate in Asia and the lowest literacy rates.
But here is also Jinzhou, Indonesia.
Panay County is located in the highlands, about the same size as New Jersey, and has 153,000 people.Glassberg, the world's largest and most profitable gold mine, is only 60 miles away. It is owned by the Phoenix-based Philip McMullan Copper Corporation.
In 2015 alone, Phillips produced about $3.1 billion worth of gold and copper mines.
In addition, Papua’s timber resources are very rich, with an estimated value of US$78 billion.
However, these rich resources are also the source of the tragedy of the Papuans. For this reason, Indonesia’s powerful military forces have been able to suppress them.
According to a 2005 investigation report in the New York Times, during the period from 1998 to 2004, Phillips paid nearly 20 million U.S. dollars to local military personnel and troops. The number of single-person officials was as high as 150,000 U.S. dollars.
The Papuans’ growing appeal for independence has threatened the gold owner, who has thus suffered cruel treatment.
According to rights activists, more than 500,000 Papuans have been killed since 1969, and thousands have been raped, tortured and detained by the Indonesian army.
According to the Asian Human Rights Commission, mass killings in the highlands of the Papua tribe in the 1970s have escalated to genocide.
Last year alone, the Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peace protesters.
In 2016, a report of the Catholic Diocese of Brisbane, "We will lose everything," includes proof of the bad behavior of the previous year, such as extrajudicial executions and torture — another report that rape and electricity are particularly common — and brutal repression of demonstrations of peace.
Humanity Watch Indonesia researcher Andreas Halseno said that "violent incidents happen every day, so it is difficult to calculate the number of victims."
Papua’s resources attracted large numbers of immigrants from outside Indonesia, and oppression began.
Eighty-three percent of the 3.5 million people in the province are Christians, but the demographics of Muslim economic migrants have changed since they arrived on the densely populated islands of Java, Kalimantan, Sumatra, and Sulawesi.
Javanese food stalls sell fried chicken and vegetables mixed with cuddago and peanut butter.
Locals fight hard.
The 24-year-old native Paniai, Apothez, moved to the provincial capital Jayapura to find a job. He explained that “those immigrants started selling chicken and vegetables in traditional markets at a lower price than the local Papuans.
This caused the local Papuans, mama-mama, to lose their market."
Indonesian President Zoko Vidodo (often referred to as Zokevi) vowed in his election campaign in 2014 to resolve Papua’s inequality and abuse of power.
The road leading to Jakarta's presidential palace by the former carpenter was supported by 27 of the 29 regions - including Paniai.
But Papua has not changed anything. Today, the local people feel betrayed.
In particular, "We have already broken our heart. In 2014, we voted for Zokow, hoping that he will achieve our aspirations and restore fairness."
In fact, after Zokowi took office in October, just two months later, Panier suffered the most terrible nightmare.
On December 7, 2014, 11 children in El Natali sang Christmas carols outside the campfire. Two Indonesian soldiers suddenly rushed on motorcycles.
The frightened children told them that they should turn on the headlights.
According to local priest Yavit Tebai, one of the soldiers was dissatisfied with their tone and then returned with four soldiers.
Victims and eyewitnesses call these drunken soldiers chasing the children with their guns.
Then one of the soldiers opened fire on the children.
16-year-old Julianus Yemoyne was severely and unconsciously beaten.
A few hours later, the nearby government agency Election Committee building lit a blaze and the incident escalated the next day.
About 1,000 young Papuan men, women and children gathered at a football stadium in front of the local police station and military command center to demand justice.
They took a ritual bow and hopped the waita dance of the Mee Pago tribe of Papua—running around the circle and imitating the birdsong.
Some protesters began to throw stones at regular military sentry posts.
According to an official document recorded by Time magazine, when emotions continued to intensify, the soldiers received an order through the internal radio: "If the crowd resists more than three times, they immediately shoot." But this document was not released to the local media.
The 56-year-old Jeremias Kayamu, leader of the Kelogo Koto district of Enarotali, felt that he was about to be in danger. He called on the crowd to calm down and begged them to return home.
But no one has the mood to listen to him.
He stood on the porch of his brightly coloured wooden house and told Times that "When I came back, my left wrist suddenly shot."
Kayamu still does not know who opened the gun, but he said that the bullets came from among the gathered soldiers.
He added: "At the time, they were very crowded. They opened a lot of guns."
According to the cousin of Orpheus Yule, a local man, he witnessed the shooting and saw Orff Yusr shot three times.
Euhanes sadly told Time magazine, “I ran over and checked his body to see if he was.
I found him dead...I kissed him."
The Chief Inspector of Yugoslav Police of Papua News told the reporter that his subordinates were only “protecting” the police station because the police station was attacked.
In 2015, the police spokesman of Papuan and police chief Phuket O. Surisio stated that “When someone threatens to kill us, we must defend ourselves.
This is a matter of life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protestors were killed and more people were injured.
The news of the killing on the second day only spread slowly in Jakarta.
Three weeks later, Zokowi made a very emotional speech in Jayapura and expressed his deep sympathy to the victim’s family and vowed to resolve the abuse of authority left over from Papua’s history.
He said, "I hope this case can be solved as soon as possible so that such things will not happen again in the future."
In October 2016, the Minister of Security, Victor, said that he would establish a non-judicial mechanism to address the historical legacy of human rights violations.
But the excuse for escaping almost immediately sounded.
He said, "Most of the violations occurred long ago.
Some were in the 90s and early 2000s.
The point is that we are committed to resolving these violations, but this will require a process."
Then on June 5th in Jakarta, when he spoke to Time magazine, he said that he did not plan to establish a grievance mechanism in Papua.
Instead, he said, "Everything will be resolved according to law."
The United Nations has filed a complaint against Viral with “anti-human rights crimes” in relation to the death of more than 1,000 people in the 1999 bloody independent vote in East Timor. However, he said that 11 human rights violations in Papua have been resolved, including the Panayai incident.
The family members of the victims of the Paniai incident scolded these remarks.
Euhanes said that "in the past three years, I have accepted four interviews, but things have not progressed."
After many years he said "I'm tired."
He still lives in fear now.
He said "I'm scared.
I was afraid of being arrested by the army and afraid of being shot."
His brother Yucabus also believes that the people of Panaeai are afraid to talk about the incident.
He said he was beaten by the military after helping to bury four victims.
He said "after the corpse was buried, the military came to me."
The shooting did not stop.
On Tuesday, the Indonesian police shot the villagers in Djayi County, Panjaai County.
A construction company manager refused to help deliver a comatose man to the hospital. There was a clash between the two parties. One person died and the other 17 were injured, including children.
The 24-year-old man, Ravianus Dawau, drowned while fishing near the river and died on his way to the hospital.
Angry villagers protested in front of the company’s field office.
The police said the villagers threw stones at the police, so the police fired a warning.
However, the Riot Mobile Force (paramilitary police in Indonesia) began shooting at the crowd and one person was killed.
29-year-old Dominique Buddy told Time magazine that “we were panicked and we are afraid that they will retaliate.” He lived near the hospital and witnessed the wounded being rushed to the hospital.
"I stayed at home for two days."
The Djayi Parliament has called for bringing the police officers involved to justice and withdrawing riot police from the area.
Panayai has always been a place of non-compliance with the Indonesian government.
The lack of effective development breeds dissatisfaction among the people of the Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal tribes scattered throughout the lush central Highlands of Paniai.
Many joined the Free Papua Movement (OPM), a rebel army that claimed to protect the rights of Papuans by distributing attacks and raids on Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the top leaders of the Free Papua Movement were born in Panayai, including Tadius Yugi and Daniel Yudas Corgaia.
Therefore, in recent years, thousands of Paniai were arrested by the military under the guise of "protecting national sovereignty," and deliberately detained.
Some people never appeared again.
In the eyes of the Papuans, Panayai is a "forgotten tragedy."
Poverty grows dissatisfaction.
There was a small amount of rice sold by Ennarotari and the local people could not afford it.
Bread is simply out of reach.
People here plant everything they can eat: mainly sweet potatoes and some fruit and leaf vegetables.
Farming is a woman's job. Every woman can take care of four or five sweet potato fields.
They usually use most of the harvest writers, and the rest are sold in the local market.
Ten sweet potatoes are worth only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Over time, economic inequality has opened up among local Papuans and new immigrants, and the number of these immigrants has increased since the opening of the new route to Nabiray Airport.
The small amount of work that currently exists falls into the hands of better educated and wealthier immigrants.
Papuans rarely have the funds or necessary skills to run competitive companies.
John Gobeh, chairman of the Panyai tribal council, said that "young people do not want to stay in this village... because there is no work and no money here."
Papua isolated from the world.
In addition, the restrictions on international media coverage are still tight.
Earlier this year, the French journalists Frank Escudy and Basel Longchamp were expelled from Papua because they "do not cooperate with the relevant agencies" even though they have rarely obtained a shooting authorization.
According to Human Rights Watch’s Deputy Director of Asia, Felix Kane, Zokevi's revocation of the election vows that limit restrictions to promote transparency and development has not been achieved.
In a statement, he said, "If foreign reporters try to report on Papua and West Papua, the most discontented provinces in Indonesia, they have new risks: refusal of visas and blacklisting."
The lack of media supervision means that the international pressure on the Indonesian government is basically limited to Papua’s neighbors.
In March, six Pacific countries — Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands, and the Solomon Islands — asked the UN Human Rights Council to investigate “all types of widespread human rights violations” in Papua including the shootings of Panille.
These countries have also supported the Free Papua Movement.
Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesman Almanata Nasir disregards the accusations against the group. He told reporters in Jakarta that "Indonesia is still implementing a democratic system and the media is free. Therefore, evidence of human rights violations is difficult to cover up."
Locals want more attention from foreign governments.
According to a person familiar with the matter, on May 4, the Dutch Human Rights ambassador, Case Wan Barr, led a delegation of officials to visit Jayapura. The local people broke their silence and pleaded, "We want freedom." He also attended the meeting, but asked for anonymity.
Indonesia will hold the next presidential election in 2019, but the Papua people say that they are unlikely to vote for Zokavi.
The tribal council chairman Gobay stated that "Zokowi's intentions are good, but he is surrounded by people who participated in the shootings of Pani Ai."
He wanted Zokowi to know that the people of Panayai not only lived under the threat of greedy troops, but also had nothing. The education in this area was poor and there was a lack of public health care services.
Goba said that the people of Panayai think like other Papuans that their vote for Zokowi is the debt he must repay.
He said "They don't need money. They need justice."
Even under threats and intimidation, the families of the victims of the Pani’ai shootings still made their last symbolic resistance: burying the body of a victim at the opposite side of the military police post.
They know that justice may never come, but at least they will not let those culprits forget their crimes.
Yucabs lowered his head and said, "My family was killed.
What else can we do?"
Sophia, Hollywood, TopSolution and other brands are capitalizing on the customization of the home industry. On February 10, 2017, the China Securities Regulatory Commission approved the initial application of Guangdong Shangpin Delivery Home Co., Ltd., and issued the SME listing pass for the Shenzhen Stock Exchange. Prior to this, more than 20 days, the European School had just passed the initial IPO.
People in the industry believe that with the delivery of Shang Pinjiao and Oupai Home, the custom home area that was originally on the market will turn from product competition to capital competition.
At the beginning of the first year of the delivery of the new product, the news of a typical representative brand, Shang Pinjia, in the custom home area will attract the attention of the entire household industry.
Beijing Reuters stated on the 9th that Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. released the first self-driving vehicle components and information entertainment solutions jointly developed with Harman International on Tuesday, which is an important move for the company to enter the automotive electronics market.
Samsung Electronics acquired Harman International approximately one year ago.
At the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas this week, Samsung released vehicle cameras with collision warnings, lane deviation warnings, and cruise control features that were developed in cooperation with Harman.
Samsung plans to ship this camera system this year. The system is based on technologies such as machine learning and augmented reality.
Samsung also demonstrated the "digital cockpit", even if the driver is not the owner, can also make the vehicle more personalized features, because this system allows users to download driver information from mobile devices and the cloud.
Tonight, the 20th round of the CBA regular season game is about to begin, which also means that the 2016-2017 season of the CBA league begins in the second half.
The fire once again engulfed the Dubai "Torch" Skyscraper
On Friday, a fire broke out in one of the world’s tallest residential buildings in Dubai, forcing hundreds of residents to flee the tall, 337-meter, 79-story super high-rise building.
This is the second large-scale fire that swept through high-rise buildings in just two years. It happened to be a skyscraper called the "Torch."
The building has been evacuated and there are no reports of injuries. The cause of the fire has not yet been discovered.
“We are sleeping, and then we are awakened by the fire and people start screaming.
We ran down the stairs and it took about 10 minutes to run from the 50th floor. "A resident of George told Reuters.
Civil defense authorities in Dubai stated that the fire brigade extinguished the fire around 4 o'clock (GMT) local time and was cooling the building.
The government stated that it is working hard to provide evacuation sites for affected people.
This accident may again cause concern around the safety of exterior wall materials for high-rise buildings around the world.
A survey conducted by the management of the “Torch” skyscraper in the wake of its 2015 fires found that most of the objects damaged were cladding and insulation cladding cladding panels.
The British police have stated that they believe that the problem of the insulation and cladding system at the Glenfern Building in London may be the reason for the rapid spread of fire in June, which caused about 80 fatalities.
The Williams team also hinted that Massa might return, even though he has already announced his retirement.
January 9 is only a month away from the opening of the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics in South Korea. With the preheating of the Olympic flame from the south to the north and various preparatory work in full swing, the atmosphere of the Winter Olympics in South Korea has become increasingly strong.
The South Korean media hope that this long-standing Korean-to-Korea talks will bring an egg for the countdown to the Pingchang Winter Olympics for one month.
On November 1st last year, the torch of the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics arrived in Korea.
The upsurge of the sacred fire was directly reflected in the ticket sales of the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics.
Just over two months ago, the ticket sales rate for the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics was only 32%, and the ticket sales rate for the Winter Paralympic Games was only 4.3%. The sluggish ticket sales rate once caused the public to worry about the popularity of the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics.
However, just as Li Xifan, chairman of the Organizing Committee of the PyeongChang Winter Olympics, recently told reporters, “As the Winter Olympic Games torch relays across South Korea, the heat of the Winter Olympics is on the rise and I believe that ticket sales will soon improve.”
According to South Korean media reports, as of January 3rd, tickets for the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics have reached 64%, and the sales rate of tickets for the Winter Paralympic Games has also exceeded 50%.
In order to encourage foreigners to go to Korea to watch the game, the Korean Ministry of Justice also announced on the 8th that foreigners who will visit South Korea to watch the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics will extend their stay in South Korea for up to 120 days.
Survey found that more than one-fifth of American travelers carry boarding items
A survey of aircraft passengers found that more than 20% of passengers deliberately or unintentionally entrap illegal items through the US TSA checkpoint. Among them, at least 6% of passengers unintentionally carried illegal tools or other objects with boarding.
Less than 1% of passengers claimed that they later discovered that they had travelled with firearms, ammunition, or explosives.
The survey of more than 1,000 people was conducted by charter service company Stratos Jet Charters Inc. The survey also found that young travelers are more likely to be blatantly ignoring regulations.
Of the respondents who acknowledged that they had attempted to intentionally carry the TSA contraband on board, 19.7% were millennials compared to less than 15% of the X generation.
The most common deliberately slipping through TSA's security staff is food and drink.
More than 3% of people admitted that they had intentionally carried a security check with a blade, and 2.2% of female respondents and 3.7% of male respondents also stated that they intentionally carried illicit drugs on board.
The company said that the survey of the country’s travelers was to understand the number of people who accidentally carried and deliberately carried prohibited articles and boarded planes.
It is not surprising that those who are most likely to carry security articles with their forbidden goods - intentionally or unintentionally - are those who fly most frequently.
However, the company pointed out that the TSA guidelines are somewhat complicated and difficult to understand.
People are usually not sure what kind and how much liquid can be carried.
Therefore, it is not surprising that the TSA has captured the most liquids that are just prohibited liquids.
It was once thought that the TSA may have used the book as a prohibited article.
Domestic flights are allowed to carry liquids, but international flights are not allowed.
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Prut changes his mind about the Obama era emission reduction regulations
One day after being sued in 15 states, Secretary of the Environmental Protection Agency Scott Pruitt changed his decision to postpone the implementation of the Obama era to reduce smoke air pollutant emissions.
Pruitt proposed making this change because the EPA can respond more quickly to the needs of environmental regulatory state agencies than the previous government.
He did not mention the legal challenges faced by the Federal Court of Appeal in relation to his predecessor.
The focus of the controversy is to set October 1 as the deadline for states to begin implementing the 2015 ground-level ozone standards.
In June, Pruitt announced that he would delay performance for one year in order to allow the Environmental Protection Agency more time to study the plan and avoid "interfering with local decision-making or impeding economic growth."
Prior to being appointed by President Donald Trump, Prut was the Attorney General of Oklahoma State and has long opposed the rigor of environmental regulations.
Since arriving in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly turned to blocking or delaying the opposition of the chemical and fossil fuel industries.
The sudden reversal on Wednesday was the latest legal impediment on Pruitt's regulatory repatriation agenda.
Last month, the Federal Court of Appeals in Washington ruled that the Director of the Environmental Protection Agency had ultra vires, trying to postpone implementation of the Obama administration’s requirement that oil and gas companies monitor and reduce methane leakage.
In a statement released on Wednesday evening, Pruitt proposed that his attitude toward the ozone standard was a big turn, saying that he would strengthen the commitment of the Environmental Protection Agency, cooperate with the states, and adopt complex procedures to reach new standards.
Pruute said, “Under the previous government administration, the EPA usually did not reach the specified deadline, and then waited for militant groups and other individuals to sue, and then agreed to set a timetable for the agreement.” In his previous work, he initiated more than a dozen lawsuits against the EPA.
"We do not believe in the supervision through litigation. We take the deadline seriously.
We also take regulations and authorities seriously.”
Despite this, the EPA's statement stated that Pruitt may once again use his “delayed authorization and all other legally available authorizations” to ensure that the provisions are in line with “good policies and the best information available”.
Republicans in Congress are pushing for a large-scale rewrite of the ozone layer regulations.
The House of Representatives bill approved last month was designed to postpone the 2015 rule by at least eight years.
This measure has not been voted in the Senate.
New York State Attorney Eric Schneiderman led state coalitions to sue the US Environmental Protection Agency this week, saying it intends to maintain legal pressure.
Schneiderman said: "The US Environmental Protection Agency's reversal - after we filed a lawsuit - was a major victory for the health and safety of the 6.7 million New Yorkers, and communities with more than 115 million Americans were directly affected by smoke emissions."
California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington, and the District of Columbia all joined the New York State and participated in this case.
Ground-level ozone is a common pollutant emitted by automobiles, power plants, oil refineries, chemical plants, and other sources that react when exposed to sunlight in the atmosphere.
The resulting smoke can cause severe respiratory problems for sensitive people, causing thousands of premature deaths each year.
Of course, public health advocates and environmentalists cheered on Pruitt's surprising transformation.
Lori Ann Byrd of the Biodiversity Center stated: "It is disturbing that this common-sense measure is under tremendous pressure from the head of the department that protects the air we breathe."
"We must fight with the Trump administration to cater to the ideological movement of polluters and special interest groups."
In addition to the external factors that steel prices have picked up, companies are also struggling to reduce costs.

Yesterday, two lands in Fangshan and Daxing landed on site and two parcels totaled 1.8452 billion yuan.
Recently, the Japanese animated film "Your Name" became popular in Asia. In Japan, after becoming the film "Spirited Away" directed by Hayao Miyazaki, the film broke the 20 billion yen for the first time in 15 years, and jumped to the second place in the box office chart.
Since the second half of 2009, Xiaoshan's sales volume (amount) has been maintained at a relatively high level. Especially in the spring, Xiaoshan's nursery stock sales hit a record high, sales volume soared, and prices soared. According to statistics, Xiaoshan District achieved a 48% increase in sales of nursery stock from January to June this year, which is the largest increase in nearly 20 years.
Shi Haiyong, deputy director of Xiaoshan District Forestry Bureau, said that with the good sales situation, Xiaoshan flowers and trees have also achieved rapid development.
In the past two years, the planting area of Xiaoshan has been increased by 30,000 mu and the total area has reached 180,000 mu. At the same time, it has actively developed outside the region. The Xiaoshan Miao farmers have established 8 million mu of flower and wood bases throughout the country, an increase of 30,000 mu compared with 2008.
With the expansion of the planting area, the quality of nursery stocks has also been continuously improved, the value of nursery stocks has been continuously improved, and large-scale, high-quality nursery stocks have been retained, and some seedlings have appeared to be reluctant to sell.
Shi Haiyong also reminded that in the face of the current prosperous boom in production and sales, producers should calmly and objectively analyze, not only to see that the demand for flowers and trees in society will be long-term and increasing, but also to recognize that market competition will become more intense.
On the morning of July 13, Beijing time, the US company Somaltus submitted a lawsuit to the Eastern Texas District Court accusing Apple of infringing a patent on a battery technology filed in 2010.
The company had previously sued Asus, Lenovo, Samsung, Sony and Toshiba with the same patent.
The lawsuit alleges that the iPhone 6s and similar Apple devices infringe US Patent 7,657,386, which is entitled "Comprehensive Battery Service System."
The plaintiff hopes to obtain cash compensation or to collect royalties for the infringing equipment after the judgment is announced.
Judging from the indictment, the plaintiff seemed to think that the iPhone's fast charging function infringed the company’s patents.
iPhones with fast charging will quickly charge 80% of the battery charge and then trickle charge them.
Somaltus is actually a so-called "patent rogue" because the company does not provide obvious products and services, and it is difficult to find relevant information on the Internet.
However, they have succeeded in reaching an out-of-court settlement with the automakers such as Ford and Nissan.
The meeting believes that accelerating the development of information technology, promoting the integration and efficient use of resources, and improving the level of industry digitalization and intelligence are of great significance in promoting the “Made in China 2025” and popular entrepreneurship and innovation, cultivating new energy, and improving the quality of life of the people.

According to leaked telephone records, Trump has pressed Mexico to pay for the cost of building a wall
The "Washington Post" leaked records of calls between President Donald Trump and leaders of Mexico and Australia.
On January 27th, in a call to President Enrique Pena Nieto of Mexico, Trump urged him to stop publicly saying that he would not pay for the proposed boundary wall.
According to reports, the U.S. president expressed dissatisfaction with his public attack on the separation wall. According to reports, Putlong once said to him, "You should not tell the media."
In the presidential election campaign, Trump promised to build a separation wall on the southern border of the United States and solemnly announced that Mexico should pay for the project.
His telephone conversation with the Australian Prime Minister, Malcolm Turnbull, was also announced. The record shows a tense exchange between them.
Trump told Turnbull that the United States’ commitment to the repatriation of refugees to Australia was "ridiculous," "obnoxious," and "stupid". He had suggested that the United States prohibit the resettlement of refugees, and now insisting that the Obama administration mediate deals will make him look like a "fool."
Trump hangs up after telling Turnbull that this is the most unpleasant conversation today.

Xinhua News Agency, Seoul, January 9 (Reporter Lu Rui and Xuepeng Peng) South Korea and North Korea ended high-level talks in Panmunjom on the evening of the 9th. The two sides issued a joint statement and reached an agreement on the DPRK's participation in the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics and the holding of military department talks between the two parties.
According to a joint statement issued by both parties, the DPRK will send high-level delegations and National Olympic Committee delegations to participate in the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics.
In addition, the DPRK will also dispatch teams of athletes, cheerleaders, art troupes, and journalists to visit the ROK; the ROK will provide necessary facilities for this.
The South Korea and North Korea also reached an agreement on mitigating the current military tension and decided to hold talks between the military and the Korean military.
The report analyzed the results of a questionnaire survey of 1,045 foreign tourists who visited Seoul last December.
The report pointed out that the average amount of shopping per foreign tourist is 1.06 million won.
Among them, the average amount of shopping per capita for Chinese tourists was 2.13 million won, which was 6.5 times that of Japanese tourists and 3.2 times that of US and European tourists.
When asked about the purpose of tourism in Seoul, 62.2% of Chinese tourists answered “shopping” and 94.9% of Chinese tourists bought cosmetics.
96.3% of Chinese tourists shop in the city duty-free shops and spend 1.56 million won per capita.

Murtan Massacre: Activists Reappear Racial Punishment and Justice
A 1948 Ford Mercury car passes through a group of onlookers in the town of Monroe, Georgia, and sprints towards the tiny Moorish Bridge.
There were four black passengers and a white driver on the car. Before the car arrived at the bridge, a group of white people with guns went forward and blocked the way the car was moving.
The thug's head - a middle-aged man in a pinstripe suit - took a cigar and dipped his eyes into the windshield.
Passengers in the car are full of fear.
"We want - Roger!" The man shouted.
"Take him out of the car!"
A young black man was dragged down from the front passenger seat and screams broke into silence.
Fortunately, this terrible scene on July 22 is just a repeat.
However, when Roger was wearing a lasso on his neck, almost all onlookers gave a real gasp.
Since 2005, civil rights activists have returned to Moorishan Bridge to recreate the scene of the night of two pairs of black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcolm as well as George and Meley Dorsey - who were hanged by the KKK lynch in 1946.
No one has been accused of murder.
“While we know who they are, even though we have seen them in the community, it has been hard to believe that they have not been arrested in the past few years,” said Tyron Brooks, who helped organize this replay.
"This is the blemishes of history and the burden of our souls."
Brooks, 71, is a former Georgia congressman and lifelong rights activist.
For him, the reenactment is a compelling call for action that reminds the Monroe community every year that injustice has never been corrected.
"We want to sue. We want to close the case. We want to cure. We want to reconcile, but we must first get justice," he said.
"Unless we get justice, we will not be cured or reconciled."
On July 27, 1946, the coroner laid a bed sheet on the body of a victim of a lynch of Molton Beach.
According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation files obtained by NBC News, more than 50 men from Monroe and neighboring counties were suspected of engaging in lynching.
However, none of them have been sued.
Although the number of suspects has been in a state of impunity for a decade, civil rights activists say that the dual motives for the implementation of lynching are well known throughout the town: politics and sex.
In April 1946, a ruling of the Supreme Court made it possible for black citizens in Georgia to vote for the first time in the primaries later that summer.
According to the FBI statistics, at about the same time, the black peasant Roger Malcolm assassinated the white landlord Barnet Hearst in a fight-looking like a woman.
Brooks said the rumor in the town was that Horst had slept Malcolm’s wife Dorothy and her baby was not her husband’s.
The FBI stated that on July 25, 1946, the prominent white landlord Loy Harrison spent $600 to release Malcolm from prison.
Dorothy and his cousins Mai Murray and George Dorsey accompany him to prison.
However, when they came back from prison and approached Moortan Bridge, a group of lynch mobs surrounded the car.
"It turns out that Harrison organized and ordered the murder," an FBI report concluded.
"Obviously, there is a conspiracy between state and local law enforcement agencies. They not only participated in the murder, destroyed the evidence, but also concealed the identity of the witness."
Brooks is very concise.
He said, "This is a trumped vote."
"They were killed. The murderer sent a message to the black people in the community: 'If you register and vote, you will also encounter the same outcome.'"
In the past ten years, Cassandra Green has been responsible for leading the annual reenactment of the Murder Bridge illicit criminal tragedy.
Her performance is vivid and exciting, with a deep racist background, and many people hope that this racism will no longer exist in the United States.
It's hard to see. It's harder to watch, but Green says that's the key.
"We don't want to talk about lynching, because lynching makes us face the ugly face of everyone," she said.
"But if you don't listen to me or you don't hear me tell your own experiences, I can't build relationships with you."
This year's show began in June. On the first day, there were nearly 30 actors - a dozen whites and the rest black - crowded in a room and listened to Greene's rehearsal shows.
Wade Malbow served as co-director of Green.
Over the years, he has been playing the role of the KKK, but he said that this role is never easy.
"I feel dirty because I'm not such a person," Malba said.
"But I think it's very important to maintain the freshness of this history because we don't want to go back to that era."
In the room, actor Darios Bradshaw and Nick Lascona, who played Roger Malcolm and Barnet Hirst, rehearsed their lines.
At the beginning of the play, Malcolm shouted and pushed Hurst, feeling angry at his sleeping wife, Dorothy.
"I said, get out of my site!"
Lascana hit back.
Then they hit it.
Then everybody (at least all black actors) burst into laughter.
Green laughed the most.
"What's the matter?!" asked Lascona.
He was panicked and confused.
Did I perform too much?
"No," Green said with a smile.
"I just don't think whites will say ‘ah’ when they fight back.”
"Yes," another black artist quipped.
"Your tone must be strong."
In this way, the energy in the room has changed; the feeling of fraternity drives away discomfort.
Everyone strives to do this not only to perform the show but also to commemorate the four victims.
The scene begins again.
This time, La Scona said this word "ah," the tone was sharp and powerful.
No one laughs.
The reenactment ended powerfully and quickly.
Screams, gunshots, and then silence.
A woman wearing a black funeral dress stood by the actor's body and sang the mourning word "strange fruit" of Billy Harlequin.
Her voice overpowered other words.
A hundred yards away, about forty viewers kept sweating and tears.
Nearly half of the audience is black and white.
A couple made a special trip to see it from Ithaca, New York. Many people live near the road.
Brooks took them to the cemetery of Malcolm and Dorothy for nearly eight hours. Everyone was enduring the uncomfortable heat and humidity in Georgia.
Until now, the murderer was still a fan of it, but now, standing on the same land where lynching occurred, the air is filled with anxiety.
When the last note of the song disappears, Green asks people to go closer and check the corpse the actor plays.
The children leaned over and looked at the fake blood and bodies and whispered to each other.
"They are not really dead," a little boy mumbled to himself, as if to remind himself.
A few minutes later, Green thanked the crowd and then the show ended.
The actor throws off the lynching rope and wipes away tears.
Bradshaw embraced Mal Po in the suit of the man who played the three K's head.
Nick Lassner embraced his two colleagues and cried in their arms; the emotions in the performance eventually infected him.
"It doesn't matter," one of the women whispered.
"We know that your heart is not like this.
There is a reason you do this."
Afterwards, the audience sat down to dinner with the actor.
On the same table, a white couple from Atlanta chatted intimately with the black couple they had just met and talked about the replay.
Dennis Duplinski finds it difficult to find words to describe her feelings after watching.
"It's hard to imagine those horrible words and actions... It's actually something that people like you say and do because they look like you," she said.
"This meant to me that I really thought lynching was still going on," she added. "Now this kind of thing is only called police shooting."
In the room, Tyrone Brooks sat at the table to watch, savour and savor the rights of citizens.
He said he has begun planning for a performance next year.
"Replay is an inspiring way because it describes the horrors we have experienced, but it is also very educational," he said.
"If you don't learn from it, this kind of thing may happen again.
Those who do not study or understand their own history are doomed to repeat it."
For natural gas market reforms, the importance of reforms in the “pipe network independence” is self-evident, but resistance and controversy are also large.
The reporter learned from Hebei Kaiyuan Group on the 7th that at 11:25 am on the 7th, an explosion occurred in the emulsification workshop of Kailuan Group Chemical Co., Ltd. in Guye District, Tangshan City, Hebei Province, and 13 workers were trapped on the site.
As of now, among the trapped 13 people, one has been rescued and sent to the hospital urgently. The remaining 12 people are under intense search and rescue.
It is understood that the scene has been blocked, and local public security, fire protection, medical and other departments are on-site to rescue.
According to eyewitnesses, a loud noise occurred during the incident and instantaneously a mushroom cloud rose into the sky.
According to the Kailuan Group personnel who organized the search and rescue on the spot, Tangshan Kailuan (Group) Chemical Co., Ltd. is located in Zhaogezhuang North, Guye District, Tangshan City, Hebei Province. It is a state-approved civilian blasting equipment fixed-point production enterprise. It was founded in 1958 and was formerly known as the No. 620 Factory of the Kailuan Mining Bureau.
(Reporter Cui Wei) Since his debut 15 years ago, Jay Chou has had to produce a new album every year, but last year he rarely made a contract.
However, the fans did not express any dissatisfaction with this. Instead, they sent a blessing. Because the reason for the missed contract was that Jay was happily becoming a father.
After allowing everyone to wait a full year and a half, Jay finally came to Beijing yesterday to present this first work to the people after he had upgraded his father, and was also the 14th album of his music career, Jay Chow's Bedtime Story.
US Media: Scientists at the China Air Force Engineering University study laser satellites to clear space debris
Reference News Network reported on January 18. US media claimed that Chinese scientists proposed a bold and innovative proposal to use large lasers to clean up messy Earth orbits and destroy old satellites and their sky trash.
According to the “Newsweek” website reported on January 15th, researchers from the China Air Force Engineering University wrote a paper titled “Sky-based Laser Clearance of Small Scale Spatial Debris-Transition Models” that describes how space debris can be irradiated by lasers into smaller, less harmful fragments through the use of space-based platform lasers.
According to reports, over the years, space debris has always been an issue of concern to international space agencies. NASA has considered multiple options to track, detect and remove man-made debris.
Ways to clear large-scale space debris include giant nets used to sweep and collect waste, and magnets that can be used to suck them out of orbit.Chinese scientists conducted laser simulation studies and concluded that this would be an effective way to clean up the Earth's orbit.
The abstract of the paper stated: "(Simulation research) provides the necessary theoretical basis for the application of space-based laser clear space debris technology."
A 2014 study by US defense giant Lockheed Martin found that there are approximately 200 threats per day for orbiting satellites.
High-speed debris orbiting the Earth is seen as a serious threat to future space missions and is described by experts of the European Space Agency as “a deadly series of threats.” In the past year, high-speed debris has continued to increase.
According to the report of the "Popular Machinery" monthly website on January 17, the space is basically empty, but the space next to Earth is becoming more and more crowded.Every satellite we send into space will eventually become another piece of debris that runs around the earth, and these fragments will pile up over time.
The more fragmentation, the higher the chance that a still functioning satellite will be hit by debris, and then damage or destroy a multi-million dollar investment.
According to reports, all space agencies have plans to clear space debris in the future.
NASA is considering using jet gas to reduce the speed of debris and remove it from orbit. Europe is considering launching a satellite carrying a large net, capturing debris and bringing it back to Earth. Japan’s idea is to use an electric chain to capture debris.
Right now, China has also proposed a solution to space debris by using a large laser to blow floating space debris into less harmful small debris.
According to a paper published by the Chinese Academy of Air Force Engineering University in the German monthly magazine "Optics", the installation of such a laser on a satellite will be enough to clean up space effectively, at least according to simulation results.
According to reports, the only way to prove its effectiveness is to conduct tests. There are no such missions yet, but it is possible that sooner or later someone will install a laser on a satellite and send it to space.
Once this is done, we can finally start to eliminate the problem of space junk once and for all.

Pearson cuts another 3,000 jobs, drastically reducing dividends to rejuvenate business
British Education Group Pearson Group said on Friday that it will cut another 3,000 jobs and cut its interim dividend by 72%, as it has begun another restructuring project to deal with business pressure.
CEO John Fallon said that most of the job cuts will take place in the second half of 2018 and the first half of 2019. The previous restructuring has reduced 4,000 jobs.
Pearson Group announced in May that it plans to cut another £300 million ($394 million) in costs for the third cost-cutting project to rejuvenate the business that is suffering from the rapid development of digital learning.
Last month, the company agreed to sell its stake in Penguin Random House to its partner Bertelsmann, and issued a report stating that its basic sales rose by 1% in the first half of the year to 2.05 billion pounds, but said that this year's outlook is unchanged.
A few days ago, the China Field Association took a serious and serious notice, severely beat the phenomenon of running, and prepared to punish violators for a lifetime ban.
Suicide bombers in Kabul have killed NATO soldiers
According to official sources, a military convoy was attacked by a suicide bomber in the Afghan capital Kabul, killing a NATO soldier and injuring several others.
The NATO statement stated that five soldiers and one interpreter were injured.
According to unconfirmed local reports, three civilians also died in the incident in the Karabagh area of the city.
This is the latest violent attack in Afghanistan. The explosion of the Herat mosque on Tuesday caused more than 30 deaths.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
According to NATO’s statement, an explosion occurred late Thursday. Joint patrols of coalition forces from Afghanistan and NATO attacked “personally carried improvised explosive devices”.
The statement said that all the injured are currently in stable condition and are being treated at a US military hospital in Bagram Air Base.
According to reports, the growing Taliban and so-called Islamic State (IS) organizations in the Karabakh region have caused serious concern from NATO troops stationed near Bagram.
According to statistics of the United Nations, at least 1,662 civilians died in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, and the death toll in the capital accounted for about 20%.
A suicide car bomb attack in a Shi’ite-dominated area in Kabul at the end of July caused at least 30 deaths.
The Taliban claimed that they had launched the attack.
On May 31, a massive explosion in the center of Kabul killed more than 150 people. This was the most deadly militant attack in the country since the U.S.-led multinational force overthrew the Taliban.
The violence has highlighted the security situation in which the United States President Donald Trump weighed the increase in the number of troops in Afghanistan to support his troops and police.
According to reports, the suicide bombings in Kabul in recent weeks have also triggered public confidence in the government and its policies, especially the reputation of President Ashraf Ghani.
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Overturns Resolution After Litigation, Delays Smoke Regulations
When Obama took office, he made regulations requiring states to curb all types of emissions that caused smoke, and 15 states sue the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency because of this rule. One day after the lawsuit, the EPA overturned the rule.
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency announced on Wednesday that it will continue to implement the so-called “2015 ozone standards area” and promised that the EPA will cooperate with the states.
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Secretary Scott Pruitt said in a statement, “We are confident in our dialogue with national partners and are committed to responding to them.”
Pruitt announced in June that the EPA plans to postpone the implementation of ozone-conformed area standards by October 2018 and postpone the time by one year - according to which the existing smoke pollution in some areas is measured to determine which areas should reduce the emissions resulting in smoke pollution in order to meet air quality standards.
The 15 major Democratic states and the District of Columbia filed suit on Tuesday, claiming that this was illegal.
As part of a broader agenda, President Donald Trump’s authorities have been working hard to restore the various environmental regulations that former President Barack Obama pursued to stimulate economic growth.
But these efforts have sparked opposition from Democrats and conservative groups who fear that more emissions will affect public health.
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency website stated that breathing air containing ozone "will reduce lung function and increase respiratory symptoms," such as asthma.

Mackie Garcia and Vasily Lomachenko meet for the first time to discuss the decisive battle that may take place in the future
The most eye-catching boxing match of under 147 pounds will soon be held. Vasily Lomachenko and McGee Garcia, currently in a state of possible conflict, met for the first time on Thursday.
In the separate room of the ESPN office in Los Angeles, the undefeated World Boxing Council Lightweight Champion Garcia took the lead and walked down the hall to pay tribute to the world boxing super featherweight champion Lomachenko.
In the Showtime boxing match held on Saturday, the referees unanimously decided that Garcia had defeated the four-zone world champion Adrien Brouna and that both boxers had become the top five players in the heavyweight category.
Garcia stretched out his right hand and said: "Champion, how are you?
Good luck."
In the ESPN game at 7 pm on Saturday night, Lomachenko defeated Miguel Mariaga and saved his position.
When the two of them took pictures, Lermanchenko's agent, Alice Klimmas, pointed out that the potential matchup between the two players depends on "perfect size."
"I used to be lightweight," said Garcia.
"I raised the level to play against Brana (140 pounds), but I didn't weigh that much.
Relative to 140 pounds, my weight is still worse.
I want to go back to lightweight.
And he must be lightweight (135 pounds) before we can play against it.
This is what fans want.
Then we will satisfy them."
Lomachenko agreed with this.
"The boxing community needs this match."
Klimas asked him if he should pay by the time, and part of his strategy was to have Lomchenko pass a debut match with a 135 pound player later this year, thinking that he would have a date with Garcia (37-0, 30 knockouts) next summer and Garcia is also interested in playing against the Jermain Linares-Luc Campbell victors after the September 23rd Forum Lightweight Fighting Championship.
"Because all the fans are asking this question, this match may be charged on a pay-per-view basis," said Garcia, who later expressed openness on the Internet in providing the best financial solutions.
"We are the main characters.
It is impossible for others to produce such great attention.
As long as they are ready..."
Garcia appreciates that Lomachenko is "an outstanding player" and may watch his Saturday's boxing match.
But Lomachenko has been hesitant about Garcia's praise, saying that he thinks this three-zone champion from Riverside looks "very slow. Sorry, McGee... You will be eliminated."
Garcia said that the key is to show the power of the fist and then boxing.
They all said that they can feel the momentum of their own boxing matches.
"This is a battle that must be conducted.
Concern and heat are beyond the reach of other boxing matches.
I am very happy to participate," Garcia said.
Lomachenko said: "I've been waiting for the top fighters. This time it's McGee.
This will be a great battle."
Publicizing environmental protection Yesterday, Xicheng District held a large-scale environmental volunteer activity theme theme of “Green Home, Benefits and Moving West City”.
Unlike the traditional way of collecting rubbish and propaganda materials, the organizers set up six game experience areas, including water-saving toilet display, enzyme production experience, and transportation dominoes.
At present, many children in China have given up professional golfers as their goals and have given up their studies, but they have been smooth on the career path and will not even consider universities.
Officials of the National Development and Reform Commission pointed out that the eleventh five-year emission reduction targets were completed ahead of schedule, so that the iron and steel industry that restricts restricted production has strong expectations for resumption of production.
Although the current steel mills have not received a clear notification from the local government that the energy conservation and emission reduction work has been completed, the industry estimates that around December 15, 2010, the original steel mills that had originally been restricted production will gradually resume production and steel prices may begin to be under pressure.
At present, there is no notice of the end of the restricted production limit, but in fact the pressure of various companies has been much less than September and October, a private steel company in Hebei Province, told reporters.
In some parts of Hebei, there have been repeated issuance of limited-production documents, and a mandatory pull-up was adopted to restrict production.
The reporter learned from local companies that the steel mills in most parts of Hebei have already resumed work and the pressure to restrict production has eased.
My steel network analyst Zhang Tieshan predicts that as the north has entered the winter, the end demand for construction steel will gradually turn from strong to weak.
Coupled with the gradual end of energy-saving emission reduction, by December 15th, most of the steel mills will basically resume production, products will arrive in the markets around the New Year's Day.
The increase in the supply of resources will put pressure on the steel prices that are currently rising.

The 68th Emmy Awards Ceremony was held in Los Angeles yesterday (local time on September 18th).
This year's drama category "Emperor" and "Post-View" competition is fierce. Two newcomers have defeated the old actors: The Best Actor Award was won by the first nominated "Hacker Corps" male lead, Rami Marek, and the Best Actress was won by Tatyana Masllani of The Black Orphan.
The big winners of this year's Emmy Awards are "Game of Thrones" and "American Crime Story."
"American Crime Story" took the important awards of mini-series/television films, and "Game of Thrones" won 12 awards (including technology), including three best awards, best director and best screenplay.
At this point, the "Game of Power" has already received 38 Emmy award trophies, making it the most epic TV series in history.
Regrettably, this year's "Game of Thrones" has been lost in the actor awards.

International Online News (Reporter Liu Xie): On the 18th, the Economic and Commercial Affairs Department of the Italian Embassy in China held a China-Italy Environmental Protection Conference. From both countries’ companies and research institutes, the two countries exchanged views on cooperation in the field of renewable resources under the new situation and reached consensus.
It is reported that the representatives of the Chinese participants mainly include China Renewable Resources Development Co., Ltd. and the China International Technology Transfer Cooperation Network. The Italian side is composed of the Global Energy Environmental Exchange Organization and the Italy Bologna Regional Confederation of Enterprises.
The Italian delegation stated that Italy has diversified environmental protection technologies and solutions in the field of renewable resources, and proposes to conduct pilot projects with China in three aspects: industrial waste treatment, waste oil treatment and waste incineration equipment. It also looks forward to extending its experience of environmental cooperation with China to other parts of the world.
Update on the results of the age assessment test for Swedish asylum seekers
The Swedish asylum testers used the latest method to medically assess their age. The latest results showed that more than 80% of subjects were judged to be over 18 years old, but not all believed it to be accurate.
The Swedish National Centre for Forensic Medicine (R?ttsmedicinalverket) started this test earlier this year.
After being accused of failing to accurately assess the ages of some refugees claiming to be minors, the Migration Board of Sweden designed these tests in order to conduct a more accurate age assessment during the asylum process.
So far, the Swedish Immigration Bureau has sent 6,880 testers, and the Forensic Medical Center has announced the results of a total of 2,481 testers between mid-March 2017 and July 31, 2017.
80% (2002 participants) were judged to be 18 years of age or older. However, in another 25 cases, the Swedish National Forensic Center determined that the subject was “may be 18 years of age or older”.
In 432 tests, the result was that the person "may be under 18 years old."
The test is only for people with age problems.
According to John Glenson of the Forensic Medicine Center, these results are consistent with the results of the previous months.
He told The Local: "These data are not much different from the data of the previous months, and the numbers are very consistent."
A higher percentage of cases judged to have reached the age of 18 does not necessarily mean that these asylum seekers have misrepresented their age.
In May, the Center published 581 test results and stated that 442 cases “indicate that this subject has reached 18 years of age or older”.
The news newspaper Svenska Dagbladet investigated the results of the 581 tests released and found that 243 of them had publicly stated that they will be 18 years old this year.
X-ray examination of wisdom teeth, MRI scanning of joints, and analysis of results by dentists and radiologists, this type of medical assessment is also questioned in some areas.
One of the skeptics was Carolyn Marcus, an endocrinologist at Carolyn College. His work included assessing people’s biological maturity to determine whether they were experiencing puberty earlier or later than normal.
He told the news paper Metro: "I have reason to think so, and I think the measurement method used should not be like this.
Judging the physiological age in this way is very inaccurate.
If we cannot guarantee accuracy, we should not pretend we can do it."
However, Glennson of the Forensic Medical Center defended the accuracy of these tests: “Generally speaking, it is safe to say that the risk of not determining a child as an adult is small.”
The biggest risk is that this person is just under 18 years old, which is about 10%.
West Virginia Governor announces party exchange
On Thursday night, West Virginia Democrat Governor Jim Justice announced at President Trump’s rally that he would change the party.
"If you like it or don't like it, the Democratic Party has left me," said the governor.
"Today, after I have conducted a lot of prayers and a lot of thinking, I want to tell you... Today I want to tell you as a West Virginian. I can no longer help you as the governor of the Democratic Party."
The rally burst into cheers.
"So, tomorrow, I will change the party membership into a Republican," adds Jaestis.
"As a coach, I have to tell when it is time to start another game."
Trump earlier promised to make a major announcement at a rally in West Virginia.
Mr. Trump won 42% of West Virginia's votes, and Jaestis did not support Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
According to Forbes, Jastis was named the only billionaire in the state in 2016.
Forbes pointed out that he inherited his father’s coal industry and owned coal mines in all five states.
Currently, he is worth about $159 million.
At the same time, the Republican National Committee issued a statement on Thursday evening: "The change of Governor Jastis's party is another blow to the Democratic Party. This will not hinder our country from becoming once again great. It will make our country once again great."
"The Democratic Party currently has only 15 governors and controls the number of state councils to record a record low. Governor Jastis's statement is the latest rejection of such a party that has lost leadership from top to bottom and cannot find a positive unified slogan," said RNA McDaniel, chairman of the Republican National Committee, in a statement to CBS News.
Fang Wenshan frankly stated that using music as a complete story is his own dream.

Sebastian Branch praises Russia's "frank" apologies for the doping scandal
On Thursday, Sebastian Branch, chairman of the International Athletic Association, expressed his appreciation for Russia’s apology for the doping scandal and stated that the apology was “candid”, but reiterated that it is not the moment for Russia to rejoin the sport.
The president of the Russian Federation of Athletics Federation, Mitri Chiractin, stated at the IAAF conference held on the eve of the World Athletics Championships that his country’s ban on participation in the sport was correct. He was determined to fight stimulants.
He said he was sorry "All the athletes who won the gold and silver medals in the game have been deprived of medals."
Despite his comments, the IAAF Congress still voted in favor of maintaining the ban, after the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) report referred to the discovery of evidence that the Russian State sponsored the use of stimulants and implemented the ban in November 2015.
"I think the response today is very candid and very candid," the IAAF chairman Ko told reporters.
“The entire Council and the IAAF Assembly are very happy... The Russian Federation admitted that it had experienced a very anguishing period and was doing everything possible to ensure that Russia could participate in the competition again.”
Ke said that he is also "happy" that Russia has accepted the criteria for re-entry.
"I think this is a very constructive day and I think we have made some progress, but the IAAF General Assembly supports the proposal of the ad hoc group and it is not yet the time to resume Russia's qualifications," said Ke.

RMB 6.4401 depreciated 66 basis points in the middle of the People’s Republic of China’s renminbi
Macroeconomics Tencent Finance 2018-01-18 09:50 Share
Tencent Financial News On January 18, the central parity of the renminbi against the US dollar was reported at 6.4401. The median price in the previous trading day depreciated by 66 basis points, ending the previous five-point rise.
In the overnight market, the US dollar rebounded and the US dollar index moved out of the V-shaped pattern, ending at 90.8900 at 07:30 Beijing time.
The Fed’s publication of the Beige Book of Economic Statistics shows that almost all 12 Fed regions reported modest to moderate growth in economic activity at the beginning of 2018 and remained optimistic about the prospects for this year.
At the same time, the unemployment rate in the United States remained at 4.1% in December, the lowest since 2000, and it is expected that companies will increase wages in the coming months.
Fed officials generally believe that tax reform is a factor supporting this modest strengthening of the economic outlook. The Fed predicts that the economy will grow by 2.5% in 2018 and raise interest rates three times.
Market participants pointed out that the recent tightening of the European Central Bank’s monetary policy is expected to push up the exchange rate of the Euro, the US dollar index has continued to decline, and the renminbi’s exchange rate against the US dollar has rapidly risen. However, at present, the European Central Bank is unlikely to adjust its policy stance soon. After the short-term volatility of the foreign exchange market, it will eventually return to the fundamentals. The continued smooth operation of the renminbi exchange rate is a high probability event.
It is worth noting that, as the market's expectations for the renminbi have become more stable, the attraction of renminbi assets to foreign investors has also become increasingly prominent.

How does football financial rules affect Neymar's transfer to Paris?
The rules aimed at preventing the unrestricted spending of European clubs will not hinder Neymar from transferring from Spain's Barcelona Club to the French Parisian PSG at record prices.
The consequence of this is the UEFA's further demotion of the Paris Saint-Germain Football Club, which is the European football game's managing body and has the right to prohibit teams from participating in the highly anticipated Champions League.
The UEFA's "Financial Fair Play Rules" (FFP) in 2011 means that the Paris St. Germain Football Club must ultimately prove that Neymar's transfer is funded without huge losses.
The Barcelona Club has paid 222 million euros ($262 million) just to pay for the Brazilian player's termination fee, while Neymar's salary will be as high as tens of millions of dollars per year.
The following are some of the financial implications of Neymar's transfer to France.
Considering that the team’s funds come from a wealthy Qatari ruling family, the Paris Saint-Germain Football Club can certainly sign Neymar with cash and bring him into the clan of other stars.
Clubs can spend huge sums to buy players, but they must use legitimate sources of income to make up for the huge sums spent, enabling them to break even in football-related businesses.
The "Financial Fair Play Rules" was proposed by Michel Platini after he was elected as the UEFA president in 2007.
The former French player believes that for those clubs that are highly indebted to pursue success, if the bank or owner withdraws support funds, they are actually deceiving and set the club at risk of destruction.
In 2011, the focus of the “Regulations” shifted from the club’s debt problem to the club’s loss status monitoring.
This change means that Roman Abramovich used the business model of acquiring the Chelsea club in 2003, buying a club with potential, and then spending heavily to improve the team and establish a global brand, which is now facing a more demanding situation.
During the three-year rule evaluation period up to 2018, the club may lose 30 million euros.
Although Abu was derogated from being chaired in 2015, UEFA’s successor Aleksander Ceferin is still committed to preventing excessive spending.
"Of course, the "Rules" have not yet expired, and we will certainly strengthen future regulations." Andrea Traverso, UEFA's responsible officer for the "Regulations", told the Associated Press last week.
Although the Paris Saint Germain Football Club will pay Neymar’s one-off buyout clause, it can also allocate the amount according to the purpose of accounting within the contract period.
Neymar has signed a five-year agreement, so the transfer fee may show up to 44.4 million euros in the annual accounts for the next five years.
The first wave of "Rules" sanctions imposed in 2014 led to the most stringent sanctions for the Paris St. Germain Football Club and the Abu Dhabi-owned Manchester City Club.
The Paris Saint-Germain football club was fined 60 million euros ($ 82 million at the exchange rate) and then reduced to 20 million euros, and demanded that the team reduce the number of players to 21 in the 2014-15 Champions League, instead of the normal 25 players.
UEFA is eyeing clubs that try to increase revenue by linking with club owners and fool financial regulators.
Although the Qatar company can sponsor the Paris Saint-Germain football club, if the sponsorship amount is considered to exceed the standard market price, then UEFA will not treat it as legitimate income.
This is what happened in 2014. UEFA ruled at the time that Qatar Tourism Authority sponsored the Paris St. Germain football club’s amount was overstated.
According to reports, Neymar's income from the Paris St. Germain Football Club may come from the payment of the Qatar World Cup Organizing Committee in 2022.
However, both the Paris Saint-Germain Football Club and the organizing committee denied that Neymar would serve as the ambassador for the World Cup, but it is easy for the UEFA regulators to make such a move.
The recent sanctions imposed on the Paris St. Germain Football Club means that UEFA will be more vigilant against any attempt to circumvent the rules.
Informed sources said on Thursday that UEFA did not make advance discussions with the Paris St. Germain Football Club about the transfer of Neymar.
The above individuals were only in contact with the Associated Press in an unnamed capacity because they were not authorized to discuss the situation of the Paris St. Germain Football Club.
The last published accounts show that the Paris Saint-Germain Football Club’s operating income in 2015-16 was 542.4 million euros and its profit exceeded 10 million euros.
The accounts for the previous fiscal year have not been announced.
The Paris Saint-Germain Football Club expects that Neymar's participation will bring evangelism to sponsorship activities, franchising and jersey sales.
The club expects that the amount of post-neighbor revenue will increase by at least 30%.
Obviously, seeing one of the most famous players left, the Spanish league felt deeply angry and tried to block Neymar's move and claimed that the Paris St. Germain football club violated the "Rules".
The Spanish league chief Javier Tebbas told the Spanish newspaper AS that "this is a clear example of a 'financial stimulant', both clubs and countries are the same," referring to Qatar which has the ultimate title to the Paris St. Germain football club.
Arsene Wenger, head coach of the Arsenal team (the club's owner is American sports tycoon), has reservations about the attitude of the state-funded club and La Liga.
“This is the consequence of ownership, and this completely changed the entire ecology of football over the past 15 years,” Wenger said on Thursday.
"Once the country has a club, anything will happen.
This will make it very difficult to comply with the Rules, because there are many different ways or interests for a country to require big players to represent a country."
Rokid, a developer of intelligent interactive robots, gains new investment. Temasek leads the game
In recent years, startups in the field of artificial intelligence have continued to be buoyed by capital.
Artificial intelligence Rokid has recently completed a new round of financing, led by Temasek, Credit Suisse, CDIB (investment agency of Taiwanese China Development Finance Holding Co.), and old shareholders IDG Capital and other institutions.
It is reported that the current round of financing is approximately US$100 million. Credit Suisse and CDIB appear for the first time in the financing of domestic artificial intelligence.
Rokid is a research and development company for intelligent interactive robots. He is dedicated to research in the field of robotics. The product can control smart devices in the home, has the ability to continuously learn and grow autonomously, and also has the functions of recognition, understanding and feedback.
This round of financing will be mainly used for research and development, talent introduction, strategic promotion and investment layout of the industrial chain.
Prior to this, Rokid received IDG, Linear Capital, Mfund, and Lantern Capital’s USD 8.3 million angel round investment in August 2014. In October 2015, the company received another round of USD 10 million in A round investment from Walden International Holdings and Angel Investors, and on November 1, 2016, Rokid completed the leading investment by Shang Hao Capital, followed by round B financing from IDG, Mfund, Lantern Capital, Walden International and other institutions.
At the time, Rokid stated that the valuation of the company after B-round financing had reached 450 million U.S. dollars.
In May 2017, Rokid released the consumer-grade intelligent speech robot “Rue Qi Yueshi”, which combines artificial intelligence with family scenes and sells for 1399 yuan.
The robot uses speech synthesis, natural language understanding, speech recognition technology and microphone array technology, with chat dialogue, music playback, and smart home functions.
He has won two awards at the International Consumer Electronics Show (CES), Tech For A Better World and Home Audio/Video Components And Accessories, as well as the German IF Design Award in the design industry.
At the just-closed 2018CES, Rokid released another new product: consumer-grade augmented reality AR glasses, RokidGlass.
The glasses will be used as a stand-alone headpiece, meaning that there is no need to connect a smartphone or an external computer and it is expected to be commercialized in 2018.
Previously, the company has released the first generation of home robot RokidAlien and the second generation of smart speaker Rokid Pebble.

Nostalgic Influx Winds the Market - Haha Summer Camp and Detective Heroes
This story is rehearsed to commemorate the 1980s era of the actors and the era of trash in the 90s (before and after David Wayne and Michael Revival produced the sketch comedy "Country" for MTV); it is also a nostalgia for the nostalgic itself, and a memory of 2001. Before this year, many stars such as Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler, and Paul Luther have not yet come of age.
As a cultural artwork, it is the imitation and embodiment of the permanent memories of our Facebook era.
But as a series, it feels like time is not enough.
After the first day of the camp, the response was strong, but not only because of its absurd humor (the story is about an original story of a talking canned vegetable, dubbed by H. Jon Benjamin).
In the story, the core laughter was used twice as much - the middle-aged actor played a child who was a quaint child - making it impossible to return to the past to become a funny part.
In "Ten Years Later", when adults actually played adults, their emotions were not too ingrained, and imitation was even more diffuse, including improvisations that tracked movies in the 1990s, such as "The Cradle Hand".
At some point, a character is trapped in an Apple notebook, some straight skates and "something else in 1991."
Many of the core stories are the same.
Mr. Sweetheart (Mr. Huwart) has now become a novelist, but he still hasn't forgotten Katie (Margaret Morrow).
Victor (Ken Marino) still maintains a virgin body.
There is another sinister conspiracy involving Ronald Reagan (also played by Mr. Hught), inspired by George HW Bush (Michael Ian Black, impressed).
As always, the best part of this series is interjection.
It is especially interesting to see this forever young Mr. Luther, who showed off the soul patch of Matt Dillon in the film "Single Aristocracy." Andy in the previous "Campus Giant" now feels like a giant.
This is a random moment of madness that may power the film like a recursive series of “Seven Years of Life” until I come to the conclusion that I think is logical: “Half Summer Camp: Twenty Years Later”, its final scene is to let the group of clubs see the movie premiere of Haha Summer Camp.
At the same time, Amazon’s “Detective Heroes” tells of different nostalgia: the Cold War revivalist American Spy Dream, the movie “Cold City”, and even the “GLOW: Gorgeous Women's Wrestling League”, an image of wrestling in the East and the West.
This comedy by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka was promoted to the TV screen by director Reese Thomas, a difficult-to-treat comics drama set in Romania in the 1980s and tells the story of two Bucharest officials fighting for truth, atheism, and Marxism-Leninist lines.
The main characters - hardcore Grigore and idealistic Esther - were played by Florin Pilszky and Cornelius Ulic, respectively. Their dialogue was voiced in English by Chanin Tatum (also executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
This is a brilliant idea.
But this is not just an idea.
There are some good visual gimmicks (the police watch time on the television because Americans like to play football).
And there are numerous celebrity voice actors - including Jenny Slater, Nick Overman, Maheshwar Hasz Ali and Colo Sevigny - who have created a wonderful sound event.
However, Detective Duo is so committed to creating a realistic propaganda comedy - there is a killer wearing a Reagan mask - and it usually plays such a role.
The six-episode TV was slightly prone and the comedy effect was not released fast enough or frequently.
The chief detective of Detective Heroes was more rigorous, and when Gregor and Isef repeatedly visited the U.S. Embassy, they displayed a better seditious effect because there were always two fat people in the embassy’s lobby devouring a bunch of burgers.
For imaginary communist audiences, this information means that Western culture can turn anything into material.

The reporter recently learned that the benefits of steel, rail transportation, shipbuilding, machinery manufacturing and other industries in the Northeast have generally declined, and even suffered losses.
Some experts believe that under the current situation, the new round of industrialization in Northeast China will not only affect the current national economic recovery, but will also affect the long-term development of China's manufacturing industry and its international competitiveness. Therefore, it is imperative to adjust and transform the industry.
The general decline in corporate profits in the traditional industry is now a loss of raw materials, industrial and heavy machinery and equipment manufacturing industry, a serious decline in profits or even a loss, is the economic downturn in the Northeast China's primary performance.
In the past, in the economic downturn, the low-end and primary products were mainly affected by the impact. However, in this economic fluctuation, the high-end and low-end industrial products of the traditional industries in northeast China were all affected.
Angang Group (Weibo) began to adjust its product structure in the previous years, focusing on the development of high-end panels such as container panels, rails, shipboards, and household appliances. However, sales of these varieties have fallen significantly this year, especially ship sales have fallen by 50% from the same period last year.
Anshan Iron & Steel Co., Ltd. (Heng Qingshun, Director of the Metallurgical Division of Liaoning's Industry and Information Technology Committee), said that metallurgy is Liaoning's third pillar industry, with an annual output of 60 million tons of steel production ranked third in the country.
From January to May this year, crude steel production in Liaoning Province was 21.54 million tons. The production and sales of the products required by the national policy encouragement and local government construction projects with good intensity were relatively good. The products with relatively fierce market competition experienced a greater decline. This is another characteristic of the Northeast manufacturing industry.

The upcoming movie “Sanshui III Shili Peach Blossom” which was released on August 4th was held in Beijing yesterday. The conference “The Eight Dead Seas Come for You” was held. The “White Night Couples” Yang Yang and Liu Yifei appeared on the same stage.
Yang Yang, who had just undergone a right ear surgery a few days ago, appeared for the first time after his recovery. He interpreted his role as “hello and irresponsibility,” and always paid silently to hide everything in his heart.
Yang Yang said that he needed to mobilize the emotions of the whole body to convey the grief of the character to the audience. “This is a new challenge to my performance. I really want to get into internal injuries during the drama.”
Liu Yifei revealed that when he was playing this movie, he simply “crumbled” and once he cried.
The Japanese Olympic Committee recently stated that the Japanese delegation’s gold medal goal for the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games is 30, and it is advancing to the top three in the gold medal standings.
In October last year, Yamashita Taiyu, chairman of the Japan Olympic Committee's sports committee, said that he expects the total number of gold medals for Japanese athletes at the Tokyo Olympic Games to be 2.5 times that of the Rio Olympic Games.
At the Rio Olympic Games in 2016, the Japanese delegation ranked sixth in the gold medal list with 12 gold medals.
Delegates teamed up and held umbrellas to enter the venue one after another.
The roads around the venue were normal, there were no balloon slogans outside the venue, there was no red carpet, and no plants or flowers were placed.
Yesterday, the second meeting of the Fourth Session of the Guangan City was held briefly.
When entering the Guang'an Convention and Exhibition Center, there was no slogan, no teacups, and even a bottle of ordinary mineral water.
Instead, there is a simple banner, a meeting place, an easy-to-use paper bag containing meeting materials, and an eco-friendly paper cup filled with tea.
The meeting materials were thinner than before. A few sheets of paper summarized the theme and agenda of the meeting.
“To save the people, when it is frugal, we must save. To return to the simple and realistic meeting environment, we understand and welcome it.” Wang Cheng, deputy of the People’s Congress of Guang’an City, said that they are willing to see and participate in meetings that are efficient and pragmatic and do not use formalism.
Experts pointed out that current inflation and deflationary pressures have all slowed down, which is undoubtedly good news for the financial transition period.

Bank of England will maintain 0.25% interest rate
The Bank of England will announce at a later date that interest rates will remain unchanged after weak economic growth and loose inflation have lifted hopes of dismantling.
The Bank of England warned that as it controls interest rates while tightening family income, economic growth will continue to be "weak".
Decision makers of the Bank’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to maintain a 0.25% interest rate with a vote of 6-2. This month, a few members called for higher interest rates, even if the weak economic growth has weakened the upward adjustment.
In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank of England reduced its 2017 and 2018 growth forecasts to 1.7% and 1.6%, respectively, and issued a warning that the family income contraction will continue and that inflation will soar to nearly 3% in the fall.
However, it said that in the next few years, it will need to raise interest rates to curb inflation caused by Brexit, while borrowing costs may need to be adjusted upwards in the financial market.
A large-scale economic promotion policy was implemented a year ago under the influence of Brexit. Members also voted to withdraw it.
The Bank of England will announce that the term financing plan will come to an end and will provide banks with cheap funding starting in February next year, although the bank said that according to the plan, the bank currently needs to add another 15 billion pounds to the £115 billion.
In the records of the interest rate decision meeting, the Bank of England stated: “In the MPC’s core forecast, gross domestic product (GDP) is still weak in the near term, as the actual household income contraction will continue to suppress consumption.”
With regard to interest rates, the bank repeatedly reiterated that "a certain monetary policy tightening" is needed to suppress inflation, and it needs to be "bigger" than the market expects.
The current market is expected to achieve its first growth in the third quarter of next year and the second time in 2020.
However, the bank stressed that any upward adjustment would be "slow" and "restraint."
The bank's growth forecast for this year and next year shows a downward trend, while the forecast for May is 1.9% and 1.7%.
The bank maintains a forecast of 1.8% growth in 2018.
The pound fell against the U.S. dollar and the euro also followed.
The sterling exchange rate against the US dollar fell 0.5% to 1.31 and the euro fell 0.4% to 1.11.
Before this unchanging decision appeared, the increasing expectations of inflation were disappointing due to the recent disappointing growth figures, which increased to 0.3% in the second quarter, compared with 0.2% in the first three months.
The bank said growth in the third quarter may remain at 0.3%, although it will rise slightly by the end of the year.
The average family was hit by inflationary inflation, and wage growth was insignificant. The Bank of England’s latest inflation report did not bring good news to them, because the bank said that the contraction will become even worse before it becomes better.
It also said that monetary policy "cannot prevent" the impact of income in the next few years, but wages are expected to recover "mass" at the end of the three-year forecast.
At the same time, because of the depreciation of the British pound, the demand for British goods has grown substantially, and the economy will be stimulated to offset some of the effects of low consumption.
One year before the decision was made, the shocking EU referendum caused the pound to plunge, and the interest rate in August was reduced to 0.25%.
The Bank of England estimates that it may take four years to fully influence prices and the British economy.
Before the bank announced its latest interest rate ruling, the call for interest rate hikes continued to linger, as inflation worsened the pressure on ordinary households and the three policymakers called for an increase in interest rates to 0.5% in July.
Last month, inflation fell from 2.9% in June to 2.6%, although the Bank of England said that this was expected and will rise again in the coming months.
The bank said that compared to its target of 2%, the excess was already the final bottom line of the weak pound.
Andrew Monterick, director of Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: “Given the recent fall in swap interest rates, the mortgage market appears to be once again becoming more competitive because lenders are strongly calling for more business and look forward to marking this year with positive momentum.

NHS controversial HIV drug opens green light
After the high-level drug court funding for NHS has settled, patients will be able to receive “transformational” HIV prevention treatment starting in September.
NHS England announced that pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), a drug that can be taken prior to sexual activity, has been shown to reduce the risk of infection in high-risk populations by approximately 86%, and the health service will now offer the drug to an estimated 10,000 people through a three-year preliminary trial.
It agreed to fund the trial after the Court of Appeals upheld the High Court ruling last year, which stated that although the NHS claims that local authorities should provide funding for this drug, the NHS is entitled to pay PrEP fees.
The move announced on Thursday was called "a major new intervention" by British NHS chief Simon Stevens, and the National AIDS Trust (NAT) described it as a "critical moment."
Sex health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be the first registered sexual health clinics, with more clinics to join in October and full implementation in England in April 2018.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is an HIV drug that is taken before sexual activity to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
Experiments have shown that PrEP can significantly reduce HIV transmission in people at risk of infection.
Taking PrEP before sexual behavior means that there are enough specific drugs in the body to prevent HIV infection.
This medicine can be taken daily or two hours before sexual intercourse.
Those who are eligible for treatment include gay men, bisexual men, transgender people, and positive HIV carriers who have not been successfully treated.
The clinic will determine who is eligible and who agrees to experiment, including men, women, transgender people, and their sexual partners, whether HIV status is unknown to people with antiretroviral therapy.
People who live in England and register as general practitioners can also sign up at their local sexual health clinics.
The plan will cost 10 million pounds, and the NHS England branch has signed a contract to purchase these drugs this week after international competitive procurement.
The trial aims to assess the full potential of PrEP by collecting clinical evidence on how it is located, absorbed and implemented on a large sample basis.
Mr. Stevens said: "This major new intervention should play a broad and increasingly successful role in the prevention and reinforcement of HIV prevention.
This is another milestone in more than 30 years worth of progress in addressing major human health challenges."
Deborah King, the chief executive of the British AIDS Trust Fund (NAT), said: "This is a crucial moment in the fight against AIDS.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis offers the possibility to change the HIV epidemic in the UK if it does address people in need and at risk.
Beginning in September, the HIV-risk population will receive a new tool approved by the NHS-funded trial in England. This tool can be truly implemented alone without negotiating with sexual partners, which will improve the lives of many people.
We agree with this announcement."
According to Ian Green, chief executive officer of the Terence Higgins Trust, “The first priority now is to ensure that trials are quickly rolled out across the country and that none of the HIV-infected people can fall.
Now that we have purchased the PrEP trial drug, we are ready to protect more than 10,000 high-risk HIV patients."
Shaw Public Health Minister Sharon Hodgson claimed: "After several months of delays and delays by the government, the start of the PrEP trial was very popular and should have arrived earlier.
Evidence shows how this drug can bring about change as part of our approach to preventing HIV and preventing the spread of this deadly infectious disease.
This experiment will allow us to further understand and fully understand the advantages of PrEP.
Now it is very important to introduce this trial nationwide as soon as possible in order to protect those who are exposed to HIV and to help us to further stop the spread of HIV in society."
In 2015, Hou Weigui led a team to inspect many depots for technical cooperation or mergers and acquisitions.
High quality of life: Apply the loft and clever design to create a spacious home for the Earl’s Palace apartment.
Joanne Ray was once a banker and she was very enthusiastic about refurbishing the house. In 2014, she moved from the large house on Knightsbridge to the Earl’s Court apartment.
This apartment is located on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne-style terrace - Joanne did not pack her luggage for sale, which is a strong testament to the new design.
“Before this, my ex-boyfriend and I lived in a bigger house in Knightsbridge,” said Joanne.
"I was looking for a house with the right price.
I saw this apartment in the Earls Court and its ceiling was high.
I like it very much. I made an offer on that day."
The 1,000-square-foot apartment has now been completely overhauled since it was first seen.
The apartment was originally a single room with a complex layout -- need to go through the kitchen to get to the bedroom -- Joanne wanted to increase the storage space and loft at the time to take full advantage of the adequate ceiling height.
"I want high ceilings, big windows, plenty of light.
This is my request," she said.
To this end, she hired Elvan Azadi from the Duck&Shed Architecture and Design Studio (in Notting Hill) to use the 12.5-foot ceiling to create a home that was not only a development project, but also a place where Joanne lived.
The height of the ceiling is not enough to add two spaces up and down, so the challenge is to create a loft that is high enough to stand.
Elvan must play creative thinking in order to solve this problem.
"The steel structure is quite complicated," he explained.
"We must arrange space for display up and down, and do not need to shrug their shoulders.
Not only is it simple to build a simple platform, but it is also necessary to start the steel so that it is at the right height to achieve the desired function."
With this arrangement, Elvan can get two full-height rooms in the space - which can add many interesting elements.
The loft features Retrouvius-branded vintage copper windows overlooking the stunning living area.
Mirrored gold furniture, silver pieces of furniture and Serge Mouille retro lighting form the overall style.
The use of mirrors plays an important role in increasing the atmosphere, space and light.
Use mirrors on both ends of the short corridor to make it look longer.
In the kitchen, a mirrored splash guard is like a window to another room.
At the entrance, a small lattice with mirrors provided Joanne with storage space for tableware and glassware.
The beautiful living room has a fascinating sense of space and can be used to close the kitchen when the kitchen is not in use.
Folding kitchens are not new.
However, the unique feature of this folding kitchen is a garage-style lifting door.
“This involves knowledge in some engineering areas,” Elvan explained to the steel reinforcement overlay MDF door.
"This uses the principle of balance, so when you push the door, it is easy to slide."
Thanks to his clever use of space and deposits, Joanne gets an additional 16 square meters, one more bedroom and an improved layout.
"Ultimately, what you sell is the area of the house -- or your property valuation is based on the area of the house," Elvan said.
"Basically, real estate agents will walk into the room and calculate according to the size of the floor."
They will try to increase the space and use high-quality materials, which will bring luxury to this space.
Elvan said, "The materials are all personally selected and therefore help create emotional bonds in the home."
"You will not love the power supply on the wall.
These things are important, but they will not detain you."
Facts have proved that with a good design and adding extra space, the standard apartment can be transformed to make you marvel.
In fact, you may choose to stay with Joanne.

Two brothers stage $500 million real estate empire battle
Forty years after the Italian family founded the dynasty, the two brothers competed for one of Victoria's largest real estate empire worth more than $500 million.
Former Carlton Football Club director and developer Colin De Lutis lived in a mansion in the Tuquera district, and the three doors were at the location of his younger brother Paul, who challenged him to the Supreme Court regarding the division of their real estate and business assets.
Since 2014, Paul has been hoping to break away from the family business, but the two brothers have engaged in fierce debate on the division of assets in the Supreme Court.
The brothers and their mothers have a total of 38 real estates valued at more than US$500 million. These real estates have accumulated since the family bought Smith Street in the Collingwood District in 1973.
There, the family founded Westco Jeans and gradually expanded it to the scale of 160 retail chains.
In 1999, the company sold for US$85 million.
After that, the money was put into real estate, and currently, the assets of the Drutis family include the city office building, the development of Braunschweig and Sorrento, the Gold Coast and Mount Buller apartments, and the suburban shopping center.
According to an agreement with his late father, Colin, who is known by his younger brother Paul as the "primary promoter and dominant figure" of the Drutis family, owns about two-thirds of the company's assets, and Paul accounts for about one-third.
The documents submitted to the court stated that Colin owned assets worth US$316 million, and that Paul had property worth US$176 million.
Paul came to think that the division of real estate and cash proved to be the crux of the negotiations.
“Colin’s proposed property division proposal left him with what I consider the best property,” he wrote in a 2015 first court affidavit.
On Friday, after several failed mediations, the Supreme Court held its first hearing.
Now, the two brothers are still fighting for control of the existing company, Paul said Colin has knocked him out.
Colin denied this and accused Paul of weak management of certain real estate.
In an early affidavit filed by Colin, he expressed his desire to resolve the dispute.
“My Italian tradition has determined that the family is the most important option. My Italian heritage determines that the family is the most important,” he wrote.
The costs of the case are constantly rising, and there are hundreds of pages of affidavits, e-mails, and company reports submitted by Deloitte, Pitcher Partners, Charter Keck Cramer and other companies, top law firms such as Allan Myers, QC, and senior lawyers hired by both parties.
Ms. De Ruttis and her late husband, Luigi, are both Italian immigrants, who have operated popular restaurants and deli since the late 1950s and bought a store in Braunschweig in the early 1970s.
They used collateral to buy the Colinwood property, where Colin opened the family’s first jeans shop.
Colin said, "I read the third year," where he founded Westco. "At the time, Paul was still young (about 10 years old)."
Anna de Ruttis said that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hope to be able to transfer their property to their sons peacefully.
“Luigi often told me that he never hoped that the brothers would eventually go to court,” she wrote.
The other two brothers, Mark and Luke, were no longer members of the Drutis Group of Companies. Colin said that when Mark left the company, he paid him $10 million and paid Luke $26 million.
Paul said that Luke and Mark both "are dissatisfied with their property division clause."
According to the biography of television star Eddie McGuire published in 2015, Colin was a low-key player despite being a member of the board of the former AFL club.
“Fairfax Media” contacted Colin and Paul and their lawyers on Friday.
However, only Colin responded via SMS. He said that because the case has been submitted to the court "I really can't say too much."
"My brother Paul chose to sue me and bring our family affairs to court, which is very, very sad," he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote in a court document that he had tried to meet his brother's request.
He said: "Our father does not want to see Paul and I finally have such a dispute," and added that he "still holds hope for the resolution of the dispute."
On Friday, this hope seemed to be shattered.
"Our problems will be resolved through the court in the near future," Colin wrote.

Trump's new chief of staff plans to limit presidential media time
Others have tried, but all ended in failure.
John F. Kelly may really be able to do it.
If this is true, then he is the first person.
According to Politico, the US political news website, the new White House chief of staff plans to restrict the flow of information to President Trump -- including news media reports -- in an attempt to ensure that big bosses are more stable.
The following is a quote from journalist Josh Dodsi:
“When the new White House chief of staff, John F. Kelly, began his first day of work with senior officials, he pointed out that he wanted to resolve a major problem with President Trump’s entry into the White House: bad information flowing into the hands of the President.”
Kelly told these officials that receiving good information helps the president to make a better decision, so information needs to be in his hands—whether in writing or in brief.
Kelly’s diagnosis was similar, but others had tried to tame it by monitoring Trump’s media time, but they ended up failing.
President Trump’s television addiction has been around for a long time – now in the White House, his habit of watching TV is still deepening.
In February, ex-campaign advisor Sam Naiberg told Politico: “If candidate Trump is frustrated with unfair reporting, then let him know that he will also benefit from positive reports in credible channels.
Tala Palmieri of Politico wrote at the time, "According to the experience of the six former election officials, the key to controlling Trump's habit of issuing Twitter is to ensure that personal media information received by him always contains certain praise."
This is completely fine.
But Trump’s tweeting habit of being “controlled” is really ridiculous.
Probably these election officials know something that we don't know - that is, if it weren't for their intervention, Trump's Twitter would even be even more raging.
We may never know those tweets that Trump did not send.
If his staff can save him in the water, even if only a few times, their efforts are worth it.
But no one can always stop Trump from causing controversy.
Part of the problem lies in the fact that in a White House made up of competing groups, people promote their business by propagating their worldviews to Trump that may or may not be reliable.
Politico—all about this story—reported in May about the admiration of consultants for strategically providing suspicious information to the president.
This is an example described by journalist Shane Goodmancher:
“Current and former Trump officials said that Trump’s reaction to negative news segments such as volcanic eruptions, especially those with devastating information leaks, he would frantically want to find out its source.
At the end of February, someone maliciously copied an article on the online instigator Charles C. Johnson’s website, GotNews.com, to the President who accused the Deputy Chief of Staff Katie Walsh’s “a source of massive information disclosure” at the White House. Trump was such a performance.
Even if Johnson had been permanently blocked by Twitter because of harassment, he had not provided any specific evidence. He had also blown out a lot of erroneous quality control, and later he has denounced it.
Trump read the article and began to ask officials about Walsh's situation."
Goodmancher also said that the then chief of staff, Reins Pribabas and White House Secretary Robert Port, "had tried to establish a system to manage and record the documents received by Trump."
The result?
Kelly plans to do the same thing three months later.
Maybe he can prove himself to be a more efficient manager than Primo, but Trump is still the impulse of Trump, and his assistant is still competing with each other and competing for influence.
These eternal influences make Kelly’s task harder.
Tourism style town: How to drunk tourists
[Abstract] The potential of small towns in Zhejiang was gradually awakened.
Nowadays, these small towns have become important destinations for Zhejiang tourists to enjoy the Zhejiang landscape, taste Zhejiang culture, and feel the hometown of Zhejiang and Zhejiang. They will also provide important help for our province to create the most beautiful tourist destination in China for “Zhejiang, Zhejiang and Zhejiang”.
Winning in style
"Social dramas and drums are accompanied by a rise in the moon. Sausage smells with the wind.
Walking in the ancient town of Anchang, Shaoxing, you can see traditional handicrafts such as hoop buckets, bamboo weaving, blacksmithing, shoes, lace, and cotton spinning. This fully demonstrates the intangible cultural heritage of the ancient town of Anchang. Tourists indulge in the atmosphere of Shaoxing's folk customs and Shaoxing's history and culture.
It is reported that during the three-day holiday on New Year's Day this year, more than 65,000 tourists visited the ancient town of Anchang.
In Zhejiang, unique towns such as Anchang are dotted with sights: the waves of Jiaxing in Xitang flow with warmth and grace in Jiangnan Water Town; the white walls of Lugubadu in Luzhou tell the years of vicissitudes of the ancient town of 1000 years; the fishermen's paintings in Shitang, Taizhou, depict traditional and modern fishermen's life... These small towns are the "handheld treasures" of Zhejiang tourism and are also the "hearts of love" of all tourists.
In recent years, with the advancement of the province's global tourism construction, the potential of Zhejiang towns has gradually been awakened.
In 2016, the General Office of the Provincial Government issued the “Implementation Measures for the Establishment of Tourism Towns in Zhejiang Province”, proposing that after a period of about five years, the province will accept and name about 100 province-level tourism and customs towns with rich folk customs, beautiful ecological environment and rich tourism.
Nowadays, these small towns have become important destinations for Zhejiang tourists to enjoy the Zhejiang landscape, taste Zhejiang culture, and feel the hometown of Zhejiang and Zhejiang. They will also provide important help for our province to create the most beautiful tourist destination in China for “Zhejiang, Zhejiang and Zhejiang”.
According to the relevant person in charge of the Provincial Tourism Bureau, under the upsurge of creating tourism towns, towns and towns across the province now pay more attention to the creation of a personalized tourism industry. New tourism projects and formats emerge in an endless stream, bringing rich experiences to tourists and winning a good reputation.
Focus on promotion
Recently, Zhejiang Tourism Bureau and Zhejiang Daily Newspaper Group sponsored the Zhezhi Group Tourism Media Center's “Small Town × Future Artists” sharing meeting and “Poetry and Painting Zhejiang? Town with Style” 2017 Zhejiang Tourism Customs Town Closing Ceremony was held in Zhejiang Provincial Exhibition Hall.
“A style town has the beauty of art and a living temperature.
The style of the town lies in the original juice, the original flavor, the original hometown, a kind of original ecological purity.
“The film and television department teacher of the China Academy of Art Academy of Film and Animation Arts, the domestic film and television advertising director Nicholas Tse, and the dean of the School of Art and Communication at China Metric University, Professor Xu Xiangtong, talked about the town’s cross-border story, such as Town in the Lens and Small Village Reconstruction.
Zhejiang's many scenic tourist towns have deep cultural resources. Dong Xiaojian, a town from the southern town of Huzhou City, interprets the southern part of the Chinese painting for everyone.
Jiangnan Water Township has always been a favorite of painters and painters since ancient times. Nowadays, Nanxun Ancient Town engages in deep cooperation with art colleges such as the China Academy of Art.
Tourism style towns must have style elements, tourism elements, service elements and environmental elements.
Among these, tourism service facilities and environment are also very important contents.
If an umbrella is handed in on a rainy day, it will allow visitors to better experience the style of the town.
In this era of sharing, Zhezhi Group's Tourism Media Center teamed up with the most popular sharing umbrella company nowadays to customize a number of shared umbrellas in the “Zhejiang and Zhejiang” editions, hoping to promote the concept of “sharing and green” and enhance the civilized tourism awareness and public morality of tourists and town residents to create a shared and beautiful tourist environment.
This has become a bright spot in the “Zhejiang Province town style” 2017 promotion season in Zhejiang tourism style town.
Looking forward to wonderful
Up to now, Zhejiang Province has issued a list of the first 21 provincial tourism towns and 115 provincial tourism towns to create a list.
As a priority area for the development of rural tourism during the “Thirteenth Five-Year Plan” period, the customs town will eventually build a tourist attraction with a grade of 3A or higher, which will become a new model for tourism product diversity, tourism benefits, and industrial integration.
The attraction of a tourist-style town lies in its authenticity.
The beauty of the tourism style town not only stems from the misty and misty bridges, but also comes from a long cultural tradition; the revitalization of the country stems from cultural self-confidence.
Throughout the world, the town of Lisse in the Netherlands, the town of Hallstatt in Austria, and the pumpkin town in France, with tulip, “salt” and pumpkin as the core attractions, each year attracts a large number of tourists from all over the world and realizes tourism to promote the economic development of the town.
For the customs towns, the emphasis of “emphasis on characteristics and retention of homesickness” has given the town a distinct personality and soul, but also provides cultural infiltration, carrying local contexts, and highlighting local civilization.
Tourism style town, with culture and homesickness as the link, with humanities and scenery as the carrier, connecting the four tourists, let the traditional customs and culture inherit and innovate in the construction and sharing.
Essentially speaking, the tourism-style town is a complex open-style tourism area, and it should be a shared living space for local residents, tourists and even residents.
As the main battleground for the future growth of tourism, tourism and customs towns may not only change the rural ecological landscape, economic and social development patterns, and the flow of industrial factors, but also eliminate the urban-rural infrastructure gap and awaken the vital forces of rural cultural recovery.
In the tide of accelerating the revitalization of the countryside, Zhejiang tourism style towns will deduce richer stories.
According to statistics, 70% of China’s travel needs are concentrated within 3 kilometers. As such, the entire short-haul market will sooner or later share the world of bicycles.
"Financial News of Japan" reported that due to the fiscal expansion policy of the next regime of Trump, inflationary pressures will increase and the rate of interest rate increase in 2017 will also accelerate.
The annual International Consumer Electronics Show (CES) opened in Las Vegas, USA on January 9th (Beijing time January 10th) to the 12th.
According to the list of exhibitors announced on the CES official website on January 9th, the 5th CES has a total of 4577 exhibitors from various countries.
Compared to the huge production of 13,000 episodes of TV dramas broadcast each year on TV, these “slums and dramas” are just a drop in the ocean.
The RV customer negotiates the ditch and returns to “Regal Street”
Some of the wealthiest owners in the West Midlands region had a dispute with resolute RV drivers. The RVs negotiated a ditch that the government had been digging and demanded the return of land outside the luxury homes.
The RV drivers parked their 20 trailers on an open space outside the bustling Solihull Street. The street was named “Regal Street”.
The RV passengers were holding horses, carrying babies and leading the RV team. After being driven off in May, they returned again. The "moat" excavated by the municipal department did not prevent them from entering.
This sleek and experienced team found a gap in this line of defense. Although there was a road with no roadblocks to pass, their vehicles penetrated through this gap.
The angry residents made fierce criticism of the Solihull Council, saying that they “have performed very poorly when dealing with this issue”.
An inhabitant who declined to be named said: "They arrived there on Monday night. They came to Blix Heath Street and threw stones at passing pedestrians.
The committee should be ashamed of their actions because they are simply useless in dealing with problems.
The RVs arrived here in May and were then driven off. Now they are back.
A lot of it came last night and it may be more today."
She added: "Birmingham City Council knows how to deal with the way it protects its parks by implementing a long-term ban.
I live in Streetsbrook and if the council can't stop this, I don’t want to continue to pay municipal taxes.
A local resident who asked not to be named said: "This is ridiculous. We just saw that the last batch of RVs was gone. It was only for another group to destroy.
The number has increased again this time. Some people even saw horses grazing on the park lawn."
A spokeswoman for the Solihull Committee said: "We know that people have been carrying out unlicensed camping on an open space on Szczbruck Road. Now we work with the Solihull police and take the necessary legal actions to get them to leave as soon as possible.
In order to support our collection of evidence, it is very important that as many local residents report any anti-social or criminal behavior to the police by calling 101.
This helps us to outline the situation when we submit the case to the court for the court to examine.”

It will also create new cross-border integration new growth points in the wider area, which will drive an average of 1 million new jobs each year.
Stanford University launched the "One Hundred Year Study on Artificial Intelligence" (AI100) to provide a long-term assessment of the future of AI.
Researchers believe that AI will be ubiquitous in the future and will play an important role.
When it comes to employment and the workplace, research suggests that AI can replace tasks rather than jobs while helping create new jobs.
According to a crew member of the crew, Zhang Mo was a delicate person at the scene. From the extras to the service, all aspects must be personally observed.
Italy Takes a Firm Opinion on NGO Rescue Ships
Italy’s non-governmental organizations that operate immigration rescue ships to the Mediterranean have warned that if they do not sign new operational management regulations, they will not be able to continue with the rescue.
Interior Minister Marco Minuti said in an interview with the Turin daily “News”: “If non-governmental organizations do not sign a new code of conduct, it is difficult to see how they will continue.”
The day before Minniti issued a warning, Italian officials suspected that the German aid organization “youth rescue” a crew member of a ship actually colluded with a trafficker to assist illegal immigrants and detain him.
The aid organization only operates for one year and refuses to comment on the specific allegations of Italian prosecutor Ambro Cartocio.
The organization said in a social media statement, “For us, saving lives is now and will be the most important thing afterwards, so we regret that we cannot operate in search and rescue areas at this time.”
"After collecting all the information, we can currently only assess all the allegations and situations."
Italian officials have been monitoring Iuventa, the ship of the Youth Relief Group since October.
Its crew members were suspected of carrying immigration from traffickers directly from the boat and allowed the smugglers to rush to flee and re-use the ship.
According to the prosecutor’s documentation, at least one such meeting was allegedly taking place at a distance of 1.3 miles off the coast of Libya, which was published by the Italian media.
Its crew allegedly flagrantly disregarded the authority of the Italian Coast Guard, who oversaw the region’s rescue operations out of humanitarian enthusiasm rather than any other motive.
According to the Code of Conduct, ships such as Iuventa obviously need an Italian police officer to supervise their activities on board.
Currently, only three of the nine non-governmental organizations involved in search and rescue operations have agreed to abide by the Code of Conduct. They are: Save the Children, the Malta-based Immigration Station and the Pro-Activa Open Arms in Spain.
The latter said on Thursday that it believes the new regulations are not necessary, but it is acceptable, because these provisions will not bring any "significant changes and obstacles" to their rescue operations.
Among the organizations that refused to sign were the Nobel Prize winning organization MSF.
At the same time, Minneti said that the number of immigrants who arrived in Italy in recent weeks has plummeted, indicating that the efforts to strengthen Libya’s coastal guards and join local mayors have begun to bear fruit.
The minister said: "In recent days, we have begun to see the dawn at the end of the tunnel."
He announced plans for in-depth talks this month: discuss economic development activities with Libyan mayors and discuss with Chad, Niger and Mali how to reduce the number of immigrants wishing to leave these countries for Europe.
Lian Ping, chief financial strategist at the Bank of Communications, said that since the industrial added value in the first three quarters of 2017 had the characteristics of the end of the quarter upturn, it is expected that the increase in industrial value added in December may be accelerated to 6.6%.
It is expected that the cumulative growth rate of fixed asset investment in December will be 7.2%, which is the same as last month and lower than last year.
Although industrial production will be weaker than in October, it is basically the same as in November.
In December, China’s manufacturing investment was operating at a low level, but there was a slight improvement in infrastructure investment. Therefore, it is expected that the investment in fixed assets will remain flat in November.
More than 200,000 people in Fujian Changle entered the United States, mostly smuggling customers; in a foreign country, homeless, separated family, similar scenes continue to stage.
Beijing's "Mechanism Relief" New Measures: More than 10,000 teachers and students from Beibei Chemical will enter Changping New Campus
The opening ceremony of the new campus of Beijing University of Chemical Technology was held on the 2nd in Changping District, Beijing. The green campus of 1800 mu was officially put into use.
The reporter learned from the ceremony that in order to strengthen the core functions of the capital and govern the “big city disease”, in recent years, in the context of Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei co-development and dissolving non-capital functions, Beijing has accelerated the dispersal of colleges and universities in the central city to the suburbs. Teachers and students of some universities are gradually moving to the new campuses of Shunyi, Daxing, and Fangshan in batches.
North Chemical New Campus is located in Nankou Town, Changping. It covers an area of 1,800 acres and is 40 kilometers away from the urban area. It is one of the key projects in Beijing to relieve non-capital functions.
The new school is divided into three phases. The current phase one construction has been completed. The second phase construction is expected to start fully by the end of this year. After the completion of the new phase, it will meet the needs of nearly 20,000 undergraduates, graduate students and faculty members.
When we look back at this year's movie market, we find that the original text of the film and the two fans of the participating stars have become an important part of the audience of the movie.
At 17:10 today, the Shaoyang City 119 Command Center received an alarm and a fire broke out in Tetrahydrofuran, which was stored in the Hongzhi Chemical Plant in Longxutang, Shuangqing District, the city.
Shaoyang City Fire Fighting Brigade immediately dispatched 5 squadrons of 20 fire engines to carry heavy chemical protective clothing, anti-chemical cleaning vehicles and other equipment to the scene.
After preliminary investigation, it was a small storage tank that stored chemical substances such as tetrahydrofuran that caught fire, and smoke on the site was large.
As of the time of the press release, the fire brigades and soldiers were in serious relief. City health, safety supervision, environmental protection, law and order, and transportation departments had rushed to the scene and no casualties were found.
Michelle Carter Sentenced for Texting Suicide by Conrad Roy
A Massachusetts woman was sentenced to two and a half years for committing suicide by texting and calling her boyfriend.
Michael Carter, 20, will serve a 15-month sentence and will be suspended for probation after the expiration of the sentence, plus a suspended sentence of 5 years.
Carter was sentenced in June to Conrad Roy for wilful and unplanned murder, which committed suicide on July 13, 2014.
Roy's father said at a hearing on Thursday: "My family is in distress.
My son is my best friend."
While waiting for an appeal, Carter was allowed to remain personal.
She faces imprisonment of up to 20 years, but her lawyers believe that both she and Mr. Roy are mentally ill.
At the time of the verdict, Carter stood, wearing red trousers and a beige blouse, his hands clasped, his eyes tears in tears, and his eyes were pointing down.
"Her behavior killed Conrad Roy," the prosecutor told the court.
"She ended his life in order to live better.
She did not take responsibility," the prosecutor said.
"She does not have any regrets."
But Carter’s lawyer said it was “a terrible consequence and she regretted it very much.”
However, Judge Lawrence Moniz said that he did not find her “age or maturity, and even her mental illness had any major impact on her behavior.”
A prosecutor read a statement from Roy's mother, Lynn Roy. She said, "I didn't feel sorry for losing my beloved son one day.
I hope he is proud of everything I do and what I do. I am trying to stand with his sisters in all my pain. These pains will accompany us forever,” the statement said.
Mr. Roy’s sister, Camdyn Roy, testified that she was “spiritual” because she realized that she would never be able to attend her brother’s wedding or be his child’s aunt.
"Losing someone who has been with me since I was born is a pain, and my life will be tied to this pain," she said.
This case seems to have set a precedent for the law, because the Massachusetts law does not stipulate that other people commit suicide.
In 2014, Roy was found dead in the car with carbon monoxide poisoning; Carter was 17 years old this year.
After Carter’s message revealed that she had sued him for suicide, the case caused national concern.
"There are many ways to hang, jump, and stab yourself." She said in several texts sent two weeks before his death; he was spending vacations with his family.
At the time before he committed suicide, she wrote: "You need to do this, Conrad." "All you have to do is start the generator and you will be free and happy."
Judge Moniz said that Carter gained attention through the death of Mr. Roy and ordered her not to profit from the case through any media.
There are legal differences in this case.
One of the few defenders of Tecat is Amanda Knox, who in 2007 was accused of murdering her British roommate in Italy and was acquitted two years later.
Ms. Knox, 30, said in a column in the Los Angeles Times: "Michell Carter deserves sympathy and help, not imprisonment."
Zhang Yimou is destined to be a controversial film artist. Since he began shooting the first movie, "Red Sorghum," he has been gaining a lot of criticism while he has been leading the Chinese movie trend.
The reporter learned from the Lhasa Pure Land Basketball Club on the 2nd that, recently, the Lhasa Pure Land Basketball Junior team won the fourth place in the national junior basketball league finals held in Beijing.
The Lhasa China Land Youth Basketball team consists of 11 local players. The coach is Lian Sangzhu, assistant coach of the Lhasa Men's Basketball Adult Team.
Before going to Beijing to participate in the finals of the Tibet "Basketball Kid".
Lhasa Pure Land Basketball Club, general manager of Lhasa's Pure Land Basketball Club, told reporters that the team's performance has improved compared to last year, and players' self-confidence and grasp of the stadium have improved significantly.The exchanges between players and other teams are more comprehensive, and the exchanges on the court and field are more and more relaxed.
After the game, the team's Chang Jiang measures that he hopes to accumulate experience by participating in the competition and do his best for the basketball career in Tibet.
It is understood that in Beijing's games, the players have overcome the low altitude oxygen and other factors, showing the image of Tibet.
Although athletics is a big gold medal in the Olympic Games, and track and field athletes have gotten in the world, the track and field champions are in the wind.
Automotive manufacturers face shocks, Audi will retrofit up to 850,000 diesel vehicles
The day before Audi announced the conversion, BMW said it will provide software upgrades for more than 350,000 vehicles.
BMW Chairman stated that BMW believes that "there are more intelligent options than driving", which means that major European cities - including Munich, where BMW's headquarters is located - consider prohibiting or restricting diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will retrofit 3 million Mercedes cars from Europe to reduce its diesel emissions.
None of the companies claimed that this was a recall.
European car manufacturers are promoting the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to help achieve CO2 emissions regulations.
However, the nitrogen oxides emitted by diesel engines are considered to be carcinogens and may cause asthma.
The cost of installing equipment to offset the exhaust emissions of diesel vehicles is also increasing. Therefore, it is difficult to maintain the price competitiveness of diesel vehicles.
As German automakers face a review, the government led by Chancellor Angela Merkel has also been accused of over-indulging these powerful auto companies and has ignored the signs of this issue.
These auto companies are trying to avoid repeating the mistakes of the public, that is, disguising their use of so-called failing devices, adjusting emissions during automobile testing to comply with regulations, and returning to normal under normal driving conditions.
A number of VW executives have been accused in the United States, while other executives are now accepting investigations from countries on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former head of thermodynamics of Audi's engine development department was arrested in Germany.
The former manager, Zachello Giovanni Pamio, is Italian and therefore not subject to extradition protection and may face trial in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi was involved in a German criminal investigation involving the public. The German government accused Audi of installing the system to escape European emission requirements and expanded the scope of investigations previously restricted to the United States.
Audi's investigation may have a major impact on the public: Luxury car manufacturers have a disproportionate share of profits for Volkswagen.
It is commonplace for a movie to be released from preparation to release, which lasted for one to two years or even several years.
The animated film “Big Fish Sea Bass” has been announced on July 8th. The film will take 12 years to prepare for the show!
Liang Xuan, the original author of “Big Fish Sea Dragonfly”, started his career in thermal energy at Tsinghua University at the age of 21. He and his good friend Zhang Chun created the other side of the sky. In 2008, he obtained a venture capital of US$1 million to create a movie debut called “Big Fish Sea Dragon”.
The film has won many awards at home and abroad during the creative sample stage, and it has been collected and praised as one of the “most outstanding works of art” by the Centre Georges Pompidou.
Since it took six years from concept to production, the film was called "Kengkeng" by millions of fans who were looking forward to their release.
“Big Fish Begonia” tells a story about the Chinese people’s fantasy, and with the announcement of the trailer, it has brought new expectations to all audiences.
Liang Xuan said: "This has only been done for 12 years. Now that it has become a reality from a dream, I am nervous and excited."
Zhang Chun said: "The old people are thinking about using the budget of one-fifth of the others and making the same picture effects as others. The team must be driven crazy by me."
Dongguan, a “world factory” that used to rely on processing and a large number of general workers, is looking to high-level talent who can lead the city’s reorientation.
Recently, Dongguan City Government held a high-level personnel activities week, the First Financial reporter saw that some local powerful companies have participated in the talent conference.
Against the brightly lit billboards against the backdrop of the orange-colored walls, they each marked a high price tag.
Therefore, the China Television Production Industry Association decided to join the national TV drama production industry and sign a self-regulation convention.
Lavender Provence threatened by climate change
Lavender has become a symbol of the French city of Provence in southern France, but now there is bad news that it is being threatened by climate change.
Lavender is declining due to persistent drought and the emergence of virus-carrying insects, which is a headache for scientists and farmers who are trying to find solutions.
Eric Chaisse, a specialist at the CRIEPPAM Institute in Provence, said: “Provence’s lavender is facing a huge threat because the plant has been affected by climate change in recent years, with significant drops in spring rainfall and rainy autumn.
This will affect the life cycle of lavender.
There is also a smaller individual, a leafhopper that can spread microscopic bacteria. In very dry weather, they will appear in large numbers.
The key is the sheer number.
In addition to attracting holidaymakers, the elegant Lavender is also sought after by the perfumery and cosmetics industries.
Eric Chase said: "In contrast to plants that can grow many large flowers and have long spikes, we have problems with small individuals, stunting, missing or cowardly insufficiency.
So we have less essential oil."
The solutions being studied include adopting better irrigation techniques and slowing the evaporation of soil moisture, spraying plants with protective mixtures of clay and water, and developing more drought-tolerant varieties.
Compared to the sci-fi elements in the film, the two protagonists have expressed that they are more attractive to them in the film's story.
On the afternoon of September 5, a reporter from the Huaxi Dushi Bao interviewed several well-known personalities in the world of dialogue and interviews with two crosstalk artists. Surprisingly, they were almost silent.
One is the Berlin movie actor, one is a rising young actor, "Psychological crime" is also the first partner of Liao Fan and Li Yifeng.
Mexico is in danger and journalists are killed
All members of the "Riodoce" weekly will usually meet on Wednesday to review their plans for the riots in Sinalo State. These riots are caused by criminal organizations, corrupt officials and the endless war on drugs.
But today, the shadow of tragedy has shrouded them. They gather to discuss security issues.
It is important that they are told to change their daily habits.
Two senior reporters discussed which is more secure: whether they should bring their children to the office (the office was attacked by a grenades in 2009) or whether they should be left at home.
The security expert wrote three words on the blackboard in front of the room: enemies, neutrals, and allies.
They let these reporters list their names under each column—no evidence, observation, and intuition are enough.
There are suspected drug traffickers, politicians, businessmen and reporters, or cartels suspected of being on the government's list. These villains have made Mexico’s reporting work dangerous.
Violence never stops, and bodies are scattered across the country. More and more reporters: According to the records of the Committee of Protected Journalists, at least 25 journalists have died since President Enrique Peña Nieto took over in December 2012; 589 journalists have been protected by the Federation after being attacked and threatened; at least seven journalists have died in seven states so far this year.
The last one to die was their editors and sources of inspiration, as well as the co-founder of "Riodoce" Javier Valdez Cardenas.
Valdez wrote many books on drug violence. In one of his books he wrote: "The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and become a reporter."
Everyone can feel deeply that he has left, although he is everywhere - a huge photo hanging on the front of the office building of "Odo deoce", Valdez has a middle finger with the word "justice"; Alan Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, two 30-year-old journalists wearing T-shirts also shows his smile, he wears glasses or his iconic Panama hat.
The seminar was held less than two months after his death; journalists discussed their common trauma, nightmares, insomnia and paranoia.
Although a special federal prosecutor’s office was established in 2010 to handle journalist cases, according to the records of the Committee for the Protection of Journalists, the office only sued two people.
Most of the thousands of crime cases each year involve drug trafficking and organized crime, so it is rare to bring the perpetrators who killed the reporters to justice.
In "Riodoce", they insisted on reporting on the violence in Sinalo State, although they have already broken their hearts, even though this land has been devastated.
Ivala said that if there is no information on the killer and there is no justice, then holding a security seminar will not be very useful.
He said "It's foolish to waste time participating in such a seminar.
As long as we don't know why, you don't believe anyone."
On the morning of May 15, Valdez left the office of Riodoce in the capital of Culiacan.
His red Toyota Corolla was blocked by two men just a few blocks away; they forced him to get out of the car and fired 12 shots, guessing because of the newspaper's name - translated as "The Twelve Rivers."
The gangster left his car and crashed it near him.
Valdez is 50 years old.
Left his wife and two grown children.
Culiacan rumors everywhere.
But on the topic of Valdez, in fact there is nothing but silence.
Since the arrest of Guzman last year and the extradition of the United States in January, Sinalo has become the country’s bloodiest battlefield, and hostile forces are madly killed.
In the streets of Sinalo State, one or more people are shot and killed every day. The graveyard is full of gorgeous two-story mausoleums, which are commonplace.
For the time being, forgetting the state of “calmness” is the time when only one cartel controls this coastal state and its ports and drug trafficking routes to the United States.
Even so, even if Valdez was deeply aware of the dangers of the job, Ismail Phomquick, the co-founder and director of the 60-year-old Riodoce, was embarrassed because he did not protect his friends.
He believes that the two mistakes caused this tragedy.
First, an interview with Damaso Lopez was published in February. He headed a cartel group that played against several Guzman sons.
The report may have angered the sons; the newspapers were sent to the newsstand and were bought out by suspected gang members.
The second mistake was not to force Valdez to leave Mexico for his own safety after another newspaper that reported the same story was confiscated.
Valdez is a legend in Mexico and abroad. His death is of great significance to Mexican violence against reporters.
His spirit persists. His friends and colleagues believe that he has always been with us.
He was also a senior reporter for Noroeste in 2003 when he co-founded “Riodoce” with five colleagues and sold a 50-dollar stake.
Pohoqui said that in the state of Sinalo, “it is impossible to step into the journalism business without dealing with the drug problem.”
With the passage of time, the newspaper has earned a good reputation for its bold and honest reports, and sales and advertising have also increased.
Reporters like to be able to publish critical reports without fear of censorship. Readers also like newspapers to publish stories that others do not dare to report.
"Riodoce" won the Latin American Maria Moscavo Press Award five years after its founding.
In the same year, the Association for the Protection of Journalists awarded the Valdez International Press Freedom Prize in recognition of his courage to pursue the most authentic Mexican drug reports.
He admits that he is also very scared.
When the Society for the Protection of Journalists granted awards, he said, "I want to continue living."
Later in late October, he said in an interview with the local television station Rompeviento TV that “In the state of Sinalo, drug trafficking is a way of life.
You must take on the task that falls on your shoulders as a journalist—either so or worse.
I don't want to be asked, ‘What did you do in the face of so many deaths... Why don’t you sound what’s going on?’”
The entire staff of “Riodoce” missed Valdez and missed him like a dock worker cursing it. He missed the friend who never hesitated to embrace and advise and missed the teacher who knew how to live.
They rely on his habits.
He used to wear that hat.
The El Guayabo bar, which often goes across the office, always sits on the same table.
Now, they will ask: Is his daily habit causing his fall?
His death also forced them to think about how to do a good job and live well.
Polquieu said, "They don't like the troubles you give their women and children, and they don't like the legitimate airports that you use to influence their legitimate companies and their drugs.
All these have crossed their bottom line."
As a result, even in the safest times, we must maintain a high degree of self-censorship and self-protection.
Believe in your instincts.
If you smell a dangerous atmosphere, keep it away.
The editor of Riodoce, Andres Villarreal, said that the problem is that “breath is a feeling that it will be deceived...and then things like Havel will happen.”
He and others have said that the previous rules no longer apply to the state of Sinaloa - just as it no longer applies to Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero, and other states. The smuggling routes of these states are lucrative, and institutions are weak, and government officials are corrupt.
The situation is constantly changing.
In the room where "Riodoce" employees participated in security training, the use of mobile phones was suddenly not allowed; a few days ago, spyware that was allegedly sold to the government was used in Mexico to monitor journalists and activists.
Outside, two police officers took shelter in the shade and avoided the high temperatures of 104 degrees (40 degrees Celsius).
They were sent by the state government to protect the office of Riodoce, a four-storey building in the middle class quarter of Culiacan.
Some journalists joked half jokingly wondering if the police would not be 50% of what the governor himself said.
Reporters have been to the mountains for several months, where drug trafficking groups are under actual control.
This week's "Riodoce" mainly reported three major events.
Among them was the murder of the brother of Julio Cesar Chaves, the great ex-boxer of Sinalo State.
There is also disclosure of government funds in the governor’s hometown.
As well as the kidnapping in the expensive restaurant of Culiacan, this restaurant is only one block away from the prosecutor's office.
The official has not released information on the kidnapping and kidnapping process, so writing down what the city knows needs to be done with caution: That restaurant is where drug dealers and officials love to go.
A reporter learned from the public archives that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician in the ruling party’s Revolutionary Institutional Party (PRI), which dominated all levels of the political class for almost the entire period.
Recently, several governors of the Revolutionary Institutional Party have been accused of corruption in several highly regarded cases.
Villarreal asked reporters to write about what had happened at the site of the incident, including a case in which a son of one of Mexico’s top drug lords Guzman evaded a military attack.
If a few months ago, readers will look at Valdez's column to find the most powerful information on the kidnapping.
46-year-old Villarreal because of his thin body, known as "thin", he said, "In the past, we already knew what had happened.
Now all of our sources of information communication channels have been cut off.
Valdez’s office is now used to store protests and logos for the killing of journalists because employees have become what they never wanted to be: activists representing the media.
The next morning, reporter Miriam Ramirez grabbed a sign and walked out of the room to the local prosecutor's office for a parade related to another reporter.
Three days after the death of Salvador Adame in Valdez, he disappeared in the western state of Michoacán.
The official found a charred body and said that according to the DNA test, this is his body.
Throughout the country, journalists have become more outspoken. They organized protests and painted the words “Save the media” on the sidewalks and buildings.
On this day, Boholqui, a director, is not in Washington. He is trying to provide justice for Valdez and seek international support.
On the second day of Valdez’s death, in a meeting with the governor of Sinalo, Ramirez filed a complaint against the official spying on the reporter’s information and killed them because they had said the facts.
In view of her anger has affected her objectivity, she also asked to resign from the position of government affairs.
Valdez has repeatedly reiterated that Mexico’s journalists are “surrounded” by organized crime, filthy government officials, and indifference to society.
In his previous book, "Drug Journalism," he wrote that journalists are not only victims of drug trafficking, but are also on the list of politicians and security forces who are affiliated with organized crime.
The media monitoring group Articulo 19 blamed police and public officials for more than half of the attacks on journalists last year.
Ramirez said, "In Mexico, they let you die in order to shut you up."
Obviously, these murders are chilling.
No one forgets that six years ago, the blogger, Maria Elisabeth Massias, died on the northern border of Tamaulipas.
Next to her body was a note that was allegedly signed by Zetas Cartel: "I came for my report."
Her head was cut off and there was a computer keyboard and headphones next to it.
After Miroslava Bryche was killed in March, some newspapers chose to close, such as the El Norte newspaper on the northern border of Chihuahua.
Others are still continuing. The directors of El Manana of Nuevo Laredo were killed in 2014, but they are still continuing.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juarez used a front page news to openly talk about drug cartels with the title “What do you want from us?”
Some reporters fled their hometowns or even left the country.
This is a difficult decision.
It is difficult to find jobs in exile, and they still need to be careful on the streets to be alert to danger.
Sometimes they are arrested and it is said that in 2015 photographer Ruben Espinosa was killed in a Mexican city and four women after fleeing Veracruz for three months.
For those who are still working behind the scenes, this is the daily step of high-risk decision-making.
Ibarra wanted to become a poet. He admitted that reporting the drug trade made him feel afraid.
He said "Mexico is going to hell, so I became a reporter."
In the middle of the most recent Friday night, the latest newspaper has been printed. The editors of Riodoce sat in the aisle outside the office and drank beer. Suddenly, their cell phones rang.
A series of gun battles took place between the gang hostile forces and security forces near the beach resort city of Mazatlan and 19 people were confirmed dead.
The fighting is still escalating, as indicated by a series of cartel information discovered in the area.
They just uploaded the news on the roadside to the "Riodoce" website via mobile phone.
The headline the next day had to be changed.
The siren sounded in the neighborhood - a gunfight of duel between the dead and the dead in the area.
Boholique glanced at the police who stood there guarding them to see if they were alert.
If they are scared, they do not show it.
The founder of this newspaper has already died. In his large-scale portraiture, his middle finger points to the entire Sinalo state that needs to be looked over. The staff of "Riodoce" follow him.
Pohoquay said: "How could you even want to close it? On the same day that Javier was killed, the intern asked me to send her to the street to report."
China's self-driving tourism market scales or trillions of yuan in 2020
[Abstract] Under the background of consumption upgrading and the prevalence of free travel, driving by car is encouraged by the national policy and more and more consumers love it.
At the same time, however, the self-driving tour market, which is expected to exceed the trillion-dollar scale, is also facing double challenges.
In the context of rising consumption and the prevalence of free travel, driving by car is encouraged by national policies and is increasingly favored by consumers.
At the same time, the self-driving tour market, which is expected to exceed the trillion-dollar scale, is also facing double challenges. On the one hand, the development of self-driving tour industry is not in direct proportion to the market demand. Self-driving tour organizers such as self-driving tour clubs and travel agencies are faced with a meagre profit; on the other hand, the infrastructure and services facing self-driving tour are still in the initial stage.
Occupying 60% of the total number of domestic tourists, market size is expected to break trillion
In 2016, domestic tourism totaled 4.44 billion passenger trips. Self-driving tour accounts for about 60% of the total number of domestic tourists. By 2020, the scale of self-driving tour market is expected to exceed RMB 1 trillion.
According to the statistics of the China Travel Coach Association’s statistics on the number of self-driving tourists, the number of tourists from the driving force has continued to increase in the past five years, and the number of outbound tourists accounts for more than half of the total number of domestic tourists.
At the same time, various regions and countries have shown more attention and support for the emerging area of self-driving tourism. From 2016 to 2017, intensive policies and regulations related to self-driving, residential and camping tourism have been issued.
In July 2017, the National Tourism Administration and the General Administration of Sport of China jointly issued the "Automotive Self-Driving Sports Camp Development Plan"; in the same month, the Self-driving tour was highlighted in the "Action Plan to Promote Quality Improvement in Rural Tourism Development (2017)" jointly issued by 14 departments including the National Development and Reform Commission and the Ministry of Finance.
The introduction of the policy provided opportunities and policy guidance for the development of self-driving tourism in China.
Self-driving tour club has a meager profit, and the complete industry chain is the key
Although the potential of self-driving tour market in China is huge and the national policy is actively guided, the self-driving tour industry is still in its infancy.
According to the 2016-2017 Annual Report on China's Self-Drive, the number of self-driving tour clubs, auto clubs, and riders' associations in the country has reached several thousand, but the proportion of self-guided travel by tourists has occupied the majority, and only about 15% of tourists participate in various kinds of agencies such as Che Youhui and Zijia You Club.
At the same time, online travel companies and traditional travel agencies that independently research and develop self-driving tour products are also very few. Many online travel platforms only sell self-driving tour products provided by some suppliers, and some self-driving tour clubs are also important suppliers.
From the standpoint of organizing driving tours, it covers many aspects such as “eat, live, travel, travel, purchase, and entertainment”. The degree of fragmentation is high, the upstream supply chain is heavy, and the randomness of tourists' consumption is large.
Li Guanjie, founder and CEO of Beijing World Auto Club, believes that self-driving tour clubs are similar to travel agencies in nature. Earlier major profit models were mainly offline activities. The core point was self-driving tour line products and leader services.
However, nowadays, homogenization of circuit products in the self-driving industry is serious and the service level of the leader is uneven. Self-driving tour clubs are faced with the need for another transformation.
It can be seen that self-driving tour itself is not an independent industry. Instead, it forms a trans-regional, industry-based eco-environment based on the displacement characteristics of self-driving tour. It is very important to form a complete industrial chain.
Experts point out that in addition to basic tourism consumption, experience is a more important consumer element.
Therefore, for the development of self-driving tour industry, the characteristics of experience should be enhanced, and the theme of “self-driving tour +” and the IP of self-driving tour products should be developed.
The scenic road is not only a road, the car camp should not only satisfy the accommodation
In the face of the rise of self-driving tour, the basic supporting development of self-driving tour is also relatively elementary.
Li Guanjie pointed out that tourism scenic roads are not just a road, but need to integrate the elements of transportation and tourism. However, the construction of roads and tourism itself is responsible for the two departments. The transportation departments increase the tourism elements and also stay in the construction of toilets, consulting centers, billboards and other facilities, and the degree of integration with tourism is not high.
Comparing with the famous self-driving tour route “U.S. 66 Highway”, the construction experience is worth learning from.
The scenic road design is no longer the most direct and quick path from the departure place to the destination, but follows the design concept of “experience driving pleasure” and provides the best enjoyment of self-driving tourists to enjoy the scenery along the road. The scenic road can connect point-like and scenic tourism landscapes, which not only preserves the historical and cultural values of the ecotourism resources along the line, but also organizes various thematic activities to enhance the participation and recreation experience of tourists and create economic benefits for the local tourism industry.
In addition to the scenic roads, the camp is also an important accessory for self-driving tour.
However, among the self-driving tourists known by the Beijing News reporter, few consumers choose to stay in the camp.
In their opinion, many camps are biased toward infrastructure construction and can only meet food and shelter requirements. Their grades are not high and their products are monotonous. They cannot meet the demand for self-driving tour, which contains many elements.
According to industry sources who declined to be named, many of the companies that used to make camps in the past few years were to get the land. After the acquisition of land, the supporting facilities and services in the later period were not able to keep up with the situation. Many of the operating conditions were losses, and it was difficult to make corresponding supporting products without the injection of funds in the later period.
Consumer group
According to the data released by the China Coaching and Transport Association in 2017, from an age point of view, the self-driving tour groups are concentrated in 21-40 years old, and especially 31-40 years old. This group of people has a certain economic foundation, and the demand for personalized tourism is high, and most of them are family-friendly.
Looking from accommodation accommodation, self-driving tour people tend to prefer non-standard accommodation.
Judging from the type of self-driving tour, the surrounding self-driving is the most important type of self-driving tour, accounting for 84.32%.
Outbound driving is a longing for many people, but the percentage is still relatively small.
At the same time, with the increase in consumer demand, tourists who liked to drive by self-guided “tours spots” began to change their minds. They are no longer “taking pictures off the car and sleeping on the train” during driving, but are paying more attention to the travel experience and process.
Dinosaurs use camouflage to hide from the enemy
At first glance, it was terrible, but it looked like a statue.
The researchers published the first research findings of the incredible rhinoceros-sized and unimaginable fossils found by Canadian miners and pointed out that the fossils were well preserved. Therefore, experts called them "the Mona Lisa of the dinosaur community."
This fossil is very well preserved and can even determine the color of its scaly skin is reddish-brown, which shows that it has had some “troublesome experience”.
The report in the Journal of Contemporary Biology describes it as "the best-preserved armored dinosaur ever discovered and one of the best dinosaur specimens in the world."
The fossil is a newly discovered species of knotted dragon that lived between 110 million and 112 million years ago in the mid-Cretaceous period.
The state of preservation was extremely good and shocked the researchers, who described it as "really amazing."
According to the National Geographic magazine, the herbivorous armored dinosaur fossil is the best-preserved fossil of the same dinosaur ever discovered.
On March 21, 2011, Shawn Funk discovered the fossil when he was mining at the Suncor Coal Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada.
At that time, he encountered something that did not seem to be the same as the surrounding rocks. So he decided to take a closer look.
Afterwards, the fossils he discovered were sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology in Canada.
It took researchers six years to expose the beast inside the 2,500 pounds (1,100 kilograms) of clods.
After such hard work, the final result is now announced.
“If you look at it with a squint, you almost believe it is sleeping,” says Caleb Brown, the first scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum and the first author of the creature.
"It will become one of the most beautiful and best-preserved dinosaur specimens in the history of science - the Mona Lisa in the world of dinosaurs."
Researchers studied the skin and found that this herbivore, while wearing armor, is like a walking tank, but it may be a major threat from carnivorous dinosaurs.
This kind of heavy-bodied dinosaur uses red-and-white camouflage to evade predators and uses a so-called "shadow-repelling" concealment technique, which is also used by many modern animals.
Experts said that in this way, it can better integrate with the surrounding environment to avoid the enemy, indicating that it is preyed by larger dinosaurs.
This 110 million-year-old creature belongs to the knotted dragon family and made headlines for the first time in May. It is currently on display at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.
Mark Mitchell, a museum technician who is a member of the team, spent 7,000 hours meticulously uncovering the beast's veil, and researchers now study it and named it "Borealopelta markmitchelli."
The sample was kept in good condition so that Dr. Mitchell, as well as the team of international scientists, could record the patterns and shapes of their scales and armor.
They discovered the "anti-shadow" technique, which is a common defensive method in the animal world, which means that the creature's back is darker than its side.
Although "anti-shadowing" was common, the findings were surprising because the dinosaurs were much larger than the existing animals using anti-shadowing.
The dinosaurs face the pressure of being hunted by carnivorous dinosaurs and evolve in a favorable direction so that they can hide in the confrontation as a means of survival.
However, most of the existing animals that use anti-shadowing techniques, such as deer, zebras, or cockroaches, are as small and fragile as prey, suggesting that the creature is facing real pressure to survive.
"The mad predation of large heavy dinosaurs shows how dangerous the Cretaceous carnivorous dinosaurs were," Brown said.
Chemical analysis of the organic complexes in the scales also indicated that the dinosaurs had a red-brown skin color.
Scientists are continuing to study the life cues of the organism, including its retained stomach contents to find the last food to eat.
They believe that when the dinosaurs died, they rushed into the river, and then they rushed into the sea and finally sank to the bottom with their backs facing down.
At the time, the climate in Alberta was as warm as it was in southern Florida today. Rivers and oceans may be more inland than they are today.
Brown said: "This kind of knotted dragon is truly amazing because it is completely covered by preserved squamous skin, and it has been preserved in dimensional space so that its original shape can be preserved."
"So, the shape of the creature is almost the same as it was in the Cretaceous.
You don't need to use too much imagination to rebuild it; if you look at it with a squint, you almost believe it is sleeping."
The Cretaceous Period was a time when large rostral dinosaurs roamed on Earth.
Although Tyrannosaurus is the king of dinosaurs, it took millions of years after armoured dinosaurs.The armored dinosaurs may have been killed by some of T. rex's ancestors.
They include the high spinosaurus, a monster weighing 6 tons and 38 feet (11.5 meters) long.
Recent research has found that scientists present in the journal "Contemporary Biology" believe that the knotted dragon was washed into the sea after its death, and then the mummy was formed in the soil.
On March 21, 2011, Sean Fink excavated the creature at the Miller Mine near Fort McMurray, Alberta, Canada.
According to the museum, it is the best-preserved armored dinosaur in the world. The skin and armor from the nose to the hips are all complete.
The organism is approximately 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighs 3000 pounds (1300 kilograms).
It has two 20-inch long, pointed corners protruding from the shoulders.
Researchers believe that this herbivorous armored dinosaur is now active in western Canada and was flooded into the sea by a flood of rivers.
However, this type of dinosaur was buried in the seabed to keep its armor intact.
The fossil remains of this particular sample were kept in good condition, leaving the remaining skin still covered with rugged nails on the dinosaur skull.
As Michael Greshko wrote in the National Geographic magazine, this level of preservation is just like winning. It is very rare.
The more I see it, the more incredible it is.
The remaining skin fossils still cover the dappled armor on the dinosaur skull.
Its right forefoot is on its side, and its five toes expand upward.
I can count it out."
The reporter learned that natural or plant-derived alginic acid, humic acid and amino acid enhancer carriers can be added to the urea production process to modify the efficiency of the traditional urea, the formation of alginic acid urea, zinc humic acid urea, urea nitrogen urea utilization factor than ordinary urea increased by 5 to 10 percentage points.

The total number of security personnel is double that of the 2012 London Olympics.
To ensure the safety of the Rio Olympic Games, Brazil will launch the largest security linkage plan ever.
Before that, the Brazilian government stated that a total of 85,000 people from the army and the police will coordinate operations, including 20,000 soldiers and 65,000 police officers.
Most military personnel will be responsible for defending the Olympic venues, and the additional 3,000 military personnel will be responsible for the security of international airports, subway stations and streets.
The police patrol the rest of the city, including subways, buses and streets.
It is reported that there are currently 6,000 military personnel arrived in Rio about Olympic security services.
In addition to the four major divisions responsible for the Rio Olympic Games, they are also responsible for patrolling the airport and the main road connecting the airport and the Olympic venues.
The introduction of an evaluation mechanism in the service industry has long been nothing new. To make the evaluation mechanism effective, it is important to make supervision more effective and non-existent.
How do activists learn to answer this question: "Who's the street?"
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrer was guilty.
On the first day of his arrival in New York City, the St. Louis man sat on Airbnb's rental bed and browsed Facebook on his mobile phone.
She stumbled upon a high school student's post.
It reads, "The police just killed an 18-year-old child. The child is still lying on the street."
She was puzzled that she found no other person on the feed to post this information, she turned off Facebook, and she opened Twitter.
A @TheePharoah user keeps pushing her a newsletter.
The rap singer in the St. Louis area tweeted the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old black who was killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri.
He posted a picture of Brown's body with no vital signs lying on the street. His body lay on the street for four hours.
"Mad," Ferrer thought.
But for her and her community, death is nothing new.
She put down her mobile phone and did not open Twitter again until that evening. She read the tweets about the gatherings on Canfield Avenue.
There are police videos and pictures of people yelling, and there is a picture of a man who claims to be Brown's father that says: "The Ferguson police had just killed my unarmed son!"
She saw a live feed. A policeman stood in front of a group of protesters with a dog.
She said that in another video, another police officer squeaked his rifle and said, "I will kill all of you ... beasts."
"This is not normal," Ferrer recalled.
"This is not what we take for granted and we can call it a typical murder."
At that moment, I felt shuddering.
I was very angry and cried."
She booked a return flight and returned home the next day.
After landing at 11 pm, she took her 6-year-old daughter from her father’s house and decided to go to Ferguson the following morning.
In the next three years, what happened to Ferrer and Ferguson was the theme of a new documentary “Who's Street?” that was released in the theater on August 11th.
This is a story about people living in this community, packed with streets and alleys asking for answers, telling stories of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and tenacity.
When Ferrer drove to Ferguson together with his daughter (in a floral dress, with a crown accessory), the two revisited the topic they had discussed many times before that morning - "About the black experience and the black condition."
"Do you remember when I taught you when blacks had to fight for their faith?" she recalled.
"We are going to Ferguson now because the police killed an 18-year-old boy. This is wrong.
I had to bring her," Ferrer later said.
"What happened today is all ... past climaxes.
She wants to know, see and rise from this matter.
She not only needs to develop well in radicalism and organization, but also to understand the different aspects of black experience and black condition and to understand what we must do to gain freedom and liberation.
Even if I had the privilege of providing her with racist experiences she had not personally experienced, she was no different from other black girls.
If I protect her on this matter, I think I am hurting her."
Their first stop at Ferguson was at a venue opposite the police station in South Florida. The activists waited until the police officer, Darren Wilson, was eventually indicted and the site became their camp.
Ferrer and her daughter contacted a local business owner who made a bag lunch.
They prepared bags and were responsible for passing the bags to protesters.
Slowly, Ferrer began to form a new type of activism.
She said, “My activism has completely changed since August 9.” At Missouri State University’s St. Louis’s undergraduate college, she was chairman of the National Minority Nursing Association and focused on issues of food justice and health in the black community.
"I have no organizational experience.
It's all here."
A few weeks later, Ferrer met with the film co-director Sabah Fallaijan in a night parade.
Folayan said she and her photography director Lucas Alvarado Fale "just want to record" what happened.
A question emerges in Ferrer’s mind: “Do you want to record or want to find a story that you can use?”
This suspicion stems from many such cases: People - usually white - enter a community to benefit from their pain and tenacity.
As Fallain explained in a recent interview, “We have heard that people born and raised in Ferguson did not focus their voices, and we wanted to do it in different ways.”
Foleyyan has already contacted co-director Damon Davis, a regional artist known for his activism against dead prisoners.
His involvement led Ferrer to join the six other locals in the “Who's Street?” project team, and he remained a few years after Brown was shot.
"This documentary is not for anyone to speak for us or to talk to us. This is our statement," Davies said.
"I mainly focus on how these characters are presented because this is how I am presented."
Although the goal is not to focus on Ferrer's experience - but to show that the campaign "is not about the savior leader, but about community cohesion," Foley said - it turns out she is the most open among film participants.
As a result, "Who's Street?" surprisingly recorded Ferrer's personal life, such as falling in love and entering marriage.
"I feel naked," Ferrer laughed when he saw the finished product for the first time.
"But I understand that to do this job and to black humanity must have a certain degree of vulnerability."
In addition, Ferrer's story reaffirms and repositions the role of black queer women in the broader movement of black life events.
Two of the three founders of the sport - the creation of #BlackLivesMatter on social media after the 2012 Black Teen Trevor Martin shooting - were identified as queer.
“The black queer women in the leadership generally supported this movement,” Ferrer said. “That's because we are fighting on multiple fronts.
Black queer women must bear it all."
Fleijn agreed and mentioned that "this sport really has the support of black women and many black queer women."
Because of her identity, Ferrer was selected as the core of the film, however, she insisted that "this is not an affirmative action for the matter."
"She is the one who stimulates this energy," she said.
“Although she is at the front line, this is not a coincidence. Because in these crossroads, as a black queer woman, you have a lot to do.
Through the screen, you can feel her energy."
At the same time, news cameras have long disappeared in Ferguson, but the tense ethnic relations between the community and the police still exist.
Ferrer was sentenced to probation for more than two and a half years for trying to block the highway during a parade.
She described the socio-political atmosphere of what she called home: "a mess."
Despite this, she has insisted on the hymn she has worked hard to remember since she embarked on the streets of Ferguson three years ago.
"We have a responsibility to fight for freedom.
We have a responsibility to win.
We must love each other and love each other.
We are no more lost than the shackles on our bodies.”
In fact, online translation services were already available on the Internet a decade ago. In fact, long ago, the argument that “the machine is about to replace humans for translation” has been heard.
Similarities: Artists use Chelsea Manning's DNA to create portraits
In the center of the exhibition hall at the Friedman Museum in New York, there are multiple faces: white, black, and brown. Each face has almost indistinguishable similarities. These faces are tied by a string hanging from the ceiling.
The 30 portraits were created by artist Dewey-Hagborg using cheek swabs and hair shrapnel sent by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent hair crumbs from the Levenworth prison and leaked confidential diplomatic telegrams through WikiLeaks. The former intelligence analyst was sentenced to 35 years in prison.
The exhibition opened on August 2 and the title was "Similarities".
This is the result of two years of communication between Dewey Hageburg and Manning, Dewey Hagerberg combined his discipline with himself in technology, computer science, and the arts, and Manning is a famous dissident who was jailed and completed a sex change operation in prison. Former U.S. President Obama pardoned her remaining punishment three days before the end of her term.
By analyzing the algorithm from Manning's DNA and creating 30 portraits of “probable appearance.” Heather Dewey Haboge made a harsh and slightly ruthless comment. His comments are both the polyphylaxis of DNA and the concept of identity itself.
Manning was born with the name Bradley Edward, who publicly acknowledged that he was a woman during adolescence. He was convicted in 2013 and involved 20 charges, including 6 espionage violations, computer fraud and theft.
In prison, her image was suppressed. There was only one photograph, a grainy black-and-white selfie. It looked obviously uneasy, sitting in the driver's seat and wearing a platinum-gold wig.
In 2015, Heather Dewey Haberg achieved great success in her 2012 project “Stranger Visions”.
In that work, she used DNA from cigarette butt and chewing gum courts to extract DNA from debris to create portraits of 3D characters that may look similar.
That's when she happened to receive an email from Paper Magazine.
“They want to interview Chelsea Manning in prison and they need a portrait shot,” said Heather Dewey Harberg at the opening ceremony of the exhibition.
At the time Chelsea Manning could not visit or take pictures, so they contacted Chelsea and asked if she was interested in making DNA portraits.
As a result, the artist and her imprisoned Muse became an impossible pen pal and exchanged many letters in two years.
They even created a comic book, "The Repressed Headshot," which was drawn by Shoili Kanungo, who expected the president to grant privilege to Manning in the future, and she could see the exhibition in prison.
Obama had asked for her release a few days after the publication of the book, which may have been a coincidence, when Manning had spent his seventh year in the Kansas military prison.
In addition, this exhibition also has another profound meaning, because in the contemporary United States, the Trump administration continues to declare war on government leakers and transgender soldiers, and at the same time seek new ways to speculate on Twitter, to instinctively incite separatism, and this exhibition is to bridge this division.
When asked about all these special occasions, Heather Dewey Haberg said that "anything happens for a reason."
In the artist’s statement written on the gallery wall, Manning’s oversized signature is below (the “i” in the name is drawn with a heart) and calls for an end to the “partisan image of discord based on gender, sexual orientation and culture.”
On the opposite wall is her mitochondrial DNA sequence, which is twisted with a pencil and twisted with Cs, Gs, and As symbols.
By containing 200 letters (or nucleotides, each artist's complex scientific dictionary), Heather De Hauber hopes to portray these surprisingly similar portraits and express that at least in the physiological structure, everyone is like this.
"I hope people get out of this dilemma. Our genome doesn't care who we are, how open genetic data is interpreted, and how subjective it is," said Heather Dewey Haberger. His 2007 video "False Memory" is also on display.
"DNA data tells us many different stories, so this is one of 30 stories."
The last work in the exhibition, in a room, comes from a page in the front illustration novella.
Demonstrate the Manning who is under the boastful, diamond-shaped styling of the American soldier holding a loudspeaker.
"When they stopped your speech, they won," the wall wrote.
"So, don't shut up."
“The content comes directly from a letter she wrote to me,” said the artist from Philadelphia.
"I'm just scared again. I still have to say."
Manning has not personally seen this exhibition, as predicted in the comics, but when she does so, she will be cheered by her own DNA portrait mask, just like a group of protesters in the center of the exhibition hall.
This is also a purposeful, as all the items in the exhibition reach the height of her genetic haplogroup information written in pencil (5.2 feet, Manning's height).
"In the past, I hung them on the wall, but I hope they feel like a group of people," Dewey Hagberg said when talking about portraits.
"But I want them to feel like a group of protesters who followed Chelsea, just as people protested to release her."
Northwestern University Professor and Oxford University Staff Wanted for Murder
The police said that a man was found deadly in a luxury apartment in Chicago. A professor from Northwest University and an Oxford University employee were wanted overnight. He is now looking for suspects nationwide.
According to Cook County Court records, Waddham Lysheim, 42, and Andrew Warren, 56, were arrested on Monday for an unreleased murder order for Trenton H. James Cornell Durango.
According to documented records, 26-year-old Cornell Durango died of multiple stab wounds.
A community alert issued by the Chicago Police Department stated that the body was found on July 27.
After receiving the call, the police arrived at the Grand Plaza apartment and found that the victim had multiple lacerations.
The police claimed that Cornell Durango died on the spot and the detective is investigating this murder. The police are actively looking for two suspects.
Lysem has been an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
In an e-mail statement, Alan K. Cobbich, deputy director of the campus relations department, stated that Lesam has now been resigned and has been banned from entering the Northwestern University campus.
Cobbich said: "Now this is a criminal case. The relevant authorities are investigating and Northwestern University is actively cooperating with the investigation work."
Warren is a senior financial assistant at Oxford University.
A spokesman for the Somerville College of Oxford said in an e-mail statement: "We have been in constant contact with the British police and are always ready to assist the U.S. investigation agency on demand."
The statement added that Warren's colleagues were deeply shocked and hoped that he would surrender himself.
Anthony Guglielmi, chief liaison officer at the Chicago Police Department, said that the suspects are strongly encouraged to surrender to the authorities.
Guglielmi said, "The police have already got a general idea of their whereabouts. We are trying to locate possible locations."
Guillermi said that local, regional and national authorities are making every effort to assist in the search of suspects.
Guglielmi said that the police received a call from Grand Plaza apartment manager and he had just received a secret message saying that something happened in apartment No. 1008.
The police said the situation was terrible.
Guillermi said it is still unclear whether this incident also occurred on July 27.
He said that according to the security camera, it was confirmed that Lysem and Warren were in the building at the time.
"We believe Professor Lesam has a certain relationship with the victim," Guglielmi said.
Grand Plaza’s management team issued a statement to residents saying: “The police are currently studying the victim’s timeline and background, and are investigating various motives, including possible domestic incidents.”
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Muteko stated: "We will complete the road map of the World Anti-Doping Agency in the near future."
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitali Mutko stated that it will not take too long to implement the WADA's remaining standards for restoring the rights of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA).
“The implementation of the roadmap standards has reached a certain stage. RUSADA has the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD (British Anti-Doping Agency).
The WADA roadmap has been updated in this area,” Muteco said on Thursday.
Deputy Prime Minister Muteko made the above statement when commenting on the second part of the World Anti-Doping Agency's roadmap, “Compliance with Regulations.” This section sets standards for the restoration of RUSADA rights and was recently published on the organization’s website.
According to Muteko, the standard does not contain anything that could cause Russia’s concern.
He added, "Everything has been announced and everything will be implemented.
And the results will be submitted to the International Olympic Committee [IOC] and WADA in the near future."
However, one of the criteria mentioned in the list is that the Russian anti-doping agency must openly accept the results of the investigation by the Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren regarding WADA approval of the Russian State's support for the use of stimulants in sports in the country.
Speaking about this matter, Muteko said: "We are investigating that our anti-doping system has undoubtedly failed.
All measures have been implemented.
There is no national plan behind this, and we will not recognize things that do not exist."
Mutko’s words responded to Vitaly Smirnov, head of the Russian Independent Public Anti-Doping Committee.
Smirnov acknowledged the past problems of Russian anti-doping agencies when he was interviewed by the Russian outlet RSport earlier in the day, but he added: “We have said on various occasions that the report contained controversial positions and regulations.
No one plans to accept this report unconditionally," Smirnov said.
After the doping scandal in November 2015, WADA suspended the right of RUSADA to perform doping tests in Russia.
However, in June this year, RUSADA was allowed to plan and coordinate tests this year under the supervision of international experts and the UKAD.
When WADA Director-General Olivia Negri visited the organization’s Moscow headquarters in July, RUSADA was “moving in the right direction” and tried to restore its rights.

In an interview, Davao Suk, chairman of the Croatian Football Association, said that participating in the China Cup is very meaningful for Croatian football. The number of prizes in the China Cup is very large.
No longer have to look for purchasing! Zero tariffs on more than 8,000 products
At the regular press conference held by the Ministry of Commerce on January 11th, the spokesman of the Ministry of Commerce stated that as of now, China has entered into force 15 FTAs involving 23 countries and regions, covering more than 8,000 zero-tariff imports.
At the same time, imported cosmetics, Icelandic salmon, Chilean red wine, tropical fruits of ASEAN... You don't need to purchase these products for big prices.
At present, China has signed 16 free trade agreements with 24 countries and regions, 15 of which have been in effect, covering more than 8,000 zero-tariff imports.
Take agricultural products as an example. With the implementation of the free trade agreement, consumers can taste agricultural products from different producing areas and with high quality and low cost throughout the year.
For example, in tropical fruits such as durian, litchi and dragon fruit of ASEAN, import duties are reduced from 15% to 30% to zero tariffs.
Icelandic import tariffs on salmon are reduced from zero to 12% to zero tariffs;
Red wine in Georgia and Chile, import tariffs from 14% to 30% reduced to zero tariffs;
There are also significant tax cuts for New Zealand's specialty products such as beef and milk powder.
In the case of industrial products, for example, some of the import tariffs on cosmetics in Switzerland have dropped to zero;
Some of the watches have reduced their import tariffs by 50% and will be reduced to zero tariffs in a few years.
Korea's import tariffs on refrigerators, rice cookers, massage devices, and beauty instruments have fallen by 40%, and will be reduced to zero tariffs in a few years;
There are also significant tax reductions for consumer electronics.
At the same time, the zero-tariff products under the Free Trade Zone also include many intermediate products and raw materials needed for the manufacture of domestic consumer goods, which has also promoted the upgrading of the structure of domestic consumer goods to some extent.
The spokesman of the Ministry of Commerce said at a high summit that nearly one-third of China’s total imports can enjoy the benefits of preferential tariffs in the free trade agreement, most of which are terminal consumer goods, which bring real benefits to consumers.
Further reduce import tariffs on consumer goods
Since December 1, 2017, China has adjusted the import tariffs on some consumer goods and further reduced the import tariffs on consumer goods. The scope covers food, health products, pharmaceuticals, daily chemical products, clothing, shoes, caps, home appliances, culture and entertainment, and general merchandise, and a total of 187 8-digit tariff codes.
The average tax rate for this batch of consumer goods will be reduced from 17.3% to 7.7%, and it will almost be "blocked!"
From January 1, 2018, China has also made some adjustments to other import and export tariffs.
Import tariffs on certain cosmetics, such as lipstick, eye shadow, and perfume, have dropped from 10% to 5%;
After reducing tariffs, it means that consumers do not have to purchase, nor do they have to go overseas to buy favorite foreign products.

Reports: Year-end American store rules vary greatly Shopping returns need to be cautious
China News Service, December 29th
According to the US "World News" report, Christmas just passed, it ushered in the return of the tide.
According to the American Broadcasting Corporation (ABC), more than half of the goods sold on Christmas last year were returned.
In addition, readers have repeatedly defrauded online shopping fraud, consumers need to pay more attention when shopping on informal websites.
In general, large shopping companies have formal and reasonable return procedures, but if you buy gifts or e-commerce from some small stores, you must be careful.
Ms. Hou of Rolandgang bought a coat on December 1st at a special online store that sells printed jackets and spent more than 60 yuan (US dollar, the same below).
She emailed her customer service and she did not reply.
Another netizen broke the news. Last year, he went to the United States to travel and bought a mobile phone from a third-party seller. After he sent it, he discovered that it was a box of plasticine.
After you know that you have been cheated, you can apply for a refund from the website and get a full refund.
However, some customers think that the website refund service is not 100% perfect.
A Northern Californian Chinese resident, Mr. Wang, said that the twice-expedited delivery service to a certain website had an urgent service of four yuan, but both were not delivered on time.
After applying for a refund, no reply was received.
Large shopping malls or shopping malls have better return policies.
Most of Macy’s products are fully refunded within 180 days.
However, the goods must remain "original" and require proof of purchase such as receipts or bank purchase records.
If there is no vouchers, customers can also get mall points that can be used to purchase other products.
Target generally has a 90-day return period for general merchandise, and electronic products usually have 15 days.
However, the return period for electronic and entertainment products purchased from November 1st to December 25th, 2017 will be extended to 30 days.
It should be noted that the 30-day refund period is calculated from December 25th, that is, it must be returned before January 25, 2018.
The ultimate shopping experience, shopping district, a new era of shopping development
More than a decade ago, China was still in the seller's market as a whole. People's choices were limited and their demand was limited.
However, after ten years of development, the market has already achieved a change from the seller's market to the buyer's market. Nowadays, consumers' tastes have become more awkward. They are no longer satisfied with the simple "one-handed, one-handed, one-handed delivery" shopping behavior.
Therefore, how to let consumers get an ultimate shopping experience becomes the next competition point for real estate developers.
Among the many factors that affect the shopping experience of consumers, shopping malls in the shopping district have the most significant impact.
See how city builders everywhere focus on shopping experience.
There are no two identical leaves in the world. There are no two identical shopping centers. A famous shopping center must have its own characteristics.
For example, Turkey's world-famous Kanyon shopping mall, its unique wavy architectural design inspired by the Canyon, Kanonon named homonym, walk in the Kanto Minister 200 meters in the trail as if within the Grand Canyon.
In addition to the canyon-style design, there is also a large oval-shaped performance venue in the center of the shopping center. It has a unique appearance and often features special performances.
Because of the open platform design, tourists can walk on each floor to see the activities in the “canyon” and have the effect of changing the scenery.
In China, the Nanjing Forest Moore Commercial Street, home to China's first forest-style stroll, combines shopping with ecology and fairy tale.
7000 square meters of green space, 3,000 square meters of roof water platform, the project consists of nine single buildings, each building between the corridors, the overall sinking courtyard design, take the top edge of the platanus trees for the construction of the skin, rooftop waters roof, creating a forest-like feel.
Walking into Forest Moore is like accidentally falling into a rabbit hole in Alice in Wonderland. The climbing trunk surrounds the building, and the grass and the clear springs contrast each other, bringing people into a forest full of vigor and vitality.
In addition, the Lijia Waterfront Business District in Chongqing and Longhu has planned hundreds of businesses and plans to introduce more than 50 international top-level monopoly flagship stores, more than 100 international top brands and more than 500 well-known domestic and foreign brands to create a business center with a distinctive service industry clustering and thematic characteristics.
Not only that, Lijia Binshui Shopping District will also integrate ecology into the building, and be guided by TOD public transport, integrating fashion shopping, living services, catering, entertainment, education, and sports. It will bring consumers the ultimate shopping experience while also leading them to enjoy Chongqing's unique “Waterfront Culture”, which will perfectly integrate shopping, water entertainment and leisure.
In summary, it can be found that at present, some real estate companies have learned the trajectory of this new urban business, and people in the industry have stated that this kind of consumption model that focuses on consumer experience and combines shopping and experience will also be the mainstream of urban development in the future.
Today's shopping district is not only a distribution center for goods, but also a comprehensive place integrating art, culture, and creativity. It also carries people's responsibility for urban living.
Therefore, satisfying the one-stop demand for materials for consumers to eat, drink, and play while maximizing the delivery of cultural and artistic multi-level spiritual needs and fulfilling livable residential needs are bound to be the commanding heights for the future development of the commercial circle.
In Chongqing, Guoxing's northern shores are located in Jiangbei, close to Guanyin Bridge, where the world's business elites are gathered, and international giants huddled around. First-class brands gather to connect with international fashion.
Here is a step by step bustling with the best of the world;
Dongwon-Jin Yue has a good shopping environment. Jinyue Dongwon is close to the Nanping shopping district and enjoys a unique four-tiered three-dimensional transportation system in the west and even in the country, which improves shopping comfort.
In addition, Hui Garden Road and Wanda Square, two pedestrian street of the landscaping, landscape and ground floor to raise the file upgrade, planting about 300 trees, renovation shop 40,000 square meters, enhance the image of the Nanping shopping district;
The Longhu Luhu nickname, adjacent to Chongqing's first low-density waterfront business district, Lijia Waterfront Business District, is surrounded by nine parks. The commercial districts are low in density and open to a high degree, making people more willing to stop, stop, and slowly enjoy shopping when shopping, instead of being hurriedly chased by the crowds of people behind them, realizing “walking shopping”.
Today's commercial competition will only become more and more intense. How to win a bloody road in a homogenized market and win the reputation of "holy places for shopping" in the minds of future consumers is worth thinking seriously for all real estate developers.
It is not enough to rely solely on differentiated strategies. Only those developers who truly put consumers in the heart of their lives, worry about the needs of consumers, think about what consumers think, and provide consumers with an ultimate and simple shopping experience can make a comeback in the stormy market.
Of course, in the end, I think the happiest thing is that the people of Chongqing have such a good shopping experience and business district. No one could imagine the prosperity of today.
Festival: Consumerism Carnival Masks Real Environment Prices
168.2 billion yuan, which is November 11, 2017, "Tmall Double 11 Global Carnival" within 24 hours, Tmall users of consumer turnover.
Specifically, after the "Double 11" start, the trade volume of Tmall exceeded 10 billion in just 3 minutes, exceeded 20 billion yuan in 6 minutes and 05 seconds, and exceeded 100 billion in 9 hours.
On this day, the total number of payments made by consumers worldwide through Alipay reached 1.48 billion, an increase of 41% over the previous year.
These consumptions will bring 812 million logistics orders.
Regardless of the online shopping platform of Tmall or Alipay payment platform, all belong to Ma Yun’s Ali Group.
No one would have imagined that ten years ago, on November 11th, the Single Youth's self-mockering creation of the “Album Festival” subculture would be collected by e-commerce and become the phenomenon-level “Double 11” shopping carnival.
On November 11th, 2009, Alibaba.com used the marketing gimmick of “The Singles Festival Big Sale” for the first time: No one fell in love with you. Then “single dog” came to buy online.
The result was surprising. On this day, the transaction volume of Taobao Mall (the predecessor of Tmall) exceeded 52 million yuan, which was 10 times of the daily transaction volume at that time.
Since then, "Double 11" has become a shopping carnival created by Alibaba. From the very beginning, domestic sellers and sellers entertained themselves, and now nine years have passed. Tmall's "Double 11" 100 billion transaction volume is already more than 3,200 times that year, which makes "Black Friday" far behind.
There are many e-commerce companies following the "double 11" promotion of Tmall Cat, of which "Jingdong" is the most powerful.
"Jingdong" has its own shopping festival "6.18", but there is no "Double 11" influence. From November 1 to 11 this year, "Jingdong" cumulative sales reached 127.1 billion yuan.
The "Double 11" is followed by similar "Double 12" discount carnival, Christmas and New Year shopping season.
Across the New Year, Chinese consumers are waiting for the Spring Festival shopping season before the Spring Festival, Valentine's Day shopping, spending, will not leave.
The environmental problems caused by the massive consumption of instants have drawn the attention of professionals and organizations.
According to the Xinhua Daily Telegraph, a conservative estimate based on the usual standard of 0.2 kg per container in the industry, this year's "Double 11" period will generate at least 300,000 tons of garbage.
Liu Hua, director of the Greenpeace East Asia Pollution Prevention and Control Program, told China Dialogue that this year's "Double 11" Tmall orders will generate 160,000 tons of packaging waste.
The State Post Bureau issued a report in 2016 and pointed out that the number of shipments during the “Double 11” period (November 11-16) in 2015 was about 780 million pieces, using more than 3 billion woven bags, 9.922 million boxes, and 16.985 billion meters of tape. The length of the tape can be 425 turns around the Earth’s equator.
This year, the State Post Bureau expects that the "Double 11" express shipments will exceed 1.5 billion.
Wang Shi, a manager of a waste incineration center in Beijing, told Xinhua News Agency that after the “Double 11”, more than 2,000 tons of rubbish came in daily, which also exceeded the incineration station's processing capacity.
The courier company has realized that the environmental pollution caused by the express delivery industry cannot be ignored.
Some e-commerce logistics companies, including Suning, launched a recyclable plastic express box, a recyclable bag that can be used as a shopping bag and a garbage bag before the “Double 11′′, but consumers who are in trouble have a low degree of acceptance.
Ma Yun also called on the logistics industry to support "green packaging" and "green logistics."
This Weibo harvested more than 68,000 "likes."
What kind of mobile payment does German want?
Zhang Dongfang: The mobile payment war opened in Germany is not expected.
WeChat Payment and Alipay can only move the battlefield to Europe. The competitors haven't changed and the position hasn't changed - Chinese people. Is this globalization?
Where there is Alipay, there must be WeChat payment.
In accordance with the agreement with the German electronic payment service provider Wirecard, WeChat Payment officially started landing in Germany in November this year, and gradually in the European range of business layout.
The reunion of the two "hometowns" took place in Europe.
All along, Alipay and WeChat Payment have been singing along the way of globalization.
Regarding the globalization of mobile payment in China, iResearch “China's third-party mobile payment industry research report 2017” is summarized in two ways: First, through strategic investment, experience export, and equity participation and support of foreign mobile payment companies.
The second is to promote mobile payment services to foreign merchants through Chinese tourists’ spending abroad, and then change the perception and acceptance of China’s mobile payments from foreign countries.
Indeed, Chinese people have the world.
With China’s rapid economic development and the large population base, the spending of Chinese tourists in Europe is an attractive figure.
However, it is also doomed that the China Mobile payment war opened in Germany this time is not expected.
WeChat Payment and Alipay only moved the battlefield to Europe. The competitors did not change. The position they captured was still the same - still Chinese. Is this also global?
A more pioneering discussion is whether China's mobile payments can be exploited in Europe.
Take Germany as an example.
Enchanted "new retail"
Chen Yulei and Yang Kaihan: Amazon announced its entry into bookstores and grocery stores as it squeezed into the top ten retailers in the world. Both timing and motivation are worth pondering.
In November 2015, Amazon opened its first physical bookstore in Seattle and later opened two bookstores in Portland and San Diego.
At the beginning of 2017, Amazon opened stores in New York and plans to have at least eight stores by the end of the year.
Almost at the same time, Amazon announced the trial operation of its own Amazon Go, customers do not need to line up to the store, do not need to check out, enter the door to scan the code, take the desired product to leave, the amount of shopping will be automatically deducted from the customer's Amazon account.
As far as Amazon is concerned, it's very surprising that in recent years it has suddenly been working on physical stores.
Because as early as in 2007 to the shareholders open letter, CEO Jeff Bezos stressed that Amazon will not easily open physical stores, unless at the same time meet the following four conditions:
1. We must be convinced that this new opportunity can make shareholders' investment return;
2. We must make sure that this new opportunity is of great significance to the entire company;
3. We must be convinced that this new opportunity is ignored by the market;
4. We must make sure that in this market, we have enough resources to make customer-oriented differentiation.
Bookstores and grocery stores are the most shaky classifications of two physical retails and the first to fall after the rise of Amazon.
Amazon has announced its entry into these two physical markets as it squeezes into the top ten retailers in the world, regardless of timing or motivation.
Does Amazon's approach violate the guarantee in the shareholders' letter?
A similar sound was heard on the other side of the globe.On the morning of October 13, 2016, at the Yunqi Conference in Hangzhou in 2016, Chairman Ma Yun of Alibaba’s board of directors delivered a keynote speech.
He said: "Since next year, Alibaba will no longer mention the term "e-commerce."
The era of pure e-commerce will soon come to an end. There will be no e-commerce in the next 10 or 20 years. Instead, it will be ‘new retail’.
The combination of online and offline and logistics will produce new retail."
For a time, the words "new retail" were as if they were enchanted, and they were frequently held by industry professionals.
But what does "new retail" mean?
If you only refer to the combination of online and offline, then this concept is not new.
In 2016, after eMarketer tracked the 180 largest e-commerce companies, it was estimated that e-commerce sales totaled approximately 200 billion U.S. dollars, of which the largest 25 accounted for more than 159 billion U.S. dollars.
Of these 25 companies, 18 are traditional retailers that started online in the past five years (such as Macy's, Nordstrom, Target, Gap, etc.).
The Alibaba Group’s shareholding of Suning Cloud Trading Co., Ltd. is worth 28.3 billion yuan.
Globally, retailers and e-commerce are shifting from single channels to omni-channel retail systems covering physical stores, e-commerce, mobile and social media.
Is Ma Yunti's "New Retail" more of a summary than an outlook for the future?
If not, what is the difference between the concept of omnichannel and "new retail"?
Perhaps the key to the problem is not whether it will be merged online and offline, but how to merge.
Looking back at the retail industry for the past 20 years, the rise of e-commerce, like the rise of discount retailers in the early years, has focused on price and convenience.
Relying on these two pain points, e-commerce has moved products with very high standardization, such as books and CDs, from offline to online.
With the development of online spending habits and the continuous improvement of customer experience, e-commerce has extended its reach to other categories, and began to increase efficiency.
In the words of Alibaba CEO Zhang Yong, “Using the Internet's ideas and technologies to comprehensively reform and upgrade the existing total of about 30 trillion social retailers, making Chinese consumers' increasingly escalating consumer demand can be effectively met, making the entire process of product production, distribution, and service more efficient because of the widespread use of the Internet and big data.”
Therefore, the e-commerce road is a road with light assets and actual heavy assets.
“Light” refers to the fact that the burden on fixed assets, staffing, and management processes is not as large as in the traditional retail industry; “heavy” refers to the huge investment in logistics and warehousing.
The change of logistics methods ensures the high efficiency of e-commerce.
According to the news of the Chinese government network, Premier Li Keqiang presided over the executive meeting of the State Council on April 28. The meeting held that expanding domestic consumer demand is an important measure for steady growth and structural adjustment.
The meeting confirmed that the relevant departments should step up their efforts to come up with concrete plans on the basis of scientific assessment.
For domestic consumer goods with large domestic consumer demand, trials to reduce import tariffs will be launched before the end of June this year, and the range of tax-deductible goods will be gradually expanded.
In combination with the taxation reform, we will improve the consumption tax policy for popular consumer goods such as apparel and cosmetics, and make overall adjustments to the scope of taxation, taxation rate, and levy.
Adding and rehabilitating port entry duty-free shops, rationally expanding tax-exempt varieties, and increasing a certain amount of tax-free shopping amount to facilitate domestic consumers to purchase foreign products in China;
Further promote the customs clearance and tax rebate facilitation of overseas tourists, and strictly implement the requirements for the active declaration of taxation of imported goods according to law.
Formulate inspection and quarantine policies to support the import of cross-border e-commerce, and clean up unreasonable charges in the import process;
Accelerate the promotion of China's product brand promotion project, support physical store development, and achieve online and offline interaction.
Regulate the market order, crack down on counterfeiting, and promote the survival of the fittest.
Make consumers comfortable and convenient shopping.

On January 18, Alibaba convened the e-business Summit on Poverty Alleviation in Chongqing, announcing that it will help lift precision and rural revitalization through the exploration of a new model of “Internet Plus Poverty Alleviation”.
This is after Ali's rural strategy has been launched, the rural Taobao project has been launched, the poverty alleviation platform has been launched on the line, and the Alibaba Poverty Alleviation Fund has been established. Ali is once again “adding weight” to poverty alleviation.
Poverty alleviation is one of China’s most important national strategies.
All-out poverty has never been realized in China in the past few thousand years.
“E-business poverty alleviation is a new round of poverty-relief development and an important measure to achieve accurate poverty alleviation and accurate poverty alleviation.
The Central Government attaches great importance to and points out that the Internet can play a role in boosting poverty alleviation, promote precision poverty alleviation, get rid of poverty precisely, and let agricultural products go out of the country through the Internet."
As a result, Ali proposed a rural strategy as early as 2014, and tied with big data cloud computing and globalization as Ali's three core strategies for the next 20 years.
In the same year, Ali launched the rural Taobao (Village Amoy) project and recruited “Village Xiao Er” in the village to lead farmers to get rid of poverty through e-commerce.
In 2017, Ali collaborated with the business sector to create a poverty alleviation channel for agriculture and agriculture. Currently, it has accumulated access to 13 provinces in the country and 120 state-level poverty-stricken counties.
There are 2,118 Taobao villages spawned by Ali platform.
Of these, close to 400 were in impoverished counties in the province and 33 in poor counties in 13 countries.
In 2017, on the Alibaba China retail platform, the national Taobao Village sales reached 120 billion yuan.
Zhang Yong stated that in the face of the national strategy to fight poverty, Alibaba has been thinking about how to make good use of innovation capabilities such as science and technology, big data, and cloud computing in Alibaba's economy to create a new path for poverty alleviation.
Among them, Murakami is the main carrier platform for Alibaba's e-commerce business to get rid of poverty, and has taken a direct link to the Internet to get rid of poverty.
In the planting process, Murakami and Ant Financial jointly implemented agricultural assets, farm tools, and microfinance support.
In 2017, among 832 state-level poor counties, Ant Financial Services had served 795 and provided them with convenient payment and credit services.
Rookie solves warehousing and logistics, Tmall is responsible for sales, Alibaba Cloud's big data feeds to guide agricultural production, and further improves the supply standards, quality and market competitiveness of agricultural products.
The development of e-commerce out of poverty requires not only products, sales channels, and industrial planning, but also talent.
Ali set up e-commerce courses through Taobao University, taught farmers the methods of standardization, quality, and large-scale planting, and realized the combination of “helping the poor and helping the mind” so that farmers could continue to lift themselves out of poverty.
These courses already cover about 92% of the country's poor counties.
The “philanthropy mentality, business methods” approach to poverty alleviation can also guarantee Ali’s “really help the poor” when helping the poor.
Ma Yun, Chairman of Alibaba's Board of Directors, said that the eradication of poverty should be divided into three phases: poverty alleviation, poverty alleviation, and getting rich.
Poverty alleviation is to grant people fish, poverty alleviation is to grant people fish, and enrichment is to create a “fish pond” for farmers so that farmers can have fish.
The industry-led poverty alleviation is the creation of fish ponds.
In the industrial poverty alleviation, the Luoyang apple industry poverty alleviation model created by Ali and Shaanxi Luochuan has been replicated and promoted by relevant departments as an example.
Alibaba's e-commerce poverty alleviation work has also been recognized by decision makers.
The e-commerce company represented by Alibaba had been addressed, through online and offline channels, to ensure that farmers increase production and income.
Some village juniors and ants financial staff were also invited to the United Nations and Africa to share their experience in e-commerce poverty eradication.
At present, the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) China Office has been working with Murakami to carry out poverty alleviation in the e-commerce industry in Anhui and other places.
Sina Financial News The 3rd New Economy Think Tank Conference jointly organized by Alibaba Research Institute and China Foresight Think Tank was held on January 16. Zhang Li, Director of the Institute of Electronic Commerce of the Ministry of Commerce attended and spoke.
She believes that our globalization actually ignores the most important issues, that is, the problems of the body and use of globalization, as well as the stage of globalization.
Many people like this to think that globalization has stagnated, and that many developed and developing countries have different attitudes towards globalization in the new stage and they are different from the model.
The second concept is the question of the mid-term phase of globalization. What are the constraints on the mid-term phase of globalization?
Due to the constraints of the economic environment, it is precisely because of changes in the economic base that globalization has occurred.
Zhang Li believes that by the end of 2017, the global economic adjustment will basically end. After 2018, it will enter a new round of growth. The next round of growth must be driven by raw products.
Jingdong's first fresh supermarket, 7FRESH, officially opened in the near future and plans to lay out more than 1,000 stores throughout the country in the next three to five years.
Coupled with Ali's boxma freshman, Yonghui's super species, Su Ning's Su Zaisheng, and the U.S. group's fresh palm fish, the "new retail outlets" have begun to take root, and they have "muted" each other in innovative models and prices.
The escalation of competition in fresh supermarkets has become a phenomenon-level topic in the new retail sector. Where is the new retail in the end?
"We will quickly enter the country in 2018. We will have a lot of shops in Beijing, Shanghai and Hangzhou before the Spring Festival."
Box Ma Xiansheng CEO Hou Yi disclosed the "new style of play" in 2018 at the second new retail summit on the 10th.
"Beginning in 2018, Boxma is not just a fresh e-commerce provider, but an e-commerce supplier that meets consumers' immediate needs.
Under the core model line is drainage, experience, online is a real sale."
Different from traditional hypermarkets and supermarkets, box horse fresh produce is a fun and delicious “net red shop” in the eyes of many consumers, and even some intermediary agencies have played out the concept of “box area room”.
Online e-commerce platforms and offline retailers have their own advantages and disadvantages. Consumers are appearing in multiple channels, so both parties are trying omni-channel models.
The industry believes that in the context of consumption upgrades, the number of “box-like horses” stores will increase in 2018.
However, from the initial fresh life, Boxma continues to explore more consumption areas, indicating that in the new year, the retail market will see more innovations.
"For example, the combination of online and offline business models has attracted the attention of consumers. Fresh supermarkets around the world are known and applauded."
"But these relationships are more talked about. It doesn't help to use them again. Finally, it is determined whether or not you have brought a good experience to consumers. I will only be willing to pay when I experience it."
According to Yuan Bin, CEO of RT-Mart Feiniu Network, under the new retail environment, consumer habits have changed, and buying needs have also changed.
The original pure line and the offline line are split. The line must be defeated. The line must be counterattacked. Now it is hand in hand because consumers have no distinction between online and offline.
With the capital's rush into the game, the new retail gunpowder represented by fresh supermarkets is full of flavor.
According to the analysis, at present, the competition in the first-tier cities of new retail is still far from the pattern of the Red Sea, and there are still a large number of second-tier cities yet to be excavated. The market still has great opportunities and space.
Different types of industries will bring new retail development into a diversified state of development for the new retail layout.
The CCTV Financial Channel and the Institute of Financial Strategy of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences have combed a dry product for everyone. This is the annual report on the development of the heavy-duty Chinese e-commerce business.
In the past year, what kind of report card has China E-commerce out?
What are the development trends of global e-commerce?
Let us announce for everyone.
Total sales volume and then record growth rate
Since 2006, China's online retail sales can be said to have been growing at a very high speed. It is estimated that online shopping is very fresh at that time and it can be bought without going out. It's so cool!
However, since 2013, the growth rate of online retail sales has dropped below 50%. In 2015, the growth rate was lower than 40% for the first time. In 2016, the growth rate actually became 26.2%.
However, this year's situation is not the same. The amount of online retail sales has reaccelerated. From January to September this year, the growth rate has rebounded to 34.2%.
It is much higher than the growth rates of 2015 and 2016.
Maybe everyone in the outer circle around, found that buying or buying more people feel physically and mentally.
Among them, the online retail sales of physical goods were nearly 5.08 trillion yuan, and the online retail sales of services were nearly 1.49 trillion yuan.
The proportion of total retail sales of social goods reached 13.6%, an increase of nearly 3% year-on-year.
Students, do not sleep, focus, service online retail is definitely a big hero ah!
Second, the French netizens who love to pick their hands, the per capita net purchase amount is 1925 US dollars, and the goods they purchase the most online is clothing, is worthy of love of fashion country.
Who loves online shopping must be young people?
Helps you avoid the company becoming the next Uber start-up company
Amy Erett had wanted to investigate employee happiness in her e-commerce startup, but the investigation was useless.
The replies received are often unclear, unhelpful, and even worse, deceptive responses.
Even if she promises to use anonymity, some employees still do not trust this process.
Elrett is responsible for managing Madison Reed, a 75-person San Francisco e-commerce hair care company. She stated that "the response received lacks consistency and objectivity."
So she called for help.
A number of new human resources startups have sprung up to help companies understand employees' feelings.
They build and license software specifically designed to measure employee engagement, allowing companies to quickly conduct opinion polls for specific teams and demographic groups, provide employees with anonymity and complaint hotlines, and, in some cases, allow reporters to report directly to the board around executives.
"Now, you can track your health with tools like Strava and Fitbit, but where is the company's Fitbit?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and CEO of Redwood City startup Glint. The Glint software analysis tool is used by companies to measure employee engagement.
Erett said that in three years she used Glint to gain more insights into the employees’ thoughts and feelings.
In addition to the quick surveys and opinion polls of specific teams, Glint also provided company heat maps, which units had the most complaints, and which managers had low approval scores at a glance – which enabled her to understand the reasons in depth.
Companies are beginning to realize that they must master the company's workplace culture so as not to become the next Uber. Previous employees of Uber had previously published a blog post describing the harassment environment. These speakers were punished by the company and Uber entered a scandal.
For start-up companies like Glint, the company’s desire for supervision is a fortuitous business opportunity.
According to the financial technology analysis site Let's Talk Payments, by 2020, the value of the global governance, regulatory, and compliance industries may exceed $118.7 billion.
Convercent, a start-up in Denver, Colorado, is dedicated to helping companies prevent and detect bad behavior. During the period when Uber's reputation was damaged earlier this year, they saw an increase in interest and activity in this area.
Convercent has nearly 600 customers, including Airbnb, Microsoft, and Tesla.
Uber recently signed up as a customer.
Like Glint, Convercent allows companies to send customized “diagnostic” surveys, collect confidential responses in real time, and view heat maps of their problem areas.
Convercent also provides an anonymous SMS hotline to allow employees to report bad behavior.
If the chairman is implicated, the complaint will go directly to the board of directors.
Patrick Quinlan, Convercent’s founder and CEO, stated: “The public opinion court has usurped the authority of the regulator.
If a company is found to be treating employees improperly or unethical about their performance, the company may face the high consequences of consumer boycotts, employee loss, and involvement in litigation, even if the regulator does not intervene, Quinlan said.
Ruby Tuesday, a restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees across more than 500 locations, has used Convercent for more than a year to ensure that employees understand work guidelines and work procedures and provide easy access to corporate headquarters.
Prior to this, if an employee wanted to report a problem, he had to find the company headquarters phone number or e-mail, make a formal complaint, and hope that the headquarters can take this seriously.
This is often a fearful and uncomfortable experience. James Vitratra, general counsel of Ruby Tuesday, said that he does not think there is a good way to track employee complaints.
But now that the company uses Convercent, it can quickly find and resolve issues that were previously unknown to senior executives in distant offices, cities, or states—such as discrimination, harassment, or unfair wage behavior.
“I can understand the work experience more closely and 360-degrees,” said Vittrarno, who is in charge of the Ruby Tuesday risk management team.
"We are protecting our shareholders from employment lawsuits."
Quinlan said that since Andorra’s accounting firm collapsed due to violations of the ethics regulations due to the Enron scandal, companies began to pay more attention to ethics, values, and employee engagement since 2002.
But it wasn’t until after “social media got into their own world” that companies realized that they couldn't stop their viral spread on the Internet.
"Before using technology to monitor ethics, people see hope as a strategy," he said.
Both Glint and Convercent offer their software as a service and charge each company for the recurring cost of product use.
This business model and business opportunities are supported by venture investors who have already provided support for these two start-up companies.
In February, Convercent raised $10 million from companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, and its total capital increased to $47 million.
In November, Glint received $10 million in funding from Bessemer Venture Partners and its total funding reached $60 million.
Given the interconnectedness of companies, culture, and venture capital, these investments are hardly surprising.
More and more research shows that today's employees have higher expectations of the workplace than before.
In a highly competitive market like Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are just bets.
Employees want to feel that they are accepted, valued, and feel that their time is spent on a company with a positive mission.
“When people are happy to join the company, feel their voices heard, and the work they do is beneficial, they will be more committed to making the company successful,” said Nina McCartney, vice president of global welfare and employee experience at LinkedIn, which uses both Convercent and Glint software.
Investors realize returns when their portfolio companies perform well; companies perform well when employees are loyal and dedicated.
If third-party analysis tools promise to increase employee loyalty and engagement, it's not surprising that they will seek financial support.
Workplace culture experts said that it is very important to have employee engagement data.
However, unless the company's administrator takes action, this data is useless.
In fact, if a company requires employees to provide feedback, it can be expected that the company is undergoing change.
If the change is not progressing fast enough, or if there is no progress, it may lead to disappointment and cause employees to leave the company.
Russell Rath, head of consulting at business management company Kurt International, said: “If you want to seek 4,000 recommendations, then you need to be ready for 4000 conversations.” He has seen some companies rely too much on data collection errors.
"Because if you don't follow up, the staff will think, ‘Did you really hear what I said?
Do you care?
If you don't care, why should I care?”
Errett said that Madison Reed now conducts a monthly employee survey and has been able to take action on the day that Glint reported the issue.
After gathering feedback from employees about their frustration with decision-making speed and quality of communication, she was able to solve the problem by reorganizing the company's internal team and increasing communication training.
Ruby Tuesday is getting new insights from its employees. In the long run, they hope to be able to make changes in this industry that is known for its high rate of brain drain, and to better retain employees.
"If you are not committed to creating a transparent culture, you will lose talent," said Vitrino.
"If you lose talent, you will lose customers.
And when you lose customers, you will lose the company."

NCAA cancels twice-a-day training to extend Bears’ daytime training time
Near 11 pm, the UCLA football team chats next to the team's new campus driving range.
Some players have taken off their jerseys to reveal the sweaty body after training camp on the first day of hard training.
For a large part of the team, this idle few minutes is a break.
Players taking summer courses will return to the dormitory for the final exam after three hours of practice, and then return to the Wasserman Soccer Center at 6:30 in the morning to attend the meeting.
"The next three days are a match for these guys," Bears coach Jim Mora said on Monday as he approached Tuesday.
The NCAA canceled two exercises per day (to reduce the burden on the players), but actually lengthened their training time during the day - at least until the end of Friday.
This is why the first three training sessions at UCLA are scheduled to begin at 7:15 PM to accommodate the time-frame for the players to be congested.
From canceling twice-a-day training to more once-a-day training, the Bears began training almost one week before last season. Mora trained for the first time in summer school during the six seasons at Westwood.
They plan to start 18 games from August 20th, and then begin pre-game preparations for the first game of the Texas start-up in September.
Mora said that he supports the adjustment of the NCAA rules, although this will increase the busy schedule of the player to another project.
"We will give them a huge amount of training in three or four days. It is very challenging," Mora said.
"They have just passed. They are hone. They are great kids.
I thought about Saturday, we would have more time, really great."
At the end of the training camp, UCLA will stop training, which is not an easy task considering the proximity of the parking lot and the Luskin Center.The Luskin Center Premium Hotel has been thrown across the football after the goal post.
Beginning this weekend, the Bears will be staying at the hotel, but Mora admitted that once these rooms are empty during the season, problems may arise.
"We will take security measures," Mora said.
“This is a really worrying issue. It is not far-fetched to think that someone may rent a room and sit in a room and record a training scenario.
If you have a videotape, it's pretty good.
However, we will take security measures there, and we will also take security measures in parking lot 8.
We will use our existing resources to do our best.
I will not worry too much about this.
We have a plan in place."
According to Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) data, in the second quarter of this year, the value of Australian homes rose by an average of 1.5% to 2%, an increase of 3.5% year-on-year, the lowest annual increase rate since March 2013.
Just as real estate agents look forward to selling more properties during the holiday season, Australia’s house price growth has been the lowest since 2013.
IT Home reported in the morning that the Wall Street Journal reported that AT&T has cancelled plans to sell Huawei's new flagship smartphone in the United States.
Huawei originally planned to announce the partnership at CES this week. AT&T canceled this cooperation at the last moment.
In response to this situation, Huawei responded to the Xinhua News Agency reporter on January 9 that on January 9th, US local time, Huawei will release new products and specific listing information to the US market.
Huawei stated that in the past five years, Huawei has proved its strength by launching high-end products in global and US markets.
According to the IT home’s previous report, Huawei will release a “best mobile phone you’ve ever heard” at the CES exhibition in Las Vegas on the afternoon of January 9, and the battery’s endurance can support two days of use.
The industry generally believes that Huawei’s upcoming flagship phone is Huawei’s Mate 10 Pro with Android Oreo.
Yangcheng Evening News reporter Wang Li is led by Fan Bingbing. Guo Tao, Dapeng, Zhang Jiaying and other films starring I'm Not Pan Jinlian will be released nationwide on September 30th.
Yesterday, the film held a "comedy sad" theme seminar in Beijing, and Feng Xiaogang, Ning Hao and Dapeng attended the event.
Alternate composition circle, the director is the special nature of the wayward "I'm not Pan Jinlian", is the composition of radius alternately, especially the round picture shot with a mask lens is very fresh.
Feng Xiaogang explained: “This theme is similar to Zhang Qimou’s film “The Story of Qiu Ju”. It is easy for everyone to think of it together. I think about how to shoot it in a way that everyone has never used. In fact, there is no special idea, that is, it is fun and I want to do something special.”
Feng Xiaogang said that he used his work as a debut, learned how to take a circular picture with the photographer, and even spent millions of dollars for the photographer to take a 10-minute test.
Facebook will launch fact check function to fight fake news
Facebook announced on Thursday that it will send more potential mischief articles to third-party testing agencies and display test results under the original posts Facebook, the world’s largest online social network, is trying to combat so-called fake news.
In a statement on its website, Facebook stated that Facebook will start using the updated machine to learn to detect possible mischiefs and send it to the fact checker, and may show the fact check results below the original post.
Facebook was criticized as one of the main transmission points for so-called fake news. Many people think that Facebook has influenced the 2016 US presidential election.
This issue has also become a major political issue in Europe. Before the presidential election in France in May, the voters suffered a flood of false stories. Germany was the first to support the penalty plan before the September election. If the social media network fails to remove the hate post in time, it will be fined.
In a separate statement on Thursday in Germany, Facebook stated that it is launching a new fact-checking function test in the United States, France, the Netherlands, and Germany.
Sarah Sue, product manager of Facebook news feeds, said in a blog post: “In addition to seeing which stories are questioned by third-party factual inspectors, people also hope to have more backgrounds to help them make informed decisions about what they read and share.
She added that Facebook will continue to test its "related articles" feature and make other changes to its news feed to reduce false news.
Creating a Drawing Fiction: The Story of an English Castle
Recently, the small Scotty Castle became the protagonist in a compressed version of the music film and was once a refuge for Madame Margaret Thatcher during the 1970s and 1980s.
But Scottie witnessed 700 years of turbulent history in the cozy position of the Baylor River Canyon in Kent. Now it is a source of inspiration for Jamie Rhodes (a Yorkshire native who has a special interest in historical documents and has a mop head).
“You can see the handwriting of 300 years ago by the ancients. I found it really beautiful,” he said with a longing.
"What kind of interpersonal relationship can make this letter fall into my hands."
Over the Middle Ages until the Edwardian era, the “An English Castle” readership recorded the families living in Scottney. Each story was made by different British future artists such as Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer, and Isabel Greenberg.
This is not Rhodes's first book based on archives. He also wrote "The Teeth and Other Stories of the Dead 2014", a book inspired by British library literature. It was a work that he accomplished with uncontrollable creative passion.
He said: "I can't suppress my writing impulse from the moment I see the thumbprint left on the side of the letter. It was written by a double agent who worked for the Jacobs in the 18th century."
"That's his fingerprint!
And the letters have always smelled of smoke, because at that time, you need to ignite to have light.
For us 300 years later, this smell makes people feel that they are also around us.
Hey, I like archives!"
For those who are impressed by old papers, they can get the support of the National Trust and Arts Council of England and live in the castle for nearly four months (“To tell the truth, I stayed for a long time”). It seems to be awesome and I don’t believe it is true.
Rhodes spent several days visiting Victoria's "new" castle, looking through the archives, studying the estate's many treasures and antiques, such as the dog's head hanging on the wall, and the centuries-old bottle in the moat.
He wandered over the land and ruins of the old castle, chatted with wanderers, gardeners, and sometimes with the artist who drew illustrations in his book.
Then at night, he would "drink whiskey and write."
The hidden history of Scotty is not yet clear, because the National Trust only entered fully after the death of Elizabeth Hershey, the last successor in 2006.
Ten years later, when Rhodes arrived, the staff began to process the files. He described them as "Hundreds of years ago the nobles were leaving: "Oh, put it in the attic."
The diary, letters from the British Empire, and maps depicting the boundaries of various countries: “You would think that land disputes would be boring,” Rhodes said. “But there will be two families who will fight for a silver birch.
Let it go, guys!"
Some of the stories in this work use the castle as a starting point to study the history of the UK in a broader way, including The Labourer. The story is based on a man who left the new castle to participate in the 1381 peasant uprising.
“The story of the book Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex” records a riot in the castle in 1380, says Rhodes.
“The peasant uprising began in that area, and I think it is a good place to start an uprising.
Maybe this is related to the two?"
Other stories are deeply rooted in the history of the castle, such as The Priest, which tells the story of the Darrell family hiding a Jesuit minister for seven years during the British Reformation.
Or "The Smuggler", the hero of the story is the 18th-century smuggler Arthur Darrell, who was thought to have given himself a funeral by filling his coffins with stones (people discovered when his coffin came out of the ground a few years later).
The Darrells is Lodz's favorite castle family of Scottney: "These gentlemen seem to be rogue. They always borrow money and spend money on what they can't afford.
Generations of Darel men solved their debt problems by marrying wealthy old women. I think they should be a group of handsome young men who know how to pursue women."
With the end of his mission in the castle, Rhodes began to look for other strange writing experiences.
He spent two weeks in the Finnish wilderness to complete a graphic novel about “El?¤m?¤nm?¤ki”, a sanatorium in the early 20th century that was later slowly abandoned.
But Scotty has a special place for him.
"I am sad to leave," he said.
"It's like: 'Hey, I have to face the real life of the loaf.'"

Large-scale energy companies are all "rich and can be enemy", then among the world's many energy companies, who pays the most?
Yesterday, the famous PFC energy company announced the top 50 listed energy companies in 2011. US oil and gas producer Exxon Mobil retired with a market value of 406.3 billion US dollars, followed by PetroChina and Royal Dutch Shell.
In the PFC's list, PetroChina had twice won in both 2007 and 2009. All other years were topped by ExxonMobil.
In the top 50 list of 2011, there were 3 companies from mainland China. In addition to No. 2 PetroChina, there are also No. 9 Sinopec and No. 15 CNOOC.
According to PFC statistics, although current oil prices are much higher than they were four years ago, PFC Energy's CEO pointed out that there are many reasons for the low total market value, including the decline in natural gas prices in North America and the low activity in the global stock market.
According to the Xinhua News Agency, heavy pollution from the 16th in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region and the surrounding areas was further exacerbated on the 19th. The AQIs in Shijiazhuang, Xinji, and Handan City of Hebei Province appeared to be “burst”.
U.S. Modification of Green Card Regulations
The media quoted President Donald Trump as saying that the United States will launch a new resettlement plan and amend the green card regulations.
The plan is intended to reduce legal immigration to 50,000 per year. Temporary work visas and family-oriented visa applications are subject to stricter restrictions.
The new rules were proposed by the Republican Party and supported by the President.
The draft law will be discussed in the two chambers.
U.S. media quoted Trump as saying: “This law will reduce poverty, raise wages, save taxpayers billions of dollars, and realize the above benefits by changing the way the United States issues green cards to citizens of other countries.
The law will replace the current program and reduce chain immigration.
This new application process is conducive to applicants who speak English, have financial support, and have skills in economic development."
On May 29, the first China Fireworks and Firecrackers Safety and Environmental Protection Expo will be held in Liuyang.
The event will be held around the theme of “Science, Security, and Environmental Protection” for a period of two days, at which time the most advanced firework machinery, the most safety and environmental protection of fireworks and raw materials, and new products will be gathered in Liuyang.
The expo will invite a large number of experts and entrepreneurs to carry out academic exchanges in the fireworks and fireworks industry and share the latest technological achievements in the safety and environmental protection of fireworks and firecrackers.
Among them, the display of fireworks and firecrackers' mechanized production equipment and safety and environmental protection products will be held in Dayao Town. The major exhibitors include safe and environment-friendly personal lighting products such as fireworks, firecrackers and related technology equipments with mature technology, relevant technology identification and safe demonstration, low-intensity, low-explosive energy and other safe pyrotechnics.
At the same time, the display of safety and environmental protection products of fireworks and firecrackers collectively undertaken by 16 fireworks enterprises in Liuyang is divided into two stages: product selection and product display. The outstanding new products that have been selected in the early stage will be displayed on the evening of May 29 at the fireworks display area in Liuzhou City.
When referring to the upcoming 2017, Zhao Lei frankly stated, “I would like to clear myself after the tour next year and then make a good preparation and write more new works.”
In order to optimize the scenic environment and build beautiful Nanyue, the "636" volunteer service team of the Nanyue District Tobacco Special Bureau (subsidiary) recently launched the environmental protection activities of "mountain care, forest protection and home care".
The activity not only received the support of all the cadres and workers of the District Tobacco Bureau, but also attracted retired veteran cadres and family members of the employees to participate in environmental protection practices together. Three generations of young and young people made concerted efforts to climb forests and clean up rubbish, contributing their own strength to the construction of “Beautiful Nanyue”.
This voluntary service activity aims to protect the scenic resources of Nanyue and promote the volunteer service concept of “loving others, caring for the society, and caring for nature”. It also allows the next generation to learn from childhood and inherit the virtues of voluntary service.
It is reported that since the “636” volunteer service team was established in early April of this year, it has developed a total of 16 members and has successively launched a series of volunteer service activities such as visiting the retail customers, helping tobacco farmers to care for tobacco, and Yaan Earthquake loving donations, and becoming a voluntary force to send positive energy.

Sex robots are on the rise, but we should be careful
Just when you think that 2017 will not be more strange, the field of sex robots has released a new technology development report.
Yes, it is.
Sex robots are a big deal right now.
Recently, the Responsible Robots Foundation (FRR) released a report that looks forward to the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years.
According to Noel Sharkey, professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of FRR, we need to start taking seriously the rise of sex robots.
The customer can choose the robot's eye color, nipple shape and nail type.
Sharkey said when the new report was released: "People laugh at the back, but major companies do launch many sex robots and we will see more."
Modern sex dolls have evolved from inflatable dolls to robots. They have silicone skin that feels warm and deliberately uses artificial intelligence to set human-like sexual responses.
Users can also “customize” their robots to suit their preferences, from eye color, nipple shape to fingernail type or color.
But even more disturbing is that many robots with "personality" will make "copying a pretty wife" look very advanced.
Modern sex toys have evolved into robots with silicone skin.
For example, RealBotix robots can be customized based on what the user considers attractive, such as shyness.
There are also Roxxxy Gold sex robots developed by True Companion that can pre-set personality traits, including the slightly shy "Fantastic Fara" and "Adventure" of "Wild Wendy."
"The Roxxxy Gold robot has the personality that matches you as much as possible," True Companion's website relished.
So she loves what you love, and she hates what you do.
She also had small emotions in the same days as normal people!
She can be lazy, talkative, or ‘sexy’!”
The rise of sex robots has caused a lot of unease—not just to replace real human relationships—but the despicable female traits and rape cuddling in the cold (interpreted as: resisting) Farah are the most worrisome.
True Companion compares Roxxxy to men's vibrators on their website.
The site said "If women have vibrators, why can't men have Roxxxy?"
However, these sex robots are not a simple fetish, nor are they just sex toys.
Their emergence and maturity are directed at the darker, deeper parts of our culture: fleeing from perfect gender equality, to sexual favor with surrender as an additional option.
Of course most men don’t have sex robots, and while FRR points out that sex robots are becoming more popular, they are still on the edge of consumer culture.
But what infiltrates from the edge allows us to see the process of our times.
Many people are not surprised or aggressive, until the free market gives them a chance to become so.
These sophisticated sex robots appear in an era when the rights of a global woman are threatened. It is no coincidence that there is a president of the White House who boasts of sexual violence against women.
The most chilling part of the TV series “The Story of the Maid” is not the realistic picture. It is not the hanging body. It is not the pair of eyes that have been excavated. It is the overly real imagination.
The Republic of Kiribati is a jump, but now it looks like this is not far away.
The goal behind these sex robots is to do everything possible to create the body that is most similar to a real woman (though it is based on the proportion of porn stars).
The creators of these robots want them to have human touch and imitate real human movements.
But to put it bluntly, their "personality" does not represent real women.
They cannot break up or leave.
They have no follow-ups and no follow-up stories. They have no independence at all, nor are they likely to break the illusion of complete slavery.
In other words, they are slaves of love.
Or press the popular saying in 2017: Maid.
“The Great Wall” tells the story of an ancient Chinese elite force defending humanity and fighting a monster on the world-famous Great Wall.
The last period of the fourth quarter of "The Brothers Running" has been recorded. Deng Chao, the captain of the "Runner Boy" team, received the Shenyang Evening News and the WeChat interview of the Shenyang Network reporter on May 30th. From the "study of tyrants" in "Run Men" to the "Hilarious Villains" in "Rabbit Angels" and to the "Decadent Man" by Chen Mo, Deng Chao's impression of the audience is like a "variety of stars", which constantly changes.
Deng Chao said, "In the performance, I will not do the same thing and I must keep updating it."
Trump's great achievements?
Let Mitt Romney be the epitome of common sense
Political differences have brought about the polarization of American voters, and from a microscopic point of view, they have destroyed American family harmony, which is not surprising for the Trump era.
Before and after Christmas and Thanksgiving, the major newspapers in the United States were filled with comments on how to deal with the fear of voting for Trump's relatives.
It is generally believed that we are trying our best to pierce our "filter bubble".
Less commented on Trump's ability to unite his family.
I mentioned this because of my cousin, a left-wing poet who lives in Chicago. He has long been out of touch with the Republicans in our family. This week he will come to visit me in New York.
She reminded me that uniting against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.
Because she and Trump are working together in the White House, all the people she knows, even Republican relatives who have been engaged in political quarrels for decades, are suddenly and strangely on the same front.
If all are at the table, this is certainly a good thing, but what shocks me is that from a broader perspective, this can pose a major risk.
Although leftist figures have been embarrassed by Trump for a long time, the warping effect he served as president has pushed us all to the right.
When we talk about "normalization" and Trump, we are referring to the possibility of fear that his erratic behavior may stop some day.
However, there is a more worrying long-term scenario. What Trump wants to “normalize” is the relationship with the right-wing Republicans. These Republicans had previously opposed Mr. President’s standards and now suddenly appear to be a symbol of reason.
I find myself recently missing out on the madness of Mitt Romney's version: Taking a dog on a car, 14% of the income tax (but at least we know his tax return), compared to Trump, the two actions seem to be too slight.
After the Trump era passed, the next Republican candidate needed only to be wisely qualified to make incalculable improvements.
When my cousin was living in the town, we took our children to the New York Park Carousel, the largest carousel operated by New York Central Park Management. If you don't need coffee, the three-dollar ticket is your most valuable consumer in the city.
The Trojan's voice was thunderous. The central column was made of fiberglass. All the clowns and animals turned their heads and looked at their shoulders terrorously and sinisterly. The buzzing music sounded oddly.
Too many vulgar cities are disappointing: landscapes from high-rise buildings have become old-fashioned, and the skyline becomes too familiar to provide much excitement, and the reality of the city does not support the dream.
35 years later, I have not completely forgotten that day. I discovered that this “Swiss Cottage” is not actually a Swiss chalet, but a Ye Bare house in the theme bar (Ye Olde Swiss Cottage). I can't remember it, but it is near an intersection in the north of London.
However, Central Park's carousel is still a magical experience. Everyone has fun with two 2-year-olds, 11-year-olds, and four girls in their 40s.
If I can evaluate the carousel, I will give it full marks, but fortunately no one asked.
But this week in a department store, before I swipe my credit card, I was asked to rate my transaction "experience" one to five stars.
The same is true for coffee shops in the corners of my street. In addition, you can choose to use a 15% tip for rating. This is to buy things on the counter.
The effect of this is not only to slow down the speed of what should have been a neutral transaction, but also to put pressure on the waiter to add personal factors to unwanted situations.
The poor woman in the department store smiled apologetically, and I was exhausted. The credit card transaction experience rated her five stars.
Oscar Pistorius transferred from prison to hospital for chest pain
This was the second time that Pistorius left prison and transferred to the hospital.
Last year he was taken to the hospital to treat a wrist cut. The prison official stated that the injury was caused by his fall in the cell.
After the prosecutor filed an appeal against the original manslaughter decision, Pistorius was convicted of murder.
In the early hours of Valentine's Day in 2013, he shot Stingkamp through the toilet cubicle at his home in Pretoria and died.
Pistorius claimed to have mistaken his girlfriend as an intruder hiding in a cubicle at night.
The prosecutor has announced that they intend to appeal again, this time in response to Pystorius’ six-year prison sentence, which they believe is too merciful.
The National Public Prosecutor’s Office stated that it will appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa and this appeal can be heard this year.
If the prosecutor wins, Pistorius will face a sentence of 15 years.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.

Two Bulgarians detained for illegal camping in Greece
bTV quoted the Ministry of Foreign Affairs as saying that two Bulgarians were detained in Greece for illegal camping.
On the morning of August 1, Sithonia police detained a group of illegal campers, including two Bulgarians.
Detainees were released on the same day and the investigation is still ongoing.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs revealed to bTV that two Bulgarians were subsequently released.
Greek authorities have stepped up control of free camping and will impose heavy fines on anyone who rests at non-designated campsites.
The inspection will continue for one season.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that the court may impose fines on random campers.
On May 18, the Ministry of Finance promulgated the "Measures for the Management of Special Awards for Industrial Structure Adjustment of Industrial Enterprises." Special funds will be allocated to promote the dismantling of excess capacity in the coal and steel industries, with a total amount of 100 billion yuan.
Recently, many local governments in Shanghai, Shanxi, Shandong, Jiangsu and Heilongjiang have successively proposed reform opinions on resolving excess production capacity.
Among them, many provinces have even proposed that they must actively seek financial support from the central government for its capacity-reduction efforts in the province.
One corroboration is that only 8 provinces announced their goal of coal capacity reduction standing on 90% of the national coal production reduction plan.
Lin Boqiang, dean of the China Energy Policy Research Institute of Xiamen University, said in an interview with reporters that the "capacity reduction" of the iron and steel and coal industries depends only on the central government's 100 billion yuan, which is far from enough. More funds need to be resolved by local governments and companies.
The Shanxi Province's recently announced implementation rules for coal removal capacity proposed to reorganize Shanxi Coking Coal Group into a state-owned capital investment company, reorganize and integrate the company's assets and businesses, and build a brand-new business model.
The actual funding gap may be three times the subsidy. Prior to this, Yin Weimin, Minister of Human Resources and Social Security, stated that the preliminary statistics of the "capacity-to-remove" workforce was 1.3 million for the diverted workers and 500,000 for the iron and steel system.
Nanfang Daily News (Reporter/Xie Qingyu) The reporter learned from the Provincial Environmental Protection Department that the results of 2012 Guangdong Province's key pollution source environmental protection credit rating are being publicized.
After evaluation, 134 of the 1251 enterprises listed on the environmental protection credit management list will not be rated because of suspension of production, non-acceptance, shutting down, and other reasons.
Among the companies that are planning to review red cards, there are more heavily polluting enterprises such as electroplating, printing and dyeing, and prevention and treatment. Some sewage treatment plants are also on the list.
The Provincial Environmental Protection Agency stated that in order to reflect the principles of openness, fairness, and impartiality, and accept public supervision, the results are now publicized on the website of the Environmental Protection Agency.
During the publicity period, the Environmental Protection Agency accepts public calls, letters, visits and other forms to reflect the issues. The Environmental Protection Agency will investigate, verify and handle the issues reflected.
Climate change may destroy a large number of species in an irreversible manner, including those that humans depend on for their survival.
Waynes said that even if the heat does not directly kill the species, it can also generate potential risk factors.

Can meat, milk, and chocolate help to alleviate inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)?
Fat and chocolate may sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.
But a new study shows the opposite: diets rich in meat proteins and dairy products can help alleviate the symptoms associated with inflammatory bowel disease.
The incurable disease affects about 1.3 million Americans and about 300,000 Britons, causing stomach cramps and bloating, recurrent or hemorrhagic diarrhea, weight loss, and extreme fatigue.
Researchers at the University of Washington often advise patients to avoid eating meat and dairy products to relieve symptoms, but the researchers found that the key amino acid of the protein, tryptophan, helps to promote the growth of immune cells, which can increase intestinal tolerance.
Lead researcher Dr. Marco Colonna explained that immune cells patrol the intestines to ensure that harmful microbes hidden in the food do not enter the body.
The balance between the cells that cause inflammation and those that increase tolerance protects the body without damaging sensitive and vulnerable tissues.
When the equilibrium state is too biased towards inflammation, inflammatory bowel disease may occur.
In the experiment, an immune-promoting cell was found in mice bearing special bacteria.
The bacteria need tryptophan (one of the constituent parts of the protein) to form the appearance of the cell.
Professor Colonna said: “We have established a link between a bacterial population (L. reuteri, which is a normal part of the gut microbiota) and cell populations that promote tolerance.
The more tryptophan mice eat in their diet, the more immune cells they have.
He suggested that if humans use the same method, the combination of Lactobacillus reuteri and a tryptophan-rich diet may form a more tolerant and less inflammatory intestinal environment.
Luisa Cervantes-Barraganwas, a postdoctoral researcher, studied immune cells that could increase tolerance, when she discovered that a group of research mice had such cells, but another group of the same strains did not.
She suspects that this difference is related to the intestinal micro-organisms (bacteria, viruses, and fungi commonly found in the gastrointestinal tract) of mice.
DNA sequencing of mice's cholesterol revealed that six bacterial populations existed in mice with immune cells, but none in mice without immune cells.
The mice are raised in a sterile environment, so they lack gut microbes and cannot present such immune cells. The presence of Lactobacillus reuteri produces immune cells.
To understand how bacteria affect the immune system, the researchers cultured Lactobacillus reuteri in liquid and then transferred a small amount of bacteria-free fluid to immature immune cells isolated from mice.
The immune cells develop into resistant cells.
When the active ingredient is purified from a liquid, it can be shown that the active ingredient is a by-product of tryptophan metabolism and is called indole-3-lactic acid.
When the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the mouse's feed, the number of such cells increased by about 50%, but when the tryptophan level was halved, the number of cells decreased by half.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that people, like mice, have the same cells that increase tolerance, and most of us have Lactobacillus reuteri in our gastrointestinal tract.
Whether humans can induce cell development from tryptophan byproducts from Lactobacillus reuteri in the same way as experimental mice has not been known yet, but tryptophan-related gene defects are found in patients with inflammatory bowel disease.
She said: "The development of these cells may be the result we want, because these cells can control the inflammatory response of the intestinal surface.
It may be incorrect to say that the high level of tryptophan present in Lactobacillus reuteri may lead to an increase in the number of species.
Jose Mourinho believes that Manchester United signed the "genius" Nemanja Madic
After Wednesday night's debut of Nemanania Matic in the Sampdoria match, Mourinho found Manchester United signed a "genius" midfielder.
Martych, from Chelsea, signed up to £40 million and opened 2-1 in the final preseason game in Dublin before the Real Madrid's European Super Cup on Tuesday, winning the favor of Paul Bogba and Andreas Pereira.
However, in the Bruce preseason Asian Tournament, Madic scored a severe deficit and only completed 45 minutes. Mourinho admitted that he needs to improve before the start of the Premier League season.
"He needs time, but he has experience, wisdom and genius thinking - he thinks about football," said Mourinho.
"We will help him to prepare as soon as possible."
Mourinho began arranging his starting lineup at the start of the season, and like Martic, the newly signed players Victor Lindrov and Romellu Lukaku also started playing at the Aviva Stadium.
The Independent reported this week that Mourinho still hopes to introduce three more signing players, but he insists that the club “has done a good job”. In his mind there are four players who have signed up for the first time, and the club has already introduced three of them.
"The club has introduced three of its contracting players. I am very grateful," he added.
"If the club can introduce all four players, I will be happier, but they have already made great efforts for me."
The global climax of escorting ships If China does not build this type of warships will lag behind?
With the recent announcement of the construction of new types of frigates by major naval powers in the world, it seems as if overnight frigate has become the focus of the major powers. Japan first determined the purchase of two new frigates in the 2018 annual defense budget. This made the Japanese DEX frigate project finally have a substantial breakthrough, followed by the latest plan for Lockheed Martin’s recent announcement of the US FFG frigates program. So where does China’s new frigate go?
With the launch of a new 054A frigate at the end of 2017, the 054A frigate has already built as many as 29 frigates and has approached the sum of the 053H series frigates. Since the launch of the first 054A in 2006, 054A has been in existence for 12 years. Even around the world, the construction of such a large number of high-performance general frigates is the same as in China except the “Perry” class frigate built in the 1970s and 1980s in the United States.
And the reason why so many 054As are built is simple: they are affordable, easy-to-use, plus extra years of navy debt.
The 054A frigate has been favored by the Chinese Navy for many years because of its high cost performance and good combat effectiveness. Its 4,000 tons of displacement is equipped with a 76mm main gun, 32 units of Haihongqi-16 and Fish-8 antisubmarine missile launching system, 8 hawks and 83 helicopters. Although it was a kind of ship that was designed very early in 2006, its combat effectiveness is not too bad even today, and it can be seen in the world's frigate.
But this is a type of warship designed at the beginning of the 21st century. Its weapon configuration is set aside. Its power system and electronic radar equipment have a big gap compared with the current world's major frigates. Like the European type of frigates that have been equipped with all-electric propulsion, small multi-function phased array radars, and large helicopter decks, it is time to develop new models.
Then we should say how China's new frigate should develop. This has a direct bearing on its future orientation and the strategic direction of our Chinese navy.
The future development of the Chinese Navy will inevitably become the Blue Water Navy. In the future, it will surely go to the ocean. It will have rapid deployment in regions closely related to China's vital interests, demonstrating the existence of force, and if necessary, it will have strong fighting power to ensure that China’s vital interests in the region will not be damaged. So, it seems that the new type of Hu Weijiang will surely grow toward large-scale and ocean-going.
Looking at the positioning problem of the new type of frigates in the future Chinese naval sequence, the future Chinese navy should be similar to the US Navy. In addition to the necessary offshore defense ships, the other main ships will form carrier battle groups or amphibious assault ships as necessary.
The role of the new frigate in the future aircraft carrier battle group should serve as the main anti-submarine and regional short-range positioning in the amphibious assault ship attack group should serve as a frigate class, then according to such requirements requires the new frigate must have strong anti-submarine capabilities and a good mid-range regional airing capacity.
Based on the above positioning, we can boldly imagine the appearance of the domestically-built frigates in the future.
First, the displacement will be about 5,000 to 6,000 tons. The new frigate will have a significant increase in displacement. The new frigate is expected to reach about 30 knots, and the new frigate will have a significant increase in its cruising capacity. The new frigate is expected to reach about 30 knots. The new frigate is expected to reach about 30 knots. The maximum speed is expected to reach about 30 knots. The maximum speed is expected to reach 30 knots. The maximum speed is expected to reach 30 knots. The maximum gun speed will be around 30 knots. The main gun will have a 32-48-unit red flag and a -8 fishtail rear suspension system. A large 8-16-unit long tail system will be installed at the rear of the hull to launch Eagle 18 and new cruise missiles. The hangar and shutdown platform will also increase to accommodate the parking and storage of two 10-ton helicopters. As for the electronic radar system, the high radar equips with a small four-sided stationary phased array radar based on the 346A development, and the low-profile multifunction rotating phased array radar similar to the European frigate.
In this way, the overall level of the new type of frigates will reach the world's best level, even compared with the United States FFG.
Of course, the above concept is only the author's conjecture for the new domestic frigates, specifically how we can only wait until the new escort ships into the water to find out, let us look forward to it.

In recent years, the city has encouraged enterprises to actively participate in the construction of national, industry standards, and regional group standards. It has awarded 300,000 yuan to enterprises that mainly participate in the formulation of Zhejiang manufacturing group standards, and awarded 500,000 yuan to enterprises that have passed Zhejiang manufacturing brand certification. This is the highest amount of the province's award, and has inspired companies to participate in benchmarking enthusiasm.
A few days ago, Wang Li Group production workshop, the group system leader Gao Jian and employees are packing a anti-theft security door package, as part of the Zhejiang manufacturing group standard benchmarking work samples, ready to be sent to the Shaoxing Quality Inspection Center.
Just two days ago, Wang Li had passed the on-site audit of the "Zhejiang Made" certification expert group.
Gao Jian stated that the professional team composed of industry technical experts and quality certification organizations expressed appreciation for the Group's achievements in core aspects such as excellence in quality and independent innovation. They all agreed that they are fully qualified. As soon as the products pass the inspection, Wang Li will become one of the first companies to pass this standard.
Wangli Group is just a microcosm of the standard industry transformation and upgrading.
In addition, the city's simultaneous development of standards for standardization and compliance by the Zhejiang manufacturing group is also in step with Yangyang Group.
Since the formulation of the Zhejiang manufacturing team standard formulated by the city's anti-theft security door industry last year, Xingyue, Xinduo and other companies are actively applying for docking and benchmarking.
In recent years, a large amount of capital has flowed into the film and television market, and the popularity and pay of star performers has risen steadily. Producer He Jing once claimed that the two actors in a hot film drama held nearly a hundred million yuan in rewards, and finally only took a two-day play together. Other scenes were all replaced by substitutes.
In the current situation where actors and actresses play together, women and men starred in different cast groups at the same time, causing the same time not to appear at the same time on the set. The crew was forced to use a substitute to ensure the cycle.
It is understood that after returning to Beijing from Chengdu, Maurice continued to go to the hospital for acupuncture treatment to ensure that the injury will not continue to deteriorate.

China's household debt ratio is close to the United States. It is even more frightening than not affording housing.
In recent days, everyone has been discussing the recent changes in real estate policies. Is it true that real estate policies have been loosened? Will the diversification of the supply of land policies lead to a decline in housing prices?
However, when we were concerned about real estate prices, worried about macroeconomic regulation and control, and worried about the future development of the real estate market, the People's Daily once again wrote an article. Last time we specifically discussed the “People’s Daily” commentary on real estate regulation. Today, the “People’s Daily” article discusses a topic that is more serious than buying a house. Is that even if you can afford to buy a house, you still have to borrow?
Today, we come to talk about the more serious problem than buying a house: repay the loan.
I. China's growing housing debt crisis
According to the data in the article, the “People's Daily” overseas edition published the review article “Awards and Loans: The Youth’s Joy and Worry” on January 17. According to the data in the report, the “China's deleveraging report in the third quarter” issued by the National Finance and Development Laboratory and the National Balance Sheet Research Center of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences in November 2017 pointed out that the leverage ratio of the residents’ sector continued to rise, rising from 47.4% in the second quarter of 2017 to 48.6% in the third quarter, which was an increase of 1.3%, and rose by 3.8 percentage points in the first three quarters of 2017.
The debt ratio of the resident sector in all the real economy increased, and the leverage rate rose rapidly.
Relevant studies have shown that Chinese households' liabilities in financial institutions are mainly consumer loans, accounting for about two-thirds of residents' liabilities, which is about twice that of operating loans.
Of these, among consumer loans, medium and long-term loans based on housing loans accounted for about 80%. However, from the point of view of increase, short-term consumer loans grew faster than long-term loans.
In addition, the household debt ratio in China is only a measure of the total amount of credit that the household sector obtains from financial institutions. The Chinese family also has a number of private loans, including borrowing money from relatives and friends, and there are large-scale implicit debts.
Seeing such data, people can not help but be staggering, according to statistics from the Suning Institute of Finance, China's leverage ratio was only 3% in 1996 and only 18% in 2008, but since 2008 the residents' leverage rate has begun to show rapid growth, which has doubled in just six years to 36.4%, and by the third quarter of 2017, the residents' leverage rate has reached 48.6%.
We compare the data again. In May last year, HSBC issued an investigation report that spanned nine countries and the respondents were close to tens of thousands.
The report was targeted at young people in the millennial generation (born between 1980 and 2000) in nine countries.
The report pointed out that China's young people after the 80th and 90th homeownership rate as high as 70%, far ahead of the second Mexico (46%), is also the United States this indicator (35%) twice the level.
These data tell us a very likely problem, that is, compared to the unaffordable housing, the largest potential gray rhinoceros at this stage of Chinese residents is estimated to be still not able to claim debt.
Second, why is the housing debt crisis the most serious problem?
As we have previously analyzed, although we have always said that China’s housing prices are relatively high, compared to other countries in the world, China’s housing ownership rate is actually quite high. So, instead of saying that housing prices can’t afford to buy houses, I’m afraid that the question to ask many of my friends now is whether you still have a loan.
When we look at the real estate market in the world, China’s real estate market started late. Except for Hainan, which we said before, there has not been a big real estate crisis. However, just a decade ago, the origin of the global financial tsunami in 2008 was the real estate crisis in the United States.
The reason why the real estate crisis in the United States was blamed on two houses: Fan Limei and Freddie Mac.
At that time, in the golden age of the United States, real estate companies sold their houses with very low downpayments to low-income Americans in the United States in order to expand sales. When the American economy was good, the real estate market was thriving. However, the good times did not last long. As the US economy saw a stagnant growth, the income of home buyers fell, and a large number of household consumption expenditures began to decline.
However, at the time, the status quo in the United States was part of the U.S. family assets, financial assets and real estate assets. Almost all household assets in the U.S. low-income group were real estate, while most assets in the top 20% of high-income groups were financial assets. As a result, the debt ratio of the more impoverished real estate in the United States was higher.
One serious fact is that these people are buying houses when the economy is better, so the money to pay for the mortgage is also calculated on their better income. When the income declines, the pressure on the mortgage has not only not been reduced, but even some subprime mortgage plans have become floating. As a result, the real estate problems of these American families have gradually evolved into real estate crisis.
Some people can't afford real estate due to low income, so banks will sell at a very low price after recovering real estate from defaulters. As a result, housing prices in the region have declined. This process has caused a further decline in housing prices. This has created a vicious circle. When prices have fallen to a certain extent, more and more home buyers have found that their own house values are even lower than their own. As a result, more people stop repaying their mortgages and cause more bad debts.
As a result, a huge vicious circle has formed:
“The economy is sluggish – income is falling – some people can’t afford mortgages – banks sell low-occupancy houses at low prices – house prices fall – more people stop paying home mortgages – banks sell again – prices fall again...”
The problem is not only that, because housing prices continue to drop, you will not get debts if you don’t have enough money to buy a house. If you don’t have enough money to buy a house, you will need to pay back the money. Suppose you use a down payment of 600,000 and a loan of 2.4 million to buy a house worth 3 million at the time. When the house price drops to 2 million, you will not repay the loan to the bank. After the bank auctions, you not only lost your down payment of 600,000 but also owed 400,000 of the bank’s debt. You still have to pay back the money.
As a result, in such a vicious cycle one after another, the United States economy gradually collapsed and eventually triggered the US financial crisis in 2008.
Therefore, at this stage, the level of household debt in China has reached a high level of 46.8%, which is a problem that requires great vigilance. This figure is still lower than the level of developed countries. However, the signs of the problem have already begun to appear. Since the beginning of last year, the country has repeatedly stressed the issue of deleveraging. This is a very prescient judgment. If household debt ratio is allowed to continue rising, it will inevitably cause huge risks. Therefore, it is necessary to prevent financial risks.
After that, with the position that the house is used to live and not used for speculation, the state will accelerate the establishment of multiple measures such as multi-subject supply, multi-channel protection, and simultaneous hiring and purchase to further resolve potential risks.
For our individual families, we must abandon real estate speculation thinking. When buying a house, we must do our best to prevent our families from falling into a huge burden. Only a reasonable assessment of our income and debt levels is a healthy development path for family wealth.

One of the reasons for the delay in express delivery is that due to haze and weather, traffic control is implemented in many places and the capacity is insufficient.
British inventors implanted chips in their bodies and waved them into the car
A British inventor installed the chip for himself. He could open his front door, enter the office, or even start the car with a wave of his hand. He became the first person in the country.
33-year-old Steven Knowstrom puts a small chip between his thumb and forefinger, and is now offering this service to companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives. This service is implemented by his company BioTeq through technology.
He has teamed up with Dr. Jeff Watson, an anesthesiologist and consultant at the Royal Hampshire Hospital in Winchester, Hampshire, to ensure that the implantation process meets medical standards.
This technology is similar to the cat and dog chip implants and it takes only 30 seconds.
Mr. Northam's company will also replace locks in rooms and vehicles to be compatible with the chip, costing 300 pounds per lock.
The married father with a child has now installed the technology for both his home and his BMW Z4. He can start the car simply by putting his hand on the steering wheel.

White House props cost thousands
According to military records released by Time magazine, last month the White House decided to ship a Marine Corps helicopter to the South Lawn to demonstrate the great glory of the American manufacturing industry. It cost US$24,000.
The green and white Sikorsky VH-3D (also known as Marine Corps No. 1 while the President was on board) is an important exhibit on the White House’s highlight of the US construction project on July 17.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Burns and senior White House officials visited manufactured products from all 50 states.
He exhibited helicopters made in Connecticut, a yacht in Maine, a fire engine in Wisconsin, and a forklift in Mississippi.
According to the records of the Army Marine Helicopter First Flight Team (HMX-1) responsible for operating the helicopter, the White House Military Office required the helicopter to appear on a daily order (FRAGO), that is, only 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn to participate in this “special” event.
The day before the event, the HMX-1 commander stated in an e-mail sent to the deputy commander of the upper Marine Corps Flight that "I just want to confirm that you know because this event is highly valued."
The information indicates that the helicopter will arrive at the South Lawn at approximately 7 a.m. on July 17 to participate in an event at 3 p.m. and leave after 6 p.m. to 9 p.m. on that day.
The information also indicates that if the departure time from the White House is postponed, the return flight will require a second set of crew members due to duty time restrictions.
The original crew members stood by the helicopter during the event, while the security personnel stood nearby while the plane was on the ground.
The records obtained by Time Magazine did not clearly indicate whether a second group of crew members is ultimately required.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using government property for political purposes.
The record indicates that HMX-1 had asked whether this activity violated the Act.
The commander wrote, "One of the questions we asked was whether this violated the Hatch Act and was told that there was no violation."
"It sounds like you were locked," replied the deputy commander.
The White House defines this "Made in America" event as an official activity and is therefore not subject to the Hatch Act.
But even official activities are political.
During the event, the President promoted the issue of the Senate at the time: health care reform and loudly touted the control of government regulations.
The use of the Marine Corps 1 or Air Force 1 aircraft for political propaganda purposes is nothing new.
Past presidents have been required to travel to take these planes.
However, it is not common to expropriate photographs for photographing purposes only.
Trump received attention in February when he was in Melbourne, Florida. The presidential plane slowly glided, eventually stopping at the background of his first campaign rally. His Twitter account was filled with complaints about the former president's use of the presidential plane.
White House deputy spokeswoman Lindsay Walters said that the White House has been thrilled with the "Made in America" exhibition. This exhibition shows products from all 50 states. These products are made by American workers using American materials."
The HMX-1 crew often conducted flight training near the Washington area and the South Lawn, practicing the accurate placement of the President of the United States in the White House.
In the early July of Trump's participation in the G-20 summit in Germany, HMX-1 practiced 58 landings in the White House.
An official said that the U.S. manufacturing activity flight was included in this month's crew training requirements.
Helicopter units also flew an additional 11 hours of "non-presidential support missions."
The White House said that taxpayers did not bear the cost of any other props in the event.
Sikorsky spokesman said the company did not participate in the South Lawn helicopter display.
The HMX-1 does not keep a budget for the president’s flight, so it is very difficult to determine the exact cost of the event.
However, according to the Department of Defense’s hourly fee record for fiscal year 2017, the Ministry of Defense of VH-3D can claim a reimbursement fee of US$24,380 per flight hour.
The force record records that each flight of the aircraft from the base of the Marine Corps Airport in Minteco, Virginia, took 30 minutes.
The White House says that the cost of operating the helicopter is much lower than the cost.
Walters said that "it is very misleading to estimate the taxpayer's expenses based on reimbursable expenses.
These estimated costs include personnel costs, maintenance fees and many other sunk costs included in annual allocations.

And I know that both Sikorsky and Connecticut are proud of this. They all contribute to our national security. I guess that even if there aren’t thousands, hundreds of people have to rely on it.
And I think like most Americans, we are proud of this helicopter and other military equipment. This is the result of countless Americans' tireless efforts.

According to the report of the market star newspaper, from 2005 to 2011, the province's GDP rose to the second seat from the middle of the parallel "bottom".
However, the economic growth of our province still has the predicament of low investment efficiency and lack of core competitiveness in the industrial economy.To this end, the latest issue of the “Economic Blue Pages” of the Provincial Economic Information Center recommends improving the quality and efficiency of economic growth.
Based on some representative indicators of the province's economy in 2005 and 2011, it is compared with the national and central regions.
In terms of industrial economic efficiency, in 2011, our province has a considerable proportion of high energy-consuming industries such as industrial energy and raw materials, which are subject to large fluctuations in market volatility and excess production capacity. At the same time, leading industries such as home appliances and automobiles have insufficient innovation capacity, resulting in low profits.
The large amount of investment did not bring about corresponding economic benefits, which is an important reason for the low quality and efficiency of economic growth in our province.
In this regard, experts suggest that effective measures should be taken to encourage business innovation, and scientific and technological achievements in universities and scientific research institutes must also be “transferred” to enterprises in a timely manner.
For industrial economic benefits are not high, experts say, we must also actively promote industrial mergers and reorganization, optimize the industrial layout, and extend the industrial chain.

The union hopes that the management of the biscuit manufacturer Maiweita guarantees a long-term commitment to production at the Lagos factory.

Drew Duffy, senior director of the British Federation of Trade Unions, said: “We cannot clearly understand the future business needs and investment plans of Tollcross from the factory general manager, which has caused deep concern to our members.
Generations of families are working here, and the local community and the Greater Glasgow region are highly concentrated labor forces and are important pillars of decent employment in high unemployment and severely deprived areas.
Therefore, from the perspective of employment, salary, and economic prosperity, in the context of Brexit, rising cost of living, and a long-term recession in the manufacturing industry, there is an urgent need for the expansion of production networks in the eastern region of Glasgow.”
A Pratt & Spencer spokesperson said: “The director of Tollcross just received a letter from the Scottish branch of the British Federation of Trade Unions yesterday and the company will immediately reply because we value continuous contact with employees and union representatives.
Two months ago, we held a regular meeting in Tollcross with employees and representatives of the British Federation of Trade Unions to openly discuss some issues.

We fully recognize the historic status of Tollcross as a production base, such as any changes in our operations at the plant, and employees and union representatives will be the first to know.”

"I don't worry, because they know that if they contact any one of our players, we will definitely be titling against them. We will also contact their players," Alghlaifi said.
"We respect all clubs.
But if they try to sign our players, then they too must eat their own food.”
