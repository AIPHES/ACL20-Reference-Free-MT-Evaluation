Last week, temporary stoppage of the costume drama "The Beauty Private Room" sparked a heated discussion about the fake ratings of the domestic drama.
Civil rights groups issue travel warning for Missouri
Because of the discriminatory policies and racist attacks in Missouri, the American Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) issued a travel warning to people of color preparing to travel to Missouri.
"The NAACP Missouri Trip Advisory, which came into effect on August 28, 2017, calls for all African American travelers, tourists, and Missouri people to take special care and be extremely cautious when traveling in Missouri due to a recent series of suspicious racial incidents in Missouri," the group's statement declared.
NAACP noted that a recently passed law in the state of Missouri made it harder for people to win discrimination lawsuits, and that law enforcement in the state was partly targeted at minorities, phenomena that prompted the organization to issue travel warnings.
The violation of civil rights is happening to people.
They were stopped for questioning, beaten or killed because of the color of their skin," Missouri NAACP Chairman Rod Chappell of Missouri told The Kansas City Star .
"We have received an unprecedented number of complaints.
It is the first such warning the group has issued in the United States against a state.
The group cited a racial slur against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of 28-year-old black male Tory Sanders of Tennessee.
Sanders, who died in suspicious circumstances earlier this year, ran out of fuel while traveling in Missouri and was taken into custody by Missouri police without charge of a crime.
The consultation also noted that a recent report from the Missouri attorney general's office showed that "black drivers in the state are 75% more likely to be checked for parking than whites"
"The purpose of the consultation was to raise awareness and warn people about what might happen to their families, friends and colleagues in Missouri," Chappell said.
People need to be prepared, whether to travel to Missouri with bail or to let relatives know they are traveling within the state.
According to the latest data from the FBI's Hate Crime Reporting Program, Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015; the state ranks 16th nationally based on the number of crimes committed.
The travel warning is also a response to a new law in Missouri that will make it harder to sue businesses for housing or employment discrimination.
Previously, US states passed immigration enforcement laws requiring local law enforcement to detain immigration offenders, a move the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) said would increase the number of racial lawsuits and issued travel advisories for Texas and Arizona.
Travel warnings are usually issued by the U.S. government against other countries, but recently, advisory groups have taken this approach in response to certain laws and trends within the United States.
After the "golden age" of the 2015 box office surge, the overall film market entered a period of calm in 2016, and it became a suspense whether it could surpass last year's total of 44.069 billion yuan.
According to figures released by the National Bureau of Statistics, the price of new and second-hand homes in Beijing cooled in October, rising only 0.6% and 1.1% in the month-on-month.

BBC says Beijing is the most exciting city: making foreigners feel "like they're living in a new era
Beijing may be 3,000 years old, but it is also rapidly becoming the modern glamour city it is today, British media said on January 18.
The Chinese capital, with its surprisingly fast internet, cutting-edge technology such as face recognition software, huge investment in artificial intelligence and unrivalled international energy, is one of the most exciting cities for exploratory foreigners.
According to the BBC website on January 16, "If I can make it there, I can make it anywhere," German expat Clemens Seshi said, citing the lyrics of singer Frank Sinatra's ode to New York City.
If Sinatra lived to this day, he would probably sing about cities like Beijing, "said Seshi, who worked as creative director at Traveler Archive, saying living in the city makes you feel" like you're living in a new era "and always keeping up with the trend.
Writing on the personal blog site 4Corners7Seas, Simon Norton, whose hometown is in England but who recently lived in Beijing, said: "There is a general sense of being at the centre of something grand, which is hard to say, but it keeps many foreigners there for long. They want to see what it will become, and they want to see it for themselves.
The city's high-quality, high-speed internet and technology-friendly environment make daily life easier than ever, reports say.
"Beijing is rapidly transforming into a cashless society, with the Internet integrating traditional wallet functions into smartphones, making it easier for everyone to make many transactions," said Andy Penyafuerte, who is from Manila and is now deputy editor-in-chief of the Beijing Kids website.
But the smartphone is only the beginning of Beijing's technological ambitions, and facial recognition software has become so popular that many mobile phone applications use it to make bank transfers and payments, get people into apartments and offices, and even use it to verify the identity of the driver of the internet dating car, the report said.
Beijing also recently announced plans to spend 13.8 billion yuan to build an artificial intelligence technology park, where more than 400 companies will settle, focusing on developing AI technologies ranging from biometrics to self-driving cars.
Food is also at the heart of many of China's major festivals over the years, and participation in these celebrations is admired by foreigners, with the Spring Festival being the most important social and economic holiday and one of the easiest for foreigners to participate in.
"My advice is to help Chinese friends prepare for the New Year," he said. "It's as important to clean up the apartment as it is to put a red spring couplet with New Year's greetings on the door. On New Year's Eve, all the family members will gather for a big meal, and then watch for the New Year until midnight and welcome the New Year with brilliant fireworks. For foreigners, spending the night with friends and family is indeed an opportunity for integration."
The number of foreigners in Beijing is large and growing, but language barriers in China and the ease of communication between expatriates can easily be an excuse for not fully integrating into local culture, the report said.
"Some foreigners have been living in China for years, but have little experience of their host country. If your initial attempts to reach out to Chinese people are not successful, then it's easy to feel that you can get along more easily with other foreigners," said Seshi.
In these so-called "foreign bubbles" ("foreign bubbles" refers to foreigners who only mix among foreigners and do not come into contact with the local people and culture), foreigners hang out in their own communities, eat in Western restaurants and have only foreigners among their friends.
The easiest way to overcome this is to learn a little Mandarin - which is simpler than one might think.
"An hour or two a week of private Chinese lessons or an entry-level radio play should suit everyone's busy schedule," he said.
Even learning a few classic phrases can be helpful for shopping, ordering a meal at a restaurant or gossiping in a taxi.
Persistent air pollution is also a fact of daily life, the report said, though government efforts in recent years have contained some of the problems.
Residents stressed the importance of going outdoors during warmer months, when pollution tends to be lighter, using the blue sky days as an opportunity to roam through historic alleyways or explore popular Ritan Park.
"Beijing is the Chinese city that finds the most things below the surface," Norton said. "You can find great artistic and musical activities, indulgent nightlife, historical wonders, ultra-modern business districts and ancient hutong areas.
The report argues that the effect of ageing on the growth of human capital is increasingly evident, particularly in the Northeast, where the average annual contribution of ageing to the growth of human capital is -1.28%.
Mr Pan pointed out that the risk of cross-border capital flows was manageable and the underlying factors underpinning the balance of payments remained long-standing.
Beijing, December 17 (Xinhua) The world is resplendent with heritage - the 2016 International Summit Forum for the Identification, Restoration and Conservation of Chinese Ancient Books and Paintings opened at Renmin University of China on December 17.
The European Commission in April accused Google of forcing phone makers to pre-install software such as Google Search and Chrome browsers or not allow them to use other Google applications.
The European Commission considers the move to be detrimental to consumers and an impediment to competition.
EU regulators initially asked Google to respond by July 27.
Google faces a fine of up to 10% of its global revenue, about $7.4 billion, if convicted of antitrust charges.
Google was not immediately available for comment.
Google also faces an EU investigation for skewing its own shopping service in search results.
Zhang Yuning's stay is solid, it can be said that he achieved from the national youth to the national Olympic "jump" is not accidental, and his leap to growth is still surprising.
A graphic read: The legal status of bitcoin around the world
Absrtact: In addition to the natural price correction caused by speculative attributes, this round of digital currency collapse is also associated with the "old enemy" - regulatory risk.
Viewed from a visual map, Eastern countries have a more conservative approach to bitcoin than the West, and the countries that make up the bulk of the globe are still watching for the legitimacy of the digital currency, representing the "black swan risk" that remains large.
*This article is from WeChat ID: wallstreetcn, editor Wang Mu. For more highlights, please visit wallstreetcn.com, or download Wall Street to see APP.*
As regulatory storms swirled in major markets such as China, South Korea and the European Union, and the global digital currency, led by bitcoin, has been decimated this week, bitcoin prices fell below the $10,000 psychological round-up on Tuesday and posted their biggest one-day drop in three years.
In addition to the speculative nature of the natural price correction, the current round of digital currency collapse has been the "old enemy" - regulatory risk is not unrelated.
At this important juncture, the visualization big data website HowMuch.net has produced a map showing the legitimacy and regulatory extent of bitcoin in countries around the world.
As the figure below shows, green represents the legal market for bitcoin; Tangerine represents the neutral market and, while not yet publicly legalizing bitcoin status, there are no major restrictions on its use; Pale pink represents a restricted market, where local governments try to use digital money through red line policies or regulation; Dark pink represents the country where bitcoin is defined as illegal; Grey is the country that has yet to comment.
(Pictured above from the HowMuch.Net visualization team on January 15)
The paper points out that, as can be seen from the distribution of non-green blocks in the graph, the traditional Eastern countries have a more conservative approach to bitcoin than the West.
Russia is by far the largest country to define bitcoin as illegal, China is one of the biggest restricted markets for bitcoin, and India is one of the biggest countries that has yet to comment on the currency and has yet to put in place a relevant policy.
North America and Western Europe have the highest acceptance of bitcoin, with a more concentrated distribution of green blocks.
The perception of bitcoin among countries in the Middle East and Latin America is markedly polarized, with a more mixed distribution of color blocks in those regions.
Among them, Iraq, Iran, Turkey, Brazil are all legal bitcoin markets, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Bolivia and others have some degree of restrictions on their trading and use, and more Latin American countries have yet to speak out against bitcoin.
Taken together, the above data show that a total of 99 (or 40%) of the 246 countries covered by the global statistics have no restrictions on the trading and use of bitcoin, i.e. green and orange areas.
Seven countries (or 3%) are restricted markets (pale pink), 10 countries (or 4%) define bitcoin as illegal (dark pink) and 130 countries (or 53%) do not have more digital currency information (grey).
This suggests that the countries that make up the bulk of the world (53%, more than half) are still waiting to see the legitimacy of the digital currency, led by bitcoin, within their borders, and that the "black swan risk" of bitcoin remains high, as some of them may end up making legislative decisions to restrict the digital currency.
The paper argues that the emerging category of digital currencies is not fully understood by global regulators and may be the main reason most countries have yet to take a stand.
While bitcoin's "popularity" has grown exponentially since last year and does not represent an interest for all countries, there may be some countries that are concerned that local currencies are under threat as a result, or more concerned that digital currencies are being exploited by criminal organizations.
Wall Street News has written a detailed summary of international regulatory news against bitcoin since last week, including China's launch of a crackdown on over-the-counter online platforms and mobile App, South Korea's ongoing consideration of closing digital currency exchanges, the EU's belief that bitcoin has not been widely accepted and a warning to investors about the risks of "losing blood"
The year 2018 will be the year of the global central bank's digital currency, from the point of view of regulation, acceptance / criticism, and adoption, according to Wall Street News Editor-in-Chief | 2018.
Major powers such as Russia have criticized the legitimacy of bitcoin, in fact, in order to make way for the official issuance of digital currency.
Madrid, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Barcelona's new aid Coutinho made his debut in a Barcelona shirt at the Nou Camp on Sunday.
Coutinho passed Barca's medical that morning and signed a contract with Bartolomeu, Barca's president, that expires in the summer of 2023.
He then made his debut as a Barca player in front of nearly 7,000 fans at the Nou Camp.
According to Spanish media, Coutinho's total transfer fee, which amounts to 160 million euros (1 euro about 7.77 yuan), is the first in the history of the Barca club and La Liga.
With Coutinho still injured, he still needs nearly 20 days off to make his debut in a Barcelona shirt.
What else is sacred?
Now the Trump White House is taking aim at the Statue of Liberty
The most certain sign of regime change is when they start attacking the statue.
Americans agree as much as anyone, so Saddam Hussein, of Paradise Square in Baghdad, was deliberately pushed down in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the key thinkers in the Trump administration, must have known what would happen to his symbolic axe of the Statue of Liberty as he sparred with Jim Acosta of CNN over the president's proposal to severely restrict legal immigration.
To be fair, Miller did not attack the statue itself.
If he did, then a group of cruise ship owners and libertarian followers would surely devour him alive.
But he did attack the significance of the statue, especially when Emma Lazarus's famous poem was engraved on a pedestal in 1903 (the monument was built 17 years later).
As Miller rebuked Acosta, "I don't want to talk about all the facts of history here, but the Statue of Liberty is a symbol of America's freedom to light up the world,"
The poem you are referring to, which was added later, is not part of the original Statue of Liberty.
In fact, Miller is right, but as he himself says, it's not really about history.
This involves the modern echo of Lazarus's cataclysmic words, the only country that seems to invite not only any old immigrants, but also the poorest of the poor: "Your exhaustion, your poverty, or your hordes of people craving free breath, / The afflicted reject your crowded beaches."
There is no "suffering people refuse" in our screen to become more glaring at the moment.
Miller, who has not worked in literary commentary, made it clear that these people would not be welcome in Trump era America.
This conflict over the significance of the statue is part of a broader political and cultural war: it's actually a conflict with the American spirit.
Lazarus, and her friends who held events after her death to engrave her verse on a pedestal, are well aware of the highly political nature of the acts they are participating in.
The sculpture aims to express the connection between French and American republicanism through the old classic metaphor of the female incarnation of the Statue of Liberty.
Lazarus changed the meaning: In her poems, the female figure is no longer abstract, she wants to be vocal.
She gave herself a very different name: the mother of exile.
The poem's combination with the painting was a successful feminist coup and a devastating blow to American nativism.
Like Lazarus changing the meaning of the statue, the alt-right has always wanted to change it back to its original meaning.
The great speaker, Rush Limbaugh, who was a Baptist when Trump arrived, argued in 2010 that liberalism was not about inviting anyone, and that he was now an early neo-conservative who brought America's flame of wisdom to a benighted world: "The Goddess of Liberty is brave.
She meant to carry the torch of freedom from America to the rest of the world.
The torch does not illuminate America's path.
Unusually, Limbaugh was actually struck by something.
The significance of a statue depends entirely on the angle of cognition.
The most imaginative thing about Lazarus is to be able to see it. When tired, poor but hopeful people can see it on the deck of a ship after a long and often terrible journey.
On the surface, this involves looking at the world from the perspective of those who seek asylum and have the opportunity to improve their lives.
Her statue conveys to them and needs the hope and welcome they hear.
That, of course, is not a view that Miller and Trump had wanted to acknowledge.
They torch not to illuminate the road, but to ignite the hatred of their only source of strength.
In 2006, he joined Universal Records in a unique musical style, becoming the first Chinese to sign a contract with Universal's UK headquarters.
World Cup 2017: Neil Black has highly praised Scotland in the British national team
Eilidh Doyle recalls that there were only two Scots in the British national team at the time.
Neil Black, executive director of the British Athletics Association, said the 16-strong Scot team in the world championship group would make a "huge contribution to the national team"
The number of Scottish field athletes selected for the 2017 London Track and Field World Cup, which opens on Friday, is at an all-time high.
Black believes that "Scotland is making extraordinary progress" and that British track and field athletes must learn from it.
"We accept and try to understand that, and we will continue until we succeed," Black said.
"I speak to people at the Scottish Institute of Sport who think it has something to do with what they do.
Scottish track and field athletes think it has something to do with what they do.
The British Athletics Association believes it has something to do with what they do.
Even the street people think so.
No matter what the situation, this is extremely brilliant.
A number of Scottish track and field athletes are medal contenders, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart, who will compete with Mo Farah at 5,000 metres, and Eilidh Doyle, who was chosen by the panel as captain.
"Eilidh is a little modest.
Her captain's speech was incredible, "Black said.
"Many track and field athletes, whether Scottish or not, or wherever they live or train, walk out the door with pride and drive.
Eilidh's natural passion and true feelings are very good.
The Commonwealth silver medallist, who will compete in the 400m hurdles at its fifth world championship, said it was "incredible" that there were 16 Scots in the British national team.
Previously, the number of Scottish track and field athletes competing in the World Series was up to seven, which is the number of entries achieved in 1983 and 2015.
Middle runner Muir is the leader. She has set five British and two European records in the past year.
She will compete in the 1500m and 5000m events.
Chris O'Hare, who competes in the 1500m event, is another Scot to watch, having previously done well in the season, winning both the British national qualifier and the Olympic anniversary.
Doyle recalls her first world championship, when the only other Scot on the team was Lee McConnell.
The captain said she was deeply proud that so many of her compatriots would not only join the team but, in some cases, challenge for medals and compete to reach the final.
"The special thing about being captain of a national team is that it's voted for by the rest of the national team, so it's a great honor for me to know that your teammates voted for you to achieve something very unusual," she added.
"Of course, I'm very proud of all the Scotland players.
It just shows how far we've come.
And they're all established track and field athletes here, track and field athletes who are about to make their way to the podium.
How was my captain's speech?
Well, I think it's very good.
I was just referring to the fact that in this case we were very lucky because we had the world championship at home.
That is why it is really important that we build on our home support and our return to the Olympic Stadium.
I will get a second chance to compete and the atmosphere there will be fantastic.

Blocking critics on Facebook: If you can't stand voter censure, don't run for office
Our founding fathers know the ways of bad media.
Americans loved Washington, but it wasn't long before major newspapers began lashing out at him for everything from domestic policies to political principles.
He was annoyed by the criticism, no doubt about it.
But he has not silenced these critics.
For as early as 1783, Washington said, "Freedom of speech is denied - and we are slaughtered like lambs in silence and ignorance."
Which brings me to Maryland's governor, Larry Hogan, who needs to learn from Washington.
Hogan's staff blocked and deleted the posts of at least 450 people as they expressed their views on his Facebook official home page.
The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) filed a lawsuit against him earlier this week.
The governor's staff dismissed the lawsuit as frivolous, and online reports flooded their backlash: "Who cares?
A lot of people say, "It's just Facebook."
But, it's important.
This is particularly important because it's against people like Hogan.
It was a Republican who served as governor in a Democratic majority state, and he was surprisingly popular.
Of the country's 50 governors, he received the second-best rating.
Hogan is not a reactionary edgy.
He ran Maryland smoothly and followed the rules strictly.
He's also very good at using Facebook as the main way to connect with voters, playfully showing off his post-chemo baldness on the home page for the first time.
So it is totally unnecessary, and ultimately dangerous, to block people who come to the governor's home page, a public forum that is the official management platform for staff who are supported by public tax payments.
In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan's spokeswoman, Amelia Shas, defended the governor's actions, saying she thought blocking their comments was simply an attempt to get them to restrain a little.
But they are too hasty to describe it as a flood beast or a cynic sweeping the web.
The Washington Post spoke face-to-face with people blocked by Hogan.
They are no more than ordinary people talking to their chosen leaders: they are teachers, small business owners, and pastors, not flood beasts.
They have said their comments are deep, respectful and not lewd.
The priest quoted the Bible in his post, calling on Hogan to remember his Catholic faith.
Lakshmi Salma Lamani, a barrister in Bowie, Maryland, was not cynical, but she asked questions about hate crimes.
Writing in the Washington Post's news story commentary section, she said, "I am politely commenting that I am disappointed that he has not responded to hate crimes and other recent news events.
I also don't like the idea of a bunch of people commenting on the same topic, because these people are simply ignored by some people as being so-called followers rather than as citizens who are worried about their country.
What the governor's staff calls "intensive spam bombing" may seem to others to be "sticking to the guns"
The Facebook era makes it easy to modify a message by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment.
And it is much cleaner than in the past, when sending staff out to collect and burn critical newspapers or to arrest or silence protesters.
But that's really what's happening now, just on a digital level.
Hogan is not the first public official to be blamed for silencing others on Facebook and other social media.
President Trump is being sued by Twitter users for blocking them on Twitter.
A landmark ruling emerged last week in Virginia on such issues.
The chairman of the Loudoun County Board of Supervisors violated the First Amendment by blocking voters from her Facebook page, according to District Judge James c Katzaris of the US city of Alexandria.
Kentucky Governor R was also patronized by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) for his use of Facebook and Twitter.
It shouldn't be so hard.
In the Washington era, affordable postage and the internet had similar influence.
The number of newspapers quadrupled between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letters were written strongly criticizing his leadership.
And even then, Washington had anonymous flood beasts against him.
People used fake names such as Yurikla, Valerius, Belizareu, and Pogius to write to newspapers harshly criticizing Washington's decision-making.
His office was inundated by petitions criticizing his attitude to the Treaty of Amity, Commerce and Navigation between His Majesty the King of the United Kingdom and the United States of America, according to historical documents collected by the online project of the George Washington newspaper.
But he did not silence them.
Freedom of speech, dissent and speech are the foundations of this country.
And real leaders need to accept that.
A trace of wind and grass in the property market is pulling people's sensitive nerves.
Restricted purchase is a hard lever of real estate control policy in many cities.
In May 2017, Jinan introduced a six-month continuous social security policy for undergraduates, who are entitled to the same home purchase policy for local permanent residents;
In June, Wuhan introduced a policy that requires college students to settle down within three years of graduation with their diplomas and employment certificates.
The policy was then increased, with officials saying that "college students can buy a house at 20% below the market price"
In July, Chengdu introduced the requirement that young talents with a bachelor's degree or above from a foreign university can apply for residence in Chengdu on the basis of their diplomas.
In addition, Kunshan, Shanghai and other cities or regions have also introduced "talent introduction" policies to lower the threshold for talent purchase.
Zhang Hongwei believes that this is actually the major cities for the population, especially talent competition, to retain the population, especially talent, the city is competitive, this is the most important significance of these real estate policies.
Some even argue that this means the time has come for the property market to "limit" the cancellation.
The film was planned for a long time, with the first adaptation of the screenplay in 1999 and even looking for Jin Cheng Wu to play Yan XIII, the director said on the day.
Ronan Rafferty looks forward to enjoying a homecoming at the Renaissance Club
The East Lothian Renaissance Club hosts the 25th Scottish evergreen Open and former European champion Ronan Rafferty will enjoy the feeling of coming home for the next three days.
The Northern Irishman, who led the next door Archerfield Links to the final last year but lost to Paul Ills, now works for the new venue, representing the club's founder and chief executive Jerry Salvati as tournament ambassador.
Rafferty said: "I have witnessed the establishment of the Renaissance Club and we will also witness its glory through this competition.
The athletes will see the best look and the best form of the pitch.
Jerry created the place like no other.
He is an ardent champion of the competition and is very proud of his achievements here.
This is the best stage to show the court.
England's Ilse looks to defend his title for the first time, despite having won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour in a 32-year career.
The Southport athlete said:'It's really very special.
I didn't defend the Extremadura Open because it was cancelled the year after I won.
It feels amazing to come to this place
It's wonderful to play golf here.
Memories of last year emerged, and for me and my wife, Sharon, last year's win had a special meaning for us.
It was really a special memory that we will always remember.
Back in the home race was Gary Orr, who turned 50 earlier this year and then played on the European evergreen tour.
This is his first Scottish tournament since the 2013 Scottish Open.
Mr Orr, of Helensburgh, said: "It always makes more sense to play back home
You want to do well; but you can feel the extra pressure.
To be able to play again I really enjoyed it and I've been playing golf.
I am satisfied with the situation.
Joining the infield trio are former Masters winner Ian Woosnam and evergreen champion Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
There were a total of six Scottish athletes on the field, with Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance two of them, while four others were Andrew Oldkorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.

In August, a total of 57 cases of continuous punishment on a daily basis were carried out nationwide. The newly revised Environmental Protection Law, enacted at the beginning of this year, significantly increased the level of enforcement of environmental laws in China, the head of the Environmental Supervision Bureau of the Ministry of Environmental Protection, Mr. Zou Jingmin, said in Beijing.
At present, environmental protection authorities in all parts of China may use such penalties as daily continuous punishment, seizure, suspension of production and transfer to administrative detention to investigate and punish environmental violations, and cooperate with judicial organs in punishing environmental crimes.
In August, a total of 335 cases of seizure and seizure were carried out in various parts of China; 177 cases of production restriction and suspension were carried out; 189 cases of administrative detention were transferred, and 166 cases of suspected environmental pollution crimes were transferred, Zou said.
Among them, Henan carries out daily continuous punishment 7, at present, China is from the end of control to the whole process of embedding, all-round increase environmental pollution control.
Although downward pressure on the economy is evident, China's environment ministry has previously made clear that China should properly handle the positioning of environmental protection in economic development and enhance its "green power". The more the economy grows, the less it can relax its environmental protection and play its role in optimizing the economy.

Russian media say Putin will own new domestic car: unit price 15% cheaper than Mercedes
Russian Minister of Industry and Trade Manturov said the unit price of President Vladimir Putin's "fleet" of cars started at 600-7 million rubles, Russian media reported on January 18.
The budget goal is to keep prices 15% lower than Mercedes-Benz S cars.
The Russian National Institute of Automotive Engineering (NAMI), the president's main research and development unit, will deliver 16 vehicles to the Federal Guard Service between late February and early March, the company reported on Monday.
According to the report, the "fleet" project, which has a budget allocation of 12.4 billion rubles, calls for the use of a unified modular platform to build three types of cars for the nation's number one - the extended sedan, the three-compartment car and the minibus.
News of the first home-made extended sedan since the Soviet Union was built for the president came about five years ago, the report said. Under the R & D unit's plan, the new car would be fitted with 800 horsepower engines and armor, and the entire vehicle would weigh six tons.
The engineering team of the German company Porsche is understood to have been involved in the development of the power plant.
Manturov told reporters that the "fleet" of cars will be available for retail from 2019 onwards, with a wide range of models available.

Poverty and Death in Indonesia's Golden State
Badtina Dejay doesn't use a stove when she's cooking.
She rarely even uses a pot.
Her wooden house is in Enarotali, the capital of Paniai district in Indonesia's Papua province, and the housewife usually simply puts a sweet potato - known to locals as "nota" - straight into the fire.
Half an hour later, the charred sweet potato was snatched out by a pair of unwashed hands and devoured.
Dai Jie sat on the mud - she had no furniture, and this was where she did her daily chores, such as washing clothes, and the water was so murky that it came from a nearby swamp.
There was a bucket in a room without a roof, and that was the outdoor toilet.
She was the youngest of her husband's four wives, so she was not assigned to the field to look after.
Polygamy is common here.
Of course it can be dangerous to work late: most of the men in the village are unemployed, and many are drunk, plus there are a lot of soldiers here.
"No one dares to walk around the village after 5 p.m.," she said.
It was a rare glimpse into the daily life of the highlands of Papua, once a Dutch colony that was incorporated into Indonesia after the 1969 referendum, but that referendum was also controversial, when only 1,026 elders were forced to vote by show of hands in front of the army occupying the land.
The current campaign for independence, against Dutch rule, is quick to point the finger again at the Jakarta government, which has imposed heavy-handed rule on the region, isolating foreign journalists and activists.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua, while Papua New Guinea controlled the eastern part of the island independently.
Enarotali is remote and deserted; to get here it takes a 90-minute flight from the provincial capital, Jayapura, to Naypyre, then a five-hour drive by hire car, all the way down the river in the stomach.
There is no public transport here.
In the town of about 19,000 people, the wooden house is surrounded by a bamboo fence, and the ruffled tin roof is a variety of tan-coloured covers made of rust.
Few Indonesians come in, let alone journalists, and there are few foreigners.
Before the arrival of the Christian preachers, the Mee Pago Papuans believed in a god named Uga Tamee.
There are other changes here as well.
"We can't get used to these clothes," she said, referring to her brightly coloured hand-woven headscarf, dark shirt and bright half-skirt.
"We used to cover ourselves only with leaves.
Papua, Indonesia's poorest province, where 28% of the population lives below the poverty line, also has the highest infant mortality rate and the lowest literacy rate in Asia.
But this is also the Golden State of Indonesia.
Paniai County is located in the Highlands, about the same size as New Jersey, with 153,000 people, and the world's largest and most profitable gold mine, Glasberg, is just 60 miles from here, owned by Phoenix-based Philip McMoran Copper Gold.
In 2015 alone, Philips mined about $3.1 billion worth of gold and copper here.
In addition, Papua is rich in timber resources with an estimated value of $78 billion.
Yet these abundant resources are also a source of tragedy for the Papuans, and Indonesia's powerful military has thus been able to keep them down.
According to a 2005 New York Times investigative report, Philips paid nearly $20 million to local military personnel and troops between 1998 and 2004, up to $150,000 for a single official.
The Papuans' growing appeal for independence threatened the gold owner and they suffered cruel treatment as a result.
Since 1969, more than 500,000 Papuans have been killed and thousands have been raped, tortured and imprisoned by the Indonesian army, according to activists.
According to the Asian Human Rights Commission, the mass killings in the Papua tribal highlands in the 1970s escalated into genocide.
Last year alone, Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful protesters.
A 2016 report by the Catholic Diocese of Brisbane, "We Will Lose Everything," encapsulated evidence of the previous year's heinous acts, such as extrajudicial killings, torture - another report said rape and electric Xing were particularly common - and a brutal crackdown on peaceful demonstrations.
"Violence happens every day, so it's hard to count the number of victims," said Andreas Halsono, an Indonesian researcher at Human Rights Watch.
The oppression began when Papua's resources brought in large numbers of immigrants from outside Indonesia.
83% of the province's population of 3.5 million is Christian, but the demographic structure of Muslim economic migrants has changed since they arrived from the densely populated islands of Java, Kalimantan, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Javanese snack stands sell fried chicken and vegetables mixed with Gadot Gadot, served with peanut butter.
The locals fought hard.
Apos Yau, a 24-year-old Paniai native who moved to the provincial capital of Jayapura to find work, explained that "those migrants started selling chicken and vegetables in traditional markets at lower prices than local Papuans.
This has deprived local Papuans - mama-mama - of their markets.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, often referred to as Jokowi, vowed at his 2014 election campaign to tackle inequality and abuse of power in Papua.
The one-time carpenter's path to the presidential palace in Jakarta is supported by 27 of all 29 districts-including Paniai.
But nothing has changed in Papua, and today, locals feel betrayed.
"We are heartbroken and in 2014 we voted for Jokowi in the hope that he will live up to our wishes and restore fairness," he said.
In fact, just two months after Jokowi took office in October, Paniai suffered his worst nightmare.
On December 7, 2014, 11 children in Enarotali were singing Christmas carols in front of a bonfire outside when two Indonesian soldiers suddenly rushed over on motorcycles.
The frightened children told them they should turn on the headlights.
One of the soldiers, who was unhappy with their tone, then returned with four soldiers, according to local priest Yawit Tebai.
Victims and witnesses said the drunk soldiers used their guns to chase the group of children.
Then one of the soldiers fired at the group of children.
Ulyanus Yemi, 16, was in a coma after being badly beaten.
Hours later, the nearby government body, the Electoral Commission building, caught fire and the incident escalated the next day.
Some 1,000 young Papuan men, women and children gathered at a football stadium in front of the local police station and military command centre to demand justice.
With a ceremonial hunting bow, they danced the waita dance of the Mee Pago tribe in Papua - running in circles and mimicking birdsong.
Some protesters began throwing stones at the military's regular outposts.
When the mood continued to intensify, soldiers received orders via internal radio: "If the crowd resisted more than three times, shoot immediately," according to an official document seen by Time, but the document was not released to local media.
Jeremias Kayamu, a 56-year-old leader of the Kego Koto neighbourhood of Enarotari, sensed a danger was imminent and appealed to the crowd to calm down and implore them to return home.
But no one was in the mood to listen to him.
Standing on the porch of his brightly coloured wooden house, he told Time magazine, "When I looked back, I was shot in the left wrist."
Kayamu still doesn't know who fired the shots, but says the bullets came from among the assembled soldiers.
"It was crowded," he added. "They shot a lot.
He witnessed the shooting and saw Olvyus Yule shot three times in the body, according to a cousin of local man Olfus Yule.
Euhanes sadly told TIME, "I ran over to check his body to see if it was him
I found him dead, I kissed him.
Papua police chief inspector Yuj Mende told reporters his subordinates were only "protecting" the police station because it had been attacked.
"When someone threatens to kill us, we have to defend ourselves," police chief Puggio Sulistio, a spokesman for the Papua police, said in 2015.
This is a matter of life and death.
Five young protesters were killed and many more injured, according to Human Rights Watch.
News of the killing spread only slowly in Jakarta the next day.
Three weeks later, Jokowi gave an emotional speech in Jayapura, expressing deep sympathy for the victim's family and vowing to address the abuse of power left over from Papua's history.
"I hope this case will be resolved as soon as possible so that it doesn't happen again in the future," he said.
In October 2016, Security Minister Fernando Villando said he would establish a non-judicial mechanism to address the historical legacy of human rights violations.
But the excuses for the pushback also rang out almost immediately.
He said, "Most of the violations occurred long ago.
Some were in the 1990s and early 2000s.
The point is that we are committed to addressing these violations, but this will require a process.
Then on June 5 in Jakarta, Verando backtracked in a conversation with Time magazine, saying he had no plans to set up a grievance mechanism in Papua.
Instead, he said, "everything will be settled in accordance with the law."
The United Nations has charged Villando with "crimes against human rights" over the deaths of more than 1,000 people in the bloody 1999 independence vote in East Timor, but he says 11 cases of human rights violations in the Papua region have been resolved, including the Paniai case.
Families of the victims of the Paniai incident have poured scorn on the claims.
"I've been interviewed four times in the last three years, but things have gone nowhere," he said.
Years later he said, "I'm tired."
He still lives in fear now.
He said, "I'm scared.
I was afraid of being arrested by the army, of being shot.
His brother Yucabus also thought the people of Paniai were scared to talk about the incident.
He said he was beaten by the military after helping to bury four victims.
"After the body was buried, the military came to me," he said.
The shooting did not stop.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police shot villagers in Deyaj County, neighboring Paniai County.
A construction company manager has refused to help transport an unconscious man to hospital amid clashes that left one person dead and 17 others injured, among them children.
The 24-year-old man, Ravianus Dogwood, drowned while fishing by a nearby river and died on his way to hospital.
Angry villagers protested in front of the company's on-site office.
Police say villagers threw rocks at officers, so officers fired warning shots.
But anti-riot mobile forces (Indonesian paramilitary police) began shooting at the crowd and one person was killed.
We were all panicked at the time and are now terrified that they will retaliate, "Domin Valley Buddy, 29, who was living near the hospital when he witnessed the injured being rushed to the hospital, told TIME.
"I hid at home for two days.
De Yayi Council has called for the police involved to be brought to justice and for riot control mobile forces to be withdrawn from the area.
Paniai has always been a place of right and wrong for the Indonesian government.
The lack of effective development feeds the discontent of the Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal tribespeople, who are scattered in the central highlands of Pani Ai.
Many have joined the Free Papua Movement (OPM), a rebel army that claims to protect the rights of Papuans by dispersing attacks and raids to kidnap Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the top leaders of the Free Papua Movement (OPM) were born in Paniai, including Tadius Youji and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
As a result, thousands of Paniai have been arrested and deliberately detained by the military in recent years under the guise of "defending national sovereignty"
Some never showed up again.
In the eyes of the Papuans, Paniai is a "forgotten place of tragedy."
Poverty feeds discontent.
Enarotari is selling so little rice that locals simply can't afford it.
Bread is simply out of reach.
People here grow everything they can eat: mainly sweet potatoes and some fruit and leafy vegetables.
Cultivation is a woman's job, and every woman can look after four or five sweet potato fields.
They usually keep most of the harvest for household use and sell the rest on the local market.
Ten sweet potatoes are worth just 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents.
Over time, economic inequality has opened up among local Papuans and new immigrants, whose numbers have increased significantly since the opening of the new route to Naypyre airport.
The few jobs available often end up in the hands of better-educated and wealthier immigrants.
Papuans have few funds or the requisite skills to run competitive companies.
"Young people don't want to stay in the village, because there is no work and no money," said John Gobai, chairman of the Paniai Tribal Council.
Papua is isolated.
In addition, restrictions on international media coverage remain tight.
Earlier this year, French journalists Frank Escudi and Basel Longchamp were ejected from Papua for "not cooperating with the relevant agencies," even though they had been given the rare authorization to shoot.
Jokowi's election vow to roll back reporting restrictions to promote transparency and development has not materialized, according to Filim Kane, deputy director for Asia at Human Rights Watch.
"If foreign journalists try to cover Papua and West Papua, Indonesia's easternmost disaffected provinces, there is a new risk: denial of visas and blacklisting," he said in a statement.
The absence of media monitoring means that international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely confined to Papua's neighbors.
In March, six Pacific nations - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands, Solomon Islands - asked the UN Human Rights Council to investigate "all kinds of widespread human rights violations" in Papua, including the Paniai shooting.
These countries also supported the Free Papua Movement (OPM).
Indonesia's foreign ministry spokesman, Almanata Nassir, shrugged off the group's allegations, telling reporters in Jakarta that "Indonesia is still a democracy and the media is free, so the evidence of human rights violations is hard to hide."
Locals want more foreign governments to value.
The local people broke their silence and pleaded "we want to be free," according to a person familiar with the matter, who also attended the meeting but spoke on condition of anonymity on May 4, when Dutch human rights ambassador Keyes Van Barr led a delegation of officials on a visit to Chayapra.
Indonesia will hold its next presidential election in 2019, but the Papuans say they are unlikely to vote for Jokowi again.
"The intentions of Jokowi were good, but he was surrounded by people who were involved in the Paniai shooting," said Gobai, who heads the tribal council.
He wants Jokowi to know that the people of Paniai not only live under the threat of a rapacious army, but have nothing, a region with little education and little public health care.
Gobaie said the people of Paniai, like other Papuans, thought their vote for Jokowi was a debt he had to pay.
"They don't need money, they need justice," he said.
Even under threat and intimidation, the families of the victims of the Paniai shooting made their last symbolic revolt: burying a victim's body opposite the military police post.
They know that justice may never come, but at least they won't let those responsible forget their crimes.
Yucabus lowered his head and said, "My family has been killed
What else can we do?
On February 10, 2017, the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) approved the initial application of Guangdong Shang House Home Joint Stock Co. Ltd. to issue the Shenzhen Stock Exchange's small- and-medium-sized board-listed pass, just over 20 days after the IPO home was first approved.
The industry believes that, with the addition of luxury houses and European homes on the market, the custom-built home sector, which is already in the wind, will shift from product competition to capital competition.
At the beginning of the new year, a typical representative brand in the field of custom-made homes will soon be on the market, attracting the attention of the entire home industry.
Beijing time 9 Reuters said that Samsung Electronics on Tuesday unveiled its first self-driving vehicle components, developed with Harman International, as well as an infotainment solution - an important step in its push into the automotive electronics market, according to Reuters.
Samsung Electronics bought Harman International about a year ago.
At the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas this week, Samsung unveiled car cameras with crash warnings, lane deflection alerts, cruise control features that were developed in partnership with Harman.
Samsung plans to start shipping the camera system this year, which is built on technology such as automatic machine learning and augmented reality.
Samsung also shows the "digital cockpit," which allows users to download driver information from mobile devices and clouds, even if the driver is not the owner of the vehicle, making the vehicle more personal.

Fire engulfs Dubai 'torch' skytower again
A fire at one of the world's highest residential buildings in Dubai forced hundreds of residents to flee the 337-metre, 79-storey supertall building on Friday.
It was the second fire to sweep high-rise buildings in just two years, and happened to be in the skyscraper known as the Torch.
The building has been evacuated, no injuries have been reported and no cause of the fire has been found.
"We were sleeping and then we were woken up by the fire alarm and people started screaming.
We ran down the stairs and it took about 10 minutes to run down the 50th floor, "a resident named George told Reuters.
Civil defence authorities in Dubai said the fire brigade put out the fire at around 4: 00 local time (0000 Greenwich Mean Time) and was cooling the building.
The government said it was working to provide shelter for those affected.
The accident could once again raise concerns around the world about the safety of materials used in high-rise buildings using external walls.
An investigation by the management of the "Torch" skyscraper after its 2015 fire found that most of the damaged objects were covered with cladding panels for decoration and insulation.
British police have said they believe problems with the insulation and cladding system at London's Grenfell Tower may have contributed to the rapid spread of the fire that killed about 80 people in June.
Williams also suggested there was a possibility Massa could return, although he has announced his retirement.
With just a month to go before the start of the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea, on January 9, the country has a growing atmosphere as the Olympic flame passes from south to north, preheating and preparations intensify.
South Korean public opinion expects the long-overdue inter-Korean talks to bring a "colored egg" to the countdown to the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics.
The flame of the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics arrived in South Korea on November 1 last year.
The flame-fueled craze is directly reflected in ticket sales for the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics.
Just over two months ago, ticket sales for the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics hovered at just 32%, with only 4.3pc of tickets sold for the Winter Games, and the lackluster ticket sales rate at one point raised concerns about the popularity of the Pyeongchang Winter Games.
But as Lee Hee-fan, president of the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics Organizing Committee, predicted to reporters not long ago, "as the Olympic flame passes through South Korea, the heat of the Winter Games is rising and it is believed that ticket sales will soon improve"
According to South Korean media reports, ticket sales for the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics had reached 64% as of January 3, and tickets for the Winter Paralympics had topped 50%.
In an effort to encourage foreigners to attend the Korean Games, South Korea's Ministry of Justice also announced Tuesday that it will extend the stay of foreigners who visit South Korea to watch the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics to a maximum of 120 days.
More than a fifth of U.S. travelers carry prohibited items on board, survey finds
A survey of plane passengers found that more than 20% had deliberately or unintentionally carried illegal items on board through TSA checkpoints, with at least 6% of them unintentionally carrying prohibited knives or other bladed objects.
Less than 1% of passengers declared that they had only discovered after the fact that they had travelled with firearms, ammunition or explosives by mistake.
The survey of more than 1,000 people, conducted by charter service Stratos Jet Charters Inc., also found that young travellers were more likely to flout regulations.
Of the respondents who admitted to attempting to board a plane with TSA contraband on purpose, 19.7% were millennials, compared with less than 15% of the X generation.
The most common items that deliberately slip past TSA security officers are food and drink.
More than 3% admitted to knowingly carrying a bladed substance through a security check, while 2.2% of female respondents and 3.7% of male respondents also said they had knowingly carried a banned substance on board.
The company said it surveyed travelers across the country to find out the number of people who accidentally carried and deliberately carried contraband through aircraft security check-in.
Not surprisingly, the people most likely to carry contraband through security - intentionally or unintentionally - are the ones who fly the most frequently.
However, the company points out that the TSA guide is a bit complicated and difficult to understand.
People are generally not sure what and how much liquid they can carry.
So it's no surprise that the most seized by TSA is precisely the prohibited liquid.
At one point it was thought that TSA might have treated books as contraband, too.
Domestic flights are allowed to carry liquids, but international flights are not.
EPA chief Pruett changes his mind on Obama-era emissions reduction regulations
A day after being sued by 15 states, EPA Administrator Scott Prut reversed his earlier decision to delay implementing Obama-era regulations to reduce emissions of smog air pollutants.
Prut offered to make the change because the EPA was able to respond more quickly to the needs of state agencies that regulate the environment than previous administrations.
He made no mention of the federal appeals court's legal challenge against his former position.
At issue is the setting of an October 1 deadline for states to begin meeting ground-level ozone standards for 2015.
In June, Prut announced he was delaying compliance for a year in order to give the EPA more time to study the plan and avoid "interfering with local decision-making or impeding economic growth"
Before being appointed by President Donald Trump, Prut was the attorney general of Oklahoma, long opposed to the toughening of environmental regulations.
Since arriving in Washington, Prut has repeatedly turned to blocking or delaying regulations opposed by the chemical and fossil fuel industries.
Wednesday's sudden reversal was the latest legal obstacle on Prut's regulatory return agenda.
Last month, a federal appeals court in Washington ruled that the head of the Environmental Protection Agency overstepped his authority to try to delay implementation of the Obama administration's rule requiring oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leaks.
In a statement released Wednesday night, Pruitt offered a U-turn on his approach to ozone standards, saying he wanted to strengthen the EPA's commitment to working with states to adopt complex procedures to reach new standards.
Mr Prut, who has launched more than a dozen prosecutions against the EPA in his previous work, said that "under the previous administration, the EPA usually did not meet the specified deadline, and then waited for activist groups and others to sue before agreeing to set a specified timetable through an agreement.
"We don't believe in regulation through litigation, we take deadlines seriously," he said.
We also take regulations and authorities seriously.
Still, the EPA's statement said Pruitt could again use his "extended mandate and all other legally available authorizations" to ensure regulations are in line with "good policies and the best information available.
Republicans in Congress are pushing for a broad rewrite of the ozone layer regulations.
The House bill, approved last month, aims to delay the 2015 rule for at least eight years.
The measure has yet to be voted on in the Senate.
New York State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman led a coalition of states to sue the EPA this week, saying it intended to maintain legal pressure.
"The EPA reversal-after we filed a lawsuit-is a significant victory for the health and safety of 6.7 million New Yorkers, with more than 115 million American communities directly affected by smog emissions," Schneiderman said.
California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington, and the District of Columbia all joined New York in the case.
Ground-level ozone is formed when common pollutants emitted by cars, power plants, oil refineries, chemical plants and other sources react under sunlight in the atmosphere.
The resulting smoke can cause severe respiratory problems for sensitive people, causing thousands of premature deaths each year.
Of course, public health advocates and environmentalists have hailed Prut's surprising transformation.
Lori Ann Bird, of the Centre for Biological Diversity, said: "It is disturbing that this commonsense measure has come under enormous pressure from the head of the department that protects the air we need to breathe.
"We must fight the Trump administration's ideological campaign to cater to polluters and special interests."

Since the second half of 2009, sales of Xiaoshan flowers and trees have remained relatively high, especially this spring, when sales of Xiaoshan seedlings reached an all-time high, with huge increases in sales and prices. According to statistics, in January-June this year, Xiaoshan achieved a 48% increase in sales of seedlings over the same period last year, with the largest increase in nearly 20 years.
Xiaoshan District Forestry Bureau deputy director Shi Haiyong said that with the good sales situation, Xiaoshan flower and wood production has also achieved a relatively rapid development.
In the past two years, the planting area of Xiaoshan flowers and trees has expanded by 30,000 mu, reaching a total area of 180,000 mu. At the same time, the planting area of Xiaoshan flowers and trees has been expanded to reach 80,000 mu, an increase of 30,000 mu over 2008.
Along with the expansion of planting area, the quality of seedlings has been improved, the value of nursery has been increased, large-scale, high-quality seedlings have been retained, and some seedlings have been sold.
Shi also cautioned that in the face of the current boom in production and marketing, producers should be calm, objective analysis, both to see that the social demand for flowers and trees will be long-term, increasing, but also to recognize that the market competition will be more intense.
On the morning of July 13, Beijing time, the US company Somaltus filed a lawsuit in the East Texas District Court, accusing Apple of violating a battery technology patent it filed in 2010.
The company has previously used the same patents to sue Asus, Lenovo, Samsung, Sony and Toshiba.
The suit alleges that both the iPhone 6s and similar Apple devices violated U.S. patent number 7,657,386, known as the Integrated Battery Service System.
Plaintiffs want to receive cash compensation, or a patent fee for infringing equipment after the verdict is announced.
Judging from the indictment, the plaintiff appeared to argue that iPhone's fast-charging features violated the company's patents.
A fast-charging iPhone would charge up to 80% of the electricity quickly, followed by a trickle charge.
Somaltus is actually a so-called "patent hooligan" because the company does not offer obvious products and services, and it is difficult to find relevant information online.
However, they have managed to reach an out-of-court settlement with automakers such as Ford and Nissan over the patent.
The meeting held that accelerating the development of information technology, promoting the integration and efficient use of resources, and raising the level of digitization and intellectualization of industries are of great significance in promoting "Made in China 2025" and mass entrepreneurship and mass innovation, fostering new energy and improving the quality of life of the masses.

Trump had pressed Mexico to pay for the border wall, according to leaked phone records
The Washington Post has leaked transcripts of calls between US President Donald Trump and the leaders of Mexico and Australia.
In a call to Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto on January 27, Trump urged him to stop publicly saying he would not pay for the proposed border wall.
The President of the United States reportedly resented his public attack on the wall, to which he allegedly told him: "You don't tell the media."
During his presidential campaign, Trump promised to build the wall on the southern border of the United States and solemnly declared that Mexico would pay for the project.
The transcript of his call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, which showed a tense exchange between them, was also released.
Mr Trump told Mr Turnbull that it was "ridiculous," "nasty" and "stupid" for the US to take on the deal to send refugees to Australia, and that he had suggested the US ban on refugee resettlement, which would now make him look like a "fool" by sticking to a deal mediated by the Obama administration.

Seoul, January 9 (Xinhua) -- South Korea and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) concluded high-level talks at Panmunjom on Saturday night, issuing a joint statement to reach agreement on the participation of the DPRK in the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics and the holding of talks between the two sides in the military sector.
According to the joint statement issued by the two sides, the DPRK will send a high-level delegation and a delegation from the National Olympic Committee to the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics.
In addition, the DPRK will send athletes, cheerleaders, art groups, press corps and other groups to visit South Korea; and the Korean side provided the necessary facilities for this.
The two Koreas also agreed to ease current military tensions and decided to hold talks between the military departments of the two Koreas.

Moore Beach tragedy: Activists recreate racist mob justice
A 1948 Ford Mercury car rumbles through a crowd of onlookers in the small town of Monroe, Georgia, toward the tiny Moore Beach Bridge.
The car, which was carrying four black passengers and a white driver, was blocked by a group of white men with guns walking forward before the car arrived at the bridge.
The mob's leader - a middle-aged man in a pinstripe suit-takes a deep sip of a cigar and glances into the windscreen.
The occupants of the car were filled with fear.
"We want-Roger!" the man shouted.
"Drag him out of the car
A young black man was dragged from the front passenger seat and screams pierced the silence.
Fortunately, the horrific scene on July 22 was just a repeat.
But when the noose was put around the neck of "Roger," there was a real gasp from almost all the onlookers.
Since 2005, civil rights activists have returned to the Moore Beach Bridge to recreate scenes from the night two black couples-Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and Meirey Dossey-were strangled by the K party in 1946.
No one has ever been charged with murder.
"Although we know who they are, and although we have seen them in the community, it is incredible that none of them have been arrested over the years," said Tyrone Brooks, who helped organize the re-enactment.
"This is a stain on history, a burden on our souls.
Brooks, 71, is a former Georgia congressman and lifelong rights activist.
For him, the re-enactment is a compelling call to action, an annual reminder to people in the Monroe community that injustice has never been corrected.
We want to sue, we want to close the case, we want to heal, we want to reconcile, but we have to get justice first, "he said.
"Unless we get justice, we will not get healing and reconciliation.
On July 27, 1946, the coroner put a sheet over the body of a Moore Beach vigilante victim.
According to FBI files obtained by NBC News, more than 50 men from Monroe and surrounding counties are suspected of involvement in the mob.
But none of them have ever been charged.
While the suspects have been on the loose for decades, civil rights activists say the dual motive for carrying out the vigilantes is well known throughout the town: politics and sex.
In April 1946, a Supreme Court ruling allowed black citizens in Georgia to vote in a primary for the first time later that summer.
Around the same time, black sharecropper Roger Malcolm stabbed white landowner Barnett Hirst in a fight-looking like it was for a woman, according to FBI statistics.
Brooks said the town's rumor was that Hirst had slept with Malcolm's wife, Dorothy, and that her baby was not her husband's.
On July 25, 1946, prominent white landowner Roy Harrison paid $600 to free Malcolm on bail, the FBI said.
Dorothy and Cousins Mack and George Dorsey accompanied him to prison.
But as they returned from prison and approached Moore Beach Bridge, a mob of vigilantes surrounded the car.
"It turned out that it was Harrison who organised and ordered the murder," a FBI report concluded.
"It is clear that there is a conspiracy between state and local law enforcement that not only participated in the murder, destroyed the evidence, but also concealed the identity of the witness.
Brooks is very concise.
"This is a voting tragedy," he said.
"It was the killers who sent a message to the black people of this community:'If you register and vote, you will have the same ending.
For nearly a decade, Cassandra Green has been in charge of leading the annual re-enactment of the Moore Beach Bridge vigilante tragedy.
Her expressive style is vivid and gripping, with a deeply racist background that many hope no longer exists in the United States.
It's hard to watch, it's harder not to watch, but Green says that's the point.
"We don't want to talk about vigilantism because it makes us face the ugly face of everyone," she said.
"But if you don't listen to me, or if you don't hear me tell you about my experience, I can't build a relationship with you.
This year's show began in June, with nearly 30 actors - a dozen white and the rest black-packed into a room on the first day to hear Green release a rehearsed overview of the show.
Wade Malbow as Green's co-director.
He has played the role of the K party for years, but says the role has never been easy.
I feel dirty because that's not who I am,' Malbow said.
"But I think it's very important to keep this history alive, because we don't want to go back to that time."
In the room, actors Darios Bradshaw and Nick Lascona, who play Roger Malcolm and Barnet Hurst, rehearse their lines.
The scene begins with Malcolm shouting and pushing away Hearst, furious that he has slept with his wife, Dorothy.
"I say, get out of my place
Rascona shot back.
Then they fought.
Then everyone (at least all black actors) burst into laughter.
Green laughs the most.
"What's the matter?!" asked Rascona.
He was alarmed and confused.
Did I overdo it?
No, "Green said with a laugh.
"I just don't think white people say 'ah' when they hit back.
"Yes," quipped another black actor.
"Your tone must be strong.
In this way, the energy in the room changes; the feeling of camaraderie drives away the discomfort.
Everyone tried to do it, not just to perform the scene, but also to honor the four victims.
The scene starts again.
This time, Rascona said the word "ah" with a sharp and forceful tone.
None of them laughed.
The re-enactment ended powerfully and quickly.
Screams, gunshots, and then, there was silence.
A woman in a funeral black stood at the actor's side and sang Billy Halladay's eulogies of 'strange fruit'
Her voice trumped other words.
A hundred yards away, about forty spectators were constantly wiping sweat and tears.
The audience was almost evenly split between black and white.
There was a couple who made the trip from Ithaca, New York, to see the show, and a lot of people who lived just off the road.
Brooks took them to worship at the cemetery in Malcolm and Dorothy, nearly eight hours away, and everyone was enduring Georgia's uncomfortable sense of humidity.
Until then, the murderer was still a mystery, but now, standing on the same land where the lynching took place, there was anxiety in the air.
When the final notes of the song disappear, Green asks people to get closer and examine the body played by the actor.
The children bent over, looking at fake blood and bodies, whispering to each other.
"They're not really dead," a little boy muttered, as if to remind himself.
A few minutes later, Green thanked the crowd and then the show ended.
The actor shook off the rope and wiped away his tears.
Bradshaw hugged Malbao, the suit man who plays the head of the three K party.
Nick Lascona hugs his two colleagues and cries in their arms; the emotion in the performance eventually infects him.
It's OK, ' one of the women whispered.
"We know you don't have that in your heart.
You did it for a reason.
Afterward, the audience sat down for dinner with the cast.
On the same table, a white couple from Atlanta chatted closely with a black couple they had just met about the re-enactment.
Denise Duplinsky struggled to find words to describe how she felt after watching.
"It's hard to imagine the horrible words and actions, that people like you say and do because they look like you," she said.
"It really makes me think that vigilantism is still going on," she added. "Now it's just a police shooting."
In the room, Tyrone Brooks sat at the table watching, savoring and recalling civil rights.
He said he had started planning his show for next year.
"Reenactment is an inspiring way because it describes the horrors we have experienced, but it is also very educational," he said.
"If you don't learn from it, it could happen again.
Those who do not study and understand their own history are doomed to repeat it.
For the reform of natural gas marketization, the importance of the reform of "network independence" is self-evident, but the resistance and controversy are also greater.
7 (Xinhua) -- At 11: 25 a.m. on Sunday, an explosion occurred in the emulsifying workshop of Kailuan Group Chemical Co. Ltd., located in the ancient metallurgical district of Tangshan City, Hebei Province. Thirteen operators were trapped at the scene.
One of the 13 people trapped so far has been rescued and rushed to hospital, while the remaining 12 are in intensive search and rescue.
It is understood that the scene has been sealed off and local public security, fire, medical and other departments are on the scene to rescue.
According to witnesses, there was a loud bang and a mushroom cloud went up in the air.
According to the personnel of Kailuan Group, which organized the search and rescue on the spot, Tangshan Kailuan Chemical Co., Ltd. is located in Chao Guzhuang North, Tangshan District, Hebei Province. It is a state-approved enterprise engaged in the production of explosives for civilian use. It was founded in 1958 and was formerly known as Kailuan Mining Bureau Six O II Factory.

However, the fans did not express any dissatisfaction with this, but instead sent a blessing, because the reason for the breach of contract is that Jay became a happy father.
After a full year and a half of waiting, Jay finally came to Beijing yesterday to present his first work since he upgraded his father, and the 14th album of his musical career, Jay Chou's Bedtime Tale.
US media: Chinese Air Force Engineering University scientists study laser satellites used to remove space junk
Chinese scientists have come up with a bold and innovative proposal to use a large laser to clean up a cluttered Earth's orbit and destroy old satellites as well as its sky junk, US media reported on January 18.
Researchers at the Air Force Engineering University of China have written a paper entitled "Space-based laser removal small-scale space debris orbit-shifting model study", which describes how space debris can be irradiated into smaller, less hazardous pieces by using a space-based platform laser.
Space junk has been a concern for international space agencies for years, with NASA considering a variety of options to track, detect and remove man-made debris, the report said.
The ways to remove large-scale space debris include giant nets used to sweep and collect waste, and magnets that can be used to suck them out of orbit. Chinese scientists conducted a laser simulation study and concluded that this would be an effective way to clean up Earth's orbit.
The abstract of the paper states: "The (simulation study) provides the necessary theoretical basis for the application of space-based platform laser space debris removal technology.
Research by US defence giant Lockheed-Martin in 2014 found that there were about 200 threats a day for satellites in orbit.
High-speed debris moving along Earth's orbit is seen as a serious threat to future space missions and has been described as a "deadly cascade of threats" by experts at the European Space Agency, which has seen a steady increase in high-speed debris in each of the past years.
Each of the satellites we send into space will eventually turn into another piece of debris orbiting the Earth, which will accumulate over time.
The more debris there is, the higher the chance that a still-functioning satellite will be hit by debris, thereby damaging or destroying a multimillion-dollar investment.
All space agencies have plans in place to remove space junk in the future, reports say.
NASA is considering using jet gas to reduce the speed of the debris and de-orbit it, and Europe is considering launching a satellite with a large net to capture the debris and bring it back to Earth, with the Japanese idea of capturing the debris with an electric chain.
For now, China is also proposing a solution to space junk by using a large laser to smash floating space junk into smaller, less harmful pieces.
The installation of such a laser on a satellite would be effective enough to clean up space, at least according to simulation results, according to a paper published by a group of researchers at the Air Force Engineering University of China in the German monthly journal Optics.
The only way to prove effectiveness is to test it, the report said. No such mission has been scheduled, but sooner or later someone might install a laser on a satellite and send it into space.
Once that is done, we can finally begin to eliminate the problem of space junk once and for all.

Pei Sheng Group cuts another 3,000 jobs, slashes dividend to revive business
The UK education group Pei Sang Group said Friday it will cut another 3,000 jobs and slash its interim dividend by 72% as it begins another restructuring project to deal with business pressures.
Chief executive John Fallon said most of the job cuts would take place in the second half of 2018 and the first half of 2019, with 4,000 jobs already cut in previous restructurings.
The group announced plans in May to cut a further 300 million pounds ($394 million) in costs in a third cost-cutting project to revive a business hit by the rapid development of digital learning.
Last month it agreed to sell its stake in Penguin Random House to partner Bertelsmann and published a report saying its underlying sales rose 1% in the first half to 2.05 billion pounds, but said the outlook for the year was unchanged.
A few days ago, China's IAAF seriously issued a notice to severely replace the running phenomenon, and is prepared to impose a lifetime ban on violators of the heavy penalty.
NATO soldier killed in suicide bombing attack on convoy in Kabul
A military convoy has been hit by a suicide bomber in the Afghan capital Kabul, killing one NATO soldier and injuring several others, according to official sources.
Five soldiers and an interpreter were injured, the NATO statement said.
Three civilians also died in the incident in the Karabag area of the city, according to unconfirmed local reports.
It was the latest violent attack to hit Afghanistan-more than 30 people were killed in Tuesday's bombing of the Herat mosque.
A suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul on Monday.
A joint patrol of Afghan and NATO forces was hit by "individuals carrying improvised explosive devices" in an explosion on Thursday night, according to the NATO statement.
All of the injured are in stable condition and are being treated at the US military hospital at Bagram Air Base, the statement said.
The growing presence of the Taliban and the so-called Islamic State (IS) group in the Karabakh region has raised serious concerns among NATO forces stationed near Bagram, according to journalists.
According to the United Nations, at least 1,662 civilians died in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, compared with about 20% in the capital.
At least 30 people were killed in a suicide car bomb attack in a predominantly Shia area of Kabul in late July.
The Taliban claim they carried out the attack.
On 31 May, a massive explosion killed more than 150 people in central Kabul, the deadliest militant attack in the country since the United States-led multinational force toppled the Taliban in 2001.
The violence highlights the precarious security situation in the country as US President Donald Trump weighs whether to send more troops to Afghanistan to support his troops and police.
The suicide bombings in Kabul in recent weeks have also triggered a crisis of public trust in the government and its policies, particularly the reputation of President Ashraf Ghani, according to reporters.
The National Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) overturned the resolution after a lawsuit to delay smoke regulations
Fifteen states sued the U.S. National Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) over a rule Obama made when he was in office that required states to curb all kinds of emissions that cause smog. A day after the indictment, EPA overturned the rule.
The EPA on Wednesday announced its decision to continue the so-called "2015 ozone compliance zone" and promised the agency would work with the states.
"We are confident in dialogue with our national partners and are committed to responding to them," EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt said in a statement.
Pruitt announced in June that the EPA planned to delay the implementation of the ozone-compliant zone standards until October 2018 for a year-under which existing smog pollution in some areas would be measured to determine which areas should reduce emissions that cause smog pollution to meet air quality standards.
Fifteen major Democratic states, as well as the District of Columbia, filed suit Tuesday, declaring the action illegal.
As part of a broader agenda, President Donald Trump's administration has been working to revive various environmental regulations pushed by former President Barack Obama to spur economic growth.
But the efforts have sparked opposition from Democrats and conservative groups, who fear more emissions could affect public health.
Breathing ozone-containing air "reduces lung function and increases respiratory symptoms," such as asthma, the EPA website declares.

McKee Garcia and Vasily Lomachenko meet for the first time to explore a possible future showdown
The most high-profile under-147lbs boxing event will take place soon, with Vasily Lomachenko and Maki Garcia, currently in a state of potential conflict, meeting for the first time on Thursday.
They were in separate rooms at the ESPN offices in Los Angeles, where undefeated World Boxing Council featherweight champion Garcia led the way down the hallway to greet World Boxing Organization super-featherweight champion Lomachenko.
At the Showtime boxing event on Saturday, the referee unanimously decided that Garcia had beaten four-division world champion Adrian Broner to victory, by which time both fighters had become top five players in the same heavyweight list.
Garcia stretched out his right hand and said, "How are you, champ?
Good luck to you.
Lomachenko retained his status with a win over Miguel Mariaga in the ESPN at 7 p.m. on Saturday.
When the two of them took photos, Lomachenko's agent, Egis Klimas, pointed out that the potential matchup between the two players depended on 'perfect size'
I was a lightweight before,' said Garcia.
"I upgraded to play against Broner (140 pounds), but I didn't weigh that much.
Relative to 140 pounds, I'm a little short of my weight.
I want to go back to lightweight.
And he had to reach lightweight (135 pounds) before we could fight.
That's what fans want, too.
Then we'll satisfy them.
Lomachenko agreed.
"The boxing world needs this fight.
Klimas asked if he should be charged on a pay-per-view basis, and part of his strategy was to have Lomachenko make his debut with a 135-pound player later this year to set a date for next summer with Garcia (37-0, 30 knockout). Garcia is also interested in taking on the winner of Jorge Linares-Luke Campbell's fight after the Forum featherweight title fight on September 23.
"Since all the fans are asking the question, the game is probably a pay-per-view," Garcia said, after which he was open to playing on the network that offers the best financial solutions.
"We are the main characters.
It's impossible for anyone else to generate so much attention.
As long as they're ready,
Garcia appreciates that Lomachenko is "an outstanding player" and may watch his boxing match on Saturday live.
But Lomachenko balked at Garcia's praise, saying he thought the three-division winner from Riverside looked "slow. Sorry, McKee, you're going to be eliminated."
The point, Garcia says, is to show the power of the fist, and then boxing.
They all said they could feel the momentum of their own boxing match.
"It is a battle that must be fought
Attention and heat are beyond the reach of other boxing matches.
I'm more than happy to compete, "Garcia said.
Lomachenko said: "I've been waiting for the top fighters and this time it's McKee's turn.
It will be a great battle.

Officials of the China Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) have expressed strong expectations for a resumption of production in the steel industry, which is being held down by limited electricity production, in response to the early completion of the 11th five-year reduction target.
Although no clear notification has been received from the local government that the energy saving and emission reduction work has been completed, the industry estimates that on or about December 15, 2010, production will be resumed and steel prices will begin to be pressurized.
No notice of the end of the production limit has been received, but in fact the pressure on individual companies has been much less than in September and October, a private steel entrepreneur in Hebei province told reporters.
In some parts of Hebei province, the production restriction documents were issued several times, and at one time, the production of enterprises was restricted by means of forced sluice-pulling.
Reporters from local enterprises understand that the vast majority of Hebei's steel mills have resumed work, production-limiting pressure relief.
My steel network analyst, Zhang Tieshan, expects the terminal demand for building steel to gradually weaken from strength to strength as the north is already wintering.
Together with the gradual end of energy-saving emission reduction, by December 15, most of the steel mills will basically resume production, products will arrive in the local market before New Year's Day.
The increase in the supply of resources will put some pressure on steel prices, which are currently on the rise.

18 (Xinhua) -- The Economic and Commercial Affairs Department of the Italian Embassy in China held a China-Italy environmental talks on Monday to exchange views and reach a positive consensus on the cooperation between the two countries in the field of renewable resources in the new situation.
According to the information received, the Chinese delegation is mainly represented by China Renewable Resources Development Co. Ltd., China International Technology Transfer Cooperation Network, and the Italian side is composed of the Global Energy Environmental Exchange Organization and the Bologna Regional Business Association of Italy, among others.
The representative of Italy said that his country had a wide range of environmental technologies and solutions in the area of renewable resources and proposed a pilot project with China on industrial waste disposal, waste oil treatment and waste incineration equipment, while looking forward to extending its experience of environmental cooperation with China to other parts of the world.
The latest results of the Swedish asylum seeker's age assessment test are published
The Swedish asylum seeker test used the latest method to medically assess their age, with the latest results showing that more than 80% of the subjects were judged to be over 18, but not all believed in its accuracy.
The R? ttsmedicinalverket began the test earlier this year.
After allegedly failing to accurately assess the age of some of the refugees claiming to be minors, the Swedish Migration Board (Migrationsverket) designed the tests with a view to conducting a more accurate age assessment during the asylum process.
So far, the Swedish Migration Board (Migrationsverket) has sent in 6,880 testers, and the Forensic Science Centre has now published the results of a total of 2,481 testers for the period from mid-March to 31 July 2017.
80% (2002) were judged to be 18 years of age or older, while in another 25 cases, the Swedish National Centre for Forensic Medicine determined that the subject was "likely to be 18 years of age or older"
In 432 tests, the result was that the person "may be under 18."
The test is only for people whose age is in doubt.
The results are consistent with those of previous months, according to John Granson of the Center for Forensic Medicine.
He told The Local: "These figures are not very different from those of previous months and are very consistent."
The high proportion of cases where the age of the asylum-seeker has been determined to be over 18 does not necessarily mean that the asylum-seeker has lied about his age.
In May, the center published 581 test results and said there were 442 cases "indicating that the subject was 18 years of age or older"
News newspaper Svenska Dagbladet examined the results of the 581 tests published and found that 243 of the subjects had publicly stated that they would be 18 years old this year.
A X ray examination of the wisdom teeth, an MRI scan of the joints and an analysis of the results by dentists and radiologists have also been questioned in some areas.
One of the skeptics is Claude Marcus, an endocrinologist at Caroline College, whose work involves assessing people's biological maturity to determine whether they experience adolescence earlier or later than their normal age.
He told the newspaper Metro: "I have reason to think so, and I don't think the measurements used should be this way.
It is very inaccurate to judge physiological age in such a way.
If we cannot guarantee accuracy, we should not pretend that we can.
But Granson, of the Forensic Medicine Center, defended the accuracy of the tests: "The risk of uncertainty in determining a child as an adult is, by and large, small."
The greatest risk is that the person is just under the age of 18, which accounts for about 10% of the cases.
West Virginia Governor Announces Party Change
On Thursday night, Jim Justice, the Democratic governor of West Virginia, announced at a rally for President Trump that he would change his party.
"Like it or not, the Democrats have left me," the governor said.
"Today, after a lot of prayer and a lot of thinking, I'm going to tell you, I'm going to tell you today, as West Virginians, that I can no longer help you as a Democratic governor."
The rally erupted in cheers.
"So tomorrow, I'm going to change the party to a Republican," Justice added.
"As a coach, I'm going to tell you it's time to start another game."
Trump earlier promised a major announcement at a rally in West Virginia.
Mr. Trump won 42% of the vote in West Virginia, and Justice did not support Hillary Clinton, the Democratic nominee.
According to Forbes, Justice was named the state's only billionaire in 2016.
Forbes noted that he inherited his father's coal industry and owned coal mines in all five states.
Currently, he is worth about $1.59 billion.
Meanwhile, the Republican National Committee issued a statement late Thursday saying: "Governor Justice's change of party is another blow to the Democratic Party and will not prevent our country from becoming great again, but will make our country great again."
"With only 15 governors in the Democratic Party and the lowest number ever in control of a state legislature, Governor Justice's statement is the latest rejection of a party that has lost its leadership from top to bottom and cannot find a positive unifying slogan," Rona McDaniel, chairwoman of the Republican National Committee, said in a statement to CBS News.

Sebastian Coe praised Russia for 'candid' apology over doping scandal
On Thursday, the president of the International Association of Athletics Federations, Sebastian Coe, praised Russia for apologizing over the doping scandal and described the apology as "candid," but reiterated that it was not the time for Russia to rejoin the sport either.
Speaking at the IAAF congress on the eve of the world athletics championship, the head of Russia's track and field federation, Mitri Hillactin, said his country was right to be banned from the sport and was determined to crack down on doping.
He said he regretted that "all the athletes who won gold and silver in the competition were stripped of their medals."
Despite his comments, the IAAF General Assembly voted to maintain the ban, which was imposed in November 2015 after the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) report referred to the discovery of evidence of state-sponsored doping in Russia.
"I think the response today was very frank and very frank," IAAF President Coe told reporters.
"The whole Council and the IAAF General Assembly are very happy, the Russian Federation acknowledges that it has gone through a very anxious period and is doing everything possible to ensure that Russia is able to re-enter the competition."
Coe said he was also "pleased" that Russia accepted the criteria for re-entry.
"I think it's a very constructive day and I think we've made some progress, but the IAAF General Assembly supports the panel's recommendation that this is not the time to reinstate Russia," Coe said.
"We need to do everything we can in the coming months to normalise this situation," he said.
Our guiding principle has always been the desire to separate clean athletes from contaminated systems, "he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes meet the strict criteria of the IAAF and will compete as neutral players in the world track and field championship in London on Friday.
The head of the IAAF's task force, Jon Anderson, said on Monday that Russia had not met a number of criteria to resume its participation.
He told reporters after a speech to the IAAF Council in London that drug testing was still inadequate and that banned coaches were still coaching.

The yuan's median price of 6.4401 depreciated 66 basis points in a row of gains has been put on hold
Macro Economic Tencent Finance 2018-01-18 09: 50 Share
Tencent Financial News January 18, the yuan to the United States dollar median price of 6.4401, the last session of the median price depreciated 66 basis points, ending the previous five consecutive gains.
The overnight market, the dollar warmer, the dollar index out of the V shape, as of 07: 30 Beijing time at 90.8900.
Almost all of the 12 Fed regions reported moderate to moderate growth in economic activity in early 2018 and remain optimistic about the outlook for the year, according to the Fed's economic brown paper.
Meanwhile, the U.S. unemployment rate remained at 4.1pc in December, the lowest since 2000, and companies are expected to raise wages in the coming months.
Federal Reserve officials generally view tax reform as a factor underpinning this moderately strong economic outlook, with the Fed forecasting 2.5pc growth and three rate increases in 2018.
Market participants pointed out that the recent tightening of monetary policy by the European Central Bank was expected to push up the euro exchange rate, with the US dollar index continuing to slide, and the renminbi's exchange rate against the US dollar showing a correspondingly rapid rally. However, for now, the ECB is unlikely to adjust its policy stance any time soon. After short-term fluctuations in the foreign exchange market, it is likely to return to fundamentals and the renminbi exchange rate will remain stable.
It is worth noting that the attractiveness of renminbi assets to overseas investors has gradually become apparent as the market's expectations for the yuan have become more flat.

Our reporter, Cai Changchun, learned from the Ministry of Public Security today that the case of the transnational series of telecommunications network fraud, which was solved by the Ministry of Public Security and the police in Xiangyang, Hubei Province, in cooperation with the Malaysian Police, is a more representative case of the Taiwan-based telecommunications network fraud.
What is the impact of football's financial rules on Neymar's move to Paris?
Rules designed to prevent unrestricted spending by big European football clubs will not prevent Neymar from moving from Barcelona in Spain to PSG in France for a record fee.
As a result, the European Football Association (UEFA), the governing body of European football and the right to ban teams from the much-watched Champions League, has further downgraded PSG.
The Financial Fair Play Rule (FFP), introduced by UEFA in 2011, means that PSG will eventually have to prove that Neymar's transfer is funded without incurring huge losses.
The Barcelona club have already paid 222 million euros ($262 million) just to pay for the Brazilian player's release, while Neymar will be paid tens of millions of dollars a year.
Here are some of the financial implications of Neymar's move to France.
Given that the team is funded by the wealthy Qatari ruling family, PSG could, of course, sign Neymar for cash and include him in other star-studded squads.
Clubs can spend huge sums on players, but they must use legitimate sources of income to make up for the huge sums spent and make them break even in football-related businesses.
The Financial Fair Play Rules (FFP) were conceived by Michel Platini after he was elected UEFA president in 2007.
The former French player believes that for clubs who are heavily in debt in pursuit of success, they are effectively cheating and putting the club at risk of destruction if the bank or everyone pulls back their support funding.
In 2011, the focus of the Rules shifted from the issue of club debt to the monitoring of club losses.
The change means that the business model used by Roman Abramovich when he bought Chelsea in 2003, buying a potential club and then spending heavily to improve the team and build a global brand, is now in a more demanding position.
The club could lose 30 million euros over the three-year rule review period ending in 2018.
Although Abramovich was disparaged by the then-president in 2015, UEFA's successor, Aleksander Ceferin, remains committed to stopping excessive spending.
"Of course the Rules have not lapsed, and we will certainly strengthen future regulations," Andrea Traverso, UEFA's director of rules-related matters, told The Associated Press last week.
Although PSG pays Neymar's buy-out clause in one lump sum, it can also distribute the amount for accounting purposes over the term of the contract.
Neymar has signed a five-year deal, so the transfer fee could show up as a fee of 44.4 million euros in its annual accounts for the next five years.
The first wave of Rules sanctions, imposed in 2014, saw the most severe sanctions imposed on the PSG, as well as the Manchester City club owned by Abu Dhabi.
PSG was sentenced to a fine of 60 million euros ($82 million at current exchange rates), later reduced to 20 million euros, and required the team to reduce the number of players to 21 instead of the normal 25 in the 2014-15 Champions League season.
UEFA is eyeing clubs that are trying to boost revenue by linking up with club owners and cheating financial regulators.
While Qatari companies can sponsor PSG, UEFA will not treat sponsorship as legal income if it is deemed to exceed the standard market price.
That was what happened in 2014, when UEFA ruled that the Qatar Tourism Authority's sponsorship of the PSG had been overstated.
It has been reported that a portion of Neymar's revenues at PSG could come from payments made by Qatar's World Cup organizing committee in 2022.
But PSG and the organizing committee have both denied that Neymar will be an ambassador for the World Cup, and such a move would be easy for UEFA's regulators.
Recent sanctions imposed on Paris Saint-Germain Football Club (PGS) mean UEFA will be more wary of any attempt to circumvent the rules.
UEFA has not held pre-talks with PSG about a move for Neymar, people familiar with the matter said on Thursday.
All of the above-mentioned individuals approached the Associated Press only in an anonymous capacity, as they were not authorized to discuss the status of PSG, the Paris Saint-Germain football club.
The last accounts published showed that PSG had an operating income of 542.4 million euros in 2015-16, making a profit of more than 10 million euros.
The accounts for the previous fiscal year have not been published.
PSG expects the arrival of Neymar to be a boon to sponsorship activities, franchises and shirt sales.
The club expects revenue to grow by at least 30% after signing Neymar.
Clearly, the Spanish league was furious to see the most famous of the players leave, trying to block Neymar's move and claiming that PSG had violated the rules.
The president of La Liga, Javier Tebas, told Spanish newspaper AS that "this is a clear example of a 'financial doping' in which the club and the country are the same," referring to Qatar, which has ultimate ownership of PSG, the Paris Saint-Germain football club.
Arsene Wenger, the head coach of the Arsenal team, which is owned by an American sports tycoon, has reservations about state-sponsored clubs and La Liga.
"It's a consequence of ownership, and it's completely changed the whole ecology of football over the last 15 years," Wenger said on Thursday.
"Once the country has a club, then anything happens.
This would make it very difficult to comply with the Rules, as there are many different ways or interests for a country to require big-name players to represent a country.
Smart interactive robot developer Rokid gets new investment in Temasek lead
In recent years, start-ups in the field of artificial intelligence have continued to enjoy a capital boom.
AI Rokid recently completed a new round of financing, led by Temasek, followed by Credit Suisse, CDIB (the investment arm of Taiwan's China Development Finance Holdings), and veteran shareholder IDG Capital.
Credit Suisse and CDIB are said to have made their first appearance in a domestic AI financing deal, with funding of about $100 million.

According to Apple, from February 28 this year, the iCloud service in mainland China will be transferred to the Guizhou company on the cloud to operate.
"The partnership with Guizhou on the cloud will allow us to continue to improve the speed and reliability of iCloud services, in line with new rules that require local companies to operate cloud services in China," Apple said.
During deactivation, the data previously stored by the user in iCloud will also be stored in iCloud and will not be lost.
If users want to use the iCloud service after February 28, they need to first accept the new terms and conditions to ensure that the account is reactivated and relocated to Guizhou in the cloud.
At the same time, Apple stressed in its statement that "Apple has strong data privacy and security protection mechanisms and does not create backdoors in any of our systems."
The main data center in iCloud's new district will also be Apple's first data center project in China, which, when completed, will be used to store data from Apple users in China.
When built and put into use, Chinese users upload and download data without having to travel long distances between China and the US, increasing speed and reducing latency.

Zou, director of "Legend of Bean," director of "Legend of Bean," animation director of "Legend of Bean," and TomDisher, producer of the film and winner of the Emmys, all appeared to share the behind-the-scenes story of the film's creation.
"Legend of Bean" is based on the story of Liu'an, the King of Huainan in the Han Dynasty of Chinese traditional culture, and is derived from the traditional allusion of "Liu'an made tofu by mistake". It tells the story of the main character, "Bean Fu", who was transformed from a bean into a human figure, overcame many difficulties and persisted in his dream.
Wudang Mountain, located in the city of Shiyan in Hubei Province, is one of the world cultural heritage sites declared by the United Nations. It is also the birthplace of Taoist culture and Wudang Wushu. It is called "the first fairy mountain in the world."
Zou, the director, revealed that he had travelled to Wudang Mountain with the main creative team in the early stages of the film's creation.
He said that the story of "Legend of Bean" took place in the Western Han Dynasty in the years of Emperor Wu, in the background of the King of Huainan, Liu Anjianxian Xianxian, the hero of the film "Bean Fu" is an accidental transformation into a human-shaped bean at the time of Andy Liu.
In addition to Wudang Mountain, which is the cradle of Taoist culture, Hubei also has a deep connection with the chime, a traditional musical instrument with a long history in China.
At a recent international conference, experts expected robots with artificial intelligence to walk into people's bedrooms in 25 years to provide a variety of services to humans.
Through research, scientists have found that memory has one of its biggest characteristics, namely its inaccuracy.
"Thunderstorm", created in 1934, was Cao Yu's first work, a symbol of the maturity of modern Chinese drama, and the most widely translated Chinese drama.
Nostalgic infectious force is popular in the market - "Hala Camp" and "Detective double hero"
Retelling the story is a nostalgic reminder of the cast's' 80s glory days as well as the '90s grunge era (before and after David Wayne and Michael Schuette produced the sketch comedy "The Nation" for MTV); It is also a nostalgic memory, a nostalgic memory of 2001; The year before, a host of stars such as Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Luther had yet to hit the water.
As a cultural artifact, it is the imitation and embodiment of the permanent memories of our Facebook era.
But as a series, it feels like time is running out.
The response after the first day of camp was strong, but it wasn't just because of its absurd humor (the plot is an original story about a talking can of vegetables, voiced by H Jon Benjamin).
The plot doubles the use of the core laugh terrier - the middle-aged actor plays a child at the age of the troublemaker-which makes the inability to return to the past a part of the hilarity.
In "Ten Years Later," where adults actually play adults, the mood is less entrenched and the mimicry more diffuse, including improvisation of '90s stalking films such as "The Hand That Pushes the Cradle"
At one point, a character gets stuck in an Apple notebook, some straight-line skates and "something else from 1991."
Many of the core stories are the same.
Mr. Sweetheart (Mr. Schuette) has now become a novelist, but he still hasn't forgotten Katie (Margaret Morrow).
Victor (Ken Marino) remains a virgin.
There's another sinister plot in the show involving Ronald Reagan (also played by Mr. Schuette), instigated by George H W Bush (Michael Ian Black, impressive).
As always, the best part of this series is interjecting.
It was particularly interesting to see the ever-young Mr. Luther, who flaunted Matt Dillon's soul patch in the film "The Bachelor," before "The Campus Giant," where Andy now feels like a giant.
This is the moment of random madness that might provide the impetus for this film, like the recursive "Seven Years of Life" series, until it comes to what I think is the logical conclusion: "Hala Camp: Twenty Years Later," whose final act is to send this bunch of Cass to see the film premiere of "Hala Camp"
Meanwhile, Amazon's "Detective Twins" tells of different nostalgic content: the Cold War revivalist "American Spy Dream," the film "The City of the Extreme Cold," and even the East-West wrestling imagery of "GLOW: The Gorgeous Women's Wrestling League"
The comedy, created by Brian Gatswood and Alessandro Tanaka, was thrust onto the TV screen by director Reece Thomas: It's a tough-guy comedy set in '80s Romania, about two Bucharest officials struggling for the line of truth, atheism and Marxism-Leninism.
The main characters - the hard-liner Grigor and the idealistic Aysef-are played by Florin Pierszi Jr and Cornejo Ulic, respectively, whose dialogue is voiced in English by Channing Tatum (also an executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
It's a brilliant idea.
But it's not just an idea.
There are some good visual gimmicks (police watch chess on TV to pass the time, because Americans like to play football).
And there are a host of celebrity voice actors-among them Jeanne Slater, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Hashbaz Ali and Kolo Sevigny-who have built a wonderful sound event.
But "Detective Twins" is so dedicated to creating a raucous and realistic propaganda comedy - the show features a killer with a Reagan mask - and it usually plays that role as well.
The six-episode television drags slightly, and the comic effect is not released quickly or frequently enough.
The director of "Detective Twins" was more tightly edited, presenting a better incendiary satire when Gregor and Aissov repeatedly visited the US embassy, where two fat men always devour a pile of hamburgers in the lobby.
For an imaginary communist audience, the message means that Western culture can turn anything into material for a rave.

Reporters recently learned that the Northeast region steel, rail transport, ships, machinery manufacturing and other industries generally decline in efficiency, or even loss.
Some experts believe that under the current situation, the new round of industrial revitalization in the Northeast is not only related to the national economic recovery, but also will have an impact on the long-term development of China's manufacturing industry and international competitiveness, so it is urgent to adjust the transformation.
The general decline in corporate efficiency in traditional industries more loss-making raw materials industry and heavy machinery and equipment manufacturing industry benefit serious decline or even a loss, is the economic downturn in the north-east of the first performance of the industry.
In the past in the economic downturn, mainly low-end, primary products hit the characteristics of large, but this economic fluctuations, the north-east traditional industrial high-end, low-end industrial products are affected.
Angang Group (Weibo) has focused on the development of high-end panels such as container boards, steel tracks, boat boards and household appliances in the past few years. However, sales of these products have fallen sharply this year, especially as sales of boardboards have fallen by 50% over the same period last year.
Angang shares (Hao Qingshun, head of the metallurgy division of the Liaoning Provincial Commission of Industry and Technology, said that metallurgy is the third pillar industry in Liaoning, with 60 million tons of steel production capacity per year ranking third in the country.
From January to May this year, 21.54 million tons of crude steel were produced in Liaoning Province. The production and marketing situation of products needed for projects with strong state policies and local government construction was better, and the decline of products with more intense market competition was another characteristic of the manufacturing industry in the Northeast.

"The White Night Couple" Yang Yang and Liu Yifei appeared in Beijing yesterday at the launch of the film "Peach Blossoms for You", which will be released on August 4.
Yang Yang, who had just had surgery on his right ear the other day, appeared for the first time since his injury. He explained that his role was "to be angry, not to be coloured," and that he always paid for his silence, hiding all his feelings in his heart.
Yang Yang expressed the need to mobilize the whole body to convey the character's insufferable sadness to the audience. "This is a new challenge to my performance, and I am really about to get hurt in the act."
Liu Yifei, for his part, revealed that he was "in tears" during the film, at one point crying until he broke down.
Japan's Olympic Committee said recently that the Japanese delegation in the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games gold medal target is 30, and advanced to the top three gold medal table.
In October, the head of the Japanese Olympic Committee's sports committee, Hiroshi Yamashita, said he expected Japan's athletes to win two-and-a-half times more gold medals at the Tokyo Games than at the Rio Games.
At the 2016 Rio Olympics, the Japanese delegation finished sixth in the gold medal table with 12 golds.
The delegates formed their own teams, held umbrellas and marched into the venue.
The roads around the venue were normally passable, there were no balloon signs outside the venue, no red carpet, no plants and flowers.
Yesterday, the second meeting of the four-term People's Congress of Guang'an was held in a simple way.
Walking into the Guang'an Convention and Exhibition Center, the venue had no signs, no teacups, not even an ordinary bottle of mineral water.
In its place is a simple banner, a meeting place, a simple eco-friendly paper bag of conference materials, an eco-friendly paper cup filled with tea.
The material for the meeting was thinner than before, and a few sheets of paper summed up the subject and agenda of the meeting.
"Save for the people, when frugal must be frugal. Back to the present simple, real meeting environment, we understand and welcome." Wang Cheng, representative of the Guang'an Municipal People's Congress, said that efficient, pragmatic, non-formalistic meetings are what they would like to see and participate in.

The Bank of England will maintain a rate of 0.25%
The Bank of England will announce at a later date that interest rates will remain unchanged after weak economic growth and accommodative inflation dashed hopes of a rise.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will continue to be "weak" as it controls interest rates while tightening household income.
The Bank's MPC policymakers voted 6-2 to keep interest rates at 0.25%, while a handful of members this month called for higher rates, even as weak economic growth has softened the boost.
In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank of England scaled back its growth forecasts for 2017 and 2018 to 1.7pc and 1.6pc, respectively, and issued a warning that household income tightening would continue, while inflation would skyrocket to nearly 3pc in the autumn.
But it said it would need to raise interest rates over the next few years to curb inflation from Brexit, while borrowing costs would likely need to rise by the larger margin expected in financial markets.
Large-scale economic promotion policies were put in place a year ago under the influence of Brexit, and members voted to withdraw them as well.
The Bank of England will announce the end of its regular funding scheme, offering cheap money to banks from February next year, although the bank says it now needs an additional 15 billion pounds on top of 115 billion pounds under the scheme.
In the minutes of its interest-rate decision-making meeting, the Bank of England said: "In MPC's core forecast, gross domestic product (GDP) remains weak in the near term as household real-income tightening will continue to depress consumption.
On interest rates, the bank has repeatedly reiterated the need for "a certain amount of monetary policy tightening" to suppress inflation, and the need to do so to a "greater extent" than the market expects.
The market is now expected to grow for the first time in the third quarter of next year and for the second time in 2020.
But the bank stressed that any increase would be "slow" and "restrained"
The bank's growth forecasts for this year and next show a downward trend, compared with forecasts of 1.9pc and 1.7pc in May.
The bank maintains its forecast for growth of 1.8pc in 2018.
The pound fell against the dollar, followed by the euro.
The pound fell 0.5% against the dollar to 1.31, while against the euro it fell 0.4% to 1.11.
The unchanged decision comes after rising expectations were dashed by recent gloomy growth data, with GDP rising to 0.3pc in the second quarter, compared with 0.2pc in the previous three months.
The bank said third-quarter growth is likely to remain at 0.3pc, although it will rise slightly by the end of the year.
The average household has been hit by a surge in inflation, while wage growth has been negligible, and the Bank of England's recent inflation report has not given them good news as the bank says austerity will get worse before it gets better
And said monetary policy "cannot prevent" a hit to earnings over the next few years, but wages are expected to recover "on a large scale" by the end of the three-year forecast.
At the same time, the economy will be boosted by a sharp rise in demand for British goods as a result of the fall in the value of the pound, offsetting some of the low consumption.
The decision comes a year after the shock EU referendum sent the pound plummeting, with interest rates cut to 0.25% in August.
The Bank of England estimates it could take four years to fully influence prices and the UK economy.
Before the bank announced its latest rate ruling, calls for a rate hike were heard as inflation added to the already stressed average household, while three policymakers called for the rate to be raised to 0.5% in July.
Inflation retreated to 2.6pc last month from 2.9pc in June, although the Bank of England said this was expected and would rise again in the coming months.
The bank said the excess was already the final bottom line of the weak pound relative to its 2% target.
"Given the recent fall in swap rates, the mortgage market looks set to become more competitive again as lenders make a strong call for more business and look forward to a positive end to the year," said Andrew Montrek, director of Coreco Mortgage Brokers.
Such a market looks particularly favorable to those who may be nearing the end of an existing deal, given the growing popularity of remortgages (many of which are fee-free and have low interest rates).
China's seismological network officially measured an 8.0-magnitude earthquake at 19: 02 on November 13 in New Zealand (42.53 degrees south and 173.05 degrees east), with a depth of 10,000 meters and strong tremors in the capital, Wellington.
British National Health Service (NHS) controversial HIV drug gives green light
Patients will be able to access "transformative" HIV preventive treatment starting in September after the High Court settled the dust over NHS's provision of drug funding.
NHS England has announced that pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), a drug that can be taken before sex, has been shown to reduce the risk of infection in people at high risk by about 86%, and the health service will now deliver the drug to an estimated 10,000 people through a three-year initial trial.
It agreed to fund the trial after the Court of Appeal upheld the High Court ruling last year, which said NHS was entitled to pay for PrEP despite NHS's claim that local authorities should fund the drug.
The move announced on Thursday was described as a "major new intervention" by NHS NHS, chief executive of NHS, while the National AIDS Trust (NAT) described it as a "critical moment"
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to be registered as sexual health clinics. More clinics will join in October, before being fully implemented across England in April 2018.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is an HIV drug taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
Tests have shown that PrEP significantly reduces HIV transmission among people at risk of infection.
Taking PrEP before sex means there are enough specific drugs in the body to prevent HIV infection.
The drug can be taken daily or two hours before sex.
Those eligible for treatment include gay, bisexual men, transgender people and positive HIV carriers who have not successfully received treatment.
The clinic will identify eligible participants who agree to the trial, including men, women, transgender people and people whose sexual partner HIV status is unknown for antiretroviral treatment.
People who live and register as general practitioners in England can also sign up at the sexual health clinics they attend locally.
The scheme will cost 10 million pounds, while the NHS England branch signed a contract to procure the drugs this week after international competitive procurement.
The trial aims to assess the full potential of PrEP by collecting clinical evidence on how it is located, absorbed and implemented on a large sample basis.
Mr Stevens said: "This major new intervention should be broadly and increasingly successful in complementing and reinforcing HIV prevention.
This is another milestone in more than 30 years of action worthy of progress in addressing major human health challenges.
"This is a critical moment in the fight against AIDS," said Deborah King, chief executive of NAT, the UK's AIDS trust.
If it does target people in need and at risk, pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) offers the potential to change the UK AIDS epidemic.
Starting in September, people at high risk of HIV will be given a new licensed tool through the NHS-funded, England-based trial, which is truly self-contained and does not require consultation with sexual partners, which will lead to improvements in the lives of many.
We agree with the announcement with both hands.
Ian Green, chief executive of the Terence Higgins Trust, said: "The priority now is to ensure that trials are rolled out quickly across the country and that no one with HIV is left behind.
Now that we have purchased the PrEP trial drug, we are ready to protect more than 10,000 people at high risk of HIV.
Sharon Hodgson, the shadow public health secretary, claimed: "After months of delays and delays from the government, the start of the PrEP trials is welcome and should come sooner.
Evidence shows how the drug can make a difference as part of our approach to preventing HIV and stopping the spread of this deadly infection.
This trial will give us a further, full understanding of PrEP's strengths.
It is now very important that this experiment be rolled out nationally as soon as possible in order to protect people exposed to HIV and to help us to further end the spread of HIV in society.

High quality of life: Apply loft and ingenious design to make the small flat of the Earl's Palace a roomy home
Joanne Ray, a former banker, was so keen on renovating her house that in 2014 she moved from her large house in Knightsbridge to a small flat in the count's palace.
The apartment is on the ground floor of an elegant Queen Anne-style patio and Joanne's failure to pack up and put it up for sale is a telling demonstration of the new design.
"Before that, I was living in a bigger house in Knightsbridge with my ex," says Joanne.
"I was looking for a house with the right price.
I saw this apartment at the count's palace, which also had a high ceiling.
I'd like to make an offer on the same day.
The 1,000-square-foot apartment has now completed a complete overhaul since it was first seen.
The apartment was originally a single room with a complex layout-it needed to go through the kitchen to get to the bedroom- and Joanne wanted to add storage space and loft at the time to make the most of the ample ceiling height.
"I want high ceilings, big windows, plenty of light.
That's what I'm asking for, "she said.
To that end, she hired Erfan Azadi, from the Duck & Shed architecture and design studio (in Notting Hill), to use the 12.5-foot-high ceiling to craft a home that is not only a development but also where Joanne lives.
The ceiling is not high enough to add two up-and-down spaces, so the architectural challenge is to create a loft high enough to stand.
Erfan had to think creatively in order to solve the problem.
The steel structure is quite complex,'he explained.
"We have to arrange the space for it to go up and down, and we don't need to shrug our shoulders.
Not only is it as simple as building a simple platform, but it is also necessary to start the steel so that it is at the right height to achieve its function.
Through this arrangement, Erfan is able to get two full-height rooms in the space-which can add many fun elements.
The loft features Retrouvius-branded retro copper windows that overlook the charming living area.
Gold furnishings with mirrors, small silver pieces of furniture and Serge Mouille retro lighting set the overall style.
The use of mirrors plays an important role in increasing atmosphere, space and light.
Putting mirrors on both ends of the short corridor can make it look longer.
In the kitchen, a splash board fitted with a mirror is like a window leading to another room.
At Xuanguan, a small lattice with mirrors provides Joanne with storage space for cutlery and glassware.
The beautiful living room has an engaging sense of space and is able to put the kitchen away when it's not in use.
The folding kitchen is not new.
But what makes this folding kitchen unique is a garage-style lift door.
"There's some engineering knowledge involved here," Erfan explains of the reinforced MDF door.
"It uses the principle of balance, so when you push the door, it's easy to slide."
Thanks to the ingenious use of space and storage, Joanne gained an extra 16 square metres, an extra bedroom and an improved layout.
Ultimately, what you're selling is the size of the house-or your property is valued on the basis of the size of the house, "Elfan said.
"Basically, a real estate agent goes into a room and calculates the size of the floor.
They will try to increase the amount of space they occupy while using high-quality materials, bringing a sense of luxury to the space.
"The material is all your own choice, so it helps to create emotional bonds at home," says Mr Elfan.
"You don't love the power on the wall.
These things are important, but they don't hold your heart.
It turns out that with good design and the addition of extra space, a standard apartment can shake itself up and make you wow.
In fact, you might, like Joanne, choose to live.

Two brothers stage $500 million real estate empire battle for big fight
Forty years after its Italian family founded the dynasty, the brothers fought for one of Victoria's biggest real estate empires, worth more than $500 million.
Colin De Lutis, a former director and developer of Carlton Football Club, lives in a mansion in the Tucala district, three doors away from his brother Paul, who took him to the Supreme Court over the division of their real estate and business assets.
Paul has been hoping to break away from the family business since 2014, but the two brothers have sparred in the Supreme Court over the split.
The brothers and their mother owned a total of 38 real estate properties worth more than $500 million that had accumulated since the family bought Smith Street, Collingwood, in 1973.
There, the family founded Westco Jeans and gradually grew it to the size of 160 retail chains.
In 1999, the company sold for $85 million.
That money was then put into real estate, and the De Routis family's portfolio now includes city office buildings, Brunswick and Sorrento developments, Gold Coast and Buller Hill apartments, and suburban shopping malls.
Under an agreement with his late father, Colin, who was described by his brother Paul as the "main mover and dominant figure" of the De Rutis family, owns about two-thirds of the company's assets, while Paul accounts for about a third.
The documents filed with the court said Colin's holdings were valued at $316 million by conversion, while Paul's holdings were valued at $176 million.
Paul came to the view that the division of real estate and cash proved to be the crux of the negotiations.
"Colin's proposal for the division of property left him what I thought was the best property," he wrote in a first court affidavit in 2015.
On Friday, after several failed attempts at mediation, the Supreme Court held its first hearing.
Now the brothers are still fighting for control of the existing business, with Paul saying Colin has kicked him out.
And Colin denied it and accused Paul of poor management of certain real estate.
In an early affidavit filed by Colin, he expressed a desire to resolve the dispute.
"My Italian heritage determines that family is the most important option. My Italian heritage determines that family is the most important," he wrote.
The cost of the case is rising, and there are hundreds of pages of affidavits, e-mails, and company reports from top law firms such as Deloitte, Pitcher Partners, Charter Keck Cramer, Allan, and senior lawyers hired by both parties.
Ms. de Rutis and her late husband, Luigi, both Italian immigrants, started running popular restaurants and delicatessens in the late 1950s and bought a shop in Brunswick in the early 1970s.
They used collateral to buy the Collingwood property, where Colin opened the family's first jeans store.
"I was in high school," says Colin, who founded Westco there. "At the time, Paul was very young (about 10 years old).
Anna de Routis says she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hope to pass on the property to their son peacefully
"Luigi used to say to me that he never wanted his brothers to end up in court," she wrote.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer members of the De Routis group, and Colin said Mark paid him $10 million when he left the company and $26 million to Luke.
Both Luke and Mark "expressed dissatisfaction with the terms of their property division," Paul said.
According to a biography of TV star Eddie McGuire, published in 2015, Colin kept a low profile despite being a board member of the former AFL club.
"Fairfax Media" contacted Colin and Paul on Friday, along with their lawyers.
But only Colin responded by text message, saying that because the case had been brought to court "I really can't say too much."
It was "very, very sad that my brother Paul chose to sue me and bring our family affairs to court," he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote in a court filing that he had tried to meet his brother's demands.
"Our father did not want to see Paul and I end up in a dispute like this," he said, adding that he "remains hopeful that the dispute will be resolved."
On Friday, that hope seemed dashed.
"Our problems will be resolved through the courts in the near future," Colin wrote.

Trump's new chief of staff plans to limit the president's media time
Others have tried, but failed.
John F Kelly may actually be able to do it.
If it does, then he's the first.
The new White House chief of staff plans to limit the flow of information to President Trump - including news media reports - in a bid to keep the big boss smoother, according to US political news website Politico.
Here's a quote from journalist Josh Dowsey
When John F Kelly, the new White House chief of staff, began his first day of work gathering with senior officials, he pointed out that he was going to address one of President Trump's main issues in the White House: the flow of bad information to the president.
Kelly told the officials that receiving good information helps the president make better decisions, so the information needs to go through his hands - both in writing and in briefings.
Kelly's diagnosis was similar, but others had tried to tame Trump by monitoring his media time, but it all ended in failure.
President Trump's TV addiction has a long history - now in the White House, his habit of watching TV is still deepening.
In February, former campaign adviser Sam Nabberg told Politico: "If candidate Trump is frustrated with unfair reporting, it would be helpful to let him know that he also gets positive coverage from credible sources.
Tara Palmieri of Politico wrote at the time, "Based on the experience of six former campaign officials, the focus of controlling Trump's Twitter habit is to ensure that the media messages he personally receives always contain a certain amount of praise."
It's totally fine.
But the notion that Trump's Twitter habit was once "controlled" is laughable.
Perhaps these campaign officials know something we don't - that Trump's tweets would have been even angrier had it not been for their intervention.
We may never know about those tweets that Trump didn't send.
If his staff could save him from the fire, even if only a few times, their efforts would be worth it.
But no one has been able to stop Trump from causing controversy.
Part of the problem is that in a White House made up of competing groups, people promote their world view and fancy their cause by presenting Trump with information that may or may not be reliable.
Politico - all about this story - reported in May on advisers' penchant for providing questionable information to the president strategically.
This is an example described by journalist Shane Goodmancher
"Current and former Trump officials claim that Trump's reaction to negative news footage has been volcanic, especially those damaging information leaks, and that he would be frantically trying to find out where it came from.
At the end of February, someone maliciously copied an article on GotNews.com, the website of online firebrand Charles C Johnson, to the president, which accused deputy chief of staff Katie Walsh of being the White House "source of a lot of information leaks," as Trump did at the time.
Even if Johnson had been permanently banned by Twitter for harassment, no concrete evidence had been provided, and he had blown up a lot of faulty quality control, which he later publicly denied.
Trump read the article and then began asking officials about Walsh.
Goodman also said then-Chief of Staff Reince Priebas and White House Secretary Rob Porter "had tried to set up a system to manage and record the documents" that Trump received.
What was the result?
Kelly intends to do the same, after three months.
Maybe he can prove himself to be a more efficient administrator than Priebus, but Trump is still the impulsive Trump, and his aides are still competing against each other for influence.
These timeless influences will make Kelly's task more difficult.
Travel Style Town: How do you get drunk
[ Abstract ] The potential of Zhejiang town is gradually aroused.
Today, these small towns have become important destinations for visitors to Zhejiang to enjoy the waters of Zhejiang, to read Zhejiang culture, and to feel the homesickness of Zhejiang. They will also provide important assistance to our province in its efforts to create the most beautiful tourist destination in China.

"A walk through the old town of Shaoxing, Anchang, where traditional handicrafts such as hoops, bamboo, iron, shoes, lace-picking and cotton spinning are everywhere, fully showcases the intangible cultural heritage of the ancient town of Anchang, with visitors from the four sides revelling in the atmosphere of enjoying Shaoxing folk customs and enjoying the historical and cultural accumulation of Shaoxing."
It is reported that this year's New Year's Day three-day holiday period, Anchangu town more than 65,000 visitors.
In Zhejiang, such a unique town such as Anchang ancient town is scattered: Jiaxing Xitang's twinkling light, flowing in Jiangnan water town's gentle and graceful; The white-walled diva of Quzhou twenty-eight tells of the vicissitudes of a thousand-year-old town; Fishermen's paintings in the town of Shitang, Taizhou, delineate the traditional and modern life of fishermen, These towns are the "palm of the hand" of Zhejiang tourism and the "heart of the heart" of tourists from all over the world.
In recent years, with the promotion of the whole-area tourism construction in our province, the potential of Zhejiang town has been gradually aroused.
In 2016, the Office of the Provincial Government officially issued the "Measures for the Implementation of the Creation of Tourism-related Small Towns in Zhejiang Province", which proposed the designation of 100 provincial tourism-friendly towns with good folk customs, beautiful eco-environment and rich tourist industry in the whole province over a period of about five years.
Today, these small towns have become important destinations for visitors to Zhejiang to enjoy the waters of Zhejiang, to read Zhejiang culture, and to feel the homesickness of Zhejiang. They will also provide important assistance to our province in its efforts to create the most beautiful tourist destination in China.
Under the upsurge of creating tourist towns, the provincial tourism bureau has paid more attention to the construction of personalized tourism industry, and new tourism projects and industries have emerged, bringing tourists a rich experience and winning a good reputation.
Focus on promotion

Town Has Style" 2017 Zhejiang Tourism Style Town Promotion season closing ceremony at Zhejiang Exhibition Hall.

The style of the town lies in the original juice, the original taste, the original hometown, a kind of original ecological purity.
"Xie Hanfeng, a teacher in the Department of Film and Television at the Academy of Animation and Arts of the Chinese Academy of Fine Arts, a director of first-line film and television advertising in China, and Professor Xu Xu, dean of the School of Art and Communication at the University of Metrology in China, told the story of small-town crossover such as" The Town in the Lens "
Zhejiang's many romantic tourism towns have deep cultural resources, from the town of Nan Xun in Huzhou City on behalf of Dong Xinjian in the scene for the interpretation of the national painting of Nanxun.
Now, the town of Nan Xun has developed deep cooperation with art schools such as the Chinese Academy of Fine Arts.

Looking forward to the highlights
So far, Zhejiang Province has released the first batch of 21 provincial tourism style town creation list and 115 provincial tourism style town cultivation creation list.
As one of the priority areas for the development of rural tourism during the 13th Five-Year Plan period, the scenic town will eventually become a tourist attraction with 3A grade and above. It will become a new model of tourism product diversification, outstanding tourism benefits and win-win industrial integration.
The key to the attraction of the tourist town is its original flavor.
The beauty of a tourist town comes not only from the smoke and rain of a small bridge, but also from a long cultural tradition; the revitalization of the countryside is rooted in cultural self-confidence.
Throughout the world, the Dutch town of Lieser, the Austrian town of Hallstadt, and the French town of Pumpkin, with tulips, "salt" and pumpkins as their core attractions, attract a large number of tourists from all over the world each year, enabling tourism to help the town's economy take off.
For the style town, the emphasis of "highlight the characteristics, retain the homesickness" makes the town has the obvious personality and the soul, is more to provide the culture infiltrate, carry the local context, show the local civilization.
Tourism style town, with culture and homesickness as the link, with the humanities and scenery as the carrier, connected with the four-way tourists, let the traditional customs and culture in the building and sharing of inheritance, innovation.
In essence, the tourist town is a complex and open tourist attraction. It should be a shared living space between the local residents and the tourists and even the tourists.
As the main battleground of tourism growth in the future, tourist towns may not only change the rural ecological outlook, economic and social development, industrial factors flow direction, but also be an important force to bridge the urban-rural infrastructure gap and revive rural culture.
In the tide of the accelerated revitalization of the countryside, Zhejiang tourist town will play a more rich and wonderful story.

RV drivers negotiate ditches, return to 'Regal Street'
Some of the wealthiest owners in the West Midlands are once again at loggerheads with determined RV drivers who are negotiating a government-dug ditch for the return of land outside the mansion.
RV drivers park their 20 trailers in a vacant lot outside the bustling Solihull Street, which is dubbed 'Regal Street'
The "moat" dug up by the city department didn't stop them from getting in, as RV drivers, holding horses, carrying babies and leading RV convoys, returned after being driven away in May.
The sleek, sophisticated team found a gap in the defensive line, and although there was a section of road where no roadblock was set up for passage, their vehicles squeezed through the gap.
Angry residents have lashed out at the Solihull Council, saying it has "performed poorly in dealing with the problem"
One resident, who did not wish to be named, said: "They got there on Monday night, before coming to Bingley Heath Street and throwing rocks at passers-by.
The committee should be ashamed of what they have done, because they are simply useless at dealing with problems.
The RV passengers arrived in May and were subsequently evicted, and now they are back.
There was a lot last night, and maybe more today.
She added: "Birmingham City Council knows how to deal with it by imposing a long-term ban to protect its parks.
I live on Streetsbrook Road, and I'm not willing to continue paying council tax if the council can't stop it.
One local resident, who did not want to be named, said: "It's ridiculous, we've just seen the last RV passengers go, just for another batch to come and destroy.
This time the number increased again, and some even saw horses grazing on the park lawn.
A Solihull Council spokeswoman said: "We are aware of unauthorized camping in a vacant lot on Streetsbrook Road and now we are working with the Solihull police and taking the necessary legal action to get them moved as quickly as possible.
To support our collection of evidence, it is very important that as many local residents as possible report any anti-social or criminal behaviour to the police by calling 101.
This helps us to outline the situation for the Court's consideration when we refer cases to it.

Italy takes a hard line on NGO migrant rescue boats
Italy has issued a warning to non-governmental organisations operating migrant rescue boats in the Mediterranean that they will not be allowed to continue to carry out rescues without signing up to new operational management norms.
"If NGOs don't sign up to the new code of conduct, it's hard to see what they're going to do," Interior Minister Marco Minniti told the Turin Daily News.
The warning from Minniti comes a day after Italian officials seized a German aid group, Youth Rescue, on suspicion that the crew of a ship actually colluded with human traffickers to assist illegal migrants.
The aid group has been operating for just one year and declined to comment on the subject of specific allegations by Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Caltosio.
"Saving lives is and will be the most important thing for us, so we regret not being able to operate in the SAR at this time," the group said in a social media statement.
"After collecting all the information, we can only assess all the allegations and the situation at this time.
Italian officials have been monitoring the Iuventa, the ship of the Youth Rescue, since October.
Its crew is suspected of carrying migrants brought directly from small boats by human traffickers and allowing smugglers to flee in a hurry and re-use the ship.
At least one such meeting allegedly took place at sea about 1.3 miles off the coast of Libya, according to the prosecutor's filing, which was published by Italian media.
Its crew is suspected of blatantly disregarding the authority of the Italian coastguard, which oversees rescue operations in the area out of humanitarian fervor rather than any other motive.
According to the code of conduct, vessels such as Iuventa clearly need an Italian police officer on board to monitor their activities.
Currently, of the nine non-governmental organizations involved in search and rescue operations, only three have agreed to abide by the code of conduct: Save the Children, the Malta-based Migrant Maritime Aid Station and the Pro-Activa Open Arms in Spain.
The latter said on Thursday that it did not believe the new rules were necessary but acceptable because they would not bring any "significant changes and impediments" to its rescue operations.
Among the organizations that refused to sign was the Nobel Prize-winning organization Médecins Sans Frontieres (MSF).
Meanwhile, Minniti said the number of migrants arriving in Italy has plunged in recent weeks, a sign that efforts to strengthen the Libyan coast guard and unite local mayors are beginning to bear fruit.
"In recent days, we have begun to see the light at the end of the tunnel," the minister said.
He unveiled plans for in-depth talks this month: to discuss economic development activities with Libyan mayors, and to discuss with Chad, Niger and Mali how to reduce the number of migrants who want to leave those countries for Europe.
Lian Ping, chief financial economist at Bank of Communications, said growth in industrial value added was expected to accelerate to 6.6pc in December, due to the end-of-season upturn in industrial value added in the first three quarters of 2017.
Investment in fixed assets is expected to grow at a cumulative rate of 7.2pc in December, unchanged from last month and lower than last year.
Industrial production, while expected to be weaker than in October, is essentially unchanged from November.
China's manufacturing investment was low in December, but infrastructure investment improved slightly, so fixed-asset investment is expected to be flat in November.

New Measures of Beijing "College Emancipation": Thousands of teachers and students in Beijing Chemical Industry will be admitted to the new campus in Changping
The opening ceremony of the new campus of Beijing Chemical University was held on Tuesday in Changping District of Beijing. The green campus covering 1,800 acres was officially put into use.
In order to strengthen the core functions of the capital and control "big city diseases", in recent years, under the background of the co-development of the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei and the deconstruction of non-capital functions, Beijing has stepped up its efforts to promote the evacuation of the central urban colleges and universities to the suburbs. Some of the students and teachers of the universities are gradually moving to the new campus in the suburbs of Shunyi, Daxing and Fangshan.
The new campus of Beijing Chemical Industry is located in the town of Changping Nankou, which covers 1,800 acres and is 40 kilometers from the city. It is one of the key projects of Beijing to relieve the non-capital function.
The new campus will be built in three phases, the first phase of which is now fully completed. The second phase is expected to be fully launched by the end of this year. Upon completion, the project will meet the learning and living needs of nearly 20,000 undergraduates, graduate students and staff.
Looking back at this year's film market, we found that the original text of the film and two groups of fans of the stars became an important part of the film's intended audience.
At 17: 10 today, the 119 command center of Shaoyang city was alerted to a fire at the storage of tetrahydrofuran at the Hongzhi chemical plant in Longshu Tong, Shuangqing district of the city.
Shaoyang Fire Detachment immediately dispatched 5 squadrons 20 fire trucks with heavy-duty anti-chemical clothing, anti-chemical washing vehicles and other equipment rushed to the scene.
After a preliminary investigation, the fire started in small storage tanks containing chemicals such as tetrahydrofuran, which produced more smoke at the site.
At the time of the press release, the fire officers and soldiers were in intensive rescue, the city health, safety supervision, environmental protection, security, traffic and other departments have rushed to the scene, no casualties were found.
Michelle Carter was sentenced for sending text messages encouraging Conrad Roy to commit suicide
A Massachusetts woman has been sentenced to two-and-a-half years for encouraging her boyfriend to commit suicide through text messages and phone calls.
Michelle Carter, 20, will serve a 15-month sentence, which can be converted into a suspended sentence, plus a five-year suspended sentence.
Carter was convicted in June of the unintentional and unpremeditated murder of Conrad Roy, who committed suicide on July 13, 2014.
Roy's father said at Thursday's hearing:'My family is devastated.
My son is my best friend.
While awaiting appeal, Carter was allowed to remain free.
She faces a maximum of 20 years in prison, but her legal team believes she and Mr Roy are both mentally ill.
At the sentencing, Carter stood, wearing red trousers and a beige smock, his hands clasped, his eyes teary and his eyes downcast.
"Her actions killed Conrad Roy," the prosecutor told the court.
"She ended his life to live better.
She did not take responsibility "the prosecutor said.
"She has no remorse.
But Carter's lawyer said it was "a terrible consequence and she feels very remorseful."
However, Justice Lawrence Moniz said he did not find that her "age or maturity, or even her mental illness, would have any significant effect on her behaviour."
A prosecutor read a statement from Roy's mother, Lynn Roy, who said, "I don't have a day to grieve about losing my beloved son.
I hope he is proud of me and what I have done, I am trying to stand with his sisters in all my pain that will stay with us forever, "the statement said.
Mr Roy's sister, Camdyn Roy, testified that she was "in a dazed mood" because she realised she would never be able to attend her brother's wedding or be his children's aunt.
"It is a pain to lose someone who has been with me since I was born, and the rest of my life will be with it," she said.
The case appears to set a legal precedent because Massachusetts law does not make it a crime to encourage others to commit suicide.
In 2014, Roy was found dead of carbon monoxide poisoning in his car; that year, Carter was 17.
The case sparked national attention after Carter's text messages revealed she egged him on to commit suicide.
"There are many ways to hang, jump and stab yourself," she said in several text messages sent two weeks before his death, while he was on holiday with his family.
In the time before he took his own life, she wrote, "You need to do this, Conrad," and "All you have to do is start the generator and then be free and happy."
Judge Moniz said Carter drew attention through Mr Roy's death and ordered her not to profit from the case through any media.
There is a difference of legal opinion in this case.
One of the few to defend Carter was Amanda Knox, who was acquitted in 2007 of the murder of her British flatmate in Italy two years later.
"Michelle Carter deserves sympathy and help, not imprisonment," Ms. Knox, 30, said in a Los Angeles Times op-ed.
Zhang Yimou is destined to be a controversial film artist, and since he began working on his first film, "Red Sorghum," he has reaped a lot of criticism while leading the Chinese film wave.
Lhasa's junior basketball team recently finished fourth in the final of the national junior basketball league tournament in Beijing, reporters learned from Lhasa Pure Land basketball club.
The Lhasa Pure Land basketball junior team is made up of 11 homegrown players and the head coach is Lhasa Pure Land Men's Basket adult team assistant coach Jae Ren Sanjoo.
Tibetan "basketball kid" before heading to Beijing for finals.
Liang Junchao, general manager of Lhasa Pure Land basketball club, told reporters that compared with last year, the team's results had improved, the players' self-confidence and grasp of the field had improved significantly, the players and other teams had a more comprehensive exchange, and there was more and easier communication on and off the court.
After the game, the captain said he hoped to gain experience by taking part in the competition and do his best for the cause of basketball in Tibet.
It is understood that during the match in Beijing, the players overcame factors such as low altitude intoxication oxygen to present the image of Tibet.
Although track and field is a big gold medalist in the Olympic Games, track and field won the world, but the track and field will be better than gold is in the wind.
Automakers face shock as Audi will retrofit up to 850,000 diesel cars
Audi's announcement of the revamp comes a day after BMW said it would provide software upgrades for more than 350,000 cars.
BMW believes there are "more smart options for driving than restrictions," meaning major European cities-including Munich, where BMW is headquartered-consider banning or restricting diesel vehicles, its chairman said.
Daimler announced Tuesday that it will retrofit 3 million Mercedes cars in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions.
None of the companies declared the move a recall.
European automakers have aggressively promoted the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to help meet carbon dioxide emissions regulations.
But the nitrogen oxide emitted by diesel engines is thought to be carcinogenic and may cause asthma.
Car companies are also increasing the cost of installing equipment to offset diesel vehicle emissions, making it difficult to keep diesel cars competitive on price.
As German automakers face scrutiny, Chancellor Angela Merkel's government has also been accused of letting these powerful car companies go too far and ignoring signs of the problem.
The car companies are trying to avoid a repeat of the popular practice of covering up their use of so-called defeat devices, adjusting emissions to comply with regulations when cars are tested and returning to normal driving conditions.
Multiple popular executives have been charged in the United States, while others are under investigation by countries on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former head of theromechanics at Audi's engine research and development unit was arrested in Germany.
Former manager Zachero Giovanni Pamio, who is Italian and therefore not subject to extradition protection, could face trial in the US.
Earlier this year, Audi was embroiled in a German criminal investigation involving the masses, with the German government accusing it of installing systems to evade European emissions requirements, widening the scope of an investigation previously limited to the United States.
Audi being investigated could have a major impact on VW: Luxury automakers account for a disproportionate share of VW's profits.
A film that lasts a year or two or even a few years, from preparation to release, is commonplace.
The animated film "Big Fish Begonia," which ran for 12 years from preparation to release, has been announced for release on July 8!
"Big Fish Begonia" original author Liang Jun, 21-year-old from Tsinghua University thermal energy professional, and friends Zhang Chun founded the other side of the day, in 2008 to create a million-dollar venture capital, launched the animated film debut "Big Fish Begonia."
The film has won many awards at home and abroad in the creative sample stage, and has been recognized as "one of the most outstanding works of art" by the Centre for Contemporary Art in Pompidou, France.
With a six-year history from creative to production, the film has been dubbed a "pit of gods" by millions of eager fans.
"The Big Fish Begonia" tells a fantasy story that belongs to the Chinese. With the release of the trailer, it brings a whole new look to all viewers.
Liang said: 'These 12 years have only done this one thing and now it's gone from a dream to a reality and I'm both nervous and excited'
Zhang Chun said: "Always want to use other people's 50% budget, do exactly the same picture effect, the team will be driven crazy by me."
Dongguan, a "world factory" that once relied on raw materials processing and mass production, is setting its sights on high-level talent who can lead the city's repositioning.
At a recent high-level talent event organized by the Dongguan Municipal Government, the first financial reporter saw a number of powerful local enterprises participate in the talent fair.
In the orange background wall against a particularly bright billboard, they each marked out a significant price.
As a result, the China Television Drama Industry Association decided to unite the national television production industry to sign a self-regulatory convention.
Provence lavender threatened by climate change
Lavender has become a symbol of the city of Provence in southern France, but now there is bad news that it is under threat from climate change.
Lavender is failing due to persistent drought and the emergence of virus-carrying insects, which is causing headaches for scientists and farmers trying to find solutions.
"Eric Chaisse, an expert at the CRIEPPAM in Provence, said:" Lavender in Provence is under great threat because the plant has been affected by climate change in recent years, with much less rain in spring and more rain in autumn.
This can affect the life cycle of lavender.
There is also a smaller individual cicada, a leaf cicada that can transmit tiny bacteria, which can appear in large numbers in very dry weather.
The key is its sheer volume.
As well as attracting holidaymakers, the elegant lavender meadow is being courted by the perfume and cosmetics industry.
"In contrast to plants that can grow a lot of big flowers and have very long grain spikes, we have smaller individuals that are poorly developed, missing or weak," says Eric Chaisse, a professor of science at the University of California.
So we have less essential oil.
Solutions under study include adopting better irrigation techniques and slowing evaporation of soil moisture, spraying plants with protective mixtures of clay and water, and developing more drought-tolerant varieties.
In contrast to the sci-fi elements of the film, the two stars have said that it is the story in the film that appeals to them more.
On the afternoon of September 5, a reporter for the Huaxi Metropolis newspaper, a series of interviews with a number of high-profile people in the cross-talk world, and two cross-talk performance artists, were surprisingly almost uniformly silent.
One is a Berlin film emperor, one is a rising youth actor, and "Psychological Crime" is also Liao Fan and Li Yifeng's first partner.
Mexico in danger, journalist killed
The entire staff of the Riodoce weekly usually meet on Wednesday to review their plans for coverage of the unrest in Sinaloa caused by criminal organizations, corrupt officials and the endless war on drugs.
But today, the shadow of tragedy hangs over themselves as they gather to discuss security.
It is important that they are told to change their daily habits.
Two senior journalists discussed what felt safer: whether to take their children to the office, which was hit by a grenade in 2009, or leave them at home.
Security experts wrote three words on the blackboard in front of the room: enemies, neutrals and allies.
They asked these journalists to list their names under each column - without the need for evidence, observation and intuition would suffice.
There are suspected drug dealers, politicians, businessmen and journalists on government lists, or cartels, and this gang of villains puts Mexico's reporting work at risk.
The violence has never ceased, and there are more and more journalists in the country: according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, at least 25 journalists have died since President Enrique Peña Nieto took office in December 2012; 589 journalists are under federal protection after being attacked and threatened; At least seven journalists have died in seven states so far this year.
The last to die was their editor and inspiration, as well as Javier Valdez Cardenas, co-founder of Riodoce.
Valdez, who has written many books on drug violence, wrote in one of them: "The biggest mistake is living in Mexico and being a journalist.
There was a deep sense that he had left, though he was everywhere - a huge photograph hung on the facade of the Riodoce office building, Valdez with his middle finger up and the word "justice." Aaron Iwala and Miriam Ramirez, two 30-something journalists wearing T shirts and wearing glasses or his trademark Panama straw hat, also showed off his smile.
The seminar took place less than two months after his death; reporters rushed to discuss their shared trauma, nightmares, insomnia and hypochondria.
Although a special federal prosecutor's office was established in 2010 to handle journalists' cases, according to the records of the Committee to Protect Journalists, it prosecuted only two people.
Most of the thousands of crimes committed each year involve drug trafficking and organized crime, so it is rare to bring the killers of journalists to justice.
In "Riodoce," they insisted on reporting the violence in Sinaloa, though they were heartbroken, though the land was riddled with holes.
There was no killer information, no justice was done, and then it wasn't much use to hold security seminars, Iwala said.
"It would be foolish to waste time attending such a seminar," he said.
As long as we don't know why, you don't trust anyone.
On the morning of 15 May, Valdez left the office of Riodoce in the capital, Culiacan.
His red Toyota Carola drove just a few blocks before being stopped by two men; they forced him to get out of his car and fired 12 shots, presumably because of the newspaper's name - which translates as Twelve Rivers.
The gangster drove off in his car and crashed it nearby.
Valdez is 50.
Leave behind his wife and two grown-up children.
Culiacan is rumoured to be all over the place.
But on the subject of Valdez, there was actually nothing but silence.
Since Guzman's arrest last year and his extradition to the United States in January, the state of Sinaloa has become the country's bloodiest battlefield, with rival forces fighting wildly.
One or several people are shot every day on the streets of Sinaloa, and the cemetery is filled with the drug lord's ornate two-story mausoleum, which has become commonplace.
Forget for a moment that the state of "calm" is when only one cartel controls this seaside state and its ports and drug-trafficking routes to the United States.
Even so, even though Valdez was well aware of the dangers of the job, Ismael Pojokwe, the 60-year-old co-founder and director of Riodoce, was guilty of failing to protect his friend.
He believes two mistakes caused the tragedy.
The first, published in February, is an interview with Damaso Lopez, who leads a cartel that fights several of Guzman's sons.
The report may have angered the sons; the newspaper was bought off by suspected gang members as soon as it arrived at the newsstand.
The second mistake was not to force Valdez to leave Mexico for his own safety after another newspaper covering the same story was seized.
Valdez is a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his death is of great significance to Mexico's violence against journalists.
His spirit lives on and his friends and colleagues believe he has always been with us.
He was also a senior reporter for Noroeste in 2003, when he co-founded Riodoce with five colleagues and sold a $50 stake.
In the state of Sinaloo, "there is no way that the press is not dealing with the drug problem."
Over time, the paper has gained a good reputation for bold and honest reporting, and sales and advertising have increased.
Journalists like to be able to publish investigative stories that hit the nail on the head without fear of censorship, and readers like newspapers that publish stories that others are afraid to report.
Five years after its founding, "Riodoce" won the National Maria Moskapo Prize for Journalism in Latin America.
That same year, the Association for the Protection of Journalists awarded Valdez the International Press Freedom Prize for his courage in pursuing the most authentic Mexican drug reporting.
He confessed that he was scared, too.
"I want to live on," he said, as the Society for the Protection of Journalists awarded the prize.
Later, in late October, he said in an interview with local television station Rompeviento TV that "drug trafficking is a way of life in Sinaloa
You have to take on the task that falls on your shoulders as a journalist - either that or playing dumb.
I don't want to be asked 'What have you done in the face of so many deaths, why aren't you vocal about what's going on?'
The entire staff of "Riodoce" missed Valdez, cursed like a longshoreman, the friend who never grudgingly hugged and advised, and the teacher who knew how to live.
They depend on his habits.
He used to wear that hat.
Go to the El Guayabo bar across the office and always sit at the same table.
Now, they will ask: Was it his daily habits that caused his downfall?
His death also forced them to think about how to do a good job and live well.
"They don't like the fact that you're causing problems for their women and their children, or the fact that you're influencing their legitimate companies and the secret airports that are used to deliver drugs," he said.
They all crossed their line.
The result is to maintain a high level of self-censorship and self-protection even at the most secure times.
Trust your intuition.
If you smell danger, get out of the way.
The problem, says Riodoce editor Andres Villarreal, is that "the breath is a feeling of being cheated, and then something like that happens to Javier."
He and others say the previous rules no longer apply to the state of Sinaloa - just as they no longer apply to Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero, and other states, where smuggling routes are lucrative and institutions weak, government officials corrupt, and smoky.
The situation is constantly changing.
Mobile phones were suddenly not allowed in the room where Riodoce employees attended security training; a few days earlier, spyware allegedly sold only to the government had been used in Mexico to spy on journalists and activists.
Outside, two police officers rode in the shade to escape the 104-degree (40℃) heat.
They were sent by the state government to protect the offices of "Riodoce" in a four-story building in the middle-class neighborhood of Culiacan.
Some reporters tease, half-jokingly, whether the police officers will be 50% of what the governor himself says they believe.
Journalists have been going to the mountains for months, where drug cartels are under the control of actual presence.
This week's Riodoce features three major events.
Among them was the killing of the brother of the great former boxer Julio Cesar Chavez of Sinaloo
And then there's the disclosure of government funding for the governor's home state
And the kidnapping inside an expensive restaurant in Culiacan, just a block from the prosecutor's office.
Officials did not release information about the abductees and the kidnapping process, so caution is needed when writing about what the city knows: that the restaurant is a place where drug dealers and officials love to go.
A journalist learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician from the ruling PRI party, which dominated the political class for almost the entire last century.
Recently, several PRI governors have been accused of corruption in several high-profile cases.
Villarreal asked reporters to write about what had happened at the site before, including an incident in which a son of Mexico's top drug lord, Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman, evaded a military attack.
If it had been a few months ago, readers would have looked at Valdez's column for the most powerful information about the kidnapping.
"Before, we knew what was going on," said Villarreal, 46, who is known as "Skinny" because of his thin build.
Now all of our sources of information communication channels are being pinched.
Valdez's office is now used to store signs and stickers protesting the killing of journalists, as employees become what they never intended to be: activists representing the media.
The next morning reporter Miriam Ramirez grabbed a sign and walked out of the room to the local prosecutor's office for a march related to another reporter.
Salvador Adame went missing in the western state of Michoacan three days after Valdez was killed.
Officials found a charred body and said it was his, according to the DNA test.
Across the country, journalists have become more outspoken, organizing protests and painting pavements and buildings with the words' save the media'
It was a day when the director, Porhoqui, was not in Washington, and he was working to get justice and international support for the Valdez case.
The day after Valdez was killed, in a meeting with the governor of the state of Sinaloo, Ramirez sued officials for spying on journalists' information and killing them because they had told the truth.
She has also asked to step down from her position covering government affairs, given that her anger has affected her objectivity.
Valdez has repeatedly reiterated that Mexican journalists are "surrounded" by organized crime, complicit government officials and an indifferent society.
In his last book, "Drug Journalism," he wrote that journalists are not just mauled by drug cartels, but are on a list of politicians and security forces who are complicit in organizing crime.
The media monitoring group Articulo 19 has blamed police and public officials for more than half of last year's attacks on journalists.
"In Mexico, they let you die just to shut you up," Ramirez said.
Obviously, these murders are chilling.
No one has forgotten that six years ago, the blogger Maria Elizabeth Mathias died on the border north of Tamaulipas.
Next to her body was a note purportedly signed by Zetas Cartel: "I came for my report.
Her head was cut off, next to a computer keyboard and headset.
Some newspapers, such as the El Norte newspaper on the northern border of the state of Chihuahua, have chosen to shut down after the killing of Miroslava Breich in March.
Others continue, with the killing of the director of the El Manana of Nuevo Laredo in 2014, but they continue.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juarez used a front-page story to speak openly about drug cartels, with the headline "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists have fled their homeland, or even left the country.
It's a tough choice.
It's hard to find work in exile, and they still have to be careful and wary of danger on the streets.
Sometimes they are arrested, and in 2015 photographer Ruben Espinosa is said to have been killed along with four women in a Mexican city three months after fleeing Veracruz.
For those who stay behind the scenes and continue to work, this is the daily dance step of high-risk decision-making.
Ibarra, who had wanted to be a poet, admitted that reporting on the drug trade had left him terrified.
"Mexico is turning into hell, so I became a journalist," he said.
In the middle of the night on a recent Friday, the latest issue of the paper had gone to press, and the editors of Riodoce were sitting in the aisles outside their offices drinking beer when, suddenly, their phones rang.
Nineteen people have been confirmed dead in a series of gun battles between rival gang forces and security forces near the beach resort city of Massatland.
The fighting is still escalating, as foreshadowed by a series of cartel messages found in the region.
They uploaded the news to the Riodoce website on the roadside via their mobile phones.
The headline the next day had to be changed.
The siren sounded nearby - there was another shoot-out in the area.
Porhokwe glanced at the police officers standing guard there to see if they were alert.
If they have a little bit of fear, then they don't show it either.
The paper's founder has been killed, and on his large portrait, his middle finger points to where the entire state of Sinaloa needs to look, with the entire staff of Riodoce following in his footsteps.
"How could you even want to shut it down? The same day that Javier was killed, the intern asked me to send her out on the street to cover it," she said.
China's self-driving tourism in 2020 market size or breakthrough trillion yuan
[ Abstract ] In the context of rising consumption and the prevalence of freedom, self-driving is encouraged by national policies and favored by more and more consumers.
But at the same time, the self-driving travel market, which is expected to break through the trillion scale, faces a double challenge.
In the context of rising consumption and the prevalence of freedom, self-driving is encouraged by national policies and increasingly favored by consumers.
But at the same time, the self-driving market, which is expected to surpass the trillion-dollar scale, faces a double challenge: on the one hand, the development of the self-driving industry is not directly proportional to market demand, and self-driving organizers such as self-driving clubs and travel agencies are faced with meagre profits; on the other hand, the infrastructure and services they face are in their infancy.
60% of the total number of domestic tourists, the market size is expected to break trillion
In 2016, the number of domestic tourists was 4.44 billion, and self-driving tourism accounted for about 60% of the total number of domestic tourists. By 2020, the market for self-driving tourism is expected to surpass trillion.
According to the statistics on the number of self-driving tourists, the number of self-driving tourists has been increasing in the past five years, and the proportion of tourists in domestic tourism has been stable at more than half.
At the same time, more attention and support has been given to the emerging area of self-driving at the regional and national levels, with policies and regulations relating to self-driving, caravans and camping tourism coming into force from 2016 to 2017.
In July 2017, eight departments, including the State Administration of Tourism and the State General Administration of Sport, jointly issued the "Development Plan for Automobile Self-Driving Sports Camps". In the same month, 14 departments, including the National Development and Reform Commission and the Ministry of Finance, jointly issued the "Programme of Action for Promoting Quality Upgrading in Rural Tourism Development (2017)", in which self-driving tourism was highlighted.
The introduction of policy provides opportunities and policy guidance for domestic self-driving development.
Self-driving clubs make a meager profit and complete industrial chains are key
While the domestic market potential for self-driving is huge and national policy is actively guided, the self-driving industry is still in its infancy.
According to the 2016-2017 China Self-Driving Travel Annual Development Report, there are thousands of domestic self-driving clubs, car clubs, car clubs and so on, but the proportion of tourists who arrange self-driving trips by themselves accounts for the majority, with only about 15% of visitors to various organizations such as car clubs and self-driving clubs.
At the same time, online travel companies and traditional travel agencies that develop their own self-driving products are few and far between, with many online travel platforms selling only self-driving products from some suppliers and some self-driving clubs as important suppliers.
In terms of organizing self-driving activities, it covers many aspects such as "eating, living, walking, traveling, buying and entertaining", with a high degree of fragmentation, a heavy upstream supply chain and a high degree of randomness in tourist consumption.
The self-driving club is similar in nature to the travel agency, with the main profit-making model in the early years being dominated by offline activities and the core points being the self-driving tour line product and the team leader service.
But now the self-driving tour area line product homogenization is serious, the leader service level is uneven, the self-driving tour club is faced with the need to transform again.
It can be seen that self-driving is not a separate industry in itself, but a cross-regional, industry-wide ecological circle formed by the displacement characteristics of self-driving. It is very important to form a complete industrial chain.
Experts point out that in addition to basic tourism consumption, experience is the more important consumption element.
Therefore, for the development of the self-driving industry, we should enhance the experience characteristics, develop the "self-driving +" theme as well as the IP of the self-driving products.
Scenic paths are not just roads; car camps should not just feed and lodging
Facing the rise of self-driving, the basic development of self-driving is also relatively junior.
Li Guanjie pointed out that the tourist attractions are not just a road, but need to integrate the traffic and tourism elements, but the road repair and tourism itself are two departments to be responsible for, the transport sector to increase the tourism elements, but also stay in the construction of toilets, advisory centres, promotional bars and other facilities, and tourism integration is not high.
Compared with the well-known self-driving tour route "American Route 66", the construction experience is worth learning from.
Scenic design is no longer the most direct and fast route between the point of departure and the destination, but rather follows the design philosophy of "experience driving fun" to provide self-driving visitors with the best enjoyment of the beautiful scenery along the road; The scenic spots can link the point-shaped and surface-shaped tourism landscape, preserving the historical and cultural value of the eco-tourism resources along the route, as well as organizing various thematic activities to enhance the participation and recreational experience of tourists and create economic benefits for the local tourism industry.
In addition to the scenic path, the camp is also an important supporting facility for self-driving tours.
But few of the self-driving tourists known to the Beijing News reporters chose to stay at the camp.
Many of the camps, they argue, are biased toward infrastructure and can only meet the demand for food, shelter, low grade, and a single product that does not meet the many elements of self-driving.
Industry sources, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said that many of the companies that had made camps in previous years had done so for the land, and that after the land was taken, the infrastructure and services in the later stages had not kept up, and many of them had been operating at a loss. Without a late infusion of funds, it would be difficult to make matching products.
Consumer groups
In terms of age, the self-driving group is concentrated in the 21-40 age group, especially in the 31-40 age group, which has a certain economic base and has a high demand for personalized travel and is mostly a parent-child visitor, according to data released in 2017 by the China Travel Ship Association.
From the accommodation survey, the self-driving group has a relatively greater preference for non-standard accommodation.
By type of self-driving, peripheral self-driving is the most dominant type of self-driving, accounting for 84.32%.
Outbound self-driving is the aspiration of many people, but the proportion is still small.
At the same time, as consumer demand has risen, tourists who used to prefer self-driving "tourist attractions" have begun to change their minds, moving away from "getting out of the car to take photos and go to sleep," and focusing more on the experience and process of travel.
Dinosaurs use disguises to hide from enemies
At first glance, it's scary, but it looks like a statue.
Researchers have released the first results of a study of a rhinoceros-sized, miraculous fossil found by miners in Canada, noting that the fossil is well preserved, so experts call it "the Mona Lisa of the dinosaur world."
The fossil was so well preserved that it was even able to determine the colour of its scaly skin to be reddish brown, suggesting that it had some 'troubling experiences'
Related reports in the journal Current Biology describe it as "the best preserved dinosaur ever found and one of the best in the world."
The fossil is a newly discovered species of nodular dragon that lived between 110 million and 112 million years ago in the middle of the Cretaceous period.
Its extremely well-preserved state shocked the researchers, who described it as 'really stunning'
According to National Geographic, the herbivorous dinosaur fossil is the best preserved of its kind ever found.
On March 21, 2011, Shawn Funk discovered the fossil while digging at Suncor Millennium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada.
At the time, he came across something that didn't seem much like the surrounding rock, so he decided to take a closer look.
Afterward, the fossils he found were sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology in Canada.
It took researchers six years to make the beast, hidden inside a 2500-pound (1100-kg) clump, look real.
After so much hard work, the final results are now being announced.
"If you look at it, you almost believe it's sleeping," says Caleb Brown, a scientist and first author at the Shawn Funk, where the creature is on display
"It will be one of the most beautiful and well-preserved dinosaur specimens in the history of science - the Mona Lisa in the world of dinosaurs."
By studying its skin, the researchers found that the herbivorous creature, while covered in armor, like a walking tank, was likely to be under significant threat from a meat-eating dinosaur.
The heavily armoured dinosaur uses red and white disguises to evade predators and uses a covert technique known as "anti-shading," which is also used by many modern animals.
In this way, experts say, it is better able to blend in with its surroundings and thus avoid the enemy, suggesting it is preyed on by larger dinosaurs.
The 110 million-year-old creature, which belongs to the knot dragon family, made headlines for the first time in May and is currently on display at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.
After Mark Mitchell, a museum technician who was part of the team, spent 7,000 hours painstakingly lifting the animal's veil, the researchers now study it and name it "Borealopelta markmitchelli."
The samples were so well preserved that Dr Mitchell, as well as the international team of scientists, were able to record the patterns and shapes of scales and armor on their bodies.
They found "anti-shading," a common form of defense in the animal kingdom, which means the creature's back is darker than the colour on its side.
Although "anti-shading" is common, the findings are surprising, as the dinosaur's size far exceeds that of existing animals using anti-shading.
The dinosaur is under pressure to be hunted by a meat-eating dinosaur, thus evolving in a favourable direction, allowing it to hide in the matchup as a means of survival.
But most of the animals that exist, such as deer, zBan a or armadillos, are as small and vulnerable as prey, suggesting that the creature is under real pressure to survive.
"The fact that large heavy-armor dinosaurs were subjected to wild predation shows how dangerous the Cretaceous carnivorous dinosaurs were," Brown said.
Chemical analysis of organic compounds in its scales also showed that the dinosaur's skin color was reddish brown.
Scientists are continuing to study the creature's lifeline, including the stomach contents it retains to find the last food to eat.
They believe the dinosaurs fell into the river at the time of their death and were then swept into the sea before finally sinking to the bottom in a back-down fashion.
At the time, the climate in Alberta was as warm as it is in southern Florida today, and rivers and oceans may be deeper inland than they are now.
"It's really amazing because it's completely covered with preserved scaly skin and it's preserved in dimensional space so that its original shape can be preserved," Brown said.
"As a result, the creature is now in almost the same shape as it was in the Cretaceous.
You don't have to rebuild it with a lot of imagination; if you look at it, you almost believe it's sleeping.
The Cretaceous period was a time when bipedal giant theropod dinosaurs roamed the earth.
Although the Tyrannosaurus rex was the king of the dinosaurs, it did not appear until millions of years after the dinosaur, which may have been killed by some of the Tyrannosaurus rex's ancestors.
They include the high-ratchet, a 6-ton, 38-foot-long (11.5-meter-long) behemoth.
New research has found that scientists who appear in the journal Current Biology believe that the tuberous dragon was washed out into the sea after its death and later formed a mummy in the soil.
On March 21, 2011, Shawn Funk excavated the creature at the Millennium Mine near Fort McMurray, Alberta, Canada.
According to the museum, it is the world's best-preserved armored dinosaur, complete with skin and armor in areas from the nose to the buttocks.
The creature averages about 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighs 3,000 pounds (1300 kilograms).
It has two 20-inch sharp corners that protrude from the shoulder.
Researchers believe the herbivorous armored dinosaur was active in what is now western Canada before being swept into the sea by rivers that erupted in flooding.
But the dinosaur's burial on the sea floor allowed it to be kept intact.
The fossilised remains of this particular sample are so well preserved that the remaining skin is still covered with bumps on the dinosaur's skull.
As Michael Greshko wrote in National Geographic, this level of preservation is as rare as winning the lottery.
The more I look at it, the more I find it incredible.
The remaining skin fossils are still covered in dappled armor on the dinosaur's skull.
Its right front palm sits on its side, with five toes spreading upward.
I can count them out.
Reporters learned that adding alginate, humic acid and amino acids from natural or plant sources to the urea production process could improve the efficiency of traditional urea by 5-10 percentage points.
Environment-friendly, crop production potential is obvious, especially large-grain value-added urea is the high-quality raw material of BB fertilizer.
The total number of security personnel is double the number of security personnel at the 2012 London Olympics.
To secure the Rio Olympics, Brazil will launch its largest-ever security linkage program.
Previously, the Brazilian government said a total of 85,000 people from the military and police would fight together, including 20,000 military personnel and 65,000 police officers.
Most of the military will be responsible for guarding the Olympic venues, while the additional 3,000 will be responsible for security at international airports, subway stations and streets.
Police officers patrol other parts of the city, including subways, buses and streets.
Six thousand military personnel are understood to have arrived in Rio to serve Olympic security.
They are responsible for patrolling the airport as well as the main roads connecting the airport to the Olympic venues, in addition to the four major competition zones responsible for the Rio Olympics.
The introduction of evaluation mechanisms in the service sector is no longer new. For evaluation mechanisms to be effective, it is important to make regulation more effective and less formalistic.
How do activists learn to answer this question: "Whose streets?
On 9 August 2014, Brittany Ferrer was perturbed.
On the first day of his trip to New York City, the St. Louis native sat on Epiphany's rented bed and browsed Facebook on his phone.
She came across a post from a high school student.
It read:'Police just killed an 18-year-old child who was still lying on the street'
She was baffled to find no one else posted the message on the feed, which she turned off Facebook and turned on Twitter.
A @ TheePharoah user kept pushing her for Dynamic Times.
The St. Louis-area rapper live-tweeted the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old black man who was killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Mo.
He posted an image of Brown's lifeless body lying in the street, where his body lay for four hours.
"Crazy," thought Ferrer.
But for her and her community, death is nothing new.
She put her phone down and didn't open her Twitter again until that night to read about the crowd gathering on Canfield Avenue.
There were police footage and pictures of people shouting, as well as a picture of a man claiming to be Brown's father, which read: "Ferguson police just killed my unarmed son
She saw a live feed and a police officer stood in front of a group of protesters with a barking dog.
In another video, she said, another policeman raises his rifle and screams, "I will kill all of you, livestock."
"It's not normal," Ferrer recalled.
"This is not a murder we are used to and can call typical.
At that moment, I shuddered.
I was angry and cried.
She booked a return flight and went home the next day.
After landing at 11 p.m., she picked up her 6-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided the two would travel to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson over the next three years was the subject of a new documentary, "Whose Streets?," which opened in theaters on August 11.
It's a story of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and tenacity from the perspective of the people who live in this community and fill the streets demanding answers.
Ferrer was driving to Ferguson with his daughter (wearing a floral dress and a coronet) when the pair revisited the topic they had discussed numerous times before that morning - ' about the black experience and the black situation'
"Do you remember when I taught you that black people had to fight for their beliefs?" she recalled.
"We're going to Ferguson now because it's not right that the police killed an 18-year-old boy.
I had to take her, "Ferrer said later.
"What happened today is the culmination of everything that happened in the past.
She wants to know, see and rise from this.
Not only does she need to be well-developed in terms of activism and organization, but she needs to understand the different dimensions of the black experience and the black situation and understand what we have to do to be free and liberated.
Even if I had the privilege of providing her with a racist experience she had not experienced firsthand, she was no different from any other black girl.
If I protect her in this matter, I feel like I'm hurting her.
They arrived at Ferguson's first stop at a venue across the road from the South Florida Sansan Police Department, which became their encampment after the militants waited until the outcome of Officer Darren Wilson's eventual non-prosecution.
Ferrer and her daughter got in touch with a local business owner who makes bagged lunches.
They prepared the bags and were responsible for passing them on to the protesters.
Slowly, Ferrer began to form a new kind of activism.
"My activism changed completely after August 9," she said. She was president of the Association of Minority Nurse Students at the University of St. Louis, Missouri, and focused on food justice and health disparities in black communities.
"I have no organizational experience.
That's what it's all about.
A few weeks later, Ferrer met with the film's co-director, Sabah Foleyan, during a night parade.
Folyan said she and her director of photography, Lucas Alvarado Farrer, "just wanted to document" what happened.
A question came to Ferrer's mind: "Do you want to record or find a story that you can use?"
This suspicion stems from a lot of these cases: people-often white-enter a community to benefit from its pain and tenacity.
As Folyan explained in a recent interview, "We hear that people born in Ferguson don't focus their voices, and we want to do it differently."
Forleyan has been in touch with co-director Damon Davis, a regional artist known for his activism against death row inmates.
His involvement led Ferrer, along with six other locals, to join the "Whose Streets?" project team, which had been inseparable for several years after Brown was shot.
"This documentary is not about someone speaking for us or talking to us, it's about us," Davis said.
"I mainly focus on how these characters are presented, because that's how I'm presented."
Although the goal was not to focus on Ferrer's experience-it was to show that the movement was "not about Savior leaders, it was about community cohesion," says Folyan-she proved to be the most open of the film's participants.
As a result, "Whose Streets?" surprisingly chronicles Ferrer's personal life, such as falling in love and stepping into marriage.
"I feel naked," Ferrer laughed when he first saw the finished product.
"But I understand that doing this work and humanizing black people requires a degree of vulnerability."
In addition, Ferrer's story reaffirms and relocates the role of black cool-boy women in the broader Black Lives Matter movement.
Two of the movement's three founders - who created the # BlackLivesMatter on social media after the 2012 shooting of black teenager Trevon Martin - have been identified as cool.
"Black cool women in leadership generally support this movement," Ferrer said. "That's because we're fighting on multiple fronts.
Black cool women have to live with it all.
"The movement really has the support of black women and a lot of black cool women," he said.
Ferrer was chosen as the centerpiece of the film because of her identity, however, she insisted that 'this is not an affirmative action for things'
She is the one who inspires that energy,' she said.
"Although she's on the front line, it's no coincidence, because in these intersections of life, as a black, cool woman, you have a lot to do.
Through the screen, you can feel her energy.
Meanwhile, in Ferguson, news cameras have long since disappeared, but strained race relations between the community and police remain.
Ferrer was given a suspended sentence of more than two-and-a-half years for trying to block the highway during a march.
She describes the socio-political atmosphere in the area she calls home: "It's a mess."
Still, she has stuck to the chant she struggled to remember since taking to the streets of Ferguson three years ago.
"We have a duty to fight for freedom.
We have a responsibility to win.
We must love each other and support each other.
We have nothing to lose but the shackles of our bodies.
In fact, online translation services were already available on the Web a decade ago, and the argument that "machines are about to take the place of humans" was heard long ago.
Similarities: Artists use Chelsea Manning's DNA to create portraits
There are multiple faces in the middle of the gallery at the Friedman Art Gallery in New York: white, black and brown, with almost imperceptible similarities between each face, tied by a string hanging from the ceiling.
The 30 portraits were created by artist Dewey-Hagborg using cheek swabs and detritus sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
The former intelligence analyst was sentenced to 35 years in prison for leaking classified diplomatic cables via the Wikileaks website after Manning sent hair crumbs from the Fort Levenworth prison.
The exhibition opened on 2 August with the headline 'Similarities'
It was the result of two years of correspondence between Dewey Hagborg and Manning, who combined his discipline with his own in technology, computer science and art, while Manning, a prominent dissident who had served time in prison and completed gender reassignment surgery, was pardoned by former US President Obama three days before the end of her term.
By doing an algorithmic analysis from Manning's DNA, and thereby creating 30 portraits of a "likely appearance," Heather Dewey Harborg makes a biting and slightly unforgiving comment, both on DNA's versatility and on the very concept of identity itself.
Manning, who was born Bradley Edward and publicly admitted to thinking she was a woman in adolescence, was convicted in 2013 on 20 charges, including six counts of espionage law violations, computer fraud and theft.
While in prison, her image was suppressed, with only one photo, a grainy black-and-white selfie, looking visibly upset, sitting in the driver's seat and wearing a platinum blond wig.
In 2015, Heather Dewey Harborg was a huge success in her 2012 project, Stranger Visions.
In that work, she uses DNA, extracted from crumbs from cigarette butts and chewing gum medium court exhibits, to create portraits of 3D characters that may look similar.
That was an email she had just received from Paper magazine.
"They want to interview Chelsea Manning in prison and need a portrait," Heather Dewey Harborg told the media at the opening of the exhibition.
Chelsea Manning could not visit or take photos at the time, so they contacted Chelsea to ask if she would be interested in making a DNA portrait.
So the artist and her jailed muse became impossible pen pals, exchanging many letters over a two-year period.
They even created a comic book, "The Suppressed Head," by Shoili Kanungo, which envisioned that the president could grant privileges to Manning in the future and that she would be able to see the exhibition in prison.
It may be a coincidence that Obama asked for her release just days after the book was published, when Manning spent his seventh year in a military prison in Kansas.
And there is another layer of meaning to this exhibition, which, because of contemporary America, the Trump administration is constantly declaring war on government leaks and transgender military personnel, while looking for new ways that can be hyped on Twitter to starkly foment division, and the show is meant to heal that division.
Asked about the particular timing of all this, Heather Dewey Harborg said, ' There's a reason anything happens'
In the artist's statement written on the gallery wall, Manning's oversized signature is below ("i" in the name is drawn with a heart), calling for an end to "partisan chaos based on gender, sexual orientation, and culture."
On the opposite wall was her mitochondrial DNA sequence, with the Cs, Gs and As symbols twisted in pencil.
By containing 200 letters (or nucleotides, each artist's complex scientific lexicon), Heather Dewey Harborg hopes to express, by portraying these eerily similar portraits, that at least in physical structure, everyone is like this.
"I hope people get out of this mess, that our genome doesn't care who we are, how open genetic data is interpreted, how subjective it is," said Heather Dewey Harborg, whose 2007 video, False Memory, is also on display.
"DNA data can tell us a lot of different stories, so this is 30 of them."
The last work in the exhibition, in a room, comes from a page in the novel in the preceding illustration.
Shown in the United States are soldiers holding loudspeakers under the pompous, Kong-shaped manning.
"When they stop your speech, they win," the wall reads.
"So don't shut up.
"The content comes directly from a letter she wrote to me," the Philadelphia-based artist said.
"I'm afraid again, and I still have to say it.
Manning has yet to see the exhibition in person, as foreseen in the comics, but when she does, she will be masked by her own DNA portrait, like a group of protesters getting a cheer at the center of the gallery.
It was also purposeful, as was the case with all the objects in the exhibition, reaching the height of the genetic monoploid message she had written in pencil (5.2ft, Manning's height.
"In the past, I hung them on the wall, but I wanted them to feel like a bunch of people," Dewey Hagborg said of the portrait.
"But I wanted them to feel like a group of protesters following Chelsea, just as people were protesting her release."
Northwestern University professor and Oxford University employee wanted for murder
A Northwestern University professor and an Oxford University employee were later wanted after a man was found fatally stabbed inside a luxury Chicago apartment and a nationwide search is underway for the suspect, police said.
On Monday, Wyndham Lessem, 42, and Andrew Warren, 56, were issued with a first-degree non-bail murder warrant in connection with the death of Trenton H James Cornell Duranleau, Cook County court records show.
Cornell Duranleau, 26, died from multiple stabbing wounds, according to documents.
A community alert issued by the Chicago Police Department said the body was found on July 27.
Police arrived at the Grand Plaza apartment after receiving the call and found multiple lacerations on the victim's body.
Cornell Duranleau died at the scene and detectives are investigating the killing, while police are actively searching for two suspects, police said.
Lessem has been an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
The deputy director of campus relations, Alan K Kauberge, said in an emailed statement that Lessem has now been removed from his post and has been barred from the Northwestern campus.
"It is now a criminal case, the authorities are investigating it and Nord-Ouest is actively cooperating with the investigation," he said.
Warren is a senior financial assistant at Oxford University.
"We have been in contact with British police and stand ready to assist US investigative agencies as needed," a spokesman for the University of Oxford's Somerville College said in an e-mail statement.
The statement added that Warren's colleagues were deeply shocked and hoped he would be able to turn himself in.
Anthony Guglielmi, the Chicago Police Department's chief liaison officer, said the suspect was strongly encouraged to turn himself in to authorities.
Mr Guglielmi said: "The police have a general idea of their whereabouts and we are trying to locate possible locations.
Mr Guglielmi said local, regional and national authorities were fully assisting in the search for the suspect.
Mr Guglielmi said police had received a call from the manager of the Grand Plaza apartment, who had just received a secret tip that something was going on at apartment 1008.
Police described the situation as very dire at the time.
Mr Guglielmi said it was still unclear whether the incident also occurred on July 27.
He said that, according to the security camera, it was confirmed that Lessem and Warren were in the building at the time.
"We believe Professor Lessem has a relationship with the victim," Guglielmi said.
In a statement to residents, Grand Plaza's management team said: "The police are currently studying the victim's timeline and background and are investigating various motives, including a possible domestic incident.
"We will complete the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) road map in the near future," said Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mutko
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said it would not take too long to implement the remaining standards of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) aimed at restoring the rights of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA).
"Implementation of the road map standards has reached a stage where RUSADA has been given the right to plan and test in partnership with UKAD (UK Anti-Doping Agency)," he said.
The WADA road map has been updated in this regard, "Mr Mutko said on Thursday.
Deputy Prime Minister Mutko made the remarks in comments on the second part of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) road map, Compliance, which sets out the criteria for restoring RUSADA rights and was recently published on the organization's website.
According to Mutko, the standard does not contain anything that might raise Russian concerns.
He added, "Everything has to be declared and everything will be implemented.
The results will be presented to the IOC [ IOC ] and WADA in the near future.
One of the criteria mentioned in the list, however, is that the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) must publicly accept the findings, approved by Canadian lawyer Richard McKellen on WADA, regarding Russian state support for the use of doping in sport in the country.
Speaking about the matter, Mutko said: "We are investigating and there is no doubt that our anti-doping system has failed.
All measures have been implemented.
But there is no national plan behind this, and we will not acknowledge what does not exist.
Mutko's words echoed those of Vitaly Smirnov, head of Russia's Independent Public Anti-Doping Commission.
Speaking to media outlet Russian outlet RSport earlier in the day, Smirnov acknowledged past problems with the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA), but added: "We have said on various occasions that the report contains controversial positions and regulations.
No one plans to accept this report unconditionally, "Smirnov said.
In the wake of the doping scandal in November 2015, WADA suspended RUSADA's right to carry out doping tests inside Russia.
But in June, RUSADA was allowed to plan and coordinate tests this year under the supervision of international experts and UKAD.
During a visit to the group's headquarters in Moscow in July, WADA director-general Olivia Niggli said RUSADA was "moving in the right direction" in an effort to restore its rights.
For computers, whether it's checkers or national chess, beating humans was out of the question decades ago.
In an interview, Croatian Football Association president Davao Souk said that playing in the China Cup was meaningful for Croatian football and that the number of prizes in the China Cup was very large.
There's no need to find a replacement! There's zero tariff on more than 8,000 products
At a regular press conference held by the Ministry of Commerce on January 11, a spokesman for the Ministry of Commerce said that, to date, China has implemented 15 FTAs involving 23 countries and regions, covering more than 8,000 tariff-free imports.
At the same time, import cosmetics, Icelandic salmon, Chilean red wine, and ASEAN tropical fruits, You don't have to pay a lot of money for these products.
At present, China has signed 16 free trade agreements with 24 countries and regions, and 15 have entered into force, covering more than 8,000 products with zero tariffs.
In the case of agricultural products, with the implementation of the FTA, consumers will be able to taste quality and cheap produce from different places of origin throughout the year.
For example, in the case of tropical fruits such as durian, lychee and fire dragon, import tariffs have been reduced from 15% to 30% to zero.
Import duty on Icelandic salmon reduced from 10% to 12% to zero tariff;
For red wine in Georgia and Chile, import tariffs were reduced from 14% to 30% to zero;
Also New Zealand's beef and milk powder and other characteristics of agricultural products have a larger tax cut.
In the case of industrial goods, for example, import tariffs on some cosmetics in Switzerland have been reduced to zero;
Part of the watch import tariff was reduced by 50% and will be reduced to zero in a few years;
South Korea's import tariffs on products such as refrigerators, rice pans, massages and beauty salons have been reduced by 40% and will be reduced to zero in a few years;
There are also consumer electronics and other relatively large tax cuts.
At the same time, zero-tariff products under the FTA also include intermediate products and raw materials needed for the manufacture of many domestic final consumer goods, which has also contributed to the structural upgrading of domestically produced consumer goods to some extent.
Nearly one-third of China's total imports can enjoy preferential tariff treatment under FTAs, most of which are final consumer goods, bringing tangible benefits to consumers, said Gao Feng, a spokesman for the Ministry of Commerce.
Further reduction of import tariffs on consumer goods
Since December 1, 2017, China has made adjustments to import duties on some consumer goods, further reducing import duties on consumer goods, covering a wide range of consumer goods such as food, health-care products, pharmaceuticals, daily necessities, shoes and hats, household equipment, cultural and entertainment, and daily general merchandise, involving a total of 187 8-digit tariff codes.
The average tax rate on this batch of consumer goods will be cut straight from 17.3% to 7.7%, almost "cut to the waist"
Since January 1, 2018, China has also made some adjustments to other import and export tariffs.
Import duties on some cosmetics such as lip balm, eye shadow and perfume were reduced from 10% to 5%;
Lower tariffs mean that consumers do not have to buy on their behalf, much less travel abroad to buy their preferred foreign products.

OVERVIEW: Year-end U.S. mall rules on big difference shopping returns to be cautious
China New Network on 29 December
Just after Christmas, there was a rush of returns, according to the US newspaper Le Monde.
More than half of the goods sold last Christmas were returned for replacement, ABC reported.
In addition, there are a number of readers who have been scammed online shopping, consumers need to pay more attention to the informal website shopping.
In general, large shopping companies have formal and reasonable return procedures, but care must be taken when buying gifts or e-shopping from small stores.
Ms. Hou, of Roland, bought a coat for more than 60 yuan (U.S. dollars) at an online store that specializes in printed coats on Dec. 1, and it hasn't arrived yet.
She emailed the customer service and there was no reply.
Another netizen explodes, travel to the United States last year, buy a mobile phone from a third-party seller, send to find it is a box of rubber mud.
When you know you've been scammed, apply to the website for a refund and get a full refund.
But there are customers who think the website refund service is not $100% perfect.
Mr. Wang, a Chinese-American resident of Northern California, said he had twice purchased an accelerated delivery service for a site and four yuan for an accelerated service, but had failed to deliver it on time on both occasions.
A refund was then applied for and no response was received.
Large malls or shopping malls have better return policies.
Most Macy's items are refunded in full within 180 days.
But the goods must remain "original" and must have a purchase voucher such as a receipt or a bank purchase record.
If there is no voucher, customers can also get mall points that can be used to buy other goods.
Target usually has a 90-day return period for general merchandise and 15 days for electronic goods.
However, the return period for electronic and entertainment goods purchased between 1 November and 25 December 2017 was extended to 30 days.
It is important to note that the 30-day refund period runs from December 25, which is to return the goods by January 25, 2018.
Extreme shopping experience, new era of shopping development
More than a decade ago, our country is still in the seller's market in general, people's choice is limited, the demand is also limited.
But after a decade of development, the market has long been transformed from a seller's market to a buyer's market, and today's consumer tastes have become more snarky, and they are no longer content with simple "hand-to-hand delivery" shopping practices.
So how to get consumers an extreme shopping experience is the next competitive point for property developers.
And among the many factors that influence the consumer's shopping experience, shopping centers in business circles have the most significant impact.
See how city builders everywhere focus on the shopping experience.
There are no two exactly the same leaves in the world, not to mention two exactly the same shopping centres, a well-known shopping centre must have its own characteristics.
For example, Turkey's world-famous Kanyon shopping mall, with its unique wave-shaped architecture inspired by the Canyon, is known as the Kanyon, and walks 200 metres in the middle of the Kanyon as if it were inside the Grand Canyon.
In addition to the canyon-style design, there is also a large, recessed oval venue in the middle of the shopping centre, which is unique in shape and often features performances.
Because of the open platform design, visitors can walk on each floor looking down at the activities carried out in the "canyon" and have the effect of shifting scenery.
At home, Nanjing Forest Moore Commercial Street, known as China's first forest-style shopping mall, combines shopping with ecology and fairy tales.
The 7000-square-meter green square, 3000-square-meter roof water platform, the project consists of nine single buildings connected by air corridors between the buildings, the overall design of the sunken courtyard, taking the French sycamore above the earth as the architectural epidermis, the roof water roof roof, to create a forest-like feeling.
Walking into the forest Moore is like accidentally falling into the rabbit hole in Alice's wanderings, climbing along the trunk of the tree to surround the building, the meadow, the clear spring, to bring people into the forest full of vitality and vitality.
There are also in Chongqing, Longhu built the JiajiaBin business circle, planning the business, planning the future introduction of more than 50 international top-level specialty flagship stores, more than 100 international top brands and more than 500 domestic and foreign famous brands, to create a service industry cluster, the theme of the distinctive business center.
Not only that, but it also integrates ecology into architecture, TOD public transport, fashion shopping, life services, dining, entertainment, education and sports, and leads consumers to enjoy the unique "waterfront culture" of Chongqing, integrating shopping with water entertainment and leisure.
To sum up, there are already a number of housing companies that have gained insight into the discovery trajectory of this new urban business, and industry sources say this consumer experience-centric consumption model of how to combine shopping with experience will also be the mainstream of urban development in the future.
Today's business circles are not only a hub for goods, but also a comprehensive place for integrating artistic culture and creative themes, as well as carrying people's responsibility for urban living.
Therefore, in order to meet the needs of consumers to eat, drink and buy the one-stop-shop material, it is necessary to maximize the multi-level spiritual needs of transmitting culture and art, and give play to the demand of livable living, which is the high point of the future development of the business circle.
In Chongqing, the north bank of Guoxing Jiangshan, located in Jiangbei, near Guanyin Bridge, the world's commercial essence, international giants around the world, first-class brands gathered, with international fashion close-up.
Here step by step prosperous, gather the world essence;
Dongyuan JinYue has a better shopping environment, Dongyuan JinYue near Nanping Business Circle, enjoy the west and even the country's leading four-storey three-dimensional transportation system, enhanced shopping comfort.
In addition, the landscaping and landscaping of the two pedestrian streets of Hei Wah Road and Wanda Square have been upgraded. About 300 trees have been planted and 40,000 square metres of land have been converted, raising the profile of the Nanping business circle;
And Longhu Yuhu No. 1, near Chongqing's first low-density waterfront business circle - the Lai Ka Waterfront business circle is surrounded by nine parks, with a low density and high degree of openness, making people more willing to stop, stop and enjoy their shopping, rather than being swept forward in a hurry by the crowd behind them, and really achieving "walking shopping."
Today's business competition will only be more and more fierce, how to kill a blood path in the homogenized market, to capture the "shopping mecca" reputation in the hearts of future consumers, it is worth all real estate developers to think seriously.
Differentiation strategies alone are not enough, and only developers who really take consumers to heart, rush consumers to think, and offer consumers the ultimate and minimalist shopping experience can laugh in the storm's coming markets.
Of course, at the end of the day I think it's the people of Chongqing who are most happy and have such a good shopping experience and business circle that no one could have imagined today's prosperity 10 years ago.
Festival of Things: Consumerist revelry disguises real environmental prices
168.2 billion yuan, which is the turnover of Tmall users within 24 hours of the "Tmall Double XI Global Carnival" on November 11, 2017.
Specifically, after the start of "Double 11," the turnover of the Cats exceeded 10 billion in just 3 minutes, 20 billion in 6 minutes and 05 seconds, and 100 billion in 9 hours.
On this day, the total number of payments made by global consumers through Alipay reached 1.48 billion, up 41% from last year.
These purchases will bring in 812 million logistics orders.
Whether it is the Tmall purchase platform or the Alipay payment platform, all belong to Ma Yun's Ali Group.
A decade ago, no one would have imagined that the "Singles' Day" subculture created by young singletons in self-deprecation on November 11 would be incorporated by e-commerce into what is now the phenomenon-level "Double 11" shopping spree.
On November 11, 2009, for the first time, Alibaba used a "Singles Day" marketing gimmick: No one is in a relationship with you, so "single dogs" come online.
The result came as a surprise, with Taobao Mall (the predecessor of Tmall) trading at more than 52 million yuan, 10 times the daily turnover of the day.
Since then, "Double 11" has been a shopping spree created by Alibaba, from the beginning of domestic buyers and sellers to the current influx of global merchants, nine years on, Tmall "Double 11" 100 billion transactions have been more than 3,200 times that year, making "Black Friday" unattainable.
There are also a number of electric merchants, of which "Jingdong" is the strongest.
"Jingdong" has its own shopping festival "6.18," but no "Double 11" impact, this year from November 1 to 11, "Jingdong" cumulative sales reached 127.1 billion yuan.
And "Double 11," followed by a similar "Double 12" discount rave, Christmas New Year shopping period.
Across the New Year, waiting for Chinese consumers are the pre-Spring Festival shopping period, Valentine's Day shopping period, consumption, will not take a holiday.
The environmental problems caused by instantaneous mass consumption have attracted the attention of professionals and institutions.
According to a conservative estimate of the usual standard of 0.2kg per container in the industry, more than 300,000 tonnes of waste was generated during the "Double 11" period this year, according to Xinhua Daily Telegraph.
Liu Hua, director of the pollution prevention program at Greenpeace East Asia, told the Chinese-foreign dialogue that orders for "Double 11" cats alone would generate 160,000 tons of packaging waste this year.
The National Post Office issued a report in 2016 indicating that there were approximately 780 million pieces of express mail during the "Double 11" period (November 11-16) in 2015, using more than 3 billion knitted bags, 9.922 billion boxes, 16.985 billion metres of tape, and the length of the tape could circumnavigate the Earth's equator 425 times.
And this year, the National Post Office expects the "Double 11" express business volume to exceed 1.5 billion pieces.
Wang Shi, manager of a waste incineration center in Beijing, told Xinhua that the daily amount of waste entering the site after "Double 11" exceeded 2,000 tons, and also exceeded the capacity of the incineration station to process it.
Express companies have realized that the environmental pollution caused by the express delivery industry cannot be ignored.
Some e-commerce logistics companies, including Suning, have introduced recycled plastic express boxes, recycled bags that can be reused as shopping bags and garbage bags, but the acceptance of troubled consumers is not high.
Ma also called on the logistics industry in Weibo to support "green packaging" and "green logistics"
The tweet reaped more than 68,000 "likes"
What kind of mobile payment do Germans want?
Zhang Dongfang: The mobile payment war situation opened in Germany is not expected.
WeChat Pay and PayPal just moved the battlefield to Europe, and the competition remained the same, as did the grab - the Chinese, which is also global?
Where there is Alipay, there must be WeChat to pay.
Under an agreement with Wirecard, the German e-payment service, WeChat Pay formally set out to land in Germany in November and gradually set up a European-wide layout.
The reunion took place in Europe.
All the while, Alipay and WeChat Pay have been singing along the road to globalisation.
For China's approach to the globalization of mobile payments, Airy Consulting "China's Third Party Mobile Payment Industry Research Report 2017" concludes in two ways: First, through strategic investment, export of experience, and taking stakes in and supporting local mobile payment companies abroad.
The second is to promote mobile payment services to foreign merchants through the behavior of Chinese tourists going abroad, thus changing the recognition and acceptance of Chinese mobile payment in foreign countries.
Indeed, the Chinese have the world.
China's booming economy, coupled with a large population base, has made spending by Chinese tourists in Europe an enticing figure.
But it is also doomed, this time in Germany to open the Chinese mobile payment war is not expected.
Is WeChat Pay and PayPal simply moving the battlefield to Europe, with the competition unchanged and the position of the snatch unchanged - or the Chinese, which is also global?
More ground-breaking is the question of whether China's mobile payments can reach home in Europe?
Consider Germany.
The enchanted "new retail
Chen Xin Lei and Yang Kaihan: Amazon announced its foray into bookstores and grocery stores as it squeezed into the world's top 10 retailers, and both timing and motivation are worth the fun.
Amazon opened its first brick-and-mortar bookstore in Seattle in November 2015, followed by two bookstores in Portland and San Diego.
Amazon opened stores in New York at the start of 2017 and plans to have at least eight stores by the end of the year.
At almost the same time, Amazon announced that its Amazon Go was operating on a trial basis, that customers did not have to wait in line to get to the store, that they did not need to pay their bills, that they entered the store and took the desired item away, and that the purchase amount was automatically deducted from the customer's Amazon account.
As far as Amazon is concerned, the sudden frequency of action above the brick-and-mortar store in recent years is a very unexpected thing.
For as early as 2007, in an open letter to shareholders, CEO Jeff Bezos stressed that Amazon would not open physical stores easily unless the following four conditions were met simultaneously
1. We have to be sure this new opportunity will pay off for shareholder investment;
2. We must be sure that this new opportunity is of great significance to the whole company;
3. We have to be sure that this new opportunity is being ignored by the market;
4. We have to be sure that in this market we have the resources to make customer-oriented differentiation.
Bookstores and grocery stores, the most ramshackle of the two brick-and-mortar retail categories, were the first rivals to fall after Amazon's rise.
Amazon announced its foray into the two physical markets as it squeezed into the world's top 10 retailers, with both timing and motivation well worth the fun.
Does Amazon's approach contradict the guarantees in the shareholder letter?
A similar voice was heard on the other side of the globe, and on the morning of October 13, 2016, the chairman of Alibaba's board of directors, Jack Ma, gave a keynote speech at the 2016 Hangzhou - Yunnan Congress.
He said: "Starting next year, Alibaba will no longer refer to 'e-commerce'
The era of pure e-commerce will soon come to an end, with no e-commerce in the next decade or two, replaced by 'new retail'
The combination of online and offline logistics will generate new retail.
For a moment, "new retail" three words as if by magic, by the industry is often hanging in the mouth.
But what does "new retail" really mean?
If it's just a combination of online and offline, then the concept is not new.
In 2016, eMarketer tracked 180 of the largest electric merchants and estimated total sales at about $200 billion, with the top 25 accounting for more than $159bn.
Of the 25, 18 are traditional retailers that have only started operating online in the past five years (such as Macy's, Nordstrom, Target, Gap, etc.).
And Alibaba Group 28.3 billion yuan shares in Suning Yun Shang, also experienced.
Globally, retailers and electricians are shifting from single-channel to full-channel retail systems that cover brick-and-mortar stores, e-commerce, mobile terminals and social media.
Is Mr Ma's "new retail" more a summary than a vision of the future?
If not, what is the difference between the whole-channel concept and "new retail"?
Perhaps the crux of the matter is not whether online and offline will merge, but how.
Looking back at the past 20 years in retail, the rise of e-commerce, like the rise of discount retailers in earlier years, has focused on price and convenience.
Relying on these two pain points, the electrician moved very standardised products, such as books and CD, from offline to online.
With the development of online consumption habits and the continuous improvement of customer experience, electric merchants have extended their tentacles to other categories and started to improve efficiency.
In the words of Alibaba CEO Zhang Yong, "Use the ideas and technologies of the Internet to overhaul and upgrade the existing total of about 30 trillion social retailers, so that the rising consumer demand in China can be effectively met and the whole process of producing, circulating, and servicing goods can be made more efficient by the extensive use of the Internet and big data."
So the road of the electric merchant, is a surface light assets, the actual heavy assets of the road.
"Light" refers to the fact that the burden of fixed assets, staffing, management processes, etc. is not as large as that of traditional retailing; "heavy" refers to the need for huge investment in logistics, warehousing, etc.
The change of logistics mode ensures the high efficiency of electric business.
Chinese Premier Li Keqiang hosted a State Council executive meeting on April 28, at which he said expanding domestic consumer demand was an important step toward steady growth and structural adjustment, according to the government's Web site.
The meeting determined that the relevant departments should put forward concrete proposals based on scientific assessment.
By the end of June this year, a pilot project to reduce import tariffs will be launched to gradually expand the range of tariff-reducing commodities;
In conjunction with the tax reform, consummate the consumption tax policy of clothing, cosmetics and other mass consumer goods, and adjust the tax scope, tax rate and collection link;
The establishment and resumption of duty-free shops at ports of entry, the reasonable expansion of duty-free varieties, the increase of a certain amount of duty-free purchases, and the convenience for domestic consumers to buy foreign products at home;
We will further promote the facilitation of customs clearance and tax refund for overseas travellers, and strictly implement the requirements for the voluntary declaration and payment of taxes for inbound goods in accordance with the law.
To formulate inspection and quarantine policies to support cross-boundary electricity traders' imports, and to clean up unreasonable charges in the import chain;
We will accelerate the promotion of Chinese product brands, support the development of physical stores and achieve online and offline interaction.
We should standardize the market order, crack down on fake and inferior, and promote the elimination of superior and inferior.
Let the consumer can be near comfort, convenient shopping.

On January 18, Alibaba held a summit dialogue in Chongqing to promote accurate poverty alleviation and rural renewal by exploring a new model of "Internet + poverty eradication."
This is after the introduction of a rural strategy, the launching of a rural Taobao project, the launching of a pro-poor platform, the establishment of the Alibaba anti-poverty fund, Ali's fight against poverty again "plus."
The fight against poverty is one of China's most important national strategies at the moment.
The full eradication of poverty has never been achieved in China in the past few thousand years.
"E-commerce to help the poor is a new round of pro-poor development innovative measures, is to achieve accurate poverty reduction, accurate poverty eradication important grasp.
The central government attaches great importance to, and points out, the role of the Internet in helping to push the country out of poverty, promoting poverty alleviation with precision and precision, and enabling agricultural products to get out of the countryside through the Internet.
As a result, Ali proposed a rural strategy as early as 2014, juxtaposed with big data cloud computing and globalization as Ali's three core strategies for the next 20 years.
In the same year, Ali launched the Rural Taobao (Village Taobao) project, recruiting "Village Junior" in the countryside to lead farmers out of poverty through e-commerce.
In 2017, Ali worked with the business sector to build a pro-poor channel, which now connects 13 provinces and 120 poverty-stricken counties at the national level.
There are already 2,118 Taobao villages created by the Ali platform.
Of these, nearly 400 were found in poverty-stricken districts of the province and 33 in poverty-stricken counties of 13 countries.
In 2017, on Alibaba's Chinese retail platform, national Taobao Village sales reached 120 billion yuan.
Mr Zhang said that in the face of a national strategy to fight poverty, Mr Ali had been thinking about how to use the innovation capabilities of the Ali economy, such as technology, big data and cloud computing, to make a new way out of poverty.
Among them, Village Taobao is the main load-bearing platform of Ali e-commerce out of poverty, and has gone through a direct sale of the new link of the Internet out of poverty.
In the planting link, Village Taobao and ant gold joint development of agricultural tools and micro-loan support.
In 2017, out of 832 poverty-stricken counties at the national level, there were 795 ant gold services, providing easy payment, credit and other services.
Vegetable birds tackle warehousing and logistics, Tmall is in charge of sales, and Ali Yun's big data feedback guides agricultural production, further improving the supply standards, quality and market competitiveness of agricultural products.
The development of e-commerce out of poverty requires not only products, sales channels, industrial planning, but also talents.
By offering e-commerce courses at Taobao University to teach farmers standardized, quality and scale farming methods, Ali achieved a combination of "pro-poor + pro-mind" to enable farmers to lift themselves out of poverty sustainably.
These courses already cover about 92% of poor counties at the national level.
And the "public welfare mentality, commercial means" of thinking out of poverty, but also to ensure that Ali in the fight against poverty to achieve "real poverty."
Ma Yun, chairman of Alibaba's board of directors, has said poverty eradication should be divided into three phases: poverty alleviation, poverty alleviation and wealth creation.
To help the poor is to teach people to fish, to get out of poverty is to teach people to fish, to get rich is to create a "fish pond" for farmers, so that farmers have fish to feed.
E-commerce-driven industries to help the poor, is to create fish ponds.
In the field of industrial poverty alleviation, the model of poverty alleviation in the apple industry in Luochuan, Shaanxi Province, which was developed by Ali in cooperation with Luochuan, has been used as an example by the relevant departments for replication and popularization throughout the country.
Ali e-commerce to help the poor work has also been recognized at the decision-making level.
E-commerce enterprises, represented by Alibaba, have been sent messages to ensure that farmers increase their output and increase their income through online and offline channels.
A number of Village Junior and Ant Gold Service employees have also been invited to the United Nations and Africa to share the experience of e-commerce out of poverty.
At present, the China office of the United Nations World Food Programme has joined with the village to launch the electric commerce industry in Anhui and other places to alleviate poverty.
The third annual conference of the New Economic Think Tank, co-organized by the Ali Institute and the China Vision think tank, was held on January 16. Zhang Li, director of the Institute of Electronic Commerce of the Ministry of Commerce, attended and spoke at the conference.
She believes that we are actually ignoring the most important issues of globalization, that is, the body and use of globalization, and the stage of globalization.
In this way, many people think that globalization has stagnated, and many developed and developing countries, with their different attitudes towards globalization in the new phase, are different to the pattern.
The second concept is the question of the medium-term phase of globalization. What are the constraints on the medium-term phase of globalization?
Constrained by the economic environment, it is because of the changes in the economic base that globalization has taken place.
Zhang believes that the global economic adjustment will essentially end at the end of 2017, with a new period of growth after 2018, and that the next round of growth must be product-led.
Tokyo's first fresh supermarket, 7FRESH, has opened recently with plans to lay more than 1,000 stores across the country over the next three to five years.
Coupled with Ali's box of fresh horses, Yonghui's super-species, Suning's sushi, and Merino's palm fish, the "new retail stores" began to pile up and "baffle" each other on innovative models and even prices.
Fresh supermarket battle to upgrade, has become a new retail field of the phenomenon-level topic, new retail in the end where?
"In 2018, we will quickly enter the country, before the Spring Festival in Beijing, Shanghai, Hangzhou will open a large number of shops.
Box horse fresh life CEO Hou Yi 10 at the second new retail summit revealed the 2018 "new style of play."
"Starting in 2018, the box horse is not just a live electric business, but one that meets the needs of consumers for instant service."
Core mode below the line is drainage, experience, online is the real sales.
Distinguishing from traditional big stores and supermarkets, Boxer is a fun-to-eat "net-red shop" in the eyes of many consumers, and there are even intermediaries who have hit the concept of "box room"
Online e-commerce platforms and offline retailers have advantages and disadvantages, but consumers are in a variety of channels, so both sides are trying the full-channel model.
The industry believes that in the context of the consumption upgrade, 2018 "box horse" stores will be more and more.
And the box horse continues to explore more consumer areas from its original freshness, foreshadowing more innovation in the retail market in the new year.
"For example, a combination of online and offline business models has caught the eye of consumers, with fresh supermarkets all over the place hailing."
"But it's no use saying more about these relationships, and finally it comes down to whether you're giving the consumer a great experience and I'm willing to pick up the tab."
In the new retail environment, consumers' habits have changed, and so has the demand for purchases, according to CEO Yuan Bin, a co-chairman of the company.
It turns out that the line is split, the line to beat the line, the line to counter-offensive line, now is holding hands together, because consumers no longer have the distinction between the line and the line.
The competition for capital has made the new retail gunpowder, which is now represented by fresh supermarkets, full of flavor.
According to the analysis, the new retail competition in the first-tier cities is still far from the Red Sea pattern, and there are still a large number of second-tier cities to be excavated, the market still has a lot of opportunities and space.
Different types of industries for the layout of new retail, will bring the development of new retail into a diversified state of development.

Total sales are back on track for record growth
Since 2006, China's online retail sales can be said to have been super-fast growth, it is estimated that at that time online shopping is very fresh, do not go out can buy things, too cool!
But starting in 2013, the growth rate of online retail sales began to fall below 50%, and in 2015, for the first time, it fell below 40%, to 26.2% in 2016.
But this year has been different, with online retail sales picking up again, with growth rebounding to 34.2% in January-September.
A much higher rate of growth than in 2015 and 2016.
Maybe we all go for a spin and find it more enjoyable to buy or buy.
Among them, physical goods online retail sales of nearly 5.08 trillion yuan, services online retail sales of nearly 1.49 trillion yuan.
The share of total retail sales of social goods reached 13.6%, up nearly 3 percentage points year-on-year.

Help you avoid the company becoming the next Uber start-up
Amy Erett once wanted to investigate employee well-being at her e-commerce start-up, but the investigation did little.
The responses are often vague, unhelpful and, worse, deceptive.
Even though she promised anonymity, some employees still don't trust the process.
"There was a lack of consistency and objectivity in the responses," said Madison Reed, a San Francisco e-commerce hair care company that manages 75 people.
So she called out for help.
A new crop of human resources start-ups has sprung up to help companies understand how employees feel.
They build and license software specifically designed to measure employee engagement, allowing companies to quickly conduct polls for specific teams and population groups, provide anonymous and complaint hotlines for employees, and in some cases allow whistle-blowers to bypass executives to report directly to the board.
"Now, you can track your health with tools like Strava and Fitbit, but where is the company's Fitbit?," says Jim Barnett, co-founder and chief executive of Glint, a Redwood City start-up used by companies to measure employee engagement.
Ms Erett said within three years she had used Glint to gain more insight into what employees think and feel.
In addition to specific teams' quick surveys and opinion polls, Glint provides a corporate heat map of which units have the most complaints and which managers have the lowest approval scores at a glance - allowing her to gain insight into why.
Companies began to realize they had to master the company's workplace culture to avoid becoming the next Uber, which was caught up in a scandal after former Uber employees published a blog post describing the harassment environment in which the speakers were punished by the company.
For startups like Glint, the company's desire for oversight is a money-rich business opportunity.
According to Let's Talk Payments, a financial technology analysis website, the value of the global governance, regulatory and compliance industries could exceed $118.7 billion by 2020.
Convercent, a start-up in Denver, Colorado, which works to help companies prevent and detect bad behavior, saw an increase in interest and activity in this area during the period when Uber's reputation was damaged earlier this year.
Convercent has nearly 600 customers, including Epicurean, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber recently signed up as a customer.
Like Glint, Convercent allows companies to send customized "diagnostic" surveys, collect confidential responses in real time and view heat maps of their problem areas.
Convercent also offers anonymous messaging hotlines for employees to report bad behavior.
If the chairman is implicated, then the complaint goes straight to the board.
Patrick Quinlan, founder and chief executive of Convercent, said: "The court of public opinion usurps the powers of the regulator.
If a company is found to treat employees badly or behave unethically, even if regulators don't step in, the company could face high consequences of consumer resistance, staff attrition and involvement in litigation, Mr. Quinlan said.
Ruby Tuesday, a restaurant chain spanning more than 500 locations and with more than 25,000 employees, has been using Convercent for more than a year to ensure that employees understand work guidelines and work protocols and provide easy access to the company's headquarters.
Before then, if employees want to report a problem, they must find the company's head office phone number or email, file a formal complaint and hope the head office takes it seriously.
It's often a daunting and disturbing experience, says James Vetrano, general counsel at Ruby Tuesday, who says he doesn't think there's a good way to track employee complaints.
But now that the company uses Convercent, it can more quickly spot and solve problems - such as discrimination, harassment or unfair wage practices - that were previously unknown to executives in remote offices, cities or states.
"I can get a closer, 360-degree view of the work experience," says Vetrano, who runs Ruby Tuesday's risk management team.
"We are protecting our shareholders from employment litigation."
In the wake of the collapse of the accounting firm in Andorra in the wake of the Enron scandal and ethics violations, companies began to place more emphasis on ethics, values and employee engagement in 2002, Mr. Quinlan said.
But it wasn't until "social media went into its own world" that companies realised they couldn't stop their explosives from spreading viral online.
"Before using technology to monitor ethics, people saw hope as a strategy," he said.
Both Glint and Convercent offer their software as a service and charge companies a recurring fee for the use of their products.
The business model and business opportunities are backed by venture capitalists who already support the two startups.
In February, Convercent raised $10 million from companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, and its total capital rose to $47 million.
In November, Glint received $10 million in funding from Bessemer Venture Partners, bringing its total to $60 million.
Given the interconnectedness of companies, culture and venture capital, these investments are hardly surprising.
A growing body of research shows that today's employees expect more from the workplace than before.
In a competitive market like Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are just bets.
Employees want to feel that they are accepted, valued, and that their time is spent on a company with a positive mission.
"When people are happy to join the company and feel that their voices are being heard and that the work they do is beneficial, they are more committed to making the company successful," says Nina McCartney, vice president of global welfare and employee experience at LinkedIn. LinkedIn uses both Convercent and Glint software.
Investors pay off when their portfolio companies do well; companies do well when employees are loyal and dedicated.
It's no surprise that third-party analytics tools will look for financial support if they promise to increase employee loyalty and engagement.
Workplace culture experts say it is important to have data on employee engagement.
But unless the company's administrators take action, the data is useless.
In fact, if a company asks employees for feedback, it can be expected that the company is making changes.
If change does not progress fast enough, or not at all, it can bring disappointment and lead to employees leaving the company.
If you're looking for 4,000 suggestions, then you need to be prepared for 4,000 conversations, "said Russell Rath, head of consulting at business management firm Cotter International, who has seen some companies over-rely on data gathering errors.
"Because if you don't follow through, the staff will think,'Did you really hear me?
Do you care?
If you don't care, why should I?'
Mr Erett said Madison Reed, which now conducts monthly staff surveys, had been able to take action on the day Glint reported problems.
After collecting feedback from employees about their frustration with the speed of decision-making and the quality of communication, she was able to solve the problem by reorganizing the company's in-house team and increasing communication training.
Ruby Tuesday is gaining new insights into its workforce and, in the long run, wants to be able to make a shift in an industry known for its high rate of brain drain and better retain staff.
"If you're not committed to creating a culture of transparency, you lose talent," Vetrano said.
"If you lose talent, you lose clients.
And when you lose a client, you lose the company.

NCAA cancels twice-a-day practice and extends day practice for the Bears
Close to 11 p.m., members of the UCLA football team lingered and chatted next to the team's new campus practice field.
Some players have taken off their sweatshirts to reveal the sweaty body after training hard on the first day of camp.
For a large part of the team, this spare few minutes is a break.
The players who take part in the summer course will return to the dorm for the final exam after three hours of practice and then return to the Wasserman football centre for a meeting at 6: 30 the next morning.
The next three days are a run-in for these guys, "Bears coach Jim Mora said Monday as he headed into Tuesday.
The NCAA cancelled two practice sessions a day (designed to ease the burden on players), but actually extended their training time during the day-at least until the end of Friday.
That's why UCLA's first three practices are scheduled to begin at 7: 15 p.m. to accommodate a schedule where players are already jammed.
From cancelling two practices a day to more one a day, the Bears began training almost a week before last season, with Mora training at the summer school for the first time in six seasons at Westwood.
They plan to start 18 practices from August 20 before starting pregame preparations for the first official game against the Texans in September.
Mora said he supported the NCAA rule change, although it would have added another item to the player's busy schedule.
"In three or four days, we're going to give them a huge amount of training, which is very challenging," Mora said.
"They've just passed. They're honing. They're all great kids."
I think about Saturday and we'll have more time, which is really great.
As soon as the camp is over, UCLA will stop training, which is not an easy task given the adjacent parking lot and the clear view of Luskin Center, who has been battered and bruised by football thrown through the back of the goal post's protective net.
The Bears will be staying at the hotel starting this weekend, but Mora acknowledged there could be problems once the rooms are vacant during the season.
We will take security measures,' Mora said.
"This is a real concern, and the idea that someone might rent a room and sit in it and record a training scene is not far-fetched.
If you have a training tape, it's also pretty good.
But we'll have security there and we'll have security in Car Park 8.
We will use the resources available and do our best.
I wouldn't worry too much about that.
We have made a plan.

Facebook to launch fact-checking feature to crack down on fake news
Facebook, the world's largest online social network that is trying to crack down on so-called fake news, announced on Thursday that it would send more potential hoax articles to third-party testing agencies and display the results below the original post.
Facebook will begin using newer machines to learn to detect possible hoaxes and send them to a fact-checker, and may display the fact-checking results below the original post, the company said in a statement on its website.
Facebook has been criticized as one of the main outlets for so-called fake news, with many suggesting it influenced the 2016 US presidential election.
The issue has also become a major political topic in Europe, with voters facing a flood of fake stories ahead of France's presidential election in May and Germany taking the lead in passing support for a fine plan ahead of the September election, with fines imposed if social media networks fail to remove hate posts in time.
Facebook said in a separate statement in Germany on Thursday that it was launching a new fact-checking feature test in the United States, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
Sarah Sue, Facebook news feed product manager, said in a blog post: "In addition to seeing which stories are questioned by third-party fact-checkers, people want more context to help them make informed decisions about what to read and share.
Facebook will continue to test its "relevant article" feature and make other changes to its news feed to reduce fake news, she added.
Creating a graphic novel: The story of England's castles
Recently, the tiny Castle of Skotney was featured in a condensed version of the music film, and at one point became a refuge for Mrs. Margaret Thatcher during the seventies and eighties.
But after seeing 700 years of tumultuous history in its comfortable location in the Belle Valley, Kent, Skotney is now the inspiration for graphic novels written by Jamie Rhodes, a Yorkshireman with a particular penchant for historical documents and a mop head.
"I can see the handwriting of the ancients 300 years ago, and I find it really beautiful," he said wistfully.
"What kind of personal connection would it take for this letter to fall into my hands.
Across the Middle Ages and into the Edwardian era, "A Castle in England" chronicled the families living in Skotney, each story by different, future British artists such as Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer, and Isabel Greenberg.
This is not the first book Roz has made of archival material: he also wrote The Teeth and Other Tales of the Dead in 2014, a book inspired by British library literature, a work he completed with uncontrollable creative passion.
He said: "I could not contain my writing impulse from the moment I saw the thumbprint on the side of the letter, which was written by a double agent who worked for the Jacobites in the 18th century.
"That's his fingerprint!
And the letters have always smelled of smoke, because at that time, you need to light up to have light.
For us 300 years later, the smell feels like they're there for us, too.
Oh, I like archival literature
For those touched by the old paper, to be able to get the support of the National Trust and Arts Council of England and live in the castle for almost four months ("I've been a bit long, to be honest") seems too great to believe it to be true.
Roz spent days visiting "new" castles in Victoria, flipping through archives, studying the manor's many treasures and curios, such as the head of a hyena hanging on a wall, and bottles that had spent centuries in the moat.
He strolled through the land and ruins of the old castle, chatting with vagabonds, gardeners and, at times, illustrators for his books.
Then at night, he would "drink some whiskey and write."
Mr Skotney's secret history is not entirely clear, because the National Trust only entered fully after the death of its last heir, Elizabeth Hersey, in 2006.
Ten years later, when Rhodes arrived, the staff began to process the files, which he described as 'hundreds of years ago the nobles were leaving:'Oh, put it in the attic.'
Diary, letters from the days of the British Empire, maps of national boundaries: "You'd think land disputes would be boring," says Rhodes, "but there would be two families fighting for a birch tree.
Let go, guys
Some of the stories in the work take the castle as a starting point, leading to a broader study of British history, including The Labourer, which takes a cue from a man who left the newly built castle to take part in the peasant uprising of 1381.
"The story of the Knightly Families of Kentand Sussex chronicles a riot that took place in the castle in 1380," says Roz.
"The peasant uprising started in that area, and I think that's a good place to start it.
Perhaps there is a connection between the two?
Other stories are deeply rooted in the history of the castle, such as The Priest, which tells the story of the Darrells who hid a Jesuit priest for seven years during the British Reformation.
Or "The Smuggler," the story of an 18th-century smuggler named Arthur Darrell, who is believed to have given himself a funeral by filling his coffin with stones (only to be discovered years later when his casket was exposed).
The The Darrells is Roz's favourite family of Scottney Castle: "These gentlemen seem to be rogues, constantly borrowing money and paying for things they can't afford.
Generations of Darrell men have solved their debt problems by marrying rich old women, and I think they should be handsome lads who know how to go after women.
As his mission in the castle came to an end, Rhodes began looking for other bizarre writing experiences.
He spent two weeks in the wilds of Finland completing a graphic novel about "El? m? Port nm? ki," an early-20th-century nursing home that was slowly abandoned.
But Skotney has a special status for him.
"I'm sad to leave," he said.
"It's like:'Oh, I have to go face to face in real life.

Big energy companies are all "enemies of the rich," so who is the most profitable among the world's many energy companies?
Yesterday, the leading PFC energy company reported a top-50 ranking for listed energy companies in 2011, with US oil and gas producer ExxonMobil winning with a market capitalisation of $406.3 billion, followed by PetroChina and Royal Dutch Shell.
PetroChina topped the PFC list twice in 2007 and 2009, with ExxonMobil taking the top spot for the rest of the year.
In the top 50 list in 2011, three companies from mainland China were shortlisted, along with No. 2 China Petroleum, No. 9 China Petrochemical and No. 15 China National Offshore Oil.
However, despite the fact that oil prices are now much higher than they were four years ago, PFC energy company CEO points out that there are a number of factors contributing to the low total market value, including a decline in North American gas prices and low activity in global stock markets, according to PFC.

US changes green card rules
President Donald Trump is quoted in the media as saying the United States will roll out new immigration programs and change green card regulations.
The plan aims to reduce legal immigration to 50,000 a year, with tighter restrictions on temporary work visas and family-oriented visa applications.
The new rules were proposed by Republicans and endorsed by the president.
The draft law will be discussed in both houses.
The US media quoted Mr Trump as saying that "this law will reduce poverty, raise wages, save taxpayers $1 billion, and achieve the above benefits by changing the way the US issues green cards to citizens of other countries.
The law will replace current programs to reduce chain migration.
This new application process benefits applicants who speak English, have financial support and have skills conducive to economic development.

In order to optimize the environment of the scenic spot and build a beautiful Nan Yue, recently, the "636" Volunteer Service Brigade of the Nanyue District Tobacco Bureau (Branch) launched the "Mountaineering Forest, Home Care" environmental protection activities.
The activities not only received the support of all the cadres and staff of the District Tobacco Bureau, but also attracted retired cadres and their families to participate in the environmental protection practice. The three generations of the old and the young worked together, climbing the forest and cleaning up the garbage, so as to contribute their share to the construction of the "beautiful South Yue"
This volunteer activity aims to protect the landscape resources of Nanyue and promote the concept of "caring for others, caring for society and caring for nature". It also enables the next generation to accept and cultivate the virtues of volunteerism from an early age.
Since its establishment in early April this year, the "636" Volunteer Service Team has developed a total of 16 members. It has launched a series of volunteer activities such as visiting disabled retail customers, helping tobacco farmers to care for their tobacco leaves, and making donations in response to the Yaan earthquake.

Sex robots are indeed on the rise, but we should be cautious
Just when you don't think 2017 will be more spooky, a new technology development report has been released in the field of sex robots.
Yes.
Now sex robots are a big deal.
Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) released a report that looks ahead to the development of sex robots over the next five to 10 years.
According to Noel Sharkey, emeritus professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of FRR, we need to start taking the rise of sex robots seriously.
Customers can choose the robot's eye color, nipple shape and nail type.
"People laugh behind their backs, but companies do launch a lot of sex robots, and we'll see a lot more," Sharkey said at the time of the new report.
Modern sex dolls have evolved from inflatable dolls to robots that have silicone skin and feel warm, and have purposely used artificial intelligence to set up human-like sexual responses.
Users can also "customize" their robots to suit their preferences, with options ranging from eye colour, nipple shape to nail type or color.
But what's even more disturbing is that a lot of robots with "personalities" make "replicating a wife" look advanced.
Modern sex toys have evolved into robots with silicone skin.
For example, a RealBotix robot is able to customize itself based on characteristics that users find attractive, such as shyness.
There is also the Roxxxy Gold sex robot, developed by True Companion, which can predetermine personality traits, including the slightly shy "cold-colored Farrah" and the "adventurous" Wild Wendy.
"Roxxxy Gold has the personality to match you as much as possible," says the website of True Companion.
So she loves what you love and hates what you hate.
She had small emotions in those days as well as normal people!
She can be lazy, talkative, or 'sexually aggressive'
The rise of sex robots has brought a lot of unease - not just the replacement of real human relationships - but the grovelling femininity and the suggestion of rape twitching on the cold-coloured (read: resisting) Farrah is the most worrying.
True Companion compares Roxxxy to a man's vibrating stick on its website.
"If a woman has a vibrator, why can't a man have a Roxxxy?
Yet these sex robots are not a mere fetish or just a sex toy.
Their presence and growing maturity point directly to the darker, deeper parts of our culture: escaping from perfect gender equality to sex with submission as an additional option.
Of course most men don't keep sex robots, and while FRR points out that sex robots are growing in popularity, they are still on the brink of a consumer culture.
But what seeps through the edges allows us to see the course of our time.
A lot of people aren't weird or aggressive until the free market gives them a chance to be so.
It's no coincidence that these elaborate sex robots have emerged at a time when the rights of women around the globe are under threat, and that the White House has a president who brags about sexual violence against women.
The most chilling part of the TV drama "The Handmaid's Tale" is not the lifelike picture, nor the hanging corpse, nor the pair of eyes dug out, but the over-real imagination.
The republic of Gilead was a jump, but now it doesn't look far away.
The goal behind these sex robots is to be as technical as possible to create the body that most resembles a real woman (though in proportion to a porn star).
The creators of these robots want them to have a human sense of touch and to mimic real human movements.
But to put it bluntly, their "personalities" don't represent real women.
They can't break up and they can't leave.
They have no recourse to institutions and no follow-up stories, no independence at all, and nothing that might break the illusion of total slavery.
In other words, they are sex slaves.
Or in the popular phrase of 2017: maids.

Trump's great exploits?
Let Mitt Romney be the epitome of common sense
It is no surprise to the Trump era that political divisions have polarized American voters and, on a micro-level, destroyed the harmony of American families.
Around Christmas and Thanksgiving, the nation's major newspapers filled their opinion columns with the fear of how to deal with voting for Trump's relatives.
It is generally believed that we are doing our best to pierce our "filter bubble"
Less vocal is the power of Trump to bring his family together.
I mention this because my cousin, a left-wing poet who lives in Chicago and has a long feud with the Republicans in our family, is visiting me in New York this week.
She reminds me that uniting against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.
By working with Trump in the White House, all the people she knows, even relatives of Republicans who have been engaged in political wrangling for decades, are now suddenly and oddly on the same page.
It's certainly a good thing if it's all at the table, but what strikes me is that, from a broader perspective, it creates significant risks.
While left-wing figures have long been egged on by Trump, the warping effect of his presidency has pushed us all to the right.
When we talk about "normalisation" and Trump, we're referring to the possibility of concern that his eccentricity might one day stop.
There is, however, a more worrying long-term scenario in which Trump is "normalizing" relations with right-wing Republicans who previously opposed Mr. President's standards and now suddenly look like symbols of reason.
I find myself recently somewhat nostalgic for the Mitt Romney version: putting a dog on a car, a 14% income tax (but at least we know his tax returns), for the crime of these two moves does seem too minor in comparison to Trump.
After the Trump era, the next Republican nominee just needs to be intellectually qualified to make immeasurable improvements.
When my cousin lived in town, we took the kids to the Carousel in New York Park, the largest merry-go-round run by New York's Central Park Administration, and if you don't need coffee, the three dollar ticket is your most expensive in the city.
The sound of the Trojans was as loud as thunder, the central columns were designed for fiberglass, all the clowns and animals turned their heads and looked at their shoulders in horror and evil, while the clanging music sounded oddly.
Too many vulgar cities are disappointing: the landscape overlooking high-rise towers becomes cliched, the skyline becomes too familiar to provide much excitement, and the reality of the city doesn't hold up dreams.
Thirty-five years later, I haven't quite forgotten the day when I discovered that this "Swiss cabin" was not actually a Swiss cabin, but rather an "old Swiss cabin" ( Ye Olde Swiss Cottage ) in the theme bar, which I can't remember, but near a junction in north London.
However, the Central Park merry-go-round remains a magical experience, with everyone having fun for two 2-year-olds, an 11-year-old, and four events that two girls in their forties can attend.
If I could rate the carousel, I would give it full marks, but thankfully no one asked.
But this week at a department store, before swiping my credit card, I was asked to rate my trading "experience" by one to five stars.
The same is true at the coffee shop on the corner of my street, in addition to the option of scoring with a 15% tip, which is for shopping on the counter.
The effect is not only to slow down what is supposed to be a neutral deal, but to put pressure on waiters to add personal factors to unwanted scenarios.
The poor woman in the department store smiled apologetically while I was exhausted and the credit card trading experience rated her five stars.
Oscar Pistolis transferred from prison to hospital with chest pain
This is the second time Pistolis has left prison to be transferred to hospital.
He was taken to hospital last year to be treated for a cut to his wrist, which prison officials say was the result of a fall in his cell.
Pistorius was convicted of murder after prosecutors appealed the original wrongful-killing ruling.
In the early hours of Valentine's Day 2013, he shot Stinkamp multiple times through the toilet cubicle door at his home in Pretoria until his death.
Pistolis claims to have mistaken his girlfriend for an intruder who hid in a cubicle at night.
Prosecutors have announced their intention to appeal again, this time for a six-year sentence against Pistolis, which they believe is too lenient.
The National Prosecuting Authority said it would appeal to the South African Supreme Court and that the appeal could be heard this year.
If prosecutors win, Pistolis faces an increase to 15 years in prison.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.

On May 18, the Ministry of Finance announced the "Measures for the Administration of Funds for Special Awards for the Restructuring of Industrial Enterprises", which will arrange special prize funds to promote the elimination of excess capacity in the coal and steel industries, for a total amount of 100 billion yuan.
Recently Shanghai, Shanxi, Shandong, Jiangsu, Heilongjiang and other local governments have put forward a number of reform proposals on the elimination of excess capacity.
Among them, many provinces even proposed to actively seek the central government's financial support for their provinces to de-productive capacity.
One piece of evidence is that the coal-to-capacity target, announced in just eight provinces, stands at 90% of the national plan to cut coal production.
In an interview with reporters, Lin Boqiang, director of the China Energy Policy Research Institute at Xiamen University, argued that the steel and coal industries' "de-production capacity" of 100 billion yuan from the central government alone is not enough, and that more capital needs to be provided by local governments and enterprises themselves. How to solve this problem?
Shanxi Province recently announced the implementation rules for coal production capacity proposed to transform the Shanxi coking coal group into a state-owned capital investment company, reorganization and integration of the assets and business of the enterprise, the construction of a new business model.
The actual shortfall in funding could be three times higher than the subsidy, after the minister of human resources and social security, Yin Weimin, said the preliminary tally of "de-production capacity" to be rehoused in the employee coal system was 1.3 million people, and the steel system was 500,000 people.

Does thin meat, dairy products and chocolate help to relieve inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)?
Skinny meat and chocolate may sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.
But a new study shows the opposite: a diet rich in meat protein and dairy products can help ease the symptoms associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).
The disease affects the lives of about 1.3 million Americans and about 300,000 Britons, causing stomach cramps and bloating, recurrent or bleeding diarrhea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
Researchers at the University of Washington typically advise patients to avoid eating meat and dairy products to relieve symptoms, but the researchers found that the protein's key amino acid-tryptophan helps boost the growth of immune cells, which boost the tolerance of the gut.
Lead researcher Dr Marco Colonna explains that immune cells patrol the gut to ensure that harmful microbes hidden in food do not creep into the body.
A balance is maintained between the cells that cause inflammation and those that promote tolerance, protecting the body without damaging various sensitive and vulnerable tissues.
Inflammatory bowel disease can occur when the equilibrium is too biased towards inflammation.
A cell promoting immunity was found in mice carrying special bacteria in the experiment.
The bacteria need tryptophan, one of the components of the protein, to form the appearance of the cell.
Professor Colonna said: "We have established a link between a bacterial population (Roe's Lactobacillus, which is a normal part of the gut microbiome) and the development of a population of cells that can promote tolerance.
The more tryptophan the mice ingested in their diet, the more immune cells they had.
He suggested that if humans used the same approach, a combination of lactic acid bacteria and a diet rich in tryptophan might form a more tolerant, less inflammatory gut environment.
Luisa Cervantes-Barraganwas, a postdoctoral researcher, studied immune cells that increase tolerance when she found that one group of mice had such cells, but another group of the same strains were not raised separately.
She suspects the difference is linked to the gut microbiome of mice, which refers to bacteria, viruses and fungi that normally live in the gastrointestinal tract.
The DNA sequencing of cholesterol in mice showed six bacterial populations in mice with immune cells, but none in mice without immune cells.
The mice were raised in a sterile environment, so they lacked gut microbes and could not develop the immune cells, which were produced by the presence of the bacteria.
In order to understand how bacteria affect the immune system, the researchers cultured Lactobacillus lucidum in the liquid and then transferred a small amount of the bacteria-free liquid into immature immune cells isolated from mice.
The immune cell develops into a tolerant cell.
When the active ingredient is purified from the liquid, it can be shown to be a by-product of tryptophan metabolism, known as indole-3-lactic acid.
When the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the mice's feed, the number of such cells increased by about 50%, but when tryptophan levels were halved, the number of cells was cut in half.
Dr Cervantes-Barragan explains that people, like mice, have the same tolerance-enhancing cells, and most of us have Lactobacillus bacteria in our gastrointestinal tract.
It is not known whether humans, like mice in the experiment, can induce the development of cells with tryptophan by-products from Lactobacillus lucidum in the body, but a gene defect linked to tryptophan has been found in patients with inflammatory bowel disease.
She said: "The development of these cells may be exactly what we want to get because these cells can control the inflammatory response on the inside surface of the gut.
It can be inaccurately said that the presence of high levels of tryptophan in Lactobacillus lucidum may lead to an increase in the number of that strain.
Jose Mourinho believes Manchester United signed 'genius' Nemanja Matic
After Nemanja Matic made his debut against Sampdoria on Wednesday night, Mourinho determined that United had signed a "talented" midfielder.
Matic, who is from Chelsea and signed for a fee of up to 40 million pounds, won the favour of Paul Bogba and Andreas Pereira when he opened 2-1 in his last pre-season game before the European Super Cup against Real Madrid in Dublin on Tuesday.
However, Matic was seriously out of form during the pre-season tour of Asia at Bruce, completing only 45 minutes, and Mourinho admitted that improvements were needed before the start of the Premier League season.
"He needs time, but he has the experience, the wisdom and the genius to think - he thinks about football," Mourinho said.
"We will help him prepare as soon as possible.
Mourinho started his starting line-up at the start of the season and, like Matic, new signings Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku started the game at the Aviva Stadium.
The Independent reported this week that Mourinho still wants to bring in three more signings but insists the club are "doing a good job" and he has four first-choice signings in mind, three of which have been brought in by the club.
"I am very grateful to the club for bringing in three of the signings," he added.
"I would be happier if the club could bring in all four players, but they have done a lot for me."
Will China lag behind if it does not build this type of warship?
With the recent announcement of plans to build new frigates by the world's major naval powers, it seems that the frigate has become the focus of the naval forces of the major powers overnight, starting with Japan's decision to purchase two new frigates in its 2018 annual defense budget, which has led to a substantial breakthrough in Japan's DEX frigate program, later, Lockheed Martin of the United States recently announced the latest plan for the U.S. FFG frigate program, so where should China's new frigate go?
With the launch of a state-of-the-art 054A frigate at the end of 2017, marking the construction of as many as 29 054A frigates, the total number of 053H frigates is approaching, and 054A has been under construction for 12 years since the first 054A was launched in 2006, even with such a large number of high-performance general-purpose frigates around the world, apart from China, only the "Perry" class frigates built by the United States in the 1970s and 1980s are comparable.
And the reason why so many 054A have been built is simply that they are affordable, easy to use, and add to years of naval debt.
The 054A frigate, which has been favored by the Chinese Navy for years because of its high cost-effectiveness and good combat power, has a displacement of around 4,000 tons, carrying a 76-mm main gun, a 32-unit sea-red flag-16 and a fish-8 anti-submarine missile combined-launched droop system, eight Hawk Strike 83 and a straight-9 helicopter, although it was built in 2006 and was designed to be a very early type of ship, its combat power is not so bad even today, and it is possible to see the world's frigates at a medium-to-high level.
But this is, after all, a ship designed in the early 21st century, with a weapons configuration on one side, a power system and electronic radar equipment that is already far from the world's mainstream frigates, such as the one in Europe already equipped with all-electric propulsion, a small multi-role phased array radar, a large-scale helicopter deck, and a new model.
So how China's new frigate should develop is directly related to its future positioning and the strategic direction of our Chinese navy.
The future development of China's navy is bound to be a blue-water navy, and the future is bound to be a sea, with rapid deployment in areas of vital interest to China, a show of force and, if necessary, a strong fighting force to ensure that China's vital interests in the region are not undermined.
Looking at the positioning of new frigates in future Chinese naval sequences, the future Chinese navy should be similar to that of the US Navy, with the exception of the necessary offshore defense ships, which will form carrier battle groups or amphibious assault ship strike groups, as the case may require.
The role of a new type of frigate in the future carrier battle group should serve as the anti-submarine main force and the mid- and near-air position, in the Amphibious assault ship strike group should act as the frigate class, then according to this demand the new type of frigate must have a strong anti-potential and a good mid-range regional air-lift capability.
Based on the above-mentioned positioning, it is possible to boldly imagine the future of domestic frigates.
First, there will be a significant increase in displacement relative to the current 054A frigate, which is estimated to be around 5000-6000 tons; The power system will be powered by an integrated electric propulsion system consisting of a QC280 modified gas turbine and two diesel engines, with a maximum speed expected to reach about 30 knots and a significant increase in power; As for the weapon configuration 76mm main gun and 1,130 near anti-aircraft gun should be retained, but a red flag 10 launch system will be added, the main gun should be followed by a 32-48 unit red flag 16 modified and a fish-8 co-mounted pendulum system, and in the rear of the hull should be fitted with an 8-16 unit large droop system for launching the Hawk 18 and new cruise missiles; The hangar and parking platform will also grow, reaching the parking and storage of two 10-ton helicopters; As far as electronic radar systems are concerned, a high match should be equipped with a small four-sided fixed phased array radar based on the 346A development, and a low match could use a multi-function rotating phased array radar similar to the one on a European frigate.
This would bring the overall level of the new frigate to its current world-class level, even compared to the US FFG.
Of course, the above-mentioned concept is only the author of a new type of domestic frigate speculation, concrete how we can only wait until the new type of frigate into the water, let us look forward to it.

In recent years, the city has encouraged enterprises to take an active part in the construction of national, industry and regional group standards. It has awarded 300,000 yuan to enterprises that are mainly or participate in the formulation of standards for Zhejiang manufacturing groups, and 500,000 yuan to enterprises that have passed the certification of Zhejiang manufacturing brands. This is the highest amount of such awards in the province and has inspired the enthusiasm of enterprises to participate in the bid.
Recently, Wang Li Group production workshop, the head of the group system, Gao Jian, together with employees, is packing a anti-theft security door sealing box as part of the Zhejiang manufacturing group standard on standard work samples, ready to be sent to the Shaoxing quality testing center.
Just two days ago, Wang Li had passed the on-site audit of the Zhejiang Manufacturing Certification Expert Group.
Gao said the professional team, made up of industry technical experts and quality certification organizations, praised the group's performance in core areas such as quality excellence and independent innovation, agreeing that it was fully compliant and that Wang would be one of the first to pass the standard as soon as the product passed the test.
Wang Li Group is just the epitome of the standard-pry industrial transformation upgrade.
Our city and its to carry out the Zhejiang manufacturing group standard and meet the standards of the work is also step Yang, group Ascension Group.
Since the Zhejiang manufacturing team standard set by our city's anti-theft security door industry last year, Star Moon, Xindo and other enterprises are also actively applying for docking work.

Is China's household debt rate closer to that of the US than it is to the point of not being able to afford a house?
In the recent past, there has been a lot of discussion about how real estate policy has changed recently. Is real estate policy going to be loosened again? Will the diversification of land policy providers lead to a fall in housing prices?
But at a time when we are worried about property prices, about macroeconomic regulation, about the future direction of the housing market, the People's Daily is writing again, and last time we were talking specifically about the tone of the People's Daily review on real estate regulation, and now the People's Daily article is talking about a more serious problem than not being able to afford to buy a house, even if you can afford to buy a house
Today, we are talking about a more serious problem than buying a house: paying off a loan.
I. China's Growing Housing Debt Crisis
The overseas edition of the People's Daily published an opinion piece, "Prizes and Loans: The Joys and Sorrow of Struggling Youth," on January 17, in November 2017, the National Financial and Development Laboratory of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences and the National Balance Sheet Research Center released the "Third Quarter China Leverage Process Report," according to the data in the paper, the residential sector's leverage ratio continued its upward trend, rising by 1.3 percentage points from 47.4% in the second quarter of 2017 to 48.6% in the third quarter, and by 3.8 percentage points in the first three quarters of 2017.
The resident sector accounts for a larger share of debt in the overall real economy, and the leverage ratio is rising faster.
Research shows that Chinese households' liabilities in financial institutions are dominated by consumer loans, which account for about two-thirds of residents' liabilities, or about twice as much as those of operating loans.
Among them, medium- and long-term loans dominated by housing loans accounted for about 80%, but in incremental terms, short-term consumer loans grew faster than medium- and long-term loans.
In addition, China's household debt ratio only counts the total amount of credit that the household sector receives from financial institutions, while Chinese households have many private loans, including borrowing from relatives and friends, with large hidden debts.
It is a bit of a surprise to see that, according to statistics from the Suning Institute of Finance, China's resident leverage ratio was only 3% in 1996 and 18% in 2008, but it has begun to grow rapidly since 2008, doubling to 36.4% in just six years. By the third quarter of 2017, the resident leverage ratio was as high as 48.6%.
In May last year, HSBC released a survey of nearly 10,000 people across nine countries.
The report is aimed at "millennial" young people in nine countries (born between 1980 and 2000).
The report notes that China has a 70% home ownership rate among young people after 80 or 90, far ahead of second-place Mexico (46%) and twice the level of the US indicator (35%).
One of the most likely problems with these figures is that Chinese residents' biggest potential "grey rhino" at this stage is expected to be insolvent compared to their inability to afford a home.
II. Why is the housing crisis the most serious problem?
As we have analysed before, although we have been saying that Chinese house prices are high, the rate of home ownership in China is actually quite high compared to other countries in the world, so instead of saying that house prices are too high to buy, I'm afraid you have to ask a lot of friends now whether you can afford a loan?
We look at the real estate market all over the world. China's real estate market, because of its late start, has not experienced a major real estate crisis other than the one we mentioned earlier in Hainan, but only a decade ago the origin of the 2008 worldwide financial tsunami was the real estate crisis in the United States.
And the cause of the U.S. housing crisis has been blamed on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
At the time, in the golden age of the United States, real estate companies sold their homes to low-income people in the United States with extremely low down-payments in order to expand sales, and the housing market was booming at a time when the U.S. economy was doing well, but not for long, as the U.S. economy stagnated, causing a decline in home buyers' incomes and a decline in household spending.
But, at the time, the status quo in the United States was a component of American household assets - financial assets and real estate assets - and almost all of the household assets of low-income groups in the United States were real estate, while most of the assets of the top 20% of high-income groups were financial assets, resulting in higher debt ratios for the poorer households in the United States.
A serious fact is that these people all bought their homes when the economy was better, so the money to pay their mortgages was also calculated in terms of their better incomes, and when incomes fell, the pressure on mortgages not only did not decrease, but even increased as some subprime programs became floating, so that the real-estate problems of these American households grew into a real-estate crisis.
So someone who can't afford a mortgage because their income is too low, the banks begin to take back the property, and when the banks take it back from buyers who are delinquent, they sell it at a very low price, leading to a further decline in house prices in the region, a process that triggers a further slide in house prices and creates a vicious circle, as house prices fall to a certain extent, more and more homebuyers find that their home is worth even less than their own loans, and more people stop paying their mortgages and create more bad debts.
Thus, a huge vicious circle is formed
"The economy is down - incomes are down - some people can't afford a mortgage - banks are selling the homes of the people they owe at low prices - house prices are down - more people are stopping paying their mortgages - banks are selling - house prices are down again
And the problem is more than that, because house prices keep falling, and you're not out of debt after people stop repaying the house to the bank, and if the money you get from the auction doesn't cover the loan you owe to the bank, then you still need to pay it back, to put it simply, let's say you used a down payment of $600,000, a loan of $2.4 million to buy a home that was worth $3 million at the time, and when the house price fell to just $2 million, you stopped paying the house to the bank, and after the bank auctioned the house, you lost not only your down payment of $600,000, but also your debt to the bank of $400,000, and you still have to pay it back.
Thus, in one vicious cycle after another, the US economy gradually collapsed, eventually triggering the US financial crisis of 2008.
So it is a matter of great alarm that China's household debt ratio has reached a high of 48.8% at this stage, a figure that is still below the level of the developed world for the time being, but the problems are beginning to emerge, and it is a very prescient judgment that the state has repeatedly emphasized the issue of de-leveraging since last year, household debt ratios, if allowed to continue to rise, are bound to cause huge risks, so be wary of financial risks.
So after the house is used to live, not to stir-fry the location, the state is faster to establish multi-agent supply, multi-channel security, buy-to-let and other multiple measures to further address the potential risks.
For our individual families, it is important to abandon the speculative thinking of real estate, to walk the walk when buying a home, to avoid their own families falling into a huge burden, and only a reasonable assessment of their income and debt levels is a healthy path to household wealth development.

British inventors implanted chips into their bodies and waved them into their cars
A British inventor who installed a chip for himself could open his front door, enter his office and even start his car with a wave of his hand, becoming the first person in the country.
Steven Northam, 33, implanted a tiny chip between his thumb and forefinger, and is now offering the service to companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives, implemented by his company BioTeq through technology.
He has joined forces with Dr Jeff Watson, a senior consultant anaesthetist at the Royal Hampshire Hospital in Winchester, Hampshire, to ensure the implantation process meets medical standards.
The technique is similar to cat and dog chip implants and takes just 30 seconds.
Mr Northam's company will also replace locks on rooms and vehicles to be compatible with the chip, costing £ 300 per lock.
The married father-of-one has now installed the technology for both his home and his BMW Z4, which he can start by simply putting his hand on the wheel.

White House props cost thousands
Last month, the White House decided to ship a Marine Corps helicopter to the South Lawn to highlight the great glory of American manufacturing, at a cost of up to $24,000, according to military records released by Time magazine.
The green- and-white Sikorsky VH-3D (also known as Marine One when the president rides) is an important exhibit at the White House's July 17 event highlighting U.S. construction projects.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and top White House officials toured manufacturing products from all 50 states.
Exhibits include a UConn-made helicopter, a Maine Yacht, a Wisconsin fire truck and a Mississippi forklift.
According to the records of the HMX-1, the unit responsible for operating the helicopter, the White House military office required the helicopter to appear as per its daily order (FRAGO), that is, only 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn for the "special" event.
The day before the event, Commander HMX-1, in an email to his superior Marine Corps deputy flight commander, said, "I just want to make sure you know, because this event is highly valued."
The information suggests the helicopter will arrive on the South Lawn at about 7 a.m. on July 17 for a 3 p.m. event, leaving only after the lawn empties between 6 p.m. and 9 p.m. that same day.
The message also said that in the event of a delay in departure from the White House, the return flight would require a second crew because of time constraints on duty.
The original crew were on standby at the side of the helicopter during the event, while members of the security forces were on standby nearby while the aircraft was on the ground.
Records obtained by Time did not clearly indicate whether a second crew was ultimately needed.
The Hutch Act prohibits federal employees from using government property for political purposes.
The records state that HMX-1 had asked whether the event violated the act.
The commander wrote that "one of the questions we asked was whether this was a violation of the Hutch Act and was told there was no violation."
"It sounds like you're locked," the deputy commander replied.
The White House defined the "Made in America" event as an official event and therefore not subject to the Hutch Act.
But even official events have political overtones.
At the event, the president pushed through what was then a Senate issue: health care reform, and touted control of government regulations.
The use of Marine One or Air Force One aircraft for political propaganda purposes is nothing new.
Successive presidents have been required to travel on these planes.
But it is not common to expropriate them solely for photo-taking purposes.
Trump came under scrutiny in February, when it was in Melbourne, Florida, when the presidential jet slowly taxied and ended up in the background of his first campaign rally, and his Twitter account was awash with complaints about the former president's use of the presidential jet.
"The White House is excited by the 'Made in America' exhibition, which showcases products from all 50 states made by American workers using American materials," White House deputy press spokesman Lindsey Walters said.
The HMX-1 crew regularly conducts flight training near the Washington area and on the South Lawn, practicing to place the U.S. president accurately in the White House.
The HMX-1 practiced 58 landings at the White House during Trump's G-20 summit in Germany in early July.
The U.S. manufacturing activity flight was included in this month's crew training requirements, an official said.
Helicopter units also flew an extra 11 hours of "non-presidential support missions" that day.
The White House said the taxpayer did not bear the cost of any other props at the event.
A Sikorsky spokesman said the company was not involved in arranging the South Lawn helicopter display.
HMX-1 does not keep a budget record of presidential flights, so it is very difficult to determine the exact cost of the event.
But according to the Defense Department's hourly expense records for the 2017 fiscal year, the VH-3D Department of Defense is reimbursed at $24,380 per flight hour.
Troops recorded a 30-minute flight time per flight from the base at Marine Corps Airport in Quantico, Virginia.
The White House said the cost of operating the helicopter was far less than the cost.
Walters said it was "very misleading to estimate the cost to the taxpayer based on reimbursable expenses."
These estimated costs include personnel costs, maintenance costs and many other sunk costs included in the annual appropriation.
A 2015 RAND study showed that Ministry of Defence reimbursable expenses did not include personnel costs, but did include oil, maintenance and contractual costs.
At the time, former White House press spokesman Sean Spike defended the use of the helicopter for the event
"The idea is to show what is made in America this week," he said
And I know that both Sikorsky and Connecticut are proud to have contributed to our national security, and I guess there are hundreds, if not thousands, of people whose jobs depend on it.
And I feel that like most Americans, we are proud of this helicopter and other military equipment, the result of the hard work of countless Americans.
So it is certainly not out of place to show this.
We don't know if Trump interacted with the helicopter when he toured the South Lawn at the event, but he did get in the driver's seat of the fire truck.
Inside the White House, Trump addressed Sikorsky representatives, joking with the media about the company plane he owns.
"I know Sikorsky very well," he said. "I have three.

It is reported that the city of Chongqing currently has 18 shale gas prospecting rights set up by the Ministry of Land and Resources and the first shale gas mining rights in the country - China Petrochemical Fuling Shale Gas Field.
As of January 2017, a total of 368 shale gas wells (excluding parameter wells) had been drilled and 261 were in operation in Chongqing. Recently, good news has come from the production of more than 200,000 cubic meters per day for each of the four shale gas exploratory wells in the southern area of Pingqiao, in China's petrochemical Nanchuan region, China's Sinopec Fuling shale gas field, the world's first commercially exploited large shale gas field outside North America, is on track to build 10 billion cubic metres of capacity this year, as planned.
It is understood that the 10 billion cubic metres of shale gas field is the equivalent of a 10 million-ton large oil field.
It is understood that shale gas, as a clean energy source, could reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 12 million tonnes per year after the 10 billion-square-shale gas field is built.

Drug Lord season 3 trailer: With the departure of Pablo Escobar, the Cali Group takes to the stage at the centre of the Netflix hit drama
The Netflix hit is far from over, despite the second season of "The Drug Lord" revealing the killer of Pablo Escobar.
The streaming service has confirmed seasons three and four, and season three has received its first trailer for a tease about the show's upcoming villains.
In the third season, DEA turns its attention to the world's richest drug trafficking organization: the Cali Group.

From 2005 to 2011, GDP rose from the middle to the bottom of the table, according to Market Star.
However, the economic growth of our province still suffers from low investment efficiency and lack of core competitiveness of the industrial economy. Therefore, the latest issue of the Economic Blue Page of the provincial economic information center recommends improving the quality and efficiency of economic growth.
Based on some representative indicators of our provincial economy in 2005 and 2011, we compare them with the whole country and the central region.
In terms of industrial economic benefits, in 2011, a significant proportion of industrial energy, raw materials and other high-energy-consuming industries in our province were affected by market fluctuations and the "double pressure" of overcapacity. At the same time, the lack of innovation in leading industries such as home appliances and automobiles led to low profits.
And a large amount of investment has not brought about corresponding economic benefits, which is an important reason for the low quality and efficiency of economic growth in our province.
In this regard, experts recommend that effective measures should be taken to encourage enterprises to innovate, and that the scientific and technological achievements of universities and research institutes should be "transferred" to enterprises in a timely manner.
To the industrial economy benefit is not high, experts say, also want to actively promote the industrial merger reorganization, optimize the industrial layout, extend the industrial chain.

GMB is concerned about investment in McVitie's Glasgow plant
The union wants the management of McVitie, the biscuit maker, to guarantee a long-term commitment to production at the factory in Lasgow.
The Scottish branch of GMB said it had been silent about the future of investment in the Tollcross plant.
The factory has more than 500 employees and produces products such as Hobnobs and Rich tea.
Pladis, owner of McVitie, said it had invested more than ￡5m in the plant over the past few years.
He added that staff and union representatives "will be the first to know" if there is a change in plant operations.
In a letter to the company's director, the Scottish branch of the GMB called on McVitie to "resolve the problem of the outstanding transfer of funds to the modernization of the production line."
"Our members are deeply concerned that we do not have a clear picture of Tollcross's future business needs and investment plans from the general manager of the plant," said Drew Duffy, a senior sponsor of GMB.
Generations of families working here, and the high concentration of labour in local communities and the greater Glasgow area, are important pillars of decent employment in areas with high levels of unemployment and social deprivation.
So, in terms of jobs, pay and economic prosperity, in the context of Brexit, rising costs of living and a prolonged decline in manufacturing, there is an urgent need in the eastern part of Glasgow for Mavita to expand its production network.
"The director of Tollcross has just received a letter from the Scottish branch of the GMB yesterday and will respond immediately as we value ongoing contact with employees and union representatives," a spokesman for the company said.
Two months ago, we held a regular meeting in Tollcross with staff and GMB representatives to discuss some issues openly.
We had discussions with staff and then, like all other companies operating in a competitive and economically uncertain environment, we reviewed the ongoing operating model we applied to businesses and factories in order to remain competitive.
She added: "In recent years we have invested more than 5 million pounds in the Tollcross plant, particularly in production lines and operational improvements.
We are fully aware of Tollcross's historic position as a production base, and staff and union representatives will be the first to know if there is any change in our operations at the plant.
Tibet, May 11 (Xinhua) -- In the future, the removal of household waste on the northern slopes of Mount Qomolangma will move from past public welfare actions to normalized behavior led by the Chinese government with the participation of the international community, the deputy director of the Tibet Autonomous Region Sports Bureau, Nima Tsering, said at the base camp on the northern slope of Mount Qomolangma on Friday.
Environmental volunteers load classified waste into trucks on May 10.
Over the past decade or so, with the rapid increase in the number of mountaineers and tourists on Mount Qomolangma, the issue of environmental protection in the area where the mountain is located has become increasingly prominent.
In the spring of 1997, the Mountaineering Association of the Tibet Autonomous Region launched its first clean-up campaign on the northern slopes of Mount Qomolangma, cleaning up a collection of household waste such as oxygen cylinders left over from the 1960s and 1970s. The video was also featured at the World Climate Conference in Tokyo that year and attracted world attention.
After 1997, public welfare teams swept the northern slopes of Mount Qomolangma, but the participants were mostly non-professionals, Nima said.
Paris Saint-Germain warned Barcelona three years ago to sign Neymar?
La Liga may regret throwing an olive branch at Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain will not give up signing for Neymar after making a 189 million-pound offer to try to get it to exercise the exemption clause, but did they warn Barcelona three years ago to launch an attack on the world-record raider?
The sensational approach has opened the summer transfer window as the Ligue 1 club prepare to break the world transfer record for more than double the previous transfer record, with Paul Bogba returning to Manchester United for up to 89 million pounds last season.
Once the transfer is complete, Neymar will leap to become the world's most expensive player and the world's highest-paid professional athlete - with Paris Saint-Germain offering an after-tax salary of more than 500,000 pounds a week.
Barcelona are angry about Neymar's approach to the attack and the way out, and sources with knowledge of the Catalan board insist the club have been doing everything they can to look after him since his arrival from Santos in 2013.
But did Paris Saint-Germain's president make such a prediction about the football world three years ago?
When City expressed interest in signing Bryce Mattei in 2014, Nasser Alkhlefi issued a stern warning to any club that wanted to sign Paris Saint-Germain's best player.
"I'm not worried because they know that if they touch any of our players, we're going to go toe-to-toe with them and we're going to contact their players," Alkhlefi said.
"We respect all clubs.
But if they're trying to sign our players, they're going to have to take it upon themselves.
The Spanish club appeared to have crossed the line earlier this summer when Barcelona threw an olive branch at Paris Saint-Germain midfielder Marco Verratti.
Paris Saint-Germain have made it clear that they will not allow the Italy international to leave anyway and that Barcelona are likely to suffer from the loss of Neymar, the midfielder.

London, January 9 (Xinhua) -- The British Sports Council (BSC) on Monday announced its goal of winning at least five medals for the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea, the "grandest" goal in the history of the British delegation to the Winter Olympics.
The British Sports Council is responsible for the allocation of funds for the various Olympic events and, of course, for the awarding of medal-winning targets for each of them.
Britain's athletes are reckoned to have hopes of hitting medals in events such as single-board skiing, curling, steel-framed snowmobiles and short-track speed skating.
In the past Winter Olympics cycle, the British Sport Council has allocated a total of 32 million pounds (about 280 million yuan) to training for the Winter Olympics programme, doubling the Winter Olympics cycle in Sochi.
Much of that money comes from the national lottery, with the rest coming from the state treasury.
Britain's gold hopes rest largely on two men, Alice Christie, the three gold winner of last year's world short track speed skating championship, and Liz Yarnold, the last women's steel frame snowmobile champion.
At the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, the British team achieved a record of 1 gold, 1 silver and 2 bronze, their best record since the first Winter Olympics in 1924.
