Civil rights groups issue travel warning for Missouri
As a result of discriminatory policies and racist attacks in Missouri, the American Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) issued a travel warning to people of color preparing to travel to Missouri.
"The NAACP Missouri Travel Advisory, which came into force on August 28, 2017, calls for all African-American travelers, tourists and Missouri to be especially careful and extremely cautious when travelling in Missouri due to a series of suspected racial incidents we inform you of this attitude," the group's statement declared.
The NAACP noted that a recently passed Missouri law made it harder for people to win discrimination lawsuits and that state law enforcement was also partly targeted at minorities, phenomena that prompted the organization to issue travel warnings.
Violations of civil rights are happening to people.
They were stopped for questioning, beaten or killed because of their skin color, "Rod Chapel, president of the NAACP in Missouri, told the Kansas City Star.
"We have received many complaints in unprecedented numbers."
It was the first such warning issued by the group in the United States against a state.
The group cited the University of Missouri's racial slur against black students and the death of 28-year-old Tennessee black male Tory Sanders.
Sanders, who died in suspicious circumstances earlier this year, ran out of fuel while traveling in Missouri and was detained by Missouri police without charge of a crime.
The consultation also noted that a recent report by the Missouri Attorney General's Office showed that "black drivers in the state are 75 percent more likely to be checked by parking compared to white people."
"The consultation was designed to raise awareness and warn their families, friends and colleagues about what might happen in Missouri," Chapel said.
"People need to be prepared, whether to travel to Missouri on bail or to let relatives know they are traveling within the state."
Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest data from the FBI's hate crime reporting program; the state ranked 16th in the country based on the number of crimes.
The travel warning is also a response to a new Missouri law that would make it harder to prosecute housing or employment discrimination businesses.
Earlier, U.S. states passed immigration enforcement laws requiring local law enforcement to detain immigration violators, a move the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) said would increase the number of racial lawsuits and issued travel advisories against Texas and Arizona.
Travel warnings are usually issued by the U.S. government against other countries, but recently, advisory groups have taken this approach to address certain laws and trends within the United States.
After the "golden age" of box office spikes in 2015, the overall film market in 2016 entered a period of calm, and whether it could break through last year's total box office record of 44.69 billion yuan became a suspense.
According to figures released by the Office for National Statistics, the price of new and second-hand homes in Beijing cooled in both directions in October, with the ring up just 0.6 per cent and 1.1 per cent.

The BBC calls Beijing the most exciting city: Making foreigners feel like "living in a new era"
Beijing may have a long history of three thousand years, but it is also rapidly becoming a modern city of charm today, according to the British media.
The Chinese capital, with its surprisingly high-speed Internet, sophisticated technology such as face-recognition software, has invested heavily in artificial intelligence and has unrivaled international energy, and is one of the most exciting cities for exploration-minded foreigners.
"If I can succeed there, I can succeed anywhere," said Clemens Seshi, a German expat who quoted the lyrics of singer Frank Sinatra's tribute to New York City.
"If Sinatra lived to this day, he would probably sing about a city like Beijing," said Seshi, who works as creative director at Traveller Archives. "Living in this city will make you feel like living in a new age always keep up with the trends.
Simon Norton, who is based in England but recently lives in Beijing, wrote on personal blog site 4Corners7Seas: "People generally have a sense of being at the centre of something grand, which is hard to say. It keeps many foreigners there for a long time. They want to see what it will become and want to witness it.
"The city's high-quality high-speed internet and technology-friendly environment make daily life easier than ever before," the report said.
"Beijing is rapidly transforming into a cashless society, with the Internet integrating the functions of traditional wallets into smartphones for everyone," said Andy Penha Fult, from Manila and now a co-editor at the Beijing Children website many transactions can be done more easily.
But smartphones are just the beginning of Beijing's technological ambitions, facial recognition software has become popular, and many mobile phone applications use the technology to make bank transfers and payments, get people into apartments and offices, and even use it to verify car drivers identities.
Beijing also recently announced plans to spend 13.8 billion yuan to build an artificial intelligence technology park where more than 400 businesses will end up, focusing on developing artificial intelligence technologies ranging from biometrics to self-driving cars.
Food is also at the heart of many major festivals in China, and participation in these celebrations is highly regarded by foreigners. The Spring Festival is the most important social and economic festival and one of the most accessible to foreigners.
"I suggest that it is equally important to help Chinese friends prepare for the New Year, to clean their apartments and to post a red Spring Festival with a New Year's Eve message on their homes. On New Year's Eve, all family members gather for foreigners, spending the night with friends and family is really an opportunity to blend in, having a big meal and then staying up until midnight to greet the New Year with spectacular fireworks."
"The number of foreigners in Beijing is large and growing, but the language barriers in China and the ease of communication between expatriates can easily be an excuse for their incomplete integration into local culture," the report said.
"Some foreigners have been living in China for years, but have little experience of their host country. If your initial attempts to reach Chinese people are not successful, it's easy to feel more comfortable with other foreigners," he said.
In these so-called "old-fashioned bubbles," the term "foreign bubbles" refers to foreigners mixing only among foreigners, without contact with locals and local cultures - translators note that foreigners hold groups in their own communities, in the West restaurants eat, and only foreigners are friends.
The easiest way to overcome this is to learn a bit of Mandarin - which is simpler than one might think.
"Taking one or two hours a week of private Chinese lessons or learning entry-level radio plays should suit everyone's busy schedule," Mr. Sisi said.
Even learning a few classic short sentences can help with shopping, ordering meals at a restaurant or chatting in a taxi.
"Stubborn air pollution is also a fact of everyday life," the report said, though government efforts in recent years have curbed some problems.
Residents stressed the importance of going outdoors in warmer months, where pollution is often light, to use those blue sky days as an opportunity to roam in historic hutongs or explore the popular Titan Park.
"Beijing is the Chinese city where the most things can be found below the surface, and you can find very good art and music activities, artful nightlife, historical wonders, ultra-modern commercial areas and ancient hutong areas," said Norton.
The report argues that the role of ageing as an impediment to human capital growth is increasingly evident, especially in the north-east, where the average annual contribution of ageing to human capital growth is -1.28 per cent.
Pan noted that the current risk of cross-border capital flows is manageable and that the fundamental factors underpinning the balance of payments are still long-standing.

The European Commission in April accused Google of forcing handset makers to pre-load software such as Google Search and Chrome browsers, otherwise it would not be allowed to use other Google applications.
The European Commission sees the move as damaging to consumers and hampering competition.
EU regulators initially asked Google to respond by July 27.
If antitrust charges are established, Google faces a fine of up to 10 percent of its global revenue, about $7.4 billion.
Google has yet to immediately comment.
Google also faces an EU investigation for favoring its own shopping service in search results.

A graphic read: Bitcoin's legal status around the world
Abstract: In addition to the natural price correction caused by speculative properties, this round of digital currency decline is also related to the "old enemy" - regulatory risk.
From the visual map, Eastern countries have a more conservative attitude toward bitcoin than the West, and countries that dominate the world are still watching for the legitimacy of the digital currency, representing the "black swan risk" that remains large.
:: This article is from Wall Street View (Microcredit ID: Wallstreetcn), editor Wang Mu. For more wonderful information, please log on to wallstreetcn.com or download Wall Street APP.
Bitcoin prices fell below the $10,000 psychological integer mark on Tuesday, the biggest in three years, as regulatory storms in major markets such as China, South Korea and the European Union battered the global digital currency, led by Bitcoin, this week a one-day drop.
In addition to the natural price correction triggered by speculative attributes, this round of the digital currency slump is also associated with the long-standing "enemy" - regulatory risk.
At this important juncture, the visualization big data site HowMuch.net produced a map showing the legitimacy and degree of regulation of bitcoin in countries around the world.
Green represents the legitimate market for bitcoin; orange represents the neutral market, although it has not yet publicly legalized bitcoin status, but there are no major restrictions on its use; light pink represents a restricted market, where local governments try red line policies or regulation methods Digital currency use; Deep pink represents the country where bitcoin is defined as illegal; Grey is the one that has not yet commented.
(Pictured above from Howe Much.Net Visual Team Drawing on January 15)
The paper points out that the traditional oriental countries' attitude towards bitcoin is more conservative than that of the West, as can be seen from the distribution of the color blocks of the Central African green.
Russia is by far the largest country to define bitcoin as illegal, China is one of the biggest restricted markets for bitcoin, and India is one of the biggest countries that has yet to comment on bitcoin and have no policies in place.
North America and Western Europe are the regions with the highest levels of acceptance of bitcoin, that is, the distribution of green blocks is more concentrated.
The views of the countries of the Middle East and Latin America on bitcoin diverge markedly, with the above-mentioned regions having a more mixed distribution of color.
Among them, Iraq, Iran, Turkey, Brazil are all legitimate bitcoin markets, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Bolivia and others have some restrictions on their trading and use, and more Latin American countries have yet to voice bitcoin.
Taken together, the data show that a total of 99 countries (or 40 per cent of the world's 246 countries) do not impose restrictions on the trading and use of bitcoin, that is, green and orange areas.
Seven countries (or 3%) are restricted markets (light pink), 10 (or 4%) define bitcoin as illegal (deep pink) and 130 (or 53%) there is no more treatment for digital currency information (grey).
This suggests that countries, which account for 53% and more than half of the global body, are still waiting to see the legitimacy of the Bitcoin-led digital currency within their borders and represent the "black swan risk" of bitcoin legislative decisions would be taken to restrict the digital currency.
The paper argues that global regulators have not yet fully understood the emerging category of digital currencies, and may be the main reason why most countries have yet to make a statement.
While bitcoin's popularity has grown exponentially since last year, and does not represent an interest for all, there may be some countries worried about local French currency being threatened as a result, or more worried about digital money being used by criminal organizations.
Wall Street has written a detailed summary of international regulatory news against bitcoin since last week, including China's start to crack down on centralized service online platforms and mobile App on off-site exchanges, South Korea still considering closing digital currency exchanges, and the European Union widely accepted and warned investors of the risk of "losing to nothing."

Big countries such as Russia have criticized the legitimacy of bitcoin, in fact, to make way for the official issuance of digital currencies.
Madrid, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Barcelona's new aid, Philippe Coutinho, made his debut in a Barca shirt at the Nou Camp on January 8.
Coutinho passed the Barca medical examination that morning and signed with Barca president Bartomeu on a contract that was due to expire in the summer of 2023.
He then made an appearance as a Barca player in front of nearly 7,000 fans at the Nou Camp.
According to Spanish media, Coutinho's total transfer fee, or up to 160 million euros (1 euro or 7.77 yuan), is the first in the history of the Barca club and La Liga.
With Coutinho still injured at the moment, he still has to rest for nearly 20 days to welcome himself in a Barca shirt.
What else is sacred?
Now the Trump White House is taking aim at the Statue of Liberty
The most definitive sign of regime change was when they began attacking the statue.
Americans agree with this as much as anyone, so Saddam Hussein, of Paradise Square in Baghdad in 2003, was deliberately pushed down.
Stephen Miller, one of the key think tanks of the Trump administration, was certain when he argued with Jim Acosta of CNN about the president's proposal to severely restrict legal immigration. You know what happens when you cut a symbolic axe on the Statue of Liberty.
To be fair, Miller did not attack the statue itself.
If he does, then a group of cruise ship owners and liberal followers will surely eat him alive.
But he did attack the significance of the statue, especially when the famous poem of Emma Lazarus was engraved on the pedestal in 1903 (the monument was built 17 years later).
As Miller berated Acosta for saying, "I don't want to talk about the full facts of history here, but the Statue of Liberty is like a symbol of American freedom to light the world..."
The poem you are referring to, which was added later, is not part of the original Statue of Liberty. "
In fact, Miller is right, but as he himself says, this is not really about history.
This relates to the modern echo of Lazarus, the only country that seems to invite not only any old immigrants, but also the poorest of the poor: "Your exhaustion, your poverty, or your crowding people want to breathe freely. / The people who suffer reject your crowded beach.
There is no "human rejection of suffering" at a moment when our screens become more piercing.
Miller, who has not worked on literary commentary, made it clear that these people would not be welcome in the Trump-era United States.
This conflict over the significance of statues is part of a broader political and cultural war: This is actually in conflict with the American spirit.
Lazarus, and her friends who held events after her death to inscribe her verses on the pedestal, are well aware of the highly political nature of the behaviour they are taking part in.
The purpose of the sculpture is to express the connection between French and American republicanism through the ancient classical metaphor of the female incarnation as the goddess of freedom.
Lazarus changed this meaning: In her poem, the female image is no longer abstract, she wants to make a sound.
She gave herself a very different name: The mother of exile.
The combination of the poem and the painting was a successful feminist coup and a devastating blow to American nativism.
Just as Lazarus has changed the meaning of the statue, the right-wingers have always wanted to change it back to its original meaning.
Rush Limbaugh, the great speaker who was an impromptu Trump launcher, argued in 2010 that liberalism was not an invitation to anyone, and that he was now an early neo-conservative. The flame of American wisdom brought to the world of folly: "The goddess of liberty is brave.
She was meant to carry the torch of freedom from the United States to other parts of the world.
The torch is not the way to illuminate the United States.
Unusually, Limbo was actually moved by something.
The significance of the statue depends entirely on the angle of cognition.
The most imaginative thing about Lazarus is to be able to see it. When tired, poor but hopeful people can see it on the deck of a ship after a long and often terrible journey.
On the face of it, this involves the perspective of the world for those who seek asylum and have the opportunity to improve their lives.
Her statue conveyed to them and needed the hope and welcome they had heard.
Of course, this is not a view that Miller and Trump had wanted to acknowledge.
Their torch was not intended to illuminate the road, but to ignite the hatred of their only source of strength.

World Cup 2017: Neil Black highly praised Scotland players in the British national team
Eilidh Doyle recalled that there were only two Scots in the British national team at the time.
Neil Black, executive director of the British Athletics Association, said a team of 16 strong Scots in the World Championships team would make a huge contribution to the national team.
The number of Scottish field athletes selected for the 2017 London Athletics World Championships, which opened on Friday, is at its highest ever.
According to Black, "Scotland is making extraordinary progress" and British track and field athletes must learn from it.
"We accept and try to understand that, and we will stick to it until we succeed," Black said.
"I'm talking to people at the Scottish Sports Institute. They think it has to do with what they do.
Scottish track and field athletes think it has something to do with their actions.
The British Athletics Association believes it has something to do with their actions.
Even street people think so.
No matter what the situation, this is extremely brilliant.
A number of Scottish track and field athletes are medal contenders, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart, who will compete with Mo Farah at 5,000 metres. Highs and lows, while Eilidh Doyle was chosen by the group as captain.
"Ereed is a little modest.
Her captain's speech was incredible, "Black said.
"Many track and field athletes, whether or not they are Scots, or wherever they live or train, walk out of the door with pride and vigour.
Ereed's natural passion and true feelings are very good. "
The Commonwealth silver medallist, who will compete in the 400m hurdles in his fifth World Championships, said it was "incredible" that there were 16 Scots in the British national team.
Previously, the highest number of Scottish track and field athletes in the World Series was seven, the number of entries made in 1983 and 2015.
The middle runner, Muir, is a leading figure. She has set five British records and two European records in the past year.
She will compete in the 1500m and 5,000m project races.
Chris O'Hale, who competed in the 1500m event, was another Scottish player to watch, having previously made a good start to the season, winning in the British National against the qualifiers and the Olympic anniversary respectively.
Doyle recalled her participation in the first World Championships, when the only other Scot on the team was Lee McConnell.
The captain said she was deeply proud that so many of her countrymen would not only join the team, but also, in some cases, challenge the medals and compete for the finals.
"The special thing about being captain of the national team is that it is voted for by the rest of the national team, so it is a great honor for me to know that your team-mates voted for you to achieve something very unusual," she added.
"Of course, I am very proud of all the Scottish players.
It just shows how far we go.
And they are both veteran track and field athletes here who are about to move towards the goal of the Rongden podium.
What about my captain's speech?
Well, I think it's fantastic.
I have just referred to the fact that, in this case, we are very fortunate because we hold the World Championships at home.
It is therefore of real importance that we build on our home support and our strength as a result of our return to the Olympic Stadium.
I will get a second chance to compete, and the atmosphere there will be fantastic.

Shield critics on Facebook: Don't run for office if you can't stand the censure of voters
Our national father understands the bad media style.
Americans love Washington, but soon after, the major newspapers began to lash out at him for everything from domestic policy to political principles.
He was irritated by the criticism, no doubt about it.
But he did not silence these critics.
Because back in 1783, Washington said, "Freedom of speech is denied - we will be slaughtered in silence and ignorance like lambs."
It made me think of Larry Hogan, the governor of Maryland, who needs to learn from Washington.
Hogan's staff blocked and deleted the posts of at least 450 people as they posted their views on his Facebook official home page.
The American Civil Liberties Union filed a lawsuit against him earlier this week.
The governor's staff thought the lawsuit was sloppy, and online reports were filled with their backlash: "Who cares?"
A lot of people say, "It's just Facebook."
But, it's important.
This is particularly important because it is facing people like Hogan.
It was a Republican who served as governor in a state with a democratic majority, and he was surprisingly popular.
Among the country's 50 governors, he received the second highest praise.
Hogan is not a reactionary irritant.
He took charge of Maryland smoothly and followed the rules strictly.
He is also very good at using Facebook as the main way to connect with voters, playfully showing off his baldness after chemotherapy for the first time on the home page.
So it's completely unnecessary and ultimately dangerous to block people who come to the governor's homepage, a public forum that serves as an official management platform for public tax-paying employees.
In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan's spokesman, Amelia Sasse, defended the governor's actions, saying she thought shielding their comments was simply an attempt to get them to restrain a little bit.
But they were too hasty to describe it as a torrent or cynic sweeping the network.
The Washington Post has spoken face-to-face with people shielded by Hogan.
They are just ordinary people talking to their elected leaders: They are teachers, small business owners and pastors, and they are not wild animals.
They are vociferous that their comments have depth, respect, and are not obscene.
The priest quoted the Bible in his post, calling on Hogan to "remember his Catholic faith."
Lakshmi Salma Ramani, a barrister in Bowie, Maryland, was not cynical, but she asked questions about hate crime.
"I'm very polite to comment that I'm disappointed that he didn't respond to hate crimes and other recent news events," she wrote in the news story review section of The Washington Post.
I also do not like a group of people to comment on the same topic, because these people will be directly ignored by some as so-called public psychology, rather than treating them as a group of worried citizens. "
What the governor's staff calls "dense garbage information bombing" may seem to others to be "persistent claims."
The Facebook era made it easy to modify a message, simply shielding one critic or deleting a negative comment.
And it is far cleaner than it used to be, and to do the same in the past few years requires sending staff out to collect and burn newspapers with critical statements or to arrest or silence protesters.
But that's really what is happening now, just on a digital level.
Hogan is not the first public official to be blamed for silencing others on Facebook and other social media.
President Trump is being sued by Twitter users because he blocked them on Twitter.
There was a landmark ruling in Virginia last week on such issues.
The chairman of the Lauden County Oversight Committee shielded voters from her Facebook home page in violation of the First Amendment, according to U.S. District Judge James c Carcharis of Alexandria.
Kentucky Governor Matt Bevin (R) was also patronized by the American Civil Liberties Union for his use of Facebook and Twitter.
This should not be so hard.
In the Washington era, affordable postage and the internet had a similar influence.
The number of news newspapers quadrupled between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letters strongly criticized his leadership.
And even then, there were anonymous torrents against him in Washington.
People wrote to the newspaper under the pseudonym Urikra, Valereus, Belislaus, and Bojus to criticize Washington's decision-making.
According to historical documents collected by the George Washington newspaper's online project, his office was inundated with petitions, all criticizing his attitude on the Treaty of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation between His Majesty the King of England and the United States of America.
But he did not silence them.
Freedom of speech, dissent and freedom of speech are the very foundations of this country.
And real leaders need to accept that.
The naked wind and grass of the property market are holding people's sensitive nerves.
Limited purchase is a hard lever of real estate control policy in many cities.
In May 2017, Jinan introduced a six-year continuous social security policy for undergraduate students to enjoy the same purchase policy for local resident resident residents;
In June, Wuhan introduced a policy that allows college students to leave their homes within 3 years of graduation with a diploma and employment certificate.
Then the policy added code, the official said, "university students can buy a house at 20% below the market price";
In July, Chengdu introduced rules that young people with an undergraduate degree or above in the field can apply for admission to Chengdu on the basis of a graduation certificate.
In addition, other cities or regions, such as Kunshan, Shanghai and Hong Kong, have introduced "talent introduction" policies to lower the threshold for talent buyers.
According to Zhang, this is actually the big cities to the population, especially the talent competition, retain the population, especially the talent, the city is competitive, this is these real estate policy is the most important significance.
Some even believe that this means that the time has come for the "limited purchase" of the building market to be cancelled.

Ronan Lafferty looks to enjoy feeling home at Renaissance club
East Lothian Renaissance Club hosts the 25th Scottish evergreen Open and former European champion Ronan Lafferty will enjoy the feeling of going home for the next three days.

"It's really special," said the Shoesport athlete.
I didn't defend the Estremadura Open because in the second year of my win, the game was called off.
It feels amazing to come to this place,
It's wonderful to play golf here.
Last year's memories came up, and for me and my wife, Sharon, last year's win had a special meaning for us.
It was really a special memory, and we will remember it forever.
Back in the Inverness race was Gary Orr, who had just turned 50 earlier this year, before also taking part in the European evergreen Tour.
This time it was his first Scottish game since the 2013 Scottish Golf Open.
"It will always make more sense to go home and compete," said Orr, a Helensburg man
You want to do well; but you can feel that extra pressure.
Being able to play again I really enjoy it, I've been playing golf.
I am satisfied with the current situation.
Joining the on-field trio were former Masters winner Ian Woosnan and evergreen champion Paul Brodhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNewty.
A total of six Scottish athletes on the field, Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are two of them, with the other four being Andrew Odekorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Lang and Ross Dramond.

In August, there were 57 cases of continuous daily punishment nationwide, and a new amendment to the Environmental Protection Act introduced earlier this year clearly added to China's environmental enforcement efforts, said Zou Zhoumin, director of the Environmental Protection Bureau in Beijing.
At present, environmental authorities in various parts of China can use the penalties of daily continuous punishment, seizure, production restriction and administrative detention to detect environmental offences and cooperate with the judiciary to punish environmental crimes.
In August, 335 cases of seizure and seizure were carried out in various parts of China; 177 cases of restriction of production and shutdown were carried out; 189 cases of administrative detention were transferred and 166 cases of suspected environmental pollution were transferred.
Among them, Henan carries out the daily continuous punishment of 7 pieces, currently, China is from the end of the control to the whole process of embedding, full force environmental pollution control.
Despite the downward pressure on the economy, China's environment ministry has made clear that it should properly handle the positioning of environmental protection in its economic development and enhance "green stability," the more the economy grows downwards, the less environmentally friendly the optimization effect.

Russian media say Putin will have a new domestic car: 15% cheaper than Mercedes
(Reuters) - President Vladimir Putin's "motorcade" has a unit price of 6-7 million roubles, according to Russian Minister of Trade and Industry Manturov, Russian media reported on January 18.
The budget target is to keep the price at 15 per cent lower than the Mercedes-Benz S-Class car.
Russia's National Automotive Engineering Institute (NAMI), the president's main research and development unit, will deliver 16 vehicles to the Federal Guard between the end of February and the beginning of March, the Russian company said on Monday.

I am deeply proud and happy, and I am willing to sink down and write more about the fate of the little men of the great age
What good suggestions can be made about the development of this grass-roots literature and art
Now the popular arts and art is very lively, the popularization aspect is a little bit
Unceasingly launched worthy of the times of the fine work.
Should be rooted with the grass roots, deep into life, then made with a certain cultural thickness, positive upward, at the same time have the constant artistic charm of the work.
It has reached twenty-eight and measured a total of 15: 200 million acres of land under contract, of which 11: 100 million acres have been completed.
The seven provinces of Sichuan and other provinces, which account for 82 percent of the land area contracted by families in the second round, have reported to the Party Central State Council that it is largely completed.

Public toilets in Nanjing, Cebu City and other places in Jiangsu
Brush your face for three seconds and get a toilet paper for free, but if you want to get a double, you need to wait another ten minutes
Avoiding misuse of public resources
Habit, maybe some tourists really want to take the paper back, but on the other hand we also have to reflect
Is there no paper for the next toilet to be accessed by our visitors, so this is something we have especially emphasized in the new three-year plan
This imbalance is not sufficient to solve the problem
To push the toilet revolution into depth is to think more of what the masses think.
Must have the third bathroom, convenient for the family to accompany the elderly, children to the toilet.
We took the baby, and we were embarrassed to go in with us
The toilet child is so small as to understand a bit of embarrassment, that board is particularly comfortable, very convenient for us to bring children.
People feel civilised and become civilized builders. In the countryside, villagers in the Guangxi River Pool are building new flush toilets in their homes
Much has been achieved, and the active promotion of the toilet revolution can not only help people stay away from disease, but also drive economic development to narrow the regional development gap.
This toilet problem is a programmatic problem, it is a social problem development node.
It is a national civilization project, from the point of view of the country to guide the layout, then all aspects from different degrees of participation to solve small social problems.
So that's all of our short complement.

Poverty and Death in Jinzhou, Indonesia
Badtina Dejer doesn't use a stove when she cooks.
She even rarely uses a pot.
Her log house is located in Enerotaly, the capital of Panyai County in Papua, Indonesia, and the housewife usually just puts a sweet potato - which locals call "nota" - straight into the fire.
Half an hour later, the burnt sweet potato was eagerly picked up by a pair of unwashed hands and devoured.
Dai Jie sits on the mud - she has no furniture, and this is where she does her daily household chores, such as washing clothes, washing clothes in very muddy water, all from the nearby marshes.
There's a bucket in a room without a roof, and this is the outdoor toilet.
She was the youngest of her husband's four wives, so she was not assigned to the fields to look after.
Polygamy is common here.
Of course it's dangerous to work to a party: Most of the men in the village don't have a job, and a lot of them are drunk, plus there are a lot of soldiers here.
"No one dares to walk around the village after 5pm," she said.
It was a rare glimpse of everyday life in the Papua Highlands, once a Dutch colony that was incorporated into Indonesia after the 1969 referendum, which was also controversial, when only 1,026 elders were forced to vote by hand in front of the occupying forces voting.
The current campaign for independence and opposition to Dutch rule is quick to point the finger at the Jakarta government, which has imposed high-pressure rule on the region, isolating foreign journalists and defenders.
In 2003, the province officially split into the provinces of Papua and West Papua, while Papua New Guinea independently controlled the eastern part of the island.
Enerotali is remote and uninhabited; to get here it takes a 90-minute flight from Chayapura, the provincial capital, to Nabire, and a five-hour car ride, all the way through the stomach.
There is no public transport here.
In this town of about 19,000 people, the wooden house is surrounded by bamboo fences, and the ruffled tin roof is a variety of yellow-brown covering made of rust.
Few Indonesians come, let alone journalists, and there are few foreigners.
Before the arrival of the Christian preacher, the Mee Pago Papuans believed in a god called Uga Tamee.
There are other changes here, too.
"We don't get used to these clothes," she said, referring to her brightly colored hand-knitted headscarf, dark shirt and bright half-skirt.
"We used to cover the body with only leaves."
Papua is the poorest province in Indonesia, where 28 percent of people live below the poverty line and the region with the highest infant mortality and lowest literacy rates in Asia.
But here, too, is Jinzhou in Indonesia.
Panyai County, about the same size as New Jersey, has 153,000 people. The world's largest and most profitable gold mine, Glassberg, is only 60 miles away from the Phoenix-based Felipe McMoran the Golden Company owned.
In 2015 alone, Felipe mined about $3.1 billion worth of gold and copper mines here.
In addition, Papua is rich in timber resources, with an estimated value of $78 billion.
Yet these rich resources are also a source of tragedy for the Papuans, and Indonesia's powerful military power has been able to suppress them all the time.
A 2005 New York Times investigation reported that Felipe paid nearly $20 million to local military personnel and troops between 1998 and 2004, up to $150,000 for an official alone.
The growing appeal of the Papuans for independence threatened the gold lord, and they were subjected to cruel treatment.
More than half a million Papuans have been killed since 1969, and thousands have been raped, tortured and held by the Indonesian army, according to rights activists.
According to the Asian Human Rights Commission, mass killings in the tribal highlands of Papua in the 1970s have escalated into genocide.
Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful protesters last year alone.
A 2016 report by the Catholic Brisbane General Diocese, "We will lose everything," included evidence of the previous year's abominations, such as extrajudicial killings, torture - another report that rape and electricity are particularly common - and peaceful the brutal repression of demonstrations.
"The violence is happening on a daily basis, making it difficult to calculate the number of victims," said Andreas Halsolo, an Indonesian researcher at Human Rights Watch.
The resources of Papua brought in large numbers of immigrants outside Indonesia, and the oppression began.
Eighty-three percent of the province's 3.5 million people are Christian, but the demographics of Muslim economic migrants have changed since they arrived from the densely populated islands of Java, Kalimantan, Sumatra, Sulawesi.
The Javanese snack stand sells fried chicken and vegetables mixed with Gal Gadot, complete with peanut butter.
Locals struggle.
Persia Yue, a 24-year-old Paniai native who moved to Chayapura, the provincial capital, to find work, explained that "those immigrants started selling chicken and vegetables in traditional markets at lower prices than local Papuans.
This has left the local Papuans - the women of Papua (mama-mama) - without their market. "
Indonesian President Zoko Widodo (often referred to as Zokovi) vowed during his 2014 campaign to tackle inequality and abuse of power in Papua.
The once-carpenter's path to the presidential palace in Jakarta was supported by 27 of all 29 districts - including Paniai.
But Papua has changed nothing, and today, locals feel betrayed.
"We are heartbroken, and in 2014 we voted for Zokowi in the hope that he will live up to our wishes and restore fairness," Yau said.
In fact, just two months after Jokowi took office in October, Paniai suffered the most terrible nightmare.
On December 7, 2014, 11 children in Enerotaly sang Christmas carols in front of a campfire outside, and two Indonesian soldiers suddenly rushed over on a motorcycle.
The frightened children told them they should turn on the headlights.
One of the soldiers was unhappy with their tone and then returned with four soldiers, according to local priest Yavit Tebbe.
The victims and witnesses said the drunk soldiers used their guns to chase the group of children.
Then one of the soldiers fired a gun at the group of children.
Julianus Yemin, 16, was in a coma after being badly beaten.
A few hours later, a fire broke out at a nearby government agency, the Electoral Commission building, and the incident escalated the following day.
Some 1,000 young Papua men, women and children gathered at a football stadium in front of the local police station and the military command centre to demand justice.
With a ceremonial hunting bow, they danced the waita dance of the Papua Mee Pago tribe - running around and mimicking the birdsong.
Some of the protesters began throwing stones at military regular posts.
According to an official document seen by Time magazine, when emotions continued to intensify, soldiers received orders via internal radio: "If the crowd resisted more than three times, shoot immediately," but the document was not released to local media.
Yeremias Kayamu, 56, the leader of the Enerotaly Kego Koto neighborhood, felt imminent danger, and called on the crowd to calm down and begged them to go home.
But no one was in the mood to hear him.
Standing on the porch of his brightly colored log house, he told Time magazine, "When I look back, my left wrist suddenly shot."
Kaayaki still does not know who fired the gun, but he said the bullet came from among the assembled soldiers.
He added, "It was very crowded at the time, they fired a lot of guns.
He witnessed the shooting and saw three shots in the body of Olvuth Yur, according to the cousin of the local Orvyus Yur.
Euhanes sadly told Time magazine, "I ran over to check his body to see if it was him,"
I found out he was dead... I kissed him.
Papua Police Chief Inspector Yoj Mende told reporters that his subordinates were only at the Protection Police Department because the station had been attacked.
"When someone threatens to kill us, we must defend ourselves," said Phugio Sulistio, police chief and spokesman for Papua police in 2015.
It is a matter of life and death.
Five young protesters were killed and many more were injured, according to Human Rights Watch.
News of the killing spread only slowly in Jakarta the next day.
Three weeks later, Zokowi gave a vociferous speech in Chayapura, expressing deep sympathy for the families of the victims and vowing to address the legacy of abuse of power in Papua's history.
"I hope the case will be resolved as soon as possible so that this will not happen again in the future," he said.
In October 2016, security minister Virando said he wanted to set up a non-judicial mechanism to address the historical legacy of human rights abuses.
But the excuse to push off also almost immediately sounded.
"Most of the aggression happened a long time ago," he said.
Some were in the 1990s and early 2000s.
The point is that we are committed to addressing these violations, but that still requires a process. "
Then in Jakarta on June 5, Villando broke out during a conversation with Time magazine, saying he had no plans to set up a complaints mechanism in Papua.
Instead, he said, "everything will be settled according to law."
The United Nations has filed a complaint against Villando for "human rights crimes" over the deaths of more than 1,000 people in the bloody independence vote in East Timor in 1999, but he says 11 human rights violations in Papua have been resolved, including the incident.
The families of the victims of the Paniai incident scoffed at the remarks.
"I've been interviewed four times in the last three years, but things are going nowhere at all," Uhanes said.
Years later he said, "I'm tired."
He still lives in fear now.
He said, "I'm scared.
I was afraid of being arrested by the army, afraid of being shot.
His brother, Yukabos, agreed that the people of Paniai were scared to talk about the incident.
He said he was beaten by the military after helping to bury four victims.
He said, "After burying the body, the military came to me."
The shooting did not stop.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police shot villagers in Deayi County, a neighboring county in Paniai.
A construction company manager refused to help transport a man in a coma to hospital, where both sides clashed, one person died and 17 others were injured, including children.
Man Lavianus Dorwood, 24, drowned while fishing by a nearby river and died on his way to hospital.
Angry villagers protested in front of the company's field office.
Police said villagers threw stones at police, so officers fired warning shots.
But anti-riot mobile units (Indonesian paramilitary police) began shooting at the crowd and one person was killed.
"We were all panicked and now scared that they would retaliate," 29-year-old Domingo Valley Buddy told Time magazine, who was living near the hospital when he witnessed the wounded being rushed to hospital.
"I hid at home for two days.
The Deayi parliament has called for the police involved to be brought to justice and the riot mobile force to be withdrawn from the area.
Panyai has always been a right and wrong place for the Indonesian government.
The absence of effective development has bred discontent among the people of the Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal tribes, which are scattered in the lush central highlands of Paniai.
Many have joined the Free Papua Movement (OPM), a rebel army that claims to protect the rights of Papuans by dispersing attacks and raids to kidnap Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the top leaders of the Free Papua movement were born in Paniai, including Tadieus Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoa.
As a result, thousands of Panaians have been arrested in recent years by the military under the guise of "defending national sovereignty" and deliberately detained.
Some people never showed up again.
In the eyes of the Papuans, Paniai is a "forgotten place of tragedy."
Poverty breeds discontent.
Enerotaly is selling very little rice, and the locals can't afford it at all.
Bread is simply out of reach.
People here grow everything they can eat: Mainly sweet potatoes and some fruit and leafy vegetables.
Farming is a woman's job and every woman can take care of four or five sweet potato fields.
They usually leave most of their harvests for writers and sell the rest on the local market.
Ten sweet potatoes are worth only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Over time, economic inequality has opened up among local Papuans and new immigrants, whose numbers have greatly increased since the opening of the new route to Nabire airport.
The small amount of work available usually falls into the hands of better-educated and wealthier immigrants.
Papuans rarely have the funds or the necessary skills to run competitive companies.
"Young people do not want to stay in this village... because there is no job and no money here," said John Gobe, president of the Parniay Tribal Council.
Papua is isolated.
In addition, restrictions on international media coverage remain tight.
Earlier this year, French journalists Frank Escudi and Basel Lunchan were expelled from Papua because they "do not cooperate with the relevant agencies," even if they have been given a rare warrant to shoot.
According to Human Rights Watch's Asia deputy director, Felim Kaine, the election vow by Zokovi to remove reporting restrictions to promote transparency and development has not materialized.
"If foreign journalists try to cover Papua and West Papua, Indonesia's most eastern disgruntled provinces, they are at new risk: Denial of visas and blacklisting," he said in a statement.
The absence of media scrutiny means that international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely confined to Papua's neighbors.
In March, six Pacific countries - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands, Solomon Islands - asked the UN Human Rights Council to investigate Papua's "widespread human rights violations," including the Paniai shooting.
These countries have also supported the Free Papua Movement.
Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesman Almanata Nassir, who does not care much about the group's allegations, told reporters in Jakarta that "Indonesia is still running a democratic system and media freedom, so the evidence of human rights violations is hard to hide." ""
Locals want more foreign governments to value.
On May 4, when the Dutch ambassador for human rights, Keith Wan Barr, led an official delegation to Chayapura, the local people broke their silence and begged, "We want freedom," he also attended the meeting, according to a source familiar with the meeting. But requested anonymity.
Indonesia will hold its next presidential election in 2019, but Papua says they are unlikely to vote for Zokowi again.
Gobai, president of the tribal council, called Zokovi's intentions "good," but he was surrounded by people who were involved in the Paniai shooting.
He wanted Zokowi to know that the people of Panyai lived not only under the threat of a greedy army, but also with nothing, a region with little education and a lack of public health care services.
Gobai said the people of Panyai, like other Papuans, thought their vote for Zokovi was a debt he had to pay off.
"They don't need money, they need justice," he said.
Even under threat and intimidation, the families of the victims of the Paniai shooting made their last symbolic rebellion: To bury the body of a victim opposite the military police post.
They know that justice may never come, but at least they will not let the culprits forget their crimes.
Eucarbs bowed his head and said, "My family has been killed,
What else can we do?
On February 10, 2017, the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) approved the initial application of Canton Shatin Homestead Home Ownership Co. Ltd., with the help of capital. The company's small and medium-listed laissez-passer, more than 20 days after the start of the IPO.
The industry believes that, with the homestead and the European home on the market, the custom home area, which is already in the wind, will be changed from product competition to capital competition.
At the beginning of the new year, a typical representative brand of homestead is coming to market, attracting the attention of the whole home industry.
(Reuters) - Samsung Electronics on Tuesday released its first self-driving vehicle kit, developed with Harman International, as well as information and entertainment solutions, an important part of the company's drive into the automotive electronics market, Reuters said initiative.
Samsung Electronics acquired Harman International about a year ago.
At the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas this week, Samsung released car cameras with collision warnings, lane offset alerts, cruise control features that were developed in partnership with Harman.
Samsung plans to start shipping the camera system this year, which is built on technology such as automatic machine learning and augmented reality.
Samsung also shows the "digital cockpit," even if the driver is not the owner, can make the vehicle more personal, as the system allows users to download the driver's data from mobile devices and clouds.

Fire engulfs Dubai's Torch Mormon Tower again
A fire at a world-tallest residential building in Dubai on Friday forced hundreds of residents to flee the 337-metre-high, 79-storey superstructure.
It was the second blaze to sweep through a high-rise building in just two years, and happened to be in the Mortian tower known as the Torch.
The building has been evacuated and no injuries have been reported, and the cause of the blaze has not yet been found.
We were sleeping, and then we were woken up by the fire alarm and people started screaming.
We ran down the stairs and it took about 10 minutes to run down from the 50th floor, "a resident named George told Reuters.
The fire brigade extinguished the blaze at around 4: 00 local time (0000 GMT) and is cooling the building, civil defence authorities in Dubai said.
The Government indicated that efforts were being made to provide places of refuge for those affected.
The accident could once again raise concerns around the world about the safety of high-rise buildings using outer-wall materials.
A survey conducted by the management of the Torch Ferris Tower in the wake of its 2015 fire found that most of the damaged objects were overlaid exterior panels for decoration and insulation.
British police have said they believe problems with the insulation and cladding panel system at Grenfell Tower in London may have contributed to the rapid spread of the fire in June, which killed about 80 people.
Williams' team also hinted that Massa is likely to return, although he has announced his retirement.
January 9 is just a month away from the opening of the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea, as the Olympic flame passes from the south to the north with preheating and preparations closely underway, South Korea's atmosphere is growing.
South Korean public opinion expects this long-running inter-Korean talks to bring a "colored egg" to the countdown to the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics.
The Pyeongchang Winter Olympics flame arrived in South Korea on November 1 last year.
The boom in the flame was directly reflected in ticket sales for the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics.
Just over two months ago, the Pyeongchang Winter Olympic Games ticket sales rate hovered at 32%, the Winter Paralympic Games ticket sales rate was only 4.3%, and the low ticket sales rate once worried about Pyeongchang's popularity.
But as Li Xie Fan, chairman of the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics Organizing Committee, recently predicted to reporters, "as the Winter Olympic flame passes across South Korea, the heat of the Winter Olympics is rising and ticket sales will soon improve."
Ticket sales for the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics have reached 64 percent as of January 3, and ticket sales for the Winter Paralympic Games have also topped 50 percent, according to South Korean media.
To encourage foreigners to travel to South Korea, the Ministry of Justice also announced on Sunday that foreigners visiting South Korea to watch the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics would be allowed to stay in the country for up to 120 days.
More than a fifth of US travellers board with contraband items, survey finds
A survey of plane passengers found that more than 20 per cent of passengers had deliberately or unintentionally packed illegal items to board a plane through a U.S. Transportation Safety Administration checkpoint, with at least 6 per cent of passengers boarding unintentionally carrying prohibited knives or other blades.
Less than 1 per cent of passengers claim they only found out afterwards that they were travelling with guns, ammunition or explosives by mistake.
The survey, which targeted more than 1,000 people, was conducted by charter services firm Stratos Jet Charters Inc., and also found that young travellers were more likely to blatantly ignore regulations.
Of the respondents who admitted to trying to board with TSA contraband on purpose, 19.7 per cent were millennials, compared with less than 15 per cent of the X-generation crowd.
The most common items that deliberately slip past TSA security personnel are food and drink.
More than 3 per cent admitted to deliberately carrying a blade through security, while 2.2 per cent of female respondents and 3.7 per cent of male respondents also said they had deliberately carried a prohibited drug on board.
The company said the survey was conducted by travellers across the country to find out about the number of people who accidentally carried and deliberately carried contraband over the aircraft security check-in.
Not surprisingly, those most likely to carry contraband through security - deliberately or unintentionally - are those who fly most frequently.
However, the company points out that the TSA guidelines are a bit complicated to understand.
People are usually not sure what and how much liquid they can carry.
It is not surprising, then, that the most seized liquid by TSA is a prohibited liquid.
It was once thought that TSA might have taken books as contraband as well.
Domestic flights are allowed to carry liquids, but international flights are not allowed to carry them.
EPA chief Prouter changes his mind on Obama-era emissions reduction regulations
A day after being sued by 15 states, EPA Director Scott Pruitt changed his earlier decision to delay the implementation of Obama-era regulations to reduce emissions of smog-air pollutants.
Pruitt offered to make the change because, compared to previous administrations, the EPA was able to respond more quickly to the needs of environmental regulatory state agencies.
He did not mention the legal challenge brought by the Federal Court of Appeal against his former post.
The controversy focused on setting October 1 as the deadline for states to begin meeting the 2015 ground ozone standards.
In June, Pruitt announced that he would delay compliance for a year in order to give the Environmental Protection Agency more time to study the plan and avoid "interfering with local decision-making or impeding economic growth."
Before being appointed by President Donald Trump, Pruitt was Oklahoma's attorney general and has long opposed the rigidity of environmental regulations.
Since arriving in Washington, Prout has repeatedly turned to block or delay regulations opposed by the chemical and fossil fuel industries.
The sudden reversal on Wednesday is the latest legal hurdle on Pluto's regulatory rollback agenda.
Last month, the Federal Court of Appeals in Washington ruled that the head of the Environmental Protection Agency had overstepped his authority to try to delay implementation of the Obama administration's requirement that oil and gas companies monitor and reduce methane leaks.
In a statement released Wednesday night, Pruitt offered a big turn in his approach to ozone standards, saying he wanted to strengthen the EPA's commitment to work with states to adopt complex procedures to reach new standards.
"Under the previous administration, the EPA usually did not meet the specified deadline, and then waited for the activist group and others to sue, and then agreed to set a specified timetable by agreement," he said, launching more than a dozen prosecutions against the Environmental Protection Agency.
"We do not believe in regulation through litigation, and we take the deadline seriously.
We also take regulations and authorities seriously.
Nonetheless, the EPA statement said Pruitt may again use his "renewal mandate and all other legally available authorizations" to ensure that the provisions are in line with "good policy and the best information available."
Republicans in Congress are pushing for a broad rewriting of the ozone layer regulations.
The House bill, approved last month, aims to delay implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years.
The measure has not yet been voted in the Senate.
New York State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman led the state coalition to sue the EPA this week, saying it intends to maintain legal pressure.
"The EPA reversal - after we filed a lawsuit - was a significant victory for the health and safety of 6.7 million New Yorkers, with communities of more than 115 million Americans directly affected by smoke emissions," Schneiderman said.
California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington, and the District of Columbia all joined New York State in the case.
Ground ozone is formed by the reaction of common pollutants emitted by cars, power plants, refineries, chemical plants and other sources in the light of sunlight in the atmosphere.
The resulting smoke can cause severe breathing problems for sensitive people, causing thousands of premature deaths each year.
Of course, public health advocates and environmentalists are cheering for the surprising shift in Prouter.
Lori Ann Bird, of the Centre for Biological Diversity, said: "It is disturbing that this common-sense measure is under enormous pressure from the head of the department that protects the air we need to breathe.
"We must fight the Trump administration's ideological campaign to cater to polluters and special interest groups."

Since the second half of 2009, sales of Xiaoshan trees have remained high, especially this spring, with a record increase in sales and prices, according to statistics, from January to June Xiaoshan achieved a 48 percent increase in sales revenue from the same period last year, the largest increase in almost 20 years.
Shi Haiyong, deputy director of Xiaoshan Forestry Bureau, said that along with the good sales situation, Xiaoshan flowerwood production has also made rapid development.
In the past two years, Xiaoshan has grown an area of 30,000 acres and a total area of 180,000 acres, while actively developing out-of-area, Xiaoshan Miangnon has built 80,000 acres across the country, up from 2008 million acres.
At the same time, the planting area is expanding, the quality of seedlings is increasing, the value of nurseries is increasing, large specifications, high-quality seedlings are retained more, and some seedlings appear to be sold.
He also warned that, in the face of the current boom in production, producers should face it calmly and objectively, both to see that society's demand for trees will be long-term, increasing, and to recognize that market competition will increase fierce.
Beijing, July 13 (Reuters) - U.S. company Somaltus filed a lawsuit in the East Texas District Court accusing Apple of violating a battery technology patent it filed for in 2010.
The company has previously used the same patents to sue Hua, Lenovo, Samsung, Sony and Toshiba.
The lawsuit alleges that both the iPhone 6s and similar Apple devices violated US patent number 7,657,386, known as the Integrated Battery Service System.
The plaintiff wanted to obtain cash compensation, or to charge a patent fee for the infringement equipment after the judgment was announced.
Judging by the indictment, the accuser appeared to believe that the fast-charging feature of the iPhone violated the company's patent.
The fast-charging iPhone will quickly charge up to 80 per cent of the power, followed by a trickle-down charge.
Somaltus is actually a so-called "patent rogue" because the company does not offer obvious products and services, and it is difficult to find information online.
However, they have successfully reached out-of-court settlements on the patent with auto makers such as Ford and Nissan.
The meeting concluded that it is of great significance to accelerate the development of informationization, promote the integration and efficient use of resources, enhance the digital and intelligent level of industry and promote "China 2025" and mass entrepreneurship, innovation and quality of life...

Trump has pressed Mexico to pay for border wall, according to leaked phone records
The Washington Post leaked transcripts of conversations between US President Donald Trump and leaders in Mexico and Australia.
On January 27, during a call to Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto, Trump urged him to stop publicly saying he would not pay for the proposed border wall.
The US president reportedly expressed his displeasure at his public bashing of the wall, with Putron allegedly saying to him: "You don't tell the media."
Trump pledged during the presidential campaign to build a wall along the southern border of the United States and made a solemn declaration to make Mexico pay for the project.
A transcript of the call between him and Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has also been released, showing a tense exchange between them.
Mr Trump told Mr Turnbull that the US deal to take on refugees sent to Australia was "ridiculous," "nasty" and "stupid" and that he had advised the US to ban refugee resettlement, now insisting on a deal brokered by the Obama administration. It will make him look like a fool.
Mr Trump hung up after telling Mr Turnbull "this is the most unpleasant call today."

Moore Beach tragedy: Activists recreate racist lynching, get justice
A 1948 Ford Mercury car runs through a crowd of onlookers in the small town of Monroe, Georgia, toward the tiny Moore Beach Bridge.
The vehicle, carrying four black passengers and a white driver, blocked the car's path ahead of a group of white men with guns before it arrived at the bridge.
The leader of the mob, a middle-aged man in a pinstripe suit, took a deep sip of a cigar and glanced into the windshield.
The passengers in the car were full of fear.
"We want - Roger!" The man shouted.
"Drag him out of the car!
A young black man was dragged from the front passenger seat and screams pierced the silence.
Fortunately, the horrific scene on July 22 was just a repeat.
But when "Roger" had a noose around his neck, almost all the onlookers gave a real gasp.
Since 2005, civil rights activists have returned to Moore Beach Bridge to recreate scenes from the night two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcon and George and Merere Dorsey - were lynched by the Three K party in 1946.
No one has ever been charged with murder.
"While we know who they are, even though we have seen them in the community, none of them have been arrested over the years, which is incredible," said Tyrone Brooks, who helped organize the repeat.
"This is a stain on history and a burden on our souls."
Brooks, 71, is a former Georgia congressman and lifelong rights activist.
For him, a repeat is a remarkable call to action, reminding people in the Monroe community every year that injustice has never been corrected.
"We want to prosecute, we want to close the case, we want to heal, we want reconciliation, but we have to get justice first," he said.
"Unless we get justice, we will not be cured and reconciled."
On July 27, 1946, the coroner placed a sheet on the body of a Moore Beach lynching victim.
More than 50 men from Monroe and surrounding counties are suspected of involvement in the lynching, according to FBI files obtained by NBC News.
But none of them have ever been prosecuted.
While the suspect has been on the loose for decades, civil rights activists say the dual motive for lynching is well known throughout the town: Political and sexual.
In April 1946, a Supreme Court ruling allowed black citizens of Georgia to vote in the primary for the first time later that summer.
Around the same time, black tenant farmer Roger Malcolm stabbed white landlord Barnett Hirst in a struggle - looking like it was for a woman, according to the FBI.
Brooks said the town rumor was that Hirst had slept with Malcolm's wife, Dorothy, and that her baby was not her husband either.
On July 25, 1946, the prominent white landlord, Loy Harrison, paid $600 to bail Malcolm out of prison, the FBI said.
Dorothy and cousins Mac Merry and George Dorsey accompanied him to the prison.
But as they returned from prison and approached the Moore Beach Bridge, a group of vigilante thugs rounded up the car.
"It turns out that it was Harrison who organized and ordered the execution of the murder," an FBI report concluded.
"It is clear that there is a conspiracy between state and local law enforcement that not only participated in the murders, destroyed the evidence, but also concealed the identity of the witnesses," the statement said.
Brooks is very succinct.
"This is a vote tragedy," he said.
"They were killed, and it was the killer who sent a message to the black people in this community:" If you sign up and vote, you will suffer the same end. "
For nearly a decade, Cassandra Green has been in charge of leading the annual repeat of the Moore Beach Bridge lynching tragedy.
Her expressive image is vivid, gripping, with a deeply racist background that many people hope will no longer exist in the United States.
Hard to watch, harder not to look at, but Green says that is the key.
"We don't want to talk about lynching because it makes us face the ugly face of all," she said.
"But if you don't listen to me, or don't hear me tell my own story, I can't build a relationship with you," she said.
This year's performance began in June, with nearly 30 actors on the first day - more than a dozen white and the rest black - huddled in a room to hear Green release an overview of the rehearsed performance.
Wade Malbow as co-director of Green.
For years, he has played the role of the three-K party, but he said the role was never easy.
"I feel dirty because I'm not such a person," Malabo said.
"But I think it's very important to keep this history alive because we don't want to go back to that time."
In the room, actors Darrios Bradshaw and Nick Lascona, who played Roger Malcolm and Barnett Hurst, were rehearsing their lines.
At the start of the play, Malcolm yelled and pushed Hurst away, angry that he had slept with his wife, Dorothy.
"I said," Get out of my territory! "
Rascona shot back.
And then they hit it.
Then everyone (at least all black actors) burst into laughter.
Green laughed the most.
"What's going on?!," Lassner asked.
He was alarmed and confused.
Am I acting too much?
"No," Green said with a laugh.
"I just think white people don't say 'ah' when they shoot back."
"Yes," quipped another black actor.
"Your tone has to be tough."
In this way, the energy in the room changes; the feeling of love drives away the discomfort.
Everyone tried to do so, not only to perform the play but also to honour the four victims.
The scene starts again.
This time, when Lascona said the word "ah," the tone was sharp and strong.
No one laughed.
The repeat came to a strong and swift end.
Screams, gunshots, and then, a silence.
A woman in a funeral black dress stood by the actor's body, singing Billy Hallyday's mournful words "strange fruit."
Her voice weighed over other words.
A hundred yards away, about forty spectators were constantly wiping sweat and tears.
Black and white people in the audience make up almost half of each.
There was a couple who came to see the show from Ithaca, New York, and a lot of people lived near the road.
Brooks took them to the graveyard of Malcolm and Dorothy for the sacrifice, nearly eight hours away, and everyone was enduring Georgia's uncomfortable feeling of wet heat.
Until this time, the murderer was still a fan, but now, standing on the same land where the lynching took place, there was anxiety in the air.
When the final note of the song disappears, Green asks people to get closer to checking the body played by the actor.
The children leaned down and looked at fake blood and bodies, whispering to each other.
"They're not really dead," muttered a little boy, as if to remind himself.
A few minutes later, Green thanked the crowd and then the performance ended.
The actor threw off the lynch rope and wiped away tears.
Bradshaw hugged Mal Bao, the man who played the three-K party head suit.
Nick Lascona hugged his two colleagues and wept in their arms; the emotion in the performance eventually infected him.
"It's okay," one of the women whispered.
"We know that your heart is not like this.
You do it for a reason.
After that, the audience sat down to dinner with the actor.
At the same table, a white couple from Atlanta had an intimate chat with a black couple they had just met to talk about a repeat.
It's hard to find words to describe how she feels after watching it.
"It's hard to imagine the terrible words and actions... being said and done by people like you, because they look like you," she said.
"For me, it really made me think the lynching was still going on," she added, "and now this kind of thing is only called police shooting.
In the room, Tyrone Brooks sat at the table watching, tasting and smelling back on civil rights.
He said he had started planning the show for next year.
"Repetition is an inspiring way, because it describes the horror we have experienced, but it is also very educational," he said.
"If you don't learn from it, this kind of thing may happen again.
Those who do not study and do not know their own history are doomed to repeat it.
For natural gas market reform, the importance of the reform of "network independence" is self-evident, but the resistance and controversy are also greater.
At 11.25 a.m. on 7 July, an explosion occurred in the emulsification workshop of Kailuan Group Chemical Co. Ltd in the ancient metallurgical district of Tangshan City, Hebei Province, where 13 operators were trapped.
So far, one of the 13 people trapped has been rescued, rushed to hospital for rescue, and the remaining 12 are in intensive search and rescue.
It is understood the scene has now been cordoned off and local public security, fire and medical services are on the scene to rescue.

However, the fans did not express any dissatisfaction, but instead sent a blessing, because the reason for the loss of contract is that Zhou Jelen happily became a father.
After a full year and a half, Jay Chou finally came to Beijing yesterday to present his first work since he upgraded his father, as well as the 14th album of his musical career, Chou Jilon's bedtime story.
Us Media: Chinese Air Force Engineering University Scientists Study Laser Satellite for Space Waste Removal
Chinese scientists have come up with a bold and innovative proposal to use large lasers to clean up messy Earth orbits and destroy old satellites and their sky waste, the US media said on January 18.
Researchers at the China Air Force Engineering University wrote a paper entitled "Space-based laser removal of small-scale space debris transition models," which describes the use of space-based platform lasers, Newsweek reported on January 15. How space debris can be irradiated by laser into smaller, less dangerous pieces.
"Space waste has been a concern for international space agencies for many years, and NASA has considered multiple options to track, detect and remove man-made debris," the report said.
The removal of large-scale space debris includes giant nets used to clean and collect waste, as well as magnets that can be used to suck them out of orbit, and Chinese scientists have conducted laser simulation studies to conclude that this would be Earth orbit the way it works.
" (Simulation study) provides the necessary theoretical basis for the application of space-based platform laser debris removal technology," the summary of the paper said.
A 2014 study by US defence giant Lockheed-Martin found that there are about 200 threats a day for satellites that are operating along the orbit.
High-speed debris moving along Earth's orbit, seen as a serious threat to future space missions, has been described by experts at the European Space Agency as a "deadly chain of threats," with high-speed debris increasing consistently over the past year.
Space is largely empty, but space next to the Earth is increasingly crowded, and every satellite we send into space will eventually become another piece of debris around the Earth, according to the US monthly website Mass Machinery. And over time, the pieces will accumulate.
The more debris, the higher the chance that a satellite that is still functioning will be hit by debris, thereby damaging or destroying a multimillion-dollar investment.
"All space agencies have plans in place to clear space debris in the future," the report said.
NASA is considering using jet gas to reduce the speed of debris and get it out of orbit, and Europe is considering launching a satellite carrying a large net to capture debris and bring it back to Earth, with the Japanese idea of capturing debris with an electric chain.
For now, China has also come up with a solution to space waste, which is to use a large laser to smash floating space waste into less harmful small pieces.
According to a paper published in the German monthly journal Optics by a group of researchers at the Chinese Air Force Engineering University, installing such a laser on a satellite would be effective enough to clean up space, at least according to simulation results.
"The only way to confirm effectiveness is to conduct tests, there is currently no arrangement for such missions, but perhaps someone will install lasers on a satellite and send them into space sooner or later," the report said.
Once that is done, we can finally begin to eliminate the problem of space junk once and for all.

Persheng Group to lay off another 3,000 jobs, slashing dividends to revive business
British education group Persheng said on Friday it would cut another 3,000 jobs and cut its interim dividend by 72 per cent, as it has begun another restructuring project to deal with business pressures.
Chief executive John Fallon said most of the job cuts would take place in the second half of 2018 and the first half of 2019, after 4,000 jobs had been scaled back in the previous restructuring.
Persheng Group announced in May plans to cut another 300 million pounds ($394 million) in costs in its third cost-cutting project to revive businesses hit by the rapid development of digital learning.
Last month, the company agreed to sell its stake in Penguin Langdon Book House to partner Bertelsmann and published reports that its underlying sales rose 1 percent to 2.05 billion pounds in the first half, but said the outlook was unchanged.
A few days ago, the China Tian Association seriously issued a notice, severely beat the running phenomenon, and is ready to give the violator a life-long ban heavy punishment.
NATO soldier killed in suicide bombing of convoy in Kabul
A military convoy was attacked by suicide bombers in the Afghan capital, Kabul, killing a NATO soldier and injuring several others, according to official sources.
Five soldiers and an interpreter were injured, the NATO statement said.
Three civilians also died in the incident in the Qarabag area of the city, according to unconfirmed local reports.
It was the latest violent attack in Afghanistan - the bombing of the Herat mosque on Tuesday killed more than 30 people.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi Embassy in Kabul.
The bombing occurred late Thursday, according to a NATO statement, when a joint patrol of the Afghan and NATO coalition forces was attacked by "individuals carrying improvised explosive devices."
"All those injured are currently in stable condition and are being treated at the U.S. Army Hospital at Bagram Air Force Base," the statement said.
The growing Taliban and so-called Islamic State (IS) groups in the Karabakh region have raised serious concerns among NATO forces stationed near Bagram, according to reporters.
At least 1,662 civilians died in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, compared with about 20 percent in the capital, according to the United Nations.
At least 30 people were killed in a suicide car bomb attack in a predominantly Shi'ite area of Kabul at the end of July.
The Taliban claimed they carried out the attack.
On 31 May, a huge explosion killed more than 150 people in the heart of Kabul, the deadliest militant attack in the country since the US-led multinational force toppled the Taliban in 2001.
The violence highlighted the perilous security situation in the country at a time when US President Donald Trump weighed in on whether to increase Afghan troops to support his army and police.
The suicide bombing in Kabul in recent weeks has also triggered a crisis of public confidence in the government and its policies, particularly the reputation of President Ashraf Ghani, according to journalists.
U.S. National Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) lawsuit overturns resolution, delays smog regulations
Obama, in office, made a rule requiring states to curb all types of emissions that cause smog, and 15 states sued the U.S. National Environmental Protection Agency for the regulation, a day after the EPA overturned it.
The EPA on Wednesday announced its decision to continue the so-called "2015 ozone compliance zone" and promised the EPA would work with states.
"We are confident in dialogue with our national partners and are committed to responding to it," EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt said in a statement.
Pruitt announced in June that the EPA plans to delay implementation of ozone-compliant zone standards until October 2018, with a one-year delay - according to which existing smoke pollution in some areas is measured to determine which areas should be reduced emissions of smoke pollution to meet air quality standards.
Fifteen major Democratic states, as well as the District of Columbia, filed a lawsuit against it on Tuesday, declaring the act illegal.
As part of a broader agenda, President Donald Trump's authorities have been working to revive various environmental regulations introduced by former President Barack Obama to spur economic growth.
But those efforts have sparked opposition from Democrats and conservative groups who fear more emissions could affect public health.
The EPA website claims that breathing ozone-containing air "reduces lung function and increases respiratory symptoms," such as asthma.

McGee Garcia and Vassily Lomachenko meet for first time to explore a possible future showdown
The most high-profile 147-under-pound boxing match will take place soon after, with Vasily Lomachenko and McGee Garcia, currently in a state of potential conflict, meeting for the first time on Thursday.
They were in separate rooms in the ESPN office in Los Angeles, where undefeated World Boxing Council lightweight champion Garcia took the lead down the aisle to greet world boxing's ultra-featherweight champion Lomachenko.
Both fighters have become the top five on the same heavyweight list at the Showtime boxing event on Saturday, when the referee unanimously decided that Garcia had beaten four-quarter world champion Adrian Blona to victory.
Garcia held out his right hand and said, "Champion, how are you?
Good luck.
Lomachenko saved his place with a victory over Miguel Mariaga at ESPN at 7pm on Saturday.
When the two of them took photos, Lomachenko's agent, Egis Klimas, pointed out that the potential matchup between the two contestants depended on the "perfect size."
"I was lightweight before," Garcia said.
"I raised my level against Warbraona (140 pounds), but I didn't weigh that much.
Compared to 140 pounds, I still weigh a little bit less.
I want to go back to lightweight.
And he has to reach a lightweight (135 pounds) and then we can fight.
This is what fans want, too.
Then we will satisfy them.
Lomachenko agreed.
"The boxing world needs this fight."
Clemens asked him if he should charge a fee, and part of his strategy was for Lomachenko to make his debut against a 135-pound player later this year, assuming a deal with Garcia next summer (37-0, 30) date. Garcia is also interested in playing against the victor of Jorge Linares-Luke Campbell after the Forum lightweight title fight on September 23.
"With all the fans asking this question, this fight may be on a charge," said Garcia, after which he expressed openness about playing on the network that offers the best financial options.
"We are the main characters.
It is impossible for others to generate such a great deal of attention.
As long as they are ready... "
Garcia praised Lomachenko as a "fantastic player" and could be on the spot to watch his boxing match on Saturday.
But Lomachenko hesitated over Garcia's praise, saying he thought the three-point regional champion from Riverside looked "slow. Sorry, McGee... you're going to be eliminated."
"The focus is to show the power of the fist and then boxing," Garcia said.
They all said they could feel the momentum of their own boxing match.
"This is a battle that must be fought,
Attention and heat are beyond the reach of other boxing matches.
I'm very happy to compete, "Garcia said.
"I've been waiting for the top fighters, this time round to McGee," Lomachenko said.
It will be a great fight.

The announcement by China Development and Reform Commission officials on the early completion of the 15-year reduction target has given the steel industry, which has limited electricity production to suppress, a strong expectation of re-production.
Although the steel plant has not received a clear notification from the local government that the energy-saving reduction effort has been completed, the industry estimates that, around 15 December 2010, the original limited production of steel plants will be completed, or will begin.
"There has been no notification of the end of the limited electricity production, but in practice the pressure on individual businesses has been significantly smaller than in September or October," a private steel company in Hebei province told reporters.
Some parts of Hebei have repeatedly issued electricity-limited production documents, and at one time adopted the forced pull-off method to restrict the production of enterprises.
The reporter learned from the local enterprise that at present most of Hebei area of the steel factory has been reworked, limited production pressure relief.
Zhang Iron Mountain, an analyst with my steel network, expects the terminal demand for construction steel to gradually weaken as the north is already in the winter.
Combined with the gradual end of energy-saving emission reductions, by December 15, most of the steel plants will be largely remanufactured and products will arrive in local markets by New Year's Day.
The increase in the supply of resources will put some pressure on steel prices, which are currently rising at the right rate.

Latest results of Swedish asylum-seeker age assessment test released
The Swedish asylum seeker test uses the latest method to medically assess their age, with the latest results showing that more than 80 per cent of the subjects were judged to be over 18, but not all believed in its accuracy.
The Swedish National Centre for Forensic Medicine (R? Ttsmedicinalverket) began the test earlier this year.
After being accused of failing to accurately assess the age of some of the refugees claiming to be minors, the Swedish Migration Board (Migrationsverket) designed these tests with a view to conducting a more accurate age assessment in the asylum process.
So far, the Swedish Migration Board has sent 6880 testers, and the Centre for Forensic Medicine has now released the results of a total of 2,481 testers between mid-March and July 31, 2017.
Eighty per cent (2002) were judged to be aged 18 or over, but in another 25 tests, the Swedish National Centre for Forensic Medicine decided that the subjects were "likely to be 18 years or older."
In 432 tests, the result was that the person "may be under the age of 18."
The test is only for people of questionable age.
The results were consistent with those of previous months, according to John Granson of the Centre for Forensic Medicine.
He told The Local: "There is not much difference between these data and the data from previous months, the numbers are very consistent.
The high proportion of cases judged to be over the age of 18 does not necessarily mean that these asylum-seekers have lied about their age.
In May, the center published 581 test results and said there were 442 cases "indicating that the subjects had reached the age of 18 or over."
News newspaper Svenska Dagbladet investigated the results of the 581 tests published and found that 243 of the subjects had publicly indicated that they would be 18 years old this year.
An X-ray examination of wisdom teeth, an MRI scan of the joints, followed by an analysis of the results by dentists and radiologists, a medical assessment that has also been questioned in some areas.
One of the doubters is Claude Marcus, an endocrinologist at Caroline College, whose work includes assessing people's biological maturity to determine whether they experience puberty sooner or later than their normal age.
He told the news newspaper Metro: "I have reason to think so, and I think the measurements used should not be like this."
It is very inaccurate to judge the physiological age in this way.
If we cannot guarantee accuracy, we should not pretend that we do it. "
But Granson, of the Centre for Forensic Science, defended the accuracy of these tests: "It is generally fair to say that there is little risk of uncertainty in judging a child as an adult."
The biggest risk is that the person is just under the age of 18, which is about 10 per cent.
West Virginia governor announces change of party
On Thursday night, Jim Justice, the Democratic governor of West Virginia, announced at a rally of President Trump that he would change the party.
"Like it or not, and the Democratic Party has left me," said the governor.
"Today, after a lot of prayers and a lot of thinking, I'm going to tell you... today I'm going to tell you as West Virginians that I can no longer help you as a Democratic governor," he said.
The rally erupted in cheers.
"So, tomorrow, I'm going to change the party to the Republican Party," Jastis added.
"As a coach, I'm going to tell you it's time to start another game."
Trump earlier promised a major announcement at a rally in West Virginia.
Mr. Trump won 42 percent of the vote in West Virginia, and Mr. Justis did not support Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Jastis was named the only billionaire in the state in 2016, according to Forbes.
Forbes notes that he inherited his father's coal industry and owns coal mines in all five states.
At the moment, he is worth about $1.59 billion.
Meanwhile, the Republican National Committee issued a statement late Thursday saying: "Governor Jastis's change of party is another blow to the Democratic Party, which, far from preventing our country from becoming great again, will make our country great again.
"Democrats now have only 15 governors, and control of state legislatures is at an all-time low, and the governor's statement is the latest rejection of such a party that loses leadership from top to bottom and cannot find a positive unifying slogan," Committee chairwoman Lana McDaniel said in a statement to CBS News.

Sebastian Coe lauds Russia's' frank 'apology for doping scandal
On Thursday, the president of the International Athletics Federation, Sebastian Coe, praised Russia's apology for the doping scandal and said it was "frank" but reiterated that it was not the time for Russia to rejoin the sport.
Mitri Chiradin, president of the Russian Athletics Federation, told the IAAF conference on the eve of the World Athletics Championships that it was right for his country to be banned from the sport and that he was determined to combat doping.
He said he regretted that "all the athletes who won gold and silver in the competition were stripped of their medals."
Despite his comments, the IAAF Congress voted in favour of maintaining the ban after the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) report referred to the discovery of evidence of Russian state-sponsored doping, which was imposed in November 2015.
"I think the response today was very frank and very frank with the introduction," IAAF president Ko told reporters.
"The whole council and the IAAF are pleased... the Russian Federation acknowledges that it has been through a very scorching period and is doing everything possible to ensure that Russia can re-enter the competition."
Ko said he was also "happy" that Russia accepted the criteria for re-entry.
"I think it's a very constructive day and I think we've made some progress, but the Tian League Congress supports the panel's proposal and it is not yet time to reinstate Russia," said Ko.
"We need to do what we can to normalize this situation over the next few months.
Our guiding principle has always been the desire to separate clean athletes from the contaminated system, "he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes meet the strict standards of the IAAF and will compete as neutral players at the World Athletics Championships in London on Friday.
The head of the IAAF panel, Ron Anderson, said on Monday that Russia had not yet met a number of criteria to resume entry.
Speaking to the IAAF Council in London, he told reporters that drug testing was still underdone and that banned coaches were still coaching.

What is the impact of football's financial rules on Neymar's move to Paris?
Rules designed to prevent unrestricted spending by European giants football clubs will not prevent Neymar from moving to France's Paris Saint-Germain football club (PSG) for a record fee from Barcelona in Spain.
The consequence is a further de-escalation of the Paris Saint-Germain Football Club by the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA), the governing body of European football matches, which has the power to ban teams from the widely watched Champions League.
The Financial Fair Play Rules (FFP), introduced by UEFA in 2011, meant the Paris Saint-Germain football club would eventually have to prove Neymar's transfer was funded without causing a huge loss.
The Barcelona club have paid £22million (£262million) just to cover the cost of the Brazilian player's settlement, while Neymar will be paid up to tens of millions of dollars a year.
Here are some of the financial implications of Neymar's move to France.
Given that the team is funded by the cash-rich Qatari ruling family, the Paris Saint-Germain football club could certainly sign Neymar with cash and include him in other star-studded squads.
Clubs can spend a lot of money on players, but they have to use legitimate sources of income to make up for the huge sums they spend to make a profit-and-loss balance in their football-related business.
The Financial Fair Competition Rules were conceived by Michel Platini after he was elected president of UEFA in 2007.
The former French player believes that for clubs that are heavily indebted in pursuit of success, if banks or owners withdraw support money, they are in fact cheating and putting the club at risk of destruction.
In 2011, the focus of the Rules shifted from club debt issues to club loss status monitoring.
The change means the business model used by Roman Abramovich when he bought the Chelsea club in 2003, buying a club with potential and then spending huge sums to improve the team and build a global brand, now face a more demanding situation.
The club could lose £30m in the three-year Rules assessment period up to 2018.
Although Abu was devalued by the then-chairman in 2015, UEFA's successor, Aleksander Ceferin, remains committed to stopping excessive spending.
"Of course the Rules have not lapsed, and we will certainly strengthen the regulations of the future," Andrea Traverso of UEFA, who is responsible for matters related to the Rules, told The Associated Press last week.
While the Paris Saint-Germain football club will pay off Neymar's buyout clause on a one-off basis, it can also allocate the amount for accounting purposes within the duration of the contract.
Neymar has signed a five-year deal so the transfer fee is likely to show a fee of £44.4million in the annual accounts for the next five years.
The first wave of Rules sanctions imposed in 2014 put the Paris Saint-Germain football club, as well as Abu Dhabi's Manchester City club, under the heaviest sanctions.
Paris Saint-Germain Football Club was fined 60 million euros ($82 million at the then exchange rate), later reduced to 20 million euros, and demanded that the team be reduced to 21 players in the 2014-15 Champions League instead of normal 25 name of player.
UEFA is eyeing clubs that are trying to raise revenue by tying up with club owners and cheating on financial regulators.
While Qatari companies can sponsor the Paris Saint-Germain Football Club, UEFA will not see it as a legitimate income if the sponsorship amount is deemed to exceed the standard market price.
It was something that happened in 2014, when UEFA ruled that the amount of money the Qatar Tourism Authority had sponsored the Paris Saint-Germain Football Club had been overstated.
Part of Neymar's income at Paris Saint-Germain Football Club could come from payments made by the 2022 Qatar World Cup organizing committee, according to reports.
But both the Paris Saint-Germain Football Club and the organizing committee denied that Neymar would be a World Cup ambassador, and it would be easy for UEFA regulators to make such a move.
The recent sanctions imposed on the Paris Saint-Germain football club mean UEFA will be more wary of any attempt to circumvent the rules.
UEFA did not have pre-discussions with Paris Saint-Germain Football Club about Neymar's move, people familiar with the matter said on Thursday.
All were in contact with the Associated Press only in an unnamed capacity, as they were not authorized to discuss the status of the Paris Saint-Germain football club.
Accounts released last time showed Paris Saint-Germain Football Club operating revenue of £542.4 million in 2015-16, making a profit of more than £10 million.
The accounts for the previous fiscal year have not been released.
Paris Saint-Germain Football Club expects Neymar's arrival to be a boon for sponsorship events, franchises and jersey sales.
The club expects to increase revenue by at least 30 per cent after signing Nemar.
It is clear that seeing one of the most famous players leave, the Spanish league is deeply angry, trying to obstruct Neymar's move and claiming that the Paris Saint-Germain football club is in breach of the Rules.
Xavier Tebas, president of La Liga, told Spanish newspaper AS that "this is a clear example of a 'financial stimulant', with clubs and countries alike," referring to Qatar, which has ultimate ownership of the Paris Saint-Germain football club.
Arsene Wenger, head coach of the Arsenal team (whose owners are American sports tycoons), has reservations about the state-funded club's attitude with the La Liga league.
"This is the consequence of ownership, which has radically changed the whole ecology of football over the past 15 years," Wenger said on Thursday.
"Once the country has a club, then anything will happen.
This will make it very difficult to comply with the Rules, because there are many different ways or interests for a country to require big-name players to represent a country.

From the Chinese traditional culture of the Han Dynasty Huainan Wang Liu An's story, the "Liu An made tofu, because of the mistake" of the traditional allusions, told the protagonist "bean fu" from a bean phantom becomes human form, overcome many difficulties, adhere to the story of the fairy dream. This germinate animation film and Hubei local culture origin is very deep.
Wuyangshan in Hubei Province is one of the world's cultural relics published by the United Nations. It is also the birthplace of Taoism culture and Wudang Wushu. It is called "the first mountain."
The director, Zou Kuo, revealed that before the film's creation, he had travelled with the main team to Wudang Mountain to gather wind.
The story, he said, took place during the period of the West Han Emperor, and in the background of Liu Anan, the hero of the film, "Bei Fu," was a man who had become an accident while Liu Andan shaped beans.
Besides Wudang Mountain, which is the birthplace of Taoist culture, Hubei also has a deep origin with China's long-standing traditional instrument, the clocks.

Nostalgic contagion hits the market - The Hare Summer Camp and Detective Twins
Retelling the story in memory of the actors' 80s beauty years and the '90s garbage age (before and after David Wayne and Michael Chewert's sketch comedy The Nation for MTV); and nostalgia for itself, miss 2001; the year before, a host of stars such as Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Luther have yet to emerge.
As a cultural work of art, it is the imitation and embodiment of the permanent memories of our Facebook age.
But as a series, it feels like time is not enough.
There was a backlash after Camp One aired, but it was not just because of its grotesque humor (the play was an original story about a canned vegetable that would speak, voiced by H Jon Benjamin).
Doubling the use of core chuckles - middle-aged actors playing children at the age of mischief - makes it a funny part to not be able to get back to the past.
Ten years later, when adults actually play adults, the mood is not too deep-rooted and the imitation is more diffuse, including improvisation of the 90s stalking movies, such as The Hand of the Driving Cradle.
At some point, a character is trapped in an Apple notebook, some straight-line skates, and "some other 1991 stuff."
Many of the core stories are the same.
Mr. Sweetie (repair Mr. Watt) has now become a novelist, but he still hasn't forgotten Katie (Margaret Morrow ornament).
Victor (Ken Mariano) still holds a man's body.
The show also has another sinister plot involving Ronald Reagan (also played by Mr. Thawat), instigated by George H.W. Bush (Michael Ian Black adorned, impressive).
As always, the best part of this series is interjecting.
It was especially interesting to see the ever-young Mr. Luther, who flaunted Matt Dillon's soul patch in the film "The Single Lords," before Andy in "The Campus Giant" now feels like a giant.
It was a moment of random madness that might provide the impetus for the film, like the recursive "Seven Years of Life" series, until I came to the logical conclusion that "Ha Camp: Twenty years later," its final act was to make the card the department went to see the movie premiere of "The Ha Summer Camp."
Meanwhile, Amazon's Detective Twin complained of different nostalgic content: The Cold War renaissance's American Spy Dream, the film "The City of the Far Cold," and even the East-West wrestling image of GLOW: Gorgeous Women's Union....
The comedy, created by Bryan Gedwood and Alexandro Tanaka, was pushed onto the television screen by director Rhys Thomas: A difficult-brother comedy set in the 1980s in Romania, about two Bucharest officials for truth a story of the struggle of atheism and Marxist-Leninism.
The main characters - hard Grigor and idealistic Etherf - are played by Little Florin Pierce and Korneu Ulrich, respectively, whose dialogue is played by Channing Tatum (also executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt in English.
It was a brilliant idea.
But it's not just an idea.
There are some good visual gimmicks (the police spend time playing chess on TV, because Americans like to play football).
And there are a number of celebrity soundtrack actors - including Jennie Slatte, Nick Overman, Mach Sarah Hashbaz Ali and Colo Sevigny - who have forged a wonderful sound show.
But Detective Twin is so committed to creating a noisy and realistic propaganda comedy - the show has a killer wearing a Reagan mask - and it usually plays such a role.
This six-episode long TV is a bit of a drag, and the comic effect is not released fast or frequently enough.
The editor-in-chief of Detective Twin was more rigorous, presenting a better fomenting irony when Guergor and Etherf repeatedly visited the US embassy, where there were always two fat men swallowing a pile of burgers.
For the imagined communist audience, the message means that Western culture can turn anything into material to rave.

Reporters recently learned that the north-east region steel, rail traffic, ships, machinery manufacturing industry benefits generally decline, even a loss.
Some experts believe that under the current situation, the new revitalization of northeast industry will not only affect the national economic recovery, but also the long-term development of China's manufacturing industry and international competitiveness, so it is urgent to adjust the transformation.
The main performance of the northeast industry in the current economic downturn is the serious decline and even loss in the manufacturing efficiency of the raw materials industry and heavy machinery equipment in the traditional industry.
In the past in the economic downturn, mainly low-end, primary products are hit by the big characteristics, but this economic fluctuation, the northeast traditional industrial high-end, low-end industrial products are affected.
In recent years, Angang Group has focused on the development of high-end panels such as container boards, rail tracks, ship boards and civil appliances. However, sales of these varieties have fallen sharply this year, especially on board sales were down 50 percent year-on-year.
"Metallurgy is the third-largest pillar industry in Liaoning, with 60 million tons of steel production per year ranked third in the country," said Hao Qingshun, director of metallurgy at Liaoning Province.

Japan's Olympic Committee recently said the Japanese delegation had a gold medal target of 30 at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics and advanced to the top three in the gold medal table.
In October last year, the head of the Japanese Olympic Committee's sports committee, Yasuo Yamaguchi, said he expected Japanese athletes to win 2.5 times more gold medals at the Tokyo Olympics than at the Rio Olympics.

The conference materials were a little thinner than before, and a few pieces of paper summed up the theme and agenda of the meeting.
"Saving for the people, when frugality must be frugal. Returning to the present simple, real meeting environment, we understand and welcome," said Wang Cheng, the representative of Guangan City, efficient and pragmatic. The meetings of the Doctrine are the ones they are willing to see and participate in.

Bank of England will maintain interest rate of 0.25%
The Bank of England will announce at a later date that interest rates will remain unchanged, after weak economic growth and loose inflation have dashed upward hopes.
The Bank of England has warned that growth will continue to be "weak" as it controls interest rates while tightening household incomes.
Policymakers at the bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted 6-2 to maintain a 0.25 per cent rate, while a handful of members this month called for higher interest rates, even as weak economic growth has weakened the upward boost.
In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank of England narrowed its growth forecasts for 2017 and 2018 to 1.7 per cent and 1.6 per cent, respectively, and issued warnings that household income tightening would continue, while inflation would soar to nearly 3 per cent in the fall.
But it said it would need to raise interest rates over the next few years to curb inflation from Brexit, while borrowing costs could need to be raised more sharply as expected in financial markets.
Large-scale economic promotion policies were implemented a year ago under the influence of Brexit, and members also voted to withdraw them.
The Bank of England will announce a halt to its regular funding plan, which will provide cheap money to banks from February next year, although the bank says it now needs an additional £15bn on a £115bn basis under the plan.
In the minutes of the interest rate decision, the Bank of England said: "In the MPC's core forecast, gross domestic product (GDP) remains weak in the near term as the squeeze on household real incomes will continue to suppress consumption.
With regard to interest rates, the bank has repeatedly reiterated the need for "some monetary policy tightening" to suppress inflation, and for a "greater degree" than the market expects.
The market is now expected to grow for the first time in the third quarter of next year and for the second time in 2020.
But the bank stressed that any increase would be "slow" and "restrained."
The bank's growth forecasts for this year and next are on a downward trend, compared with forecasts of 1.9 per cent and 1.7 per cent in May.
The bank maintains its forecast for growth of 1.8 per cent in 2018.
The pound fell against the dollar and the euro followed.
The pound fell 0.5 per cent to 1.31 against the dollar and 0.4 per cent to 1.11 against the euro.
The unchanged decision comes after rising expectations were dashed by recent unpromising growth figures, with GDP rising to 0.3 per cent in the second quarter, compared to just 0.2 per cent in the first three months.
The bank said growth in the third quarter could remain at 0.3 percent, although it would rise slightly at the end of the year.
Ordinary households have been hit by a surge in inflation, while wage growth has been negligible, and the Bank of England's recent inflation report has not pleased them, as the bank says austerity will get worse before it gets better,
It said monetary policy "cannot prevent" the blow to revenues over the next few years, but wages are expected to recover "on a large scale" at the end of the three-year forecast.
At the same time, as the pound depreciates and demand for British goods grows sharply, the economy will be stimulated to offset some of the effects of low consumption.
The decision-making comes a year after the shocking EU referendum sent the pound plummeting, with interest rates cut to 0.25 per cent in August.
The Bank of England estimates it could take four years for it to have a full impact on prices and the UK economy.
Before the bank published its latest rate ruling, calls for an increase in interest rates fell on deaf ears as inflation added to the already-stressed average household, while three policymakers called for an increase in interest rates to 0.5 per cent in July.
Inflation retreated to 2.6 per cent last month from 2.9 per cent in June, although the Bank of England said it was in the forecast and would rise again in the coming months.
The bank said the excess was already "completely the bottom line" for the weak pound relative to its 2 per cent target.
Andrew Monterrey, director of Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: "Given the recent fall in swap rates, the mortgage market looks set to become more competitive again, as lenders strongly call for more business and look forward to a positive stance mark the perfect end for this year.
For those who may be close to ending an existing deal, such a market looks particularly advantageous, as remortgaging (many can be fee-free and interest rates are low) is becoming increasingly popular.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The NHS has given the green light to controversial HIV drugs
Patients will be able to get "transformative" HIV prevention treatment from September, after the High Court has settled on NHS drug funding.
NHS England has announced that pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), a drug that can be taken before sex, has been shown to reduce the risk of infection in at-risk populations by about 86 per cent. The drug was provided to an estimated 10,000 people.
It agreed to fund the trial after the Court of Appeal upheld the High Court ruling last year, which said the NHS was entitled to pay for PrEP despite claims that local authorities should fund the drug.
The move, announced on Thursday, was called a "significant new intervention" by NHS chief executive Simon Stevens, while the National AIDS Trust (NAT) described it as a "critical moment."
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will become the first sexual health clinics to be registered. More clinics will be added in October, followed by full implementation across England in April 2018.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is an HIV drug that is taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
Trials have shown that PrEP can significantly reduce HIV transmission among people at risk of infection.
Taking PrEP before sex means there are enough specific drugs in the body to prevent HIV infection.
The drug can be taken every day or two hours before intercourse.
Those eligible for treatment include gay, bisexual men, transgender people, and HIV-positive people who have not been successfully treated.
The clinic will identify eligible participants who agree to the test, including men, women, transgender people and those whose partner HIV status is unknown for antiretroviral treatment.
People who live in England and register as a general practitioner can also sign up at their local sexual health clinic.
The scheme will cost £10m, while the NHS England branch signed a contract to procure the drugs this week after international competitive procurement.
The trial aims to assess the full potential of PrEP by gathering clinical evidence on how it is positioned, absorbed and implemented on a large sample basis.
Mr Stevens said: "This major new intervention should serve as a broad and increasingly successful complement and reinforcement to HIV prevention."
This is yet another milestone in more than 30 years of action worthy of progress in addressing the major health challenges of humanity. "
"This is a critical moment in the fight against AIDS," said Deborah King, chief executive of the British AIDS Trust (NAT).
If it does target people in need and at risk, pre-exposure prophylaxis offers the potential to change the UK's epidemic.
Starting in September, people at high risk of HIV will have access to an approved new tool through an NHS-funded trial in England that can be truly implemented on its own and without consultation with sexual partners, which will live for many people bringing improvements.
We are both in favour of this announcement.
Ian Green, chief executive of the Terrence Higgins Trust, said: "The priority now is to ensure that trials are quickly pushed back across the country and that none of the people living with HIV can fall.
Now that we have purchased the PrEP trial drug, we are ready to protect more than 10,000 people at high risk of HIV. "
Sharon Hodgson, the shadow public health minister, claimed: "After months of delays and government procrastination, the start of the PrEP trial is popular and should come sooner.
The evidence shows how the drug can bring about change as part of our approach to preventing HIV and ending the spread of this deadly infectious disease.
This trial will allow us to go further and fully understand the advantages of PrEP.
It is now important that the experiment be rolled out nationwide as soon as possible in order to protect people exposed to HIV and help us to further end the spread of HIV in society. "

High-quality life: Use the attic and ingenious design to make the Earl's Palace small apartment a spacious home
Joanne Ray, a former banker, was keen to renovate the house, and in 2014 she moved from her large house in Knightsbridge to the Earl's Palace small apartment.
The apartment is on the ground floor of an elegant Queen Anne-style terrace - Joanne didn't pack up and sell it, which is a strong testament to the new design.
"Before that, my ex and I lived in a bigger house in Knightsbridge," says Joanne.
"I was looking for a house suitable for the offer.
I saw this apartment at the Earl's Palace, and its ceiling was very high.
I am very pleased to make an offer on the same day.
Since seeing the house for the first time, the 1,000-square-foot apartment has now completed a thorough overhaul.
The apartment was originally a complex one-room layout - needed to cross the kitchen to walk to the bedroom - and Joanne wanted to add storage space and loft at the time to make the most of the ample ceiling height.
"I want a high ceiling, big windows, plenty of light.
That's my request, "she said.
To that end, she hired Elfan Azadi from Duck and Shed Architecture and Design Studio (in Notting Hill) to use the 12.5-foot ceiling to craft a home that was not just a development project, but Joanne where to live.
The height of the ceiling is not enough to add two up and down spaces, so the architectural challenge is to create a loft that is high enough for people to stand.
Elfan must play creative thinking so that the problem can be solved.
"The steel structure is quite complex," he explained.
"We must arrange the space for it to be displayed up and down, and do not need to shrug the bow.
Not only is it so simple to build a simple platform, but also to start the steel so that it is at the right height to function. "
Through this arrangement, Elfan was able to get two full-body high rooms in the space - which can add many interesting elements.
The attic uses the Retrovius brand's retro copper windows, overlooking the glamorous living area.
Gold furniture with mirrors, small silver pieces of furniture and Serge Mouille retro lighting laid the overall style.
The use of mirrors plays an important role in increasing the atmosphere, space and light.
Putting mirrors on both ends of the short corridor can make it look longer.
In the kitchen, the splash-proof panels fitted with mirrors are like windows leading to another room.
In the basement, the small lattice with a mirror provides Joanne with storage space for the storage of cutlery and glassware.
The beautiful living room has a fascinating sense of space and is able to collect the kitchen when it is not in use.
The folding kitchen is not new.
But the unique thing about this folding kitchen is a garage-style lift-down door.
"There is some engineering knowledge involved here," Elfan explained to the reinforced surface of the MDF door.
"This uses the principle of balance, so when you push the door, it's easy to slide."
Thanks to the ingenious use of space and storage, Joanne gained an extra 16 square metres, an extra bedroom and an improved layout.
"In the end, what you sell is the size of your house -- or your property valuation is based on the size of the house," Elfan said.
"Basically, the real estate agent would walk into the room and make calculations based on the floor size," the statement said.
They will try to increase the space and use quality materials at the same time, thus bringing a sense of luxury to the space.
"The material is your choice, so it helps to create emotional bonds at home," Mr Elfan said.
"You won't fall in love with the power on the wall.
These things are important, but they don't strike a chord with you. "
It turns out that by being well designed and adding extra space, standard apartments can shake up and become amazing to you.
In fact, you might, like Joanne, choose to live.

Two brothers stage $500 million real estate empire fight
Forty years after its Italian family founded the dynasty, the two brothers fought for one of Victoria's largest real estate empires worth more than $500 million.
Colin De Lutis, a former Carlton Football Club director and developer, lives in a mansion in the Tucala district, and the distance between the three doors is where his brother Paul lives. The division of real estate and business assets took him to the Supreme Court.
Paul has been hoping to break away from the family business since 2014, but the two brothers have had a heated argument in the Supreme Court over the division of the assets.
The brothers and their mother owned a total of 38 real estate worth more than $500 million, which had been accumulating since the family bought Smith Street, Collingwood District, in 1973.
There, the family founded Westco Jeans and gradually grew it to the size of 160 retail chains.
In 1999, the company sold for $85 million.
After that, the money was put into real estate and, for now, the De Routis family's portfolio includes city office buildings, Brunswick and Sorento development projects, Gold Coast and Bule Hill apartments, and suburban shopping centres.
Under an agreement with his late father, Colin, known by his brother Paul as the "main mover and dominant character" of the De Routis family, has about two-thirds of the company's assets, while Paul accounts for about a third.
Documents filed with the court said the converted property owned by Colin was worth $316 million, while the property owned by Paul was worth $176 million.
Paul came to believe that the division of real estate and cash proved to be the crux of the talks.
"The property division proposal put forward by Colin left him what I thought was the best property," he wrote in an initial court affidavit in 2015.
On Friday, the Supreme Court held its first hearing after several mediation failures.
Now, the two brothers are still fighting for control of the existing business, and Paul says Colin has kicked him out.
And Colin denied it and accused Paul of poor management of certain real estate properties.
In an earlier affidavit submitted by Colin, he expressed a desire to resolve the dispute.
"My Italian tradition determines that family is the most important option. My Italian ancestry determines that family is the most important," he wrote.
The cost of the case continues to climb, and there are hundreds of pages of affidavit, email, and top law firms such as Deloitte, Pitcher Partners, Charter Keck Cramer, Allan Myers, QC, and company reports from senior lawyers hired by both parties.
Ms. de Routis and her late husband Luigi, both Italian immigrants, started running popular food and deli stores in the late 1950s and bought a shop in Brunswick in the early 1970s.
They used collateral to buy the Collingwood property, where Colin opened the family's first jeans shop.
"I read High Three," said Colin, who founded Westco there, "and at the time, Paul was very small (about 10 years old)."
Anna de Routis said she and Luigi, who died in 2012, wanted to be able to pass on the property peacefully to their son
"Luigi used to say to me that he would never want the brothers to end up in court," she wrote.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke are no longer members of De Routis Group, and Colin said Mark paid him $10 million when he left the company and $26 million to Luke.
Paul said both Luke and Mark were "dissatisfied with the terms of their property division."
According to TV star Eddie McGuire to a biography published in 2015, Colin has kept a low profile despite being a board member of the former AFL club.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul on Friday, as well as their lawyers.
But only Colin replied by text message, he said, because the case had been referred to the court "I really can't say too much."
"It is very, very sad that my brother Paul chose to sue me and bring our family affairs to court," he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote in a court filing that he had tried to meet the demands of his brother.
"Our father doesn't want to see Paul and I end up in a dispute like this at the moment," he said, adding that he "remains hopeful about the settlement of the dispute."
On Friday, that hope seemed dashed.
"Our problems will be resolved through the courts in the near future," Colin wrote.

Trump's new chief of staff plans to limit the president's media time
Others have tried, but all ended in failure.
John F. Kelly might really be able to do it.
If it does, then he is the first person.
The new White House chief of staff plans to limit the flow of information to President Trump - including news media reports - with a view to ensuring greater stability for big bosses, according to Politico, the US political news website.
Here is a passage from journalist Josh Dawsey:
When the new White House chief of staff, John F. Kelly, began his first day of work to gather with senior officials, he pointed out that he wanted to address one of President Trump's main problems in the White House: Bad information going to the president.
Kelly told the officials that receiving good information would help the president make better decisions, so the information would need to go through his hands - both in writing and in the form of a briefing.
Kelly's diagnosis seems like a pattern, but others have also tried to tame Trump by monitoring his media time, but all ended in failure.
President Trump has a long history of TV addiction - and now in the White House, his habit of watching TV is still deepening.
In February, former campaign adviser Sam Nagberg told Politico: "If candidate Trump is frustrated with unfair reporting, it would be helpful to let him know that he has also received positive coverage in credible channels."
Tara Palmeri of Politico wrote at the time that "based on the experience of six former campaign officials, the focus of the habit of controlling Trump's tweets is to ensure that the media messages he personally receives always contain some praise."
That's no problem at all.
But the idea that Trump's Twitter habit was once "controlled" is laughable.
Maybe these campaign officials know something we don't know - that Trump's tweets would have been even more fiery had it not been for their intervention.
We may never know those tweets that Trump did not send.
If his staff were able to save him from the fire, even if only a few times, their efforts were worth it.
But no one has been able to keep Trump from being controversial.
Part of the problem is that in a White House made up of competing groups, people promote their worldview by handing over potentially reliable and potentially unreliable information to Trump, with florals pushing their cause.
Politico - all about the story - reported in May on the advisers "penchant for strategically providing suspicious information to the president.
This is an example described by journalist Shane Goodmancher:
"Current and former Trump officials say Trump's reaction to negative news episodes, such as volcanic eruptions, especially those with damaging information leaks, will be frantically trying to figure out where it comes from.
At the end of February, someone viciously copied an article on Internet agitator Charles C. Johnson's website, GotNews.com, to the President, accusing Deputy Chief of Staff Katie Walsh of being the White House's "source of massive information leaks." Trump was that way at the time.
Even if Johnson had been permanently blocked by Twitter for harassment, no concrete evidence had been provided, and he had blown up a great deal of false quality control, which he later blatantly denied.
Trump read the article and then began asking officials about Walsh.
Goodman added that then-chief of staff Reince Priebus and White House secretary Rob Porter "tried to build a system to manage and record the documents that Trump received."
And the result?
Kelly intends to do the same thing, after three months.
Maybe he can prove himself to be a more efficient manager than Priebus, but Trump is still that impulsive Trump, and his aides are still competing for influence.
These timeless influencing factors can make Kelly's task even more difficult.
Tourist Fantasy Town: How the wind gets drunk
[Abstract] The potential of the small town of Zhejiang was gradually awakened.
Today, these small towns will be an important destination for tourists to visit Zhejiang, Zhejiang, Zhejiang and Zhejiang. They will also provide an important contribution to our province's efforts to create the "Poetry Zhejiang" China's most beautiful tourist destination.

As a priority area in the "13th Five-Year" period of rural tourism, the scenic spot will eventually be built at 3A level and above. It will be a new model of tourism product diversity, tourism benefit and industry integration.

Cabins negotiate ditches and return to "Rich Street"
Some of the richest owners in the West Midlands are once again at loggerheads with determined housebuilders, who negotiate a government-dug ditch for the return of land outside the mansion.
The occupants of the van parked their 20 trailers in an open area outside the bustling Solihull Street, which has been dubbed "Rich Street."
The occupants, who were holding horses, carrying babies and leading the caravan, returned again after being driven away in May, and the city department's dug-out moat did not stop them from entering.
The sleek and sophisticated team found a gap in the defensive line, and although there were some roads where no roadblocks were set for passage, their vehicles squeezed through the gap.
Angry residents have taken a swipe at the Solihull Council, calling it "very poor" in dealing with the issue.
One resident, who did not want to be named, said: 'They arrived there on Monday night, before coming to Bingley Heath Street and throwing stones at passers-by.
The council should be ashamed of their actions because they are simply useless in dealing with issues.
The occupants came here in May and were then driven away, and now they are back.
It came quite a bit last night, and it could be more today.
She added: "Birmingham City Council knows how to deal with it by imposing a long-term ban to protect its parks."
I live on Streetsbrook Road, and I would not be willing to continue paying council tax if the council could not stop such a thing.
One local resident, who asked not to be named, said: "This is ridiculous, we have just seen the last batch of occupants go, just to facilitate another batch to destroy."
The number has increased again this time, and some have even seen horses grazing on the park lawn.
A Solihull Council spokeswoman said: "We are aware of unauthorized camping in an open area on Sbeatbrook Road and we are now working with Solihull police and taking the necessary legal action to remove them as soon as possible.
To support us in gathering evidence, it is important to ask as many local residents as possible to report any anti-social or criminal behaviour to the police by calling 101.
This helps us to present an overview of the situation to the Court for its examination. "

Italy gets tough on NGO migrant rescue boats
Italy has issued a warning to non-governmental organizations operating migrant rescue boats in the Mediterranean that they will not be allowed to continue to carry out rescues if they do not sign new operational management norms.
"If NGOs don't sign new codes of conduct, it's hard to see what they're going to do," Interior Minister Marco Minniti told the Turin Daily News.
The day before Minniti's warning, Italian officials seized the German aid group's boat crew on suspicion of actually colluding with traffickers to assist illegal immigrants.
The aid group, which operates for only a year, declined to comment on the subject of specific allegations by Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Caltocio.
"For us, saving lives is and will be the most important thing, so we regret not being able to operate in the search-and-rescue zone at this time," the group said in a social media statement.
"After collecting all the information, we can only assess all the allegations and the situation at this time."
Italian officials have been monitoring the ship Iuventa, a youth rescue group, since October.
Its crew were suspected of carrying migrants who were transported directly from small boats by traffickers, and allowed smugglers to flee in haste and re-use the ship.
At least one such meeting allegedly took place at sea 1.3 miles off the coast of Libya, according to prosecutors' documents, which were published by the Italian media.
Its crew is suspected of blatantly ignoring the authority of the Italian Coast Guard, which oversees rescue operations in the area out of humanitarian fervour rather than any other motive.
According to the code of conduct, vessels such as Iuventa clearly require an Italian police officer on board to oversee their activities.
Currently, only three of the nine non-governmental organizations involved in the search and rescue operation have agreed to comply with the code of conduct, namely Save the Children, the Immigration Maritime Aid Station based in Malhim and the Pro-Activa Open Arms in Spain.
The latter said on Thursday that it believed the new rules, while unnecessary, were acceptable because they would not bring any "significant change and obstruction" to its rescue operations.
Among the organizations that refused to sign was the Nobel Prize-winning organization Doctors Without Borders (MSF).
Meanwhile, Minniti says the number of migrants arriving in Italy has plummeted in recent weeks, suggesting that efforts to strengthen the Libyan coast guard and unite local mayors are beginning to bear fruit.
"In recent days we have begun to see the light at the end of the tunnel," the minister said.
He unveiled plans for this month's in-depth talks: Discussions with Libyan mayors on economic development activities and discussions with Chad, Niger and Mali on how to reduce the number of migrants who want to leave these countries for Europe.
Len Ping, chief financial scientist at the Bank of Communications, said growth in industrial value added was expected to accelerate to 6.6 percent in December because of the end-of-season upturn in industrial value added in the first three quarters of 2017.
Fixed asset investment is expected to grow at a cumulative rate of 7.2 per cent in December, the same rate as last month, down from last year.
Industrial production, though weaker than in October, is roughly the same as in November.
In December, China's manufacturing investment was running low, but there was a slight improvement in infrastructure investment, so it is expected that fixed asset investment will be flat in November.

Beijing "Colleges and Universities Dissolution" New Initiative: Thousands of teachers and students from Northern Chemical Industry will be admitted to Changping New School District
The opening ceremony of the new campus of Peking Chemical University was held in Changping District of Beijing on Tuesday. The 1,800-acre green campus was put into use.

The new campus of North Chemical Industry is located in Changping Nankou Town, which covers 1,800 acres and is 40 kilometers from the city, and is one of the key projects in Beijing to solve the non-capital functions.
The construction of the new campus has been completed in three phases, and the second phase is expected to be fully launched by the end of this year. It will meet the needs of nearly 20,000 undergraduates, graduate students and staff for study and life.

Michelle Carter has been sentenced for texting Conrad Roy to commit suicide.
A Massachusetts woman has been sentenced to two-and-a-half years for encouraging her boyfriend to commit suicide via text messages and phone calls.
Michelle Carter, 20, will serve a 15-month sentence, which can be converted to a suspended sentence. Plus a five-year suspended sentence.
Carter was sentenced in June to one count of wilful non-premeditated homicide against Conrad Roy, who committed suicide on July 13, 2014.
Roy's father said at the hearing on Thursday: "My family is devastated."
My son is my best friend.
While awaiting appeal, Carter was allowed to keep his personal liberty.
She faces a maximum of 20 years in prison, but her group of lawyers believe she and Mr Roy are both mentally ill.
At the sentencing, Carter stood, wearing red trousers and a beige blouse, his hands clasped, his eyes tearful, his eyes down.
"Her actions killed Conrad Roy," the prosecutor told the court.
"She ended his life in order to live better for herself.
She did not take responsibility, "said the prosecutor.
"She has no remorse."
But Carter's lawyer said it was "a terrible consequence, and she felt very regretful."
However, Judge Lawrence Moniz said he did not find that her "age or maturity, or even her mental illness, would have any significant impact on her behaviour."
A prosecutor read a statement from Roy's mother, Lynn Roy, saying, "I don't have a day not to grieve for the loss of my beloved son."
"I want him to be proud of me and what I have done, and I am trying to stand with his sisters in all my pain that will accompany us forever," the statement said.
Mr Roy's sister, Camdyn Roy, testified that she was "in a state of mind" because she realised she would never be able to attend her brother's wedding or become an aunt to his children.
"It is a pain to lose someone who has been with me since I was born, and the rest of my life will be with that pain," she said.
The case appears to set a legal precedent, as Massachusetts law does not make it a crime to encourage others to commit suicide.
In 2014, Roy was found dead from carbon monoxide poisoning in his car; this year, Carter was 17.
Carter's text message revealed she encouraged him to commit suicide after the case sparked national attention.
"There are many ways to hang up, jump, stab yourself," she said in several text messages sent two weeks before his death; he was on holiday with his family.
During the time before his suicide, she wrote: 'You need to do this, Conrad, all you have to do is start the generator and then get free and happy.
Judge Moniz said Carter drew attention through Mr Roy's death and ordered her not to profit from the case through any media.
There are legal differences of opinion in this case.
One of the few to defend Carter is Amanda Knox, who was acquitted two years later after being accused of murdering her British roommate in Italy in 2007.
"Michelle Carter deserves sympathy and help, not imprisonment," Ms. Knox, 30, said in a column published by the Los Angeles Times.
Zhang Yimou is destined to be a controversial film artist, and since he began filming the first film, "Red sorghum," he has been leading the Chinese film trend while also reaping a lot of criticism.

Car makers face shock, Audi will retrofit as many as 850,000 diesel cars
The day before Audi announced the conversion, BMW said it would provide software upgrades for more than 350,000 vehicles.
BMW believes that "driving has more intelligent options than restrictions," meaning that major European cities - including Munich, where BMW is based - consider banning or restricting diesel vehicles, the BMW chairman said.
Daimler announced Tuesday that it would retrofit Europe's 3 million Mercedes cars to reduce its diesel emissions.
None of the companies claimed the move as a recall.
European carmakers have aggressively promoted the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to help meet CO2 emissions regulations.
But nitrogen oxides emitted by diesel engines are thought to be carcinogens and can lead to asthma.
The cost of car companies installing equipment to offset exhaust emissions from diesel cars is also increasing, making it difficult to keep diesel cars competitive on price.
As German carmakers face scrutiny, the government led by Chancellor Angela Merkel has also been accused of being too laissez-faire for these powerful car companies and ignoring signs of the problem.
These car companies are trying to avoid repeating the popular rut of covering up their use of so-called failed devices, adjusting emissions to comply with regulations when testing cars and returning to normal driving conditions.
Multiple Volkswagen executives have been charged in the United States, while others are under investigation by countries on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former head of thermodynamics at the Audi engine development department was arrested in Germany.
Former manager Zachelo Giovanni Palmio, who is Italian, is therefore not protected from extradition and could face trial in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi was embroiled in a German criminal investigation involving Volkswagen, with the German government accusing the Audi of installing systems to evade European emissions requirements, widening the scope of an investigation previously limited to the US.
Audi being investigated could have a major impact on the masses: Luxury car makers account for a disproportionate share of Volkswagen's profits.
A film from preparation to release, for a year or two or even a few years, is commonplace.

"Big Fish Hai Tong" tells a fantasy story that belongs to the Chinese people. With the release of the trailer, it brings new expectations to all audiences.
"These 12 years have only done this one thing, and now it's gone from a dream to a reality, I'm both nervous and excited," Liang said.
Zhang Chun said: "Always think about using one-fifth of the budget of others, make the same picture effect as others, the team is going to be driven mad by me."
Dongguan, a "world factory" that once relied on processing and mass production, is setting its sights on high-level talent who can lead the city to reposition itself.

Provence lavender threatened by climate change
Lavender has become a symbol of the city of Provence in southern France, but now there is bad news that it is under threat from climate change.
Lavender is decaying due to persistent drought and the presence of insects carrying the virus, leaving scientists and farmers who are trying to find a solution with a headache.
Eric Chaisse, an expert at the Agricultural Research Institute (CRIEPAM) in Provence, said: "The lavender in Provence is facing a huge threat because the plant has been subject to climate change in recent years. The impact of the spring rainfall has been significantly reduced, while the fall has been rainy.
This can affect the life cycle of lavender.
There is also an individual, smaller cicada, a leaf cicada that can spread tiny bacteria, and in very dry weather, they will appear in large numbers.
The key is its huge number.
The elegant lavender farm, in addition to being able to attract holidaymakers, lavender oil is also sought after by the perfume and cosmetics industry.
Eric Chase said: "Contrary to plants that can open many large flowers and have long grain spikes, we have problems with smaller individuals, stunted, missing, or weak."
So we have less essential oil. "
Solutions being studied include better irrigation techniques and reduced evaporation of soil moisture, the spraying of protective mixtures of clay and water on plants, and the development of more drought-tolerant varieties.
Compared with the sci-fi elements of the film, the two stars are more attracted to the story in the film.
On the afternoon of September 5, Huaxi Metropolis News reporters, in a series of interviews with a number of high-profile people in the vocal world, as well as two phase-in performance artists, surprisingly, remained almost silent.
One is the Berlin film emperor, one is a rising youth actor, "psychological crime" is also Liao fan and Li Yi Feng's first partner.
Mexico is dangerous and journalists are killed
All employees of the weekly newspaper Riodoce usually gather on Wednesday to review their plans for coverage of the unrest in Sinaloa state, caused by criminal organizations, corrupt officials and an endless war on drugs.
But today, the shadow of tragedy hangs over themselves, and they come together to discuss security.
They were told to change their daily habits, which is important.
Two senior journalists discussed what was more secure: Whether it was time to bring their children to the office (the office had been hit by a grenade in 2009) or to leave them at home.
Security experts wrote three words on the blackboard in front of the room: Enemies, neutrals and allies.
They asked these reporters to name under each column - without the need for evidence, observation and intuition would suffice.
There are suspected drug dealers, politicians, businessmen and journalists on the government list, or cartels, which make Mexico's reporting dangerous.
Violence never ceases, and there are more and more journalists across the country: At least 25 journalists have died since President Enrique Panya Nieto took office in December 2012, according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists; 589 journalists are under federal protection after attacks and threats; at least seven have died in seven states so far this year.
The last one to die was their source of editing and inspiration, as well as Javier Valdez Cardenas, co-founder of Riodoce.
Valdez, who has written many books about drug violence, wrote in one of them: "The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist.
Everyone was able to feel deeply that he had left, though he was everywhere - a huge picture hanging on the facade of the Riodoce office building, with Valdez standing on the middle finger, with the words "Justice"; the T-shirt worn by two journalists in their 30s, Riam Ramirez, also showed his smile, wearing glasses or his signature Panama straw hat.
The seminar took place less than two months after his death; journalists rushed to discuss their shared trauma, nightmares, insomnia and paranoid disorder.
Although a special federal prosecutor's office was set up in 2010 to handle the case of journalists, it prosecuted only two people, according to the records of the Committee for the Protection of Journalists.
Most of the thousands of crimes each year involve drug trafficking and organized crime, so the perpetrators of the killings of journalists are rarely brought to justice.
In "Riodoce," they insisted on covering the violence in Sinaloa state, although they were already heartbroken, though the land was in tatters.
'There's no killer information, no justice, 'Mr. Iwala said.' It's not much use to have a security seminar.
He said, "It is foolish to waste time attending such a seminar.
As long as we don't know why, you don't believe anyone.
On the morning of May 15, Valdez left the office of Riodoce in the capital, Kulyakan.
His red Toyota Karolla was stopped by two men just a few blocks away; they forced him out of the car and fired 12 shots, guessing because of the newspaper's name - translated as "The Twelve River."
The gangster left in his car and crashed it nearby.
Valdez is 50 years old.
Leave behind his wife and two grown-up children.
Kulyakan spoke four times.
But on the subject of Valdez, there was actually nothing but silence.
Since Guzman's arrest last year and his extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloo has become the country's bloodiest battleground, with hostile forces fighting in a frenzy.
It has become commonplace for one or several people to be shot every day in the streets of Sinaloo state, with cemeteries strewn with the gorgeous two-story mausoleum of drug lords.
Temporarily forgetting the state of "calm" is when only one cartel controls this seaside state and its ports and drug trafficking routes to the United States.
Even so, even though Valdez is deeply aware of the dangers of the job, 60-year-old Riodoce co-founder and director Ismail Pohoiqui is guilty of failing to protect his friend.
He believes two mistakes caused the tragedy.
First, a Damaso Lopez interview was published in February, and he led a cartel group that fought against several of Guzman's sons.
The report may have angered the sons; the newspaper was bought off by suspected gang members as soon as it was sent to the newsstand.
The second mistake was not to force Valdez to leave Mexico for his own security concerns after another newspaper covering the same story was confiscated.
Valdez is a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his death is of great significance to Mexican violence against journalists.
His spirit is long, and his friends and colleagues believe that he has always been with us.
He was also a senior reporter for Noroeste in 2003, when he co-founded Riodoce with five colleagues and sold a $50 stake.
"In Sinaloo," he said, "it is impossible for journalism not to deal with the drug problem."
As time went by, the paper gained a good reputation for bold and honest reporting, and sales and advertising increased.
Journalists like to be able to publish critical investigative stories without fear of censorship, and readers like newspapers to publish stories that others are afraid to report.
Five years after its founding, Riodoce won the Latin American Maria Moscambo Prize for Journalism.
In the same year, the Association for the Protection of Journalists awarded the Valdez International Press Freedom Award for his courage in pursuing the most authentic Mexican drug coverage.
He confessed that he was scared, too.
When the Association for the Protection of Journalists awarded the award, he said, "I want to continue to live.
Later, in late October, he said in an interview on local television station Rompeviento TV that "drug trafficking is a way of life in Sinaloa,
You have to take on the task that falls on your shoulders as a journalist - either so, or pretend to be deaf.
I don't want to be asked 'What did you do in the face of so many deaths... why didn't you make a noise about what was going on?'
All of Riodoce's staff are nostalgic for Valdez, for cursing like a docker, for the friend who never grudgingly embraced and suggested, and for the teacher who knew how to live.
They rely on his habits.
He used to wear that hat.
Always go to the El Guayabo bar opposite the office, and always sit on the same table.
Now, they will ask: Was it his day-to-day habits that caused his fall?
His death also made them have to think about how to do a good job and live well.
"They don't like the fact that you're causing trouble for their women and children, or that you influence their legitimate companies and the secret airports that are used to transport drugs," Pohoqui said.
These are all over their bottom line.
The result is to maintain a high level of self-censorship and self-protection even in the safest of times.
Believe in your own intuition.
If you smell the danger, get away with it.
"The problem is that the breath is a feeling that will be deceived... and then something like Javier will happen," said Andreas Villaril, editor of Riodoce.
He and others have said that previous rules no longer apply to Sinaloa - as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states, where smuggling routes are lucrative, and agencies are weak, government officials corrupt, smoky.
The situation is constantly changing.
In the room where Riodoce employees take part in security training, mobile phones are suddenly not allowed; a few days ago, spyware allegedly sold only to the government was already used in Mexico to spy on journalists and activists.
Outside, two police officers ride in the shade to escape the heat of 104 degrees (40 degrees Celsius).
They were sent by the state government to protect the offices of Riodoce, which are located in a four-story building in the middle-class block of Kulyakan.
Some reporters half-jokingly joked about not knowing whether the police officers would be 50 percent of the letter that the governor himself said.
It has been months since journalists went to the mountains, where drug gangs are under the control of a physical presence.
This week's Riodoce featured three major events.
Among them was the killing of the brother of Sinaloo's great former boxer Julio Cesar Chavez,
And the disclosure of government funds in the governor's hometown,
As well as the kidnapping inside an expensive restaurant in Kulyakan, which is just one block from the prosecutor's office.
The authorities did not release information about the subject of the kidnapping and the kidnapping process, so it would be prudent to write down what the city knew: That the restaurant was a place that drug dealers and officials loved to go.
One journalist learned from the public archives that the restaurant was registered in the name of a politician of the ruling Revolutionary Institutional Party (PRI), which dominates the political class almost throughout the previous period.
Recently, several PRI governors have been accused of corruption in several high-profile cases.
Villaril asked reporters to write about what happened at the site before the incident, including an incident in which a son of Guzman, Mexico's top drug lord, evaded a military attack.
If a few months ago, readers would look at Valdez's column to find the most powerful information about the kidnapping.
The 46-year-old, who is known as "skinny" because of his thin build, said: "Before, we had known what was going on.
Now all of our sources of information communication channels are choked.
Valdez's office is now used to store signs and stickers protesting the killing of journalists, as employees become what they never wanted to be: Activists representing the media.
The next morning, journalist Miriam Ramirez walked out of the room with a sign in hand and went to the local prosecutor's office for a march related to another reporter.
El Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez was killed in the western state of Miyokan.
Officials found a charred body and said it was his body, according to DNA tests.
Across the country, journalists have become more outspoken, organizing protests and painting the words "Save the Media" on sidewalks and buildings.
On that day, the director, Pohoqui, was not in Washington, and he was trying to get justice for the Valdez case and get international support.
The day after Valdez was killed, during a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa state, Ramirez accused the official of spying on journalists and killing them because they had told the truth.
Given that her anger has affected her objectivity, she has also asked to resign from her post covering government affairs.
Valdez has repeatedly reiterated that Mexican journalists are "surrounded" by organized crime, complicit government officials and an indifferent society.
In his last book, Drug Journalism, he wrote that journalists are not only mutilated by drug cartels, but are on the list of politicians and security forces who are complicit in organized crime.
Media watchdog group Articulo 19 blamed police and public officials for more than half of the journalists' attacks last year.
"In Mexico, they let you die just to shut you up," Ramirez said.
Clearly, these murders are chilling.
No one has forgotten that six years ago, blogger Maria Elizabeth Marcias died at the border north of Tamaulipas.
Beside her body was a note purportedly signed by the Zetas cartel: "I came for my reporting."
Her head was cut off, next to a computer keyboard and headphones.
Some newspapers have chosen to close, such as the El Norte newspaper on the northern border of Chihuahua state, after Miroslava Bresch was killed in March.
Others continued, and the directors of the 2014 El Manana of Nuevo Laredo were killed, but they continued.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juarez used a front-page news to speak publicly about the drug cartel, with the headline "What do you want from us?"
Part of the reporter fled their home town, or even left the country.
It was a tough choice.
It is difficult to find work in exile, and they still need to be cautious and alert to danger in the streets.
Sometimes they would be arrested, and in 2015 photographer Ruben Espinosa was said to have been killed along with four women in a Mexican city three months after fleeing Veracruz.
For those who stay behind the scenes and continue to work, this is the daily step of high-risk decision-making.
Iwala, who had wanted to be a poet, admitted that reporting on the drug trade made him fearful.
"Mexico is turning into hell, so I became a journalist," he said.
The latest issue of the newspaper had been printed in the middle of the night on a recent Friday, and the editors of "Riodoce" sat on the aisle outside the office drinking beer when suddenly their phones rang.
A series of gunfights between gang hostile forces and security forces near the beach resort city of Massatland have confirmed the deaths of 19 people.
The fighting is still escalating, as foreshadowed by a series of cartel messages found in the region.
They were on the side of the road to upload the news to the website Riodoce via their mobile phone.
The headlines the next day had to be changed.
The siren sounded nearby - and there was another battle of life and death in the area.
Pohoqui glanced at the police officers who were standing there guarding to see if they were alert.
If they had a bit of fear, then they didn't show it either.
The newspaper's founder has been killed in action, and in his large portrait, his middle finger points to where the entire state of Sinaloo needs to look out, with Riodoce's entire staff following his pace.
"How can you even want to shut down?" Said Pohoqui, who asked me to send her to the street to take part in the coverage on the same day that Xavier was killed.
China's self-driving tourism 2020 market size or breakthrough trillion yuan
[Abstract] In the broader context of the rise in consumption and the prevalence of free movement, self-driving is encouraged by national policies and increasingly popular with consumers.
But at the same time, the self-driving market, which is expected to break through the trillion scale, faces a double challenge.
In the context of rising consumption and the prevalence of free movement, self-driving is encouraged by national policies as well as by more and more consumers.
But at the same time, the prospect of breaking through the trillion-scale self-driving market also faces a double challenge, with the development of the self-driving industry not directly proportional to market demand, self-driving clubs and travel agents facing low profitability on the other hand, the infrastructure and services for self-driving travel are at an early stage.
60% of the total number of domestic trips, the market size is expected to be $1 trillion
With a total of 4.44 billion domestic trips in 2016, self-driving trips account for about 60% of the country's total tourist arrivals, and the size of the self-driving market is expected to exceed trillion by 2020.
According to the China Travel Ship Association's statistics on the number of self-driving outings, there has been a steady increase in the number of outings in the past five years, with more than half of the country's tourist arrivals.
At the same time, more attention and support has been shown in the emerging area of self-driving, as well as at the national level, with intensive policy regulations related to self-driving, hostel and camping tourism from 2016 to 2017.
In July 2017, eight departments, including the National Tourist Board and the National Sports Directorate, jointly released the Automobile Self-Driving Campaign Camp Development Plan; in the same month, 14 departments, such as the NDRC and Treasury, jointly issued the Upgrade self-driving is highlighted in the Programme of Action (2017).
The introduction of policy provides opportunities and policy guidance for domestic self-driving development.
Self-driving clubs make meagre profits and complete industrial chains are key
Although the domestic self-driving market potential is huge, the national policy actively guides, but the self-driving industry is still in the early stages.
According to China's annual self-driving development report for 2016-2017, there are thousands of domestic self-driving clubs, car clubs, car clubs, etc., but the majority of self-driving trips are arranged by tourists the proportion of visitors to various institutions, such as self-driving clubs, is only around 15 per cent.
At the same time, online travel enterprises and traditional travel agencies that independently develop self-driving products are also numerous. Many online travel platforms sell only self-driving products provided by some suppliers, and some self-driving clubs are important suppliers.
In terms of organizing self-driving activities, it covers "eating, living, traveling, shopping, entertainment" aspects, high degree of fragmentation, heavy upstream supply chain, and high randomness of tourist consumption.
Li Guojie, founder and CEO of Beijing World Automobile Club, thinks the self-driving club is essentially similar to the travel agency, and the early main profit-making mode is mainly offline activities, the core point is self-driving line products and leader services.
But now in the field of self-driving line product homogenization is serious, the service level of the leader is uneven, the self-driving club is facing the need to transform again.
It can be seen that self-driving travel is not an independent industry in itself, but it is important to form a cross-geographical, industry ecological circle with the characteristics of its self-driving displacement, forming a complete industrial chain.
Experts point out that, in addition to basic tourism consumption, experience is a more important element of consumption.
Therefore, for self-driving industry development, should enhance experience characteristics, develop "self-driving +" theme and self-driving product IP.
The scenic road is not only the road, but the car camp should not only satisfy the room and board
In the face of the rise of self-driving travel, the basic supporting development of self-driving travel is also relatively junior.
Li pointed out that the tourist scenic road is not just a road, but the elements of traffic and tourism need to be integrated into it, but the road repair and tourism itself are two departments responsible, the transport sector adds tourism elements and stays construction of facilities such as latrines, counselling centres, billboards, etc., and tourism integration is not high.
Compared with the well-known self-driving route "American 66 Highway," the construction experience is worth learning.
Landscape design is no longer the most direct and fast route between the point of departure and destination, but follows the concept of "experience driving fun" to provide self-driving visitors with the best enjoyment of the beauty along the road; landscape connectivity preserves the historical value and cultural value of ecotourism resources along the route, as well as the organization of various thematic activities to enhance visitors' participation and recreation experience and create economic benefits for local tourism.
In addition to the scenic track, the camp is also an important supporting facility for self-driving.
But there are not many consumers who choose to stay in the camp among self-driving tourists known to reporters in the New Beijing newspaper.
In their view, many camps are biased towards basic construction and can only meet the needs of eating, low-grade, single-product, and self-driving, which contain many elements.
Insiders, who asked not to be named, said that many of the businesses that had been doing the camps in previous years had been trying to get the ground, and that the later stages of infrastructure and services had not kept up. It's hard to do some matching products.
Consumer groups
In terms of age, self-driving groups are concentrated in the 21-40 age group, especially the 31-40 age group, which has a certain economic base and individualized tourism, according to data released in 2017 by the China Travel Ship Association higher demand, and more for parent-child tour customers.
From the accommodation survey, the self-driving people prefer non-standard accommodation relatively more.
From the self-driving type, the peripheral self-driving is the most important type of self-driving travel, accounting for 84,32%.
Out-of-country self-driving is the yearning of many people, but the proportion is still smaller.
At the same time, as consumer demand has risen, tourists who used to enjoy "sightseeing" have begun to change their minds. Instead of "taking pictures and sleeping in cars," they are more concerned with the experience and process of travel.
Dinosaurs use camouflage to dodge enemies
At first glance, it was terrible, but it looked like a statue.
The researchers published the first study of rhinoceros-sized, uncanny fossils found by Canadian miners, noting that the fossil was well preserved, so experts called it the "Mona Lisa of the dinosaur world."
The fossil is so well preserved that it can even be concluded that the color of its scaly skin is reddish brown. This suggests that it has had some "troubled experiences."
Related reports in the journal Current Biology described it as "the most well-preserved cloak dinosaur ever found, and one of the best dinosaur specimens in the world."
The fossil is a newly discovered species of nodules that live in the middle of the Cretaceous period between 110 million and 112 million years ago.
Its very well-preserved state shocked the researchers, who described it as "truly stunning."
According to National Geographic, the herbacea dinosaur fossil is the most well-preserved dinosaur of its kind ever found.
On March 21, 2011, Shawn Funk discovered the fossil while digging at the Suncor Jubilee mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada.
At the time, he encountered something that seemed not to be the same as the rocks around him, so he decided to take a closer look.
After that, the fossils he discovered were sent to the Royal Tyrrell Paleontological Museum in Canada.
It took researchers six years to make the beast, hidden within 2500 pounds (1100 kilograms) of soil, look real.
After such hard work, the final results have only now been made public.
"If you look at it, you almost believe it is sleeping," said Caleb Brown, a scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum and the first author. The creature is on display at the museum.
"It will become one of the most beautiful and well-preserved dinosaur specimens in scientific history - the Mona Lisa in the dinosaur world."
By studying its skin, the researchers found that the herbivorous creature, though draped in armor like a walking tank, was at risk of major threats from carnivorous dinosaurs.
The heavily mangled dinosaur used red-and-white camouflage to avoid predators and used a covert technique known as "anti-shading," which has also been used by many modern animals.
In this way, it is better able to blend in with the surrounding environment to avoid the enemy, experts say, suggesting it was preyed on by larger dinosaurs.
The 110-million-year-old creature, which belongs to a member of the Festival Dragon family, made headlines for the first time in May and is currently on display at the Royal Tyrrell Paleontological Museum.
After Mark Mitchell, a museum technician who was part of the team, took 7,000 hours to carefully unveil the giant beast, the researchers now study it and name it Borealopelmarta Kmitchelli.
The samples were kept in excellent condition, allowing Dr. Mitchell, as well as the international team of scientists, to record the patterns and shapes of the scales and armor on his body.
They found anti-shading, a common form of defense in the animal world, which means the creature's back is darker than the color on its side.
Although anti-shading is common, the findings are surprising because the dinosaur is much larger than the existing animal that uses anti-shading.
The dinosaur is under pressure to be hunted by a meat-eating dinosaur, which evolves in a favorable direction, allowing it to hide in the opposite base as a means of survival.
But most of the existing animals, such as deer, zebra or armadillo, that use anti-shading techniques, are as small and vulnerable as prey, suggesting that the creature is under real existential pressure.
"The frenzied predation of large heavy-armor dinosaurs shows how dangerous the Cretaceous carnivorous dinosaurs are," Brown said.
Chemical analysis of the organic complex in its scales also showed that the dinosaur had a reddish-brown skin color.
Scientists are continuing to study the life cues of the creature, including the stomach contents it retains to find the last food to eat.
They believe the dinosaurs fell into the river at the time of their death and were then swept into the sea before finally sinking into the seabed in a back-to-back manner.
At the time, the climate in Alberta was as warm as it is in southern Florida today, and rivers and oceans may be deeper inland than they are now.
"This knot dragon is truly amazing because it is completely covered by the preserved scaly skin and, to this day, is kept in the dimensional space, allowing its original shape to be preserved," Brown said.
"So the creature is now in almost the same shape as it was during the Cretaceous period.
You don't need to rebuild it with too much imagination; if you look at it, you will almost believe it is sleeping.
The Cretaceous period was a period of two-legged walking of large animal-foot dinosaurs roaming the earth.
Although the Tyrannosaurus was the king of the dinosaurs, it did not appear for millions of years after the cloak dinosaurs, which may have been killed by some of the ancestors of the Tyrannosaurus.
They include high-thorn dragons, a giant beast weighing up to 6 tons and 38 feet (11.5 meters) long.
New research has found that scientists who appeared in the journal Current Biology believe the knot dragon died after being washed into the sea, before forming mummies in the dirt.
Sean Fink excavates the creature at the Jubilee mine near Fort McMurray, Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011.
According to the museum, it is the most well-preserved cloak dinosaur in the world, and the skin and armor in the area from nose to hip are intact.
The creature averages about 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighs 3,000 pounds (1,300 kilograms).
It has two 20-inch-long, off-the-shoulder spikes.
Researchers believe the grass-fed cloak dinosaur was active in what is now the western part of Canada before being washed into the sea by rivers that burst into flooding.
However, the dinosaur was buried at the bottom of the sea, allowing its cloak to be fully preserved.
The fossil remains of this particular sample are well preserved, leaving the remaining skin still covered with uneven slices of the dinosaur skull.
As Michael Greshko wrote in the journal National Geographic, this level of preservation, like a lottery, is rare.
The more I look, the more I think it's incredible.
The remaining skin fossils are still covered in mottled armour on the dinosaur's skull.
Its front right hand is on its side, with five toes spreading upward.
I can count its tablets.
The reporter learned that adding natural or plant-based alginate, humic acid and amino acid to the urea process can modify the traditional urea and form alginate urea and zinc humic acid. The utilization rate of urea was 5 to 10 percent higher than that of common urea.
Environment friendly, crop yield potential is obvious, especially large granular value-added urea is BB fertilizer high-quality raw material.
This total number of security personnel is double that of the 2012 London Olympics.
To ensure the safety of the Rio Games, Brazil will launch the largest-ever security linkage programme.
Previously, the Brazilian government said a total of 85,000 people from the army and police would fight together, including 20,000 military and 65,000 police.
Most of the military will be responsible for defending the Olympic venues, while the additional 3,000 troops will be responsible for security at international airports, subway stations and streets.
Police officers patrol other parts of the city, including subways, public transport and streets.
It is reported that 6,000 military personnel have arrived in Rio to serve Olympic security.
They are responsible for patrolling the airport as well as the main roads connecting the airport and the Olympic venues, in addition to the four major racing areas in charge of the Rio Olympics.
The introduction of evaluation mechanisms in the service industry is no longer new, and for evaluation mechanisms to be effective, it is important to make regulation more effective and non-formal.
How do activists learn to answer this question: "Whose streets?"
On 9 August 2014, Brittany Ferrer was distraught.
On the first day of his trip to New York City, the St. Louis native was sitting in a rented bed in Epey, browsing Facebook on his mobile phone.
She stumbled upon a post from a high school student.
It read: 'The police just killed an 18-year-old and the child was still lying in the street.
She found that no one else on the feed had posted the message, and she was confused. She turned off her Facebook and turned on Twitter.
One @ TheePharoah user kept pushing her to the Dynamic Times.
The St. Louis-area rapper's live Twitter feed of the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old black man who was killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri.
He posted a picture of Brown's lifeless body lying on the street, with his body lying on the street for four hours.
"Crazy," Ferrer thought.
But for her and her community, death is nothing new.
She put down her phone and didn't turn on Twitter again until that night, "read the tweets about the crowd gathering on Camfield Avenue.
There were police videos and pictures of people shouting, as well as a picture of a man claiming to be Brown's father, which read: "Ferguson police just killed my unarmed son!"
She saw a live feed message and a police officer stood in front of a group of protesters with a barking dog.
In another video, she said, another officer raises his rifle and screams: "I will kill all of you... brutes."
"It's not normal," Ferrer recalled.
"This is not what we are accustomed to and can call a typical murder."
At that moment, I felt shudder.
I was angry and cried.
She booked a return flight and went home the next day.
After landing at 11pm, she picked up her six-year-old daughter from her father's home and decided the pair would travel to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson over the next three years is the subject of a new documentary, Who's Street?, released in cinemas on August 11.
This is a story about survival and protest, love and loss, strength and tenacity from the point of view of the people who live in this community, packed streets and alleyways demanding answers.
While Ferrell was driving to Ferguson with her daughter (in a floral dress, with a coronation), the pair re-discussed the countless topics they had discussed before that morning - "About Black Experience and Black State."
"Do you remember when I taught you when black people had to fight for their faith?" She recalled.
"We are going to Ferguson now because the police killed an 18-year-old boy, which is not right.
I had to take her, "Ferrer said later.
"What happened today is the... climax of everything in the past.
She wants to know, see, and rise from this.
Not only does she need to develop well in terms of radicalism and organisation, but she needs to understand the different dimensions of black experience and black conditions and what we have to do to be free and liberated.
Even if I had the privilege of providing her with a racist experience she had not personally experienced, she was no different from other black girls.
If I protect her in this matter, I feel like I am hurting her.
They arrived at Ferguson's first stop at a venue opposite the South Florence Road police station, which became their camp after the militants waited until the result of police officer Darren Wilson's eventual non-prosecution.
Ferrell and her daughter got in touch with a local business owner who made a bag lunch.
They prepared the bag and were responsible for passing it on to the protesters.
Slowly, Ferrer began to form a new kind of activism.
"My radicalism changed completely after August 9," she said. While studying at St. Louis, Missouri State University, she was president of the Association of Minority Nursing Students, focusing on the food justice and health gap in black communities.
"I have no organizational experience.
That's how it all came.
A few weeks later, Ferrer met with the film's co-director, Sabah Faleyan, during a night march.
Forlayan said she and her photography director, Lucas Alvarado Falle, "just wanted to record" what happened.
A question arose in Ferrer's mind: "Do you want to record or find a story that you can exploit?"
This suspicion stems from many of these cases: People - usually white people - enter a community to benefit from their pain and tenacity.
As Faleyan explained in a recent interview, "We've heard that people who were born in Ferguson didn't concentrate their voices, and we wanted to do it differently."
Faleyan has been linked to co-director Damon Davis, a regional artist known for his activism against dead prisoners.
His involvement led Ferrell, along with six other locals, to join the "Who's Street?" Project team, which remained unforsaken for several years after Brown was shot.
"This documentary is not someone who speaks for us or talks to us, this is our statement," Davis said.
"I'm mainly concerned about how these characters are presented, because that's the way I'm presented."
Although the goal was not to focus on Ferrell's experience - but to show that the movement was "not about savior leaders, but about community cohesion," Flyyan said - proving that she was the most open of film participants.
As a result, "whose street?" Surprisingly recorded Ferrer's personal life, such as falling in love and stepping into marriage.
"I feel naked," Ferrer laughed when he first saw the finished product.
"But I understand that doing this work and humanizing black people requires a degree of vulnerability."
In addition, Ferrer's story reaffirms and relocates the role of black cool women in the broader Black Lives Matter movement.
Two of the three founders of the movement - who created # BlackLivesMatter on social media after the 2012 shooting of black teenager Trevor Martin - were identified as cool.
"Black cool women in leadership generally support this movement," Ferrer said. "That's because we keep fighting on multiple fronts.
Black cool women have to bear all this. "
"The movement really has the support of black women and many black cool women," Faleyan agreed and mentioned.
Because of her identity, Ferrell was chosen to be at the heart of the film. However, she insisted that "this is not an affirmative action for things."
"She is the one who inspires this energy," she said.
"Although she is on the front line, it is no coincidence, because in these intersections of life, as a black cool woman, you have a lot to do.
Through the screen, you can feel her energy.
Meanwhile, in Ferguson, news cameras have long since disappeared, but tensions between the community and the police remain racial.
Ferrer was given a suspended sentence of more than two-and-a-half years for trying to block the highway during a march.
She described the socio-political atmosphere in the area she called home: "A mess."
Still, since taking to the streets of Ferguson three years ago, she has stuck to the hymn she struggled to remember.
"We have a responsibility to fight for freedom.
We have a responsibility to win.
We must love each other and support each other.
We have nothing to lose, except the shackles of our bodies. "
In fact, online translation services were already available on the Internet a decade ago, and it was a long time ago that the argument that "machines are about to replace humans for translation" came to an end.
Similarities: Artist uses Chelsea Manning's DNA to create portrait
There are multiple faces in the middle of the pavilion at the Friedman Gallery in New York: White, black and brown, with almost imperceptible similarities between each face, tied by lines hanging from the ceiling.
The 30 portraits were created by artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg using a cheek cotton sign and hair shredder sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent hair crumbs from Levenworth prison, where the former intelligence analyst was sentenced to 35 years for leaking classified diplomatic cables via the WikiLeaks website.
The exhibition opens on August 2 with the headline "The similarities."
It was the result of two years of correspondence between Dewey Hagburg and Manning, who combined his discipline with his own in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a prominent dissident, had been jailed and in prison. Former President Barack Obama pardoned the rest of her sentence three days before the end of his term.
By analyzing the algorithms from Manning's DNA and creating 30 portraits of the "likely appearance," Heather Dewey Harborg made an edgy and slightly unforgiving comment about DNA. It is also about the concept of identity itself.
Manning, who was born under the name Bradley Edward, who publicly admitted to being a woman during puberty, was convicted in 2013 of 20 charges, including six counts of espionage law violations, computer fraud and theft.
In prison, her image was suppressed, with only one photo, a granular black-and-white self-photograph that looked visibly unsettling, sitting on the driver's seat and wearing a platinum-coloured wig.
In 2015, Heather Dewey Harborg had a huge success in her 2012 project Stranger Faces (Stranger Things).
In that piece, she uses DNA extracted from cigarette butts and chewing gum medium court exhibits to create 3-D portraits of people who may have similar looks.
That was an email she just happened to receive from Paper magazine.
"They want to interview Chelsea Manning in prison and need a portrait," Heather Dewey Harberg told the media at the opening of the exhibition.
Chelsea Manning was unable to visit or take photos at the time, so they contacted Chelsea to ask if she was interested in making a DNA portrait.
So the artist and her imprisoned muse became an unlikely pen pal, exchanging many letters with each other over the course of two years.
They even created a comic book, The repressed Head, by Shoili Kanungo, which anticipates that the president will be able to grant privileges to Manning in the future and that she will be able to see the exhibition in prison.
It may be a coincidence that Obama asked for her release just days after the book was published, when Manning spent his seventh year in the Kansas military prison.
In addition, there is another layer of deep interest in the exhibition, because in contemporary America, the Trump administration has repeatedly declared war on government leakers and transgender servicemen, while looking for new, Twitter-hyped ways to incite division to heal that split.
When asked about the special timing of all this, Heather Dewey Harborg said, "There is a reason for anything to happen."
In an artist statement written on the gallery wall, Manning's oversized signature is below (the name "i" is painted with a heart), calling for an end to the "partisan chaos" based on gender, sexual orientation and culture.
On the opposite wall was her mitochondrial DNA sequence, with pencil twisting curvature written with the symbols of Cs, Gs and As.
By including 200 letters (or nucleotide, each artist's complex scientific dictionary), Heather Dewey Harborg hopes to express, by portraying these strangely similar portraits, that everyone is, at least in physical structure.
"I want people to get out of this mess, our genomes don't care who we are, how open genetic data is interpreted, how subjective it is," said Heather Dewey Harborg, whose 2007 video production is fake memory, too, is on show.
"DNA data can tell us a lot of different stories, so this is 30 of them."
The last work in the exhibition, in a room, comes from a page in the novel in the preceding illustration.
Shows the soldier in the United States holding a megaphone under the pompous, King Kong-shaped manning.
"When they make your speech stop, they win," wrote the wall.
"So, don't shut up."
"The content came directly from a letter she wrote to me," said the artist from Philadelphia.
"I'm just scared again. I'm still going to say it."
Manning has yet to see the exhibition in person, as foreseen in the comics, but when she does, she will be covered by her own DNA portrait mask, like a group of protesters getting cheers at the pavilion center.
It was also purposeful, as with all the items in the exhibition, reaching the height of her pencil-written genetic one-fold group information (5.2 feet, Manning's height).
"In the past, I hung them up on the wall, but I wanted them to feel like a bunch of people," Dewey Hagburg said of the portrait.
"But I want them to feel like a group of protesters following Chelsea, just as people protested at the time to release her."
Northwestern University professor and Oxford University employee wanted for homicide
Police said a man was found fatally stabbed inside a luxury Chicago apartment and a Northwestern University professor and an Oxford University employee were subsequently wanted and are now looking for suspects nationwide.
Cook County Court records show that on Monday, 42-year-old Wyndham Lessem and 56-year-old Andrew Warren were arrested without bail on suspicion of the death of Trenton H. James Cornell Duranlow.
Cornell Durané, 26, died from multiple stab wounds, according to documents.
A community alert issued by the Chicago Police Department said the body was found on July 27.
Upon receiving the call, the police arrived at the Grand Plaza apartment and found multiple lacerations on the victim.
Cornell Durrano died on the spot and detectives are investigating the killing, while police are actively looking for two suspects, police said.
Lessem has been an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
"Lyseum has now been removed from service and has been banned from Northwestern University campus," Alan K. Kaubetch, deputy director of campus relations, said in an email statement.
"Now this is a criminal case, the authorities are investigating, and Northwestern University is actively cooperating with the investigation," Mr Caubetch said.
Warren is a senior financial assistant at Oxford University.
A spokesman for Summerville College, Oxford, said in an emailed statement: "We have been in touch with UK police and stand ready to assist US investigative agencies as needed.
The statement added that Warren's colleagues were "deeply shocked" and hoped he would be able to turn himself in.
Anthony Gurielmi, chief liaison officer for the Chicago Police Department, said he strongly encouraged the suspect to turn himself in to the authorities.
"The police already have a general idea of their whereabouts, and we are trying to locate the possible location," Mr Gulelmi said.
Mr Gurielmi said local, regional and national authorities were doing their utmost to assist in the search of the suspects.
Mr Gurielmi said police had received a call from the manager of the Grand Plaza apartment and he had just received a secret tip that something had happened to the 1008 apartment.
Police said the situation was horrific at the time.
Mr Gurielmi said it was still unclear whether the incident also took place on July 27.
He said that according to security cameras, it was confirmed that Lessem and Warren were in the building at the time.
"We believe Professor Lessem has something to do with the victims," Gurielmi said.
The management team at Grand Plaza issued a statement to residents saying: "Police are currently looking at the victim's timeline and the circumstances of the case and are investigating a variety of motives, including a possible domestic incident.
"We will complete the World Anti-Doping Agency road map in the near future," Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mutko said
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said it would not take too long to implement the remaining standards of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) aimed at restoring the rights of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA).
"The implementation of the road map standards has reached a certain stage, and RUSADA has been given the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD (UK Anti-Doping Agency).
The WADA road map has been updated in this regard, "Mutko said on Thursday.
Deputy Prime Minister Mutko made the remarks while commenting on the second part of the World Anti-Doping Agency road map, Compliance, which sets standards for the restoration of RUSADA rights and was recently posted on the organization's website.
According to Mutko, the criteria do not contain anything that might raise Russian concerns.
He added, "Everything has to be announced and everything will be implemented."
And the results will be presented to the IOC [IOC] and WADA in the near future. "
One of the criteria mentioned in the list, however, is that the Russian Anti-Doping Agency must publicly accept the findings of the WADA-approved investigation into Russian state support for doping in national sport, by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren.
Speaking about the matter, Mutko said: "We are investigating and our anti-doping system has undoubtedly failed."
All measures have been implemented.
But there is no national plan behind this, and we will not acknowledge what does not exist.
Mutko's words echoed those of Vitaly Smirnov, the head of Russia's Independent Public Anti-Doping Commission.
Mr Smirnoff acknowledged past problems with the Russian anti-doping agency when he was interviewed by media outlet Russian outlet RSport earlier in the day, but added: "We have said on various occasions that the report contains controversial positions and the rules.
No one plans to accept the report unconditionally, "said Smirnoff.
WADA suspended RUSADA's right to carry out doping inspections in Russia after the doping scandal in November 2015.
But in June this year, RUSADA was allowed to plan and coordinate testing this year under the supervision of international experts and UKAD.
WADA Director-General Olivia Negri said during a visit to the organization's headquarters in Moscow in July that RUSADA was "moving in the right direction" in an effort to restore its rights.
For computers, whether it's a game of chess or a national chess game, beating humans was absent decades ago.

No longer need to find a replacement! These more than 8,000 products zero tariff
At a regular press conference held by the Ministry of Commerce on January 11, a spokesman for the Ministry of Commerce said that as of now, there are 15 self-trade agreements in force, covering 23 countries and regions, covering more than 8,000 imports.
At the same time, import cosmetics, Icelandic salmon, Chilean red wine, ASEAN tropical fruit... You don't have to buy these products at a big price anymore.
At present, we have signed 16 free trade agreements with 24 countries and regions, and 15 have entered into force, covering more than 8,000 zero-tariff imports.
Take agricultural products as an example, with the implementation of the self-trade agreement, consumers can taste produce from different origin, quality and cheap all year round.
For example, in ASEAN, tropical fruits such as durian, lychee, fir fruit, import tariffs fell from 15% to 30% to zero tariffs.
Import duties for Icelandic salmon fell from 10% to 12% to zero tariffs;
Red wine in Georgia and Chile, with import tariffs reduced from 14% to 30% to zero tariffs;
There are also New Zealand's beef and milk powder and other characteristic agricultural products such as a relatively large tax reduction.
In the case of industrial goods, for example, the import tariff for some cosmetics in Switzerland has been reduced to zero;
Part of the watch import tariff has been reduced by 50 per cent and will be reduced to zero in a few years;
South Korea's tariffs on imports of refrigerators, rice pans, massages, beauty meters and other products have been reduced by 40 percent and will be reduced to zero tariffs in a few years;
There are also consumer electronics and other products with a relatively large tax reduction.
At the same time, zero-tariff products under the zone also include intermediate products and raw materials needed for the manufacture of many domestic terminal consumer goods, and have contributed to the structural upgrading of domestic consumer goods to some extent.
A spokesman for the Commerce Department said that nearly one-third of our total imports can be treated with preferential tariffs under the self-trade agreement, most of which are end-consumer goods, with tangible benefits for consumers.
Further reduction of import tariffs on consumer goods
Since December 1, 2017, China has adjusted import tariffs on some consumer goods to further reduce import duties on consumer goods, covering food, health products, pharmaceuticals, daily products, clothing caps, household equipment, cultural entertainment and miscellaneous goods all kinds of consumer goods, involving a total of 187 8-digit taxes.
The average tax rate for this batch of consumer goods will drop from 17.3 per cent straight to 7.7 per cent, almost "cut off"!
With effect from 1 January 2018, our country has also made partial adjustments to other import and export tariffs.
The import duty for some cosmetics such as lip balm, eye shadow, perfume was reduced from 10% to 5%;
Lower tariffs mean that consumers do not have to buy, much less go abroad to buy their favorite foreign products.

End-of-year U.S. mall rules difference big shopping return need to be cautious
Zhongxin Network December 29 Electricity
Just after Christmas, there was a wave of returning goods, according to the US daily Le Monde.
More than half of the goods sold last Christmas were returned, according to the ABC.
In addition, there are readers who have been tricked into Internet shopping, consumers need to pay more attention when shopping on informal websites.
In general, large shopping companies have formal, reasonable return procedures, but they must be careful if they buy gifts or electricity from some small shops.
Ms. Hou, of Roland Gunn, bought a coat for more than 60 yuan (US $) at an online store selling a printed coat on December 1, local time, and it has not been sent to this day.
She sent an email to the customer service, and there was no reply.
Another netizen explosive, last year to travel to the United States, to buy a mobile phone from a third-party seller, sent to find that inside is a box of rubber mud.
After knowing to be cheated, apply to the website for a refund, fortunately get a full refund.
But there are also customers who believe the website refund service is not 100 per cent perfect.
Mr. Wang, a North California Chinese resident, said he had twice bought an emergency distribution service for a site, four yuan for an emergency service, but twice failed to deliver it on time.
A refund was then applied and no response was received.
Large shopping malls or shopping malls have a better return policy.
Macy's is fully refunded within 180 days for most of its merchandise.
However, the goods must remain "original" and require purchase vouchers such as receipts or bank purchase records.
If there is no voucher, customers can also get mall points, which can be used to buy other goods.
Target typically has a 90-day return period for general merchandise, with electronic items typically 15 days.
But the withdrawal period for electronic, recreational goods purchased between November 1 and December 25, 2017, has been extended to 30 days.
It should be noted that the 30-day refund period is calculated from December 25, which is to return the goods by January 25, 2018.
Great shopping experience, new era of shopping development in business circles
More than a decade ago, our country was generally still in the seller market, people's choice is limited and demand is limited.
But after a decade of development, the market has been transformed from a seller's to a buyer's market, and today's consumer tastes have become more sophisticated, and they are no longer content with simple "one-handed" shopping practices.
So how to get consumers an extreme shopping experience becomes the next point of competition for real estate developers.
And among the many factors that affect the consumer shopping experience, the shopping center in the business circle has the most significant impact.
See how city builders everywhere focus on the shopping experience.
There are no two completely identical leaves in the world, not two exactly the same shopping centres, a famous shopping centre must have its own characteristics.
The world-famous Kanyon shopping centre in Turkey, for example, has a unique wave-shaped architectural design inspired by the Grand Canyon, so Kanyon, known as the Consonant, walks 200 metres in the Kanyon minister the steps seem to be in the Grand Canyon.
In addition to the canyon-style design, there is also a large oval performance venue in the centre of the shopping centre, which is unique in shape and often features performances.
Because of the open platform design, visitors can walk on each floor to see the "canyon" activities, and have the effect of moving the scene.
At home, Nanjing Forest Moore Commercial Street, known as China's first forest-style stroll, combines shopping with ecological and fairy-tale perfection.
7000-square-metre Green Square, 3000-square-metre rooftop water platform, consisting of 9 monomer buildings, interfacing between buildings, overall sinking courtyard design, above the French plane tree for the construction of the epidermis, create a sense of forest.
Walking into Forest Moor is like accidentally falling into a rabbit hole in Alice's Wonderful Journey, climbing tree trunks that surround buildings, grass, clear springs, and bring people into a vibrant and vibrant forest.
There are also more than 50 international top-selling flagship stores, more than 100 international top brands and more than 500 famous domestic and foreign brands planned for the future. Service industry agglomeration, theme distinctive business center.
Not only that, but also integrating ecology into buildings, TOD-oriented public transport, fashion shopping, life services, catering, entertainment, education, and sports, leading consumers in their shopping experience enjoy the unique "waterfront culture" in Chongqing, the shopping and water entertainment, leisure and perfect integration.
It can be found that some housing companies are now learning about the new urban business, and industry insiders say that this consumer experience-centred consumption model, which combines shopping with experience, will also be a future urban development mainstream.
The present business circle is not only the collection of goods, but also the integration of artistic culture and creative themes, and also carries people's responsibility for urban residence.
Therefore, while satisfying the demand of consumers to eat and drink and buy one-stop material, maximizing the multi-level spiritual demand of culture and art, playing the habitable demand, is necessarily the high point of the future development of business circle.
In Chongqing, the North Shore Jiangshan, located in Jiangbei, near the Yingqiao, the world's commercial essence, international giants around, first-class brands together, and international fashion close links.
This is a bustling place, with the best of the world;
Dongyuan Jinyue has a good shopping environment, Dongyuan Jinyue near the Nanping business circle, enjoy the western and even the country's leading four-storey three-dimensional transportation system, enhance the shopping comfort.
In addition, the landscaping and landscaping of the two pedestrian streets of Huizhou Road and Wanda Square were upgraded, some 300 trees were planted, 40,000 square metres were reconstructed, and the image of Nampong was enhanced;
Lung Lake, near the first low-density waterfront business circle in Chongqing, is surrounded by nine parks with low density and high openness, making people more willing to stay and stay when shopping full-footed, slowly enjoying the fun of shopping, rather than being held back by the flow of people hurrying forward, really realized "walk-in shopping."
Today's commercial competition will only become increasingly fierce, how to kill a blood road in the seriously homogenized market, capture the future consumer's "shopping mecca" reputation, worth all real estate developers to think seriously.
The strategy of differentiation alone is far from enough. Only developers who are truly putting consumers in their hearts, eager consumers, and thinking about what consumers want, will be able to provide consumers with an extreme and simple shopping experience in the storm the market is full of laughter.
Of course, by the end of the day I think most happy is the people of Chongqing, have such a good shopping experience and business circle, put 10 years ago no one can imagine the prosperity of today.
Festival of Things: Consumerist revelry covers up real environmental prices
168.2 billion yuan, this is November 11, 2017, in the 24-hour period of the Sky Cat Double-Eleven Global Carnival, the turnover of Skycat user consumption.
Specifically, after the start of "Double 11," the cat's turnover in just three minutes exceeded 10 billion, 6 minutes and 05 seconds more than 20 billion yuan, and 9 hours broke 100 billion.
On this day, the total number of payments made by global consumers through PayPal reached 1.48 billion, an increase of 41 per cent over last year.
These consumption will bring in 812 million logistics orders.
And whether the Skycat net purchase platform or the PayPal payment platform, all belong to Ma Yun's Ali Group.
Ten years ago no one would have thought that the "Singles Day" subculture, created by self-deprecation by single youth on Nov. 11, would be picked up by electricity dealers as the "Double 11" shopping carnival today.
On November 11, 2009, for the first time, Alibaba used a marketing stunt called "Singles Day Promotions": No one is in love with you, so "Single Dog" is coming online.
As a surprise, Taobao was trading at $52 million a day, 10 times the value of its day-to-day trading.
Since then, "Double 11" has become the Alibaba-built shopping carnival, from the start of domestic buyer sellers amused themselves, to the current global influx of merchants, nine years on, the sky-cat "double 11 billion" more than 3,200 times that year, making Black Friday impossible.
With the "Twin XI" promotion, there are also a number of electric dealers, among which "Jingdong" is the strongest.
"Jingdong" has its own shopping festival "6.18," but no "double 11" has a big impact, this year from November 1 to 11, the cumulative sales of "Jingdong" reached 127.1 billion yuan.
And after "double 11," followed by the same kind of "double 12" discount revelry, Christmas New Year shopping period.
Across the New Year, waiting for Chinese consumers is also the pre-Spring Festival annual shopping period, Valentine's Day shopping period, consumption, will not holiday.
The environmental problems caused by the instantaneous mass consumption have attracted the attention of professionals and institutions.
At least 300,000 tons of garbage were generated during this year's "Double 11" period, according to the usual conservative estimate of 0.2 kg per packing box in the industry, according to the New China Daily Telegraph.
Liu Huawei, director of the pollution control program at Greenpeace East Asia, told China-Foreign Dialogue that this year's order for "double 11" cats will produce 160,000 tons of packaged waste.
The National Post Office issued a report in 2016, noting that the 2015 "Double 11" period (11-16 November) was about 780 million pieces of fast-forward, using more than 3 billion woven bags and 99.22 billion packing boxes 16985 million meters of tape, the length of which can circle the earth's equator 425.
And this year, the National Post Office expects the "double 11" fast-track business to exceed 1.5 billion pieces.
Wang Shi, the manager of a waste incineration center in Beijing, told Xinhua that more than 2,000 tons of garbage came in daily after the "double 11," which also exceeded the processing capacity of the burning station.
The express company has realized that the environmental pollution caused by the express delivery industry is not negligible.
Some electric logistics companies, including Suning, have launched recyclable plastic courier boxes, recycled packaging bags that can be used repeatedly as shopping bags and garbage bags before Double 11, but troublesome consumer acceptance is not high.
Ma also called on the logistics industry to support "green packaging" and "green logistics" in the microblog.
The microblog has harvested more than 68,000 "favorites."
What kind of mobile payment do Germans want?
Zhang Winter Fang: The mobile payment war in Germany is not expected.
Microsoft Pay and PayPal have moved the battlefield to Europe, the competitors have not changed, the grab of positions has not changed - the Chinese, this is also globalization?
Where there is a treasure to pay, there must be a micro-payment.
Under an agreement with Wirecard, a German e-payment service provider, Micropayment formally started landing in Germany in November this year and is gradually being laid out in European-wide businesses.
This reunion of the two "old country" took place in Europe.
All the while, PayPal and Microcredit pay in the path of globalization all the way up the song.
With regard to the globalization of China's mobile payments, the "China Third-Party Mobile Payments Industry Study 2017" concludes that there are two types: Strategic investment, empirical output, equity and support for local mobile payment enterprises abroad.
The second is to promote the mobile payment service to foreign merchants through the consumption behavior of Chinese tourists abroad, thereby changing the cognition and acceptance of Chinese mobile payment in foreign countries.
Indeed, the Chinese have the world.
China's rapid economic development, coupled with a large population base, is an attractive figure for Chinese tourists to spend in Europe.
But it is also doomed, this time in Germany the Chinese mobile payment war bureau is not to be expected.
The micro-credit payments and payouts simply moved the battlefield to Europe, the competitors did not change, the snatched positions did not change - or the Chinese, this is also globalization?
A more ground-breaking discussion is whether China's mobile payments can expand on Europe's mainland?
Consider Germany.
The Magic's "New Retail"
Chen Bai Lei, Yang Kaihan: Amazon announced its foray into bookstores and grocers as it squeezed into the world's top 10 retailers, both timing and motivation are well worth playing with.
In November 2015, Amazon opened its first physical bookstore in Seattle, followed by two bookstores in Portland and San Diego.
At the start of 2017, Amazon opened stores in New York and plans to have at least eight stores by the end of the year.
Almost at the same time, Amazon announced that its no-one supermarket, customers to the store do not need to line up, do not need checkout, enter the door sweep, take the desired goods to leave, the amount automatically from customers included in the account.
As far as Amazon is concerned, the sudden frequency of action on the physical store in recent years is a very unexpected thing.
Because as early as 2007's "Open Letter to Shareholders," CEO Jeff Bezos stressed that Amazon would not easily open a physical store unless the following four conditions were met:
1. We must be sure that this new opportunity will give shareholders a return on their investment;
We must be sure that this new opportunity is of great significance to the whole company;
3. We must be sure that this new opportunity is ignored by the market;
We must be sure that in this market, we have enough resources to make customer-oriented differentiation.
Bookstores and grocers, the most shaky classification in retail for both entities, are the first rivals to fall after the rise of Amazon.
Amazon announced its foray into the two physical markets as it squeezed into the world's top 10 retailers, both timing and motivation well worth playing with.
Is Amazon's approach, contrary to the assurances in the shareholder letter?
A similar voice was heard at the other end of the planet, where the chairman of Alibaba's board, Ma Yun, gave a keynote speech on the morning of October 13, 2016, at the Hangzhou Yunbian Congress.
"From next year, Alibaba will not mention the term 'e-commerce'," he said.
The era of pure electricity will soon come to an end, with no e-commerce for the next decade or two, replaced by 'new retail'.
The combination of line-up and logistics will produce new retail sales. "
For a moment, the words "new retail" are like magic, by industry people often hanging around the mouth.
But what exactly does "new retail" mean?
If it's just a combination of the line and the line, then the concept is not new.
In 2016, eMarketer tracked 180 of the biggest electricity dealers after estimating that total electricity sales were about $200 billion, with the largest 25 accounting for more than $159 billion.
Of the 25, 18 are traditional retailers that have only started operating online in the past five years (such as Macy's, Nordstrom, Target, Gap, etc.).
And Alibaba Group $28.3 billion into the stock of Su Ning cloud merchants, also in the past.
Globally, retailers and electricity makers are moving from a single channel to a full-channel retail system that covers physical stores, electricity dealers, mobile end and social media.
Is Ma Yunti's "new retail" more a summary than a vision of the future?
If not, what is the difference between the whole-channel concept and "new retail"?
Perhaps the key to the problem is not whether the line and the line will fuse, but how.
Looking back at the past 20 years in the retail sector, the rise of electricity dealers, like the rise of discount retailers in the early years, has focused on price and convenience.
Relying on these two pain points, the electrician moved highly standardized products, such as books and CDs, from the bottom of the line to the line.
With the development of online consumption habits and the continuous improvement of customer experience, the electric dealer extended the tentacles to other categories and began to improve efficiency.
In the words of Alibaba CEO Zhang Yong, "The use of Internet ideas and technologies to overhaul and upgrade the existing stock of about 30 trillion social retailers has enabled China's rising consumer demand to be effectively met, resulting in overall commodity production and circulation the service process is made more efficient by the widespread use of the Internet and big data.
Therefore, the electric merchant's road, is a surface light assets, the actual heavy assets of the road.
"Light" means that the burden of fixed assets, staffing, management processes, etc. is not large in traditional retailing; "heavy" refers to the need for huge investment in logistics, storage, etc.
The change of the logistics mode ensures the high efficiency of the electric dealer.
According to the Chinese government network, Premier Li Keqiang of the State Council chaired an executive meeting of the State Council on April 28, which considered expanding domestic consumption demand to be an important step in stabilizing growth and restructuring.
It was determined that specific programmes should be urgently developed by the relevant departments on the basis of scientific assessments.
Some foreign consumer products with high demand for domestic consumers are being piloted to reduce import tariffs by the end of June this year, gradually expanding the range of tax-reducing commodities;
Combining with the reform of tax system, consummate the consumption tax policy of popular consumer goods such as clothing and cosmetics, and adjust the tax scope, tax rate and collection chain;
The addition and restoration of duty-free shops at ports of entry, the reasonable expansion of duty-free varieties, the increase of a certain amount of duty-free shopping, the convenience of domestic consumers to purchase foreign products within the country;
Further promote the overseas passenger shopping clearance and tax rebate facilitation, strictly implement the entry goods according to the law active declaration of tax requirements.
Establish inspection and quarantine policy to support the import of cross-border electric merchants, clean up the import chain unreasonable charge;
Speed up the promotion project of Chinese product brand, support the development of physical stores, realize line-up interaction.
Regulate the market order, strictly fight fake and inferior, promote superior and inferior.
Let the consumer be close to comfortable, convenient shopping.
BlackBerry (BlackBerry) has not won hardware all the time, but in the face of peer-to-peer crowding, it has the Passport, which was released last September.
SONY (Sony) often has a variety of black-tech products coming out, such as the 4K reflex super-short coking machine, which was released at the start of the year, is one of them.
Of course, such high-end atmospheric products are also naturally expensive, with 5 million yen roughly the equivalent of 250,000 yuan, enough to buy a car.
Big-size luxury TV has always been the representative of the technical strength of the major manufacturers, this time with the soft LG brought 77-inch surface 4K OLED TV is typical of such products.

On January 18, Alibaba held a dialogue session in Chongqing to help boost poverty eradication and rural revitalization by exploring a new model of "Internet + poverty eradication."
This was followed by the introduction of the country strategy, the launch of the rural Taobao project, the upmarket pro-poor platform, the establishment of the Alibaba anti-poverty fund, Ali's "plus" against poverty.
The fight against poverty is one of the most important national strategies in China today.
Total poverty eradication has never been achieved in China in the past few thousand years.
"E-commerce poverty alleviation is a new round of pro-poor development innovation initiative, is to achieve accurate poverty reduction, accurate poverty eradication important grasp.
The central government attaches great importance to and points out that it can play the role of the Internet in the fight against poverty, promote accurate poverty alleviation, accurate poverty eradication, and let agricultural products out of the countryside through the Internet.
As a result, Ali proposed a rural strategy as early as 2014, along with big data cloud computing and globalization and listed as Ali's three core strategies for the next 20 years.
In the same year, Ali launched the Rural Taobao (Village Taobao) project to recruit "Village Two" in the countryside, leading farmers to get rich through electricity dealers.
In 2017, Ali worked with the business sector to create a pro-poor channel for Xinganong, which is now connected to 13 provinces across the country and 120 poor counties at the national level.
Ali Platform-inspired Taobao Village, already has 2118.
Of these, nearly 400 appeared in the provincial poor counties and 33 in the 13 national poor counties.
National Taobao Village sales hit 120 billion yuan in 2017 on Alibaba's Chinese retail platform.
Zhang Yong said that in the face of the national strategy to fight poverty, Ali has been thinking about how to use the technology, big data, cloud computing and other innovative capabilities of the Ali economy to get out of poverty.
Among them, the village Tao is the main carrier platform of Ali Electric Trader to get out of poverty, and went through a direct-selling Internet to get out of the new chain.
In the planting link, the village and ant gold clothing jointly carry out agricultural tools and micro-credit support.
In 2017, ant gold suits served 795 of the 832 state-level poor counties, providing them with convenient payments, credit and other services.
Vegetable birds solve storage and logistics, Skycat is responsible for sales, Ali Yun's big data back-feeding guide agricultural production, further improve the supply standards, quality and market competitiveness of agricultural products.
The development of electric merchants out of poverty requires not only products, sales channels, industrial planning, but also talents.
Through the Taobao University of Taobao to teach farmers standardized, quality and scale planting methods, Ali achieved the combination of "pro-poor + mental support" to keep farmers out of poverty in a sustainable way.
The courses already cover about 92 percent of state-level poor counties.
And the "public interest mentality, business means" anti-poverty thinking, can also guarantee Ali to be "truly pro-poor" when reducing poverty.
The chairman of Alibaba's board, Ma Yun, has said that poverty eradication should be divided into three stages: Poverty alleviation, poverty eradication and enrichment.
To reduce poverty is to give people to fish, to get out of poverty is to give people to fish, to get rich is to create a "fish pond" for farmers to have fish to keep.
The electric business-led industry is pro-poor, is to build fish pond.
In the field of industrial poverty alleviation, Ali and Shaanxi Lokawa in cooperation to create the model of poverty reduction in the apple industry, has been used as an example by the relevant departments to replicate in the whole country.
Ali Electronics's pro-poor work has also been recognized at the decision-making level.
The company, represented by Alibaba, has been sent the language, through the line down the channel, to ensure farmers increase production and income.
Some village sophomore and ant kimono employees were also invited to the United Nations and Africa to share the experience of electricity dealers in poverty alleviation.
At present, the China office of the United Nations World Food Programme has been working with the village to reduce poverty in the electrical and commercial industries in Anhui and other areas.
The Third Congress of the New Economic think tank, co-organized by the Ali Institute and the China Vision think tank, was held on January 16 and was attended by Zhang Li, Director of the Institute of Electronics of the Ministry of Commerce.
She believes that our globalization actually ignores the most important issues, namely, the body and use of globalization, and the stage of globalization.
This has led many to believe that globalization has stagnated, and that many developed and developing countries, in the new phase, have different attitudes towards globalization and are different from models.
The second concept is the question of the medium-term phase of globalization, and what are the constraints of the medium-term phase of globalization?
Constrained by the foundation of the economic environment, it is precisely because the economic base has changed the globalization has taken place the restriction.
Zhang believes the global economic adjustment at the end of 2017 is essentially over, with a new round of growth coming into the long term after 2018, and the next round of growth must be product-driven.
Jingdong's first fresh supermarket, 7FRESH, has recently opened and plans to lay more than 1,000 stores across the country over the next three to five years.
In addition to Ali's box of Marsheng, Yonghui's superspecies, Su Xingsheng of Su Ning and the fresh palm of the United States, "new retail stores" began to pile up on innovative models and even prices call the board.
Fresh supermarket competition has escalated, has become a new retail area of phenomenon-level topic, where exactly new retail is new?
"In 2018 we will quickly enter the country, before the Spring Festival in Beijing, Shanghai, Hangzhou will open a large number of shops."
Box Horse Fresh CEO Hou Yi revealed the 2018 hit-and-run at the second New Retail Summit on Sunday.
"Starting in 2018, the boxed horse is not just a fresh electricity maker, but a life-class electrician that meets the immediate services of consumers.
Under the core mode line is the stream, the experience, the line is the real sale.
Unlike the traditional big shops, supermarkets, box horses are rarely seen by many consumers as a fun and delicious "red shop," and even intermediaries have developed the concept of "box room."
Online platforms and offline retailers have their own advantages and disadvantages, but consumers appear in a variety of channels, so both sides are trying full-channel mode.
The industry believes there will be more and more outlets for Class Box Horse in 2018 in the broader context of the consumer upgrade.
And the box-horse continues to explore more areas of consumption from its original freshness, foreshadowing more innovation in the retail market in the new year.
"For example, the combination of business models on the line has attracted the attention of consumers, and fresh supermarkets from all over the place are called."
"But it's no use talking more about these relationships, and finally realizing whether you're bringing a good experience to the consumer, I'm willing to pay for it."
In the new retail environment, consumer habits have changed and the demand for purchases has changed, according to co-CEO Yuan Bing.
The original pure line, the line is cut, the line to beat the line, the line to counter the line, now is a hand-in-hand, because the consumer already has no line line under the distinction.
The capital of the competition into the market, let the current representative of the fresh supermarket as the new retail fire flavor full.
The analysis suggests that the current competition for new retailing in front-line cities is far from the Red Sea pattern, and that there are large areas of second-tier cities yet to be dug up and markets still have great opportunities and space.
Different types of industry for the new retail layout, will bring the development of new retail into a diversified state of development.
The CCTV financial channel and the Institute of Financial Strategy of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences collated a dry goods, which is this heavy annual report on the development of the Chinese electric business.

Total sales re-record growth back to accelerated track
Since 2006, China's online retail sales volume can be said to have been showing super-high growth, the estimate is that the net purchase is very fresh, do not go out also can buy things, too cool!
But starting in 2013, online retail growth began to fall below 50 per cent, with growth falling below 40 per cent for the first time in 2015, when it turned to 26.2 per cent in 2016.
But this year has been different, with online retail sales accelerating again, rising to 34.2% in January-September.
Much higher than the rate of growth in 2015, 2016.
Maybe people go around and find it more enjoyable to buy or buy.
Among them, online retail sales of physical goods amounted to nearly 508 million yuan, and online retail sales of services amounted to nearly 149 million yuan.
The share of total retail sales of social goods reached 13.6 per cent, an increase of nearly 3 percentage points year-on-year.
Students, do not doze off, draw the point, the service online retail sales is absolutely a big merit!
Second, the French netizens, who love chopping hands, buy $1925 per person, and they buy the most goods online, is clothing, is not guilty to love the fashion country.

Help you avoid the company becoming the next best start-up
Amy Eret once wanted to investigate employee well-being at her e-commerce start-up, but the survey didn't work.
Responses are often vague, unhelpful and, even worse, deceptive.
Even if she promises to take the form of anonymity, some employees still don't trust the process.
"There is a lack of consistency and objectivity in the responses received," said Madison Reed, a San Francisco e-commerce hair care company that manages 75 people.
So she called outside for help.
A new batch of human resources start-ups have sprung up to help companies understand how employees feel.
They build and authorize software specifically designed to measure employee participation, which allows companies to quickly conduct opinion polls for specific teams and population groups, provide anonymous and complaint hotlines for employees, and in some cases allow whistleblowers to bypass executives to report directly to boards.
"Now, you can track your health with tools like Strava and Fitbit, but where is the company's Fitbit?" Said Jim Barnett, co-founder and CEO of Redwood City startup Glint. The Glint software analysis tool is used by companies to measure employee commitment.
In three years, Ms. Eret said, she used Glint to gain more insight into what employees think and feel.
In addition to the team-specific fast-track surveys and opinion polls, Glint offers corporate hot charts, which units complain the most, and which managers approve low scores, at a glance - which gives her insight into why.
Companies began to realize that they had to master the company's workplace culture so as not to be the next best step, after a blog post by former employees described the harassment environment, and the speakers were punished by the company and then plunged into scandal.
For start-ups like Glint, this corporate desire for oversight is a money-free business opportunity.
The global governance, regulatory and compliance industry could be worth more than $118.7 billion by 2020, according to financial technology analysis website Let's Talk Payments.
Convercent, a start-up in Denver, Colorado, which works to help companies prevent and detect bad behavior, saw an increase in interest and activity during the damage to its reputation earlier this year.
Convercent has nearly 600 customers, including Epeyin, Microsoft and Tesla.
Good Step recently signed up to become a customer.
Like Glint, Convergent allows companies to send customized "diagnostic" surveys, collect confidential responses in real time, and view heat maps of their problem areas.
Convercent also provides an anonymous messaging hotline to let employees report bad behavior.
If the chairman is implicated, then the complaint will go straight into the board.
Patrick Quinlan, founder and chief executive of Convercent, said: "The opinion court usurped the powers of the regulator."
If a company is found to be bad at employees or unethical about their performance, even if the regulator doesn't step in, the company could face high consequences of consumer resistance, staff loss and involvement in litigation, Mr Quinlan said.
Ruby Tuesday, a catering chain that spans more than 500 places and has more than 25,000 employees, has been using Convergent for more than a year to ensure staff understand work guidelines and protocols and provide easy access to company headquarters.
Until then, if employees want to report problems, they must find a company headquarters phone number or email, file a formal complaint and hope that headquarters will take it seriously.
It was often a daunting and unsettling experience, as James Vitrano, general counsel for law at Ruby Tuesday, said he did not think there was a good way to track complaints from employees.
But now that the company uses Convergent, it can more quickly detect and address issues previously unknown to executives in remote offices, cities or states - such as discrimination, harassment or unfair wage behavior.
"I can get a more near-Earth, 360-degree full view of the work experience," said Vitrano, who runs the Ruby Tuesday risk management team.
"We are protecting our shareholders from employment litigation."
Mr Quinlan said companies had been paying more attention to ethics, values and staff professionalism since 2002, following the collapse of the Andorran accounting firm over the Enron scandal that violated ethics.
But it wasn't until "social media went into their own world" that companies realized they couldn't stop their exploits from going viral online.
"Before using technology to monitor ethics, people see hope as a strategy," he said.
Both Glint and Convergent provide their software as a service and charge companies a recurring fee for the use of their products.
Such business models and business opportunities are supported by venture investors who have already supported both start-ups.
In February, Convercent raised $10 million from companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, and its total capital rose to $47 million.
In November, Glint received $10 million from Bessemer Venture Partners, and its total funding reached $60 million.
Given the interconnectedness between companies, culture and venture capital, these investments are hardly surprising.
A growing body of research has shown that employees today expect more from the workplace than before.
In a competitive market like Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are just the stakes.
Employees want to feel that they are accepted, valued, and feel that their time is spent on a company with a positive mission.
"When people are happy to join the company and feel their voices heard and the work they do is beneficial, they are more committed to making the company successful," said Nina McCartney, vice president of global welfare and employee experience at LinkedIn LinkedIn uses both Convergent and Gint software.
Investors pay off when their portfolio companies perform well; companies do well when employees are loyal and dedicated.
It is not surprising that third-party analysis tools will look for financial support if they promise to increase employee loyalty and professionalism.
Workplace culture experts say it is important to have data on employee professionalism.
However, these data are of no use unless the company's administrators take action.
In fact, if a company asks employees for feedback, it can be expected that the company is making changes.
If change is not moving fast enough, or without a bit of progress, it could bring disappointment and lead to employees leaving the company.
"If you want to seek 4000 recommendations, you need to be ready for 4000 conversations," said Russell Raith, head of consulting operations at business management firm Cotter International, who has seen some companies rely too heavily on data acquisition errors.
"Because if you don't follow through, the employee will think, 'Did you really hear what I said?
Do you care?
If you don't care, why should I care?
Mr Eret said Madison Reed, who now conducts a monthly staff survey, had been able to take action on the day Glint reported the problem.
After collecting feedback from employees that they were frustrated by the speed of decision-making and the quality of communication, she was able to solve the problem by reorganizing the company's internal team and increasing communication training.
Ruby Tuesday is gaining new insights into its employees, and in the long run they want to be able to make a shift in an industry known for its high talent turnover and better retain staff.
"If you're not committed to creating a culture of transparency, you lose talent," said Vitrano.
"If you lose the talent, you will lose the customer.
And when you lose customers, you will lose the company.

NCAA cancels twice-a-day training to extend Bears' day training time
As time approached 11 p.m., UCLA football team members lingered for a chat next to the team's new campus practice field.
Some players have taken off their jerseys, revealing the sweaty body of the first day of intensive training.
For a big part of the team, this free few minutes is the break.
Players taking the summer course will return to the dorm for the final exam after three hours of practice, before returning to the Wasserman Football Centre for the meeting at 6: 30 the next morning.
"The next three days are a grind for these guys," Bears coach Jim Mora said as he headed into Tuesday on Monday.
The NCAA canceled two practice sessions a day (designed to ease the burden on players), but actually extended their day training time - at least until the end of Friday.
That's why UCLA's first three training sessions are scheduled to begin at 7: 15 p.m. to accommodate a schedule that players have jammed.
From cancelling two training sessions a day to more one a day, the Bears started training almost a week before last season, and Mora trained at the summer school for the first time in six seasons at Westwood.
They plan to start 18 training sessions from August 20 before starting to prepare for the official race for the first Texas farmworkers in September.
Mora said he supported the NCAA's rule adjustment, although that would add another item to the player's busy schedule.
"In three or four days, we're going to put a huge amount of training on them, very challenging," Mora said.
"They've just passed, too. They're honing, they're all great kids.
I thought about Saturday and we were going to have more time, really great.
UCLA will stop training as soon as the encampment is over, which is not an easy task given the clear view of the adjacent parking lot and the Luskin Center, which has been worn through the post-goal football net hurled and bruised.
The Bears will be staying at the hotel starting this weekend, but Mora admits problems could arise once the rooms are vacant during the season.
"We will take security measures," Mora said.
"This is a real concern. The idea that someone might rent a room and sit in a room and record a training scene is not far-fetched.
If you have a training tape, it's also pretty good.
But we will take security measures there, and security measures will be taken in parking lot No. 8.
We will use the resources available to do the best.
I don't worry too much about that.
We have a plan in place.

Facebook will launch fact-checking feature to crack down on fake news
Facebook, the world's largest online social network trying to crack down on so-called fake news, claimed on Thursday that it would send more potential prank articles to third-party detection agencies and show test results below the original post.
Facebook will start using newer machines to learn to detect possible pranks and send them to fact-checkers, and may display fact-checking results below the original post, Facebook said in a statement on its website.
Facebook has been criticized as one of the main dissemination points of so-called fake news, with many arguing that Facebook influenced the 2016 U.S. presidential election.
The issue has also become a major political topic in Europe, with voters suffering a deluge of false stories ahead of the French presidential election in May and Germany taking the lead in passing support for a penalty plan before the September election if social media networks fail to remove hate posts in time, a fine is imposed.
Facebook said in a separate statement in Germany on Thursday that a new fact-checking functional test was being launched in the United States, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
In addition to seeing which stories are being questioned by third-party fact checkers, people want more context to help them make sense of what they read and share, Facebook news feed product manager Sarah Sue said in a blog post decision.
Facebook will continue to test its "relevant article" feature and make other changes to its news feed to reduce fake news, she added.
Creating a graphic novel: The story of the Castle of England
The tiny Skotney Castle recently starred in the compressed version of the music film and at one point became a refuge for Lady Margaret Thatcher during the seventies and eighties.
But Skotney, who has witnessed a turbulent 700-year history in the comfort of the Belle River Canyon in Kent, is now made by Jamie Rhodes (a man who has a special penchant for historical documents and drags his head) the source of inspiration for the graphic novel written by the Yorkshireman.
"I could see the handwriting of the ancient people 300 years ago, and I found it so beautiful," he said, looking forward to it.
"What kind of interpersonal relationship this is to let this letter fall on my hands."
Across the Middle Ages until the Edouard era, the "One England Castle" reading book chronicles the families living in Skotney, each story by different, British future artists such as Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg did.
It was not Rhodes' first book to use the archives as raw material: He also wrote The Teeth and Other Stories of the Dead in 2014, a book inspired by British library literature that was completed with an uncontrollable creative passion the work.
"I couldn't contain the urge to write when I saw the thumb mark left on the side of the letter, which was written by a double agent who worked for the Jacobites in the 18th century," he said.
"That's his fingerprint!
And the letter has always smelled of smoke, because at that time, you need to ignite to have light.
For us 300 years later, the smell makes it feel like they are also around us.
Oh, I like archival literature!
For those impressed by the old paper, to have the support of the National Trust and Arts Council of England and to live in the castle for almost four months ("to tell the truth, I've been a little longer") seems fantastic...
Rhodes spent days visiting Victoria's New Castle, flipping through archives, studying the estate's many treasures and antiques, such as hyena heads hanging on walls, and bottles that had spent centuries in the moat, among others.
He strolled over the land and ruins of the old castle, chatting with wanderers, gardeners, and sometimes with the illustrated artist who painted his book.
Then in the evening, he would "drink some whiskey and write."
Scott's stealth history is not yet clear, as the National Trust is only fully in after the death of its last heir, Elizabeth Hersey, in 2006.
A decade later, when Rhodes arrived, staff began to process the files, which he described as "hundreds of years ago the nobles were going:" Oh, put it in the attic. "
"You would think land disputes would be boring," said Rhodes, "but there would be two families who would fight for a birch tree.
Let it go, guys!
Some of the stories in the work use castles as a starting point, leading to a broader study of British history, including The Labour, which leads with a man who left the newly built castle for the 1381 peasant uprising.....
"The story of the Knights Family of Kent and Sussex chronicled a riot in the castle in 1380," Rhodes said.
"The peasant uprising began in that area, and I think it's a good place to start an uprising.
Perhaps there is a connection between these two?
Other stories are deeply rooted in the history of the castle, such as The Priest, which tells the story of the Darrell family hiding a Jesuit priest for seven years during the period of British religious reform.
Or The Smuggler, whose ownership of the story is 18th-century smuggler Arthur Darrell, who is believed to have given himself a funeral by filling his coffin with stones (years later his coffin exposed the ground). Only found.
The Darrells are Rhodes's favourite Skotney Castle family: "These gentlemen seem to be rogue, always constantly borrowing money and spending money on things they cannot afford."
Generation after generation of Darrell men solve their debt problems by marrying rich old women, and I think they should be a group of handsome lads who know how to pursue women.
As his mission in the castle came to an end, Rhodes began to look for other bizarre writing experiences.
He spent two weeks in the Finnish wilderness to complete a drawing novel about "El?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
But Skotney has a special status for him.
"I left sadly," he said.
"It's like: 'Oh, I have to face the real life of the trough cake.'"
According to the news reporter, Zhongxing intelligent car team is based in Zhuhai, the operator is Zhongxing communication executive vice president Tian Wenguo.
Big energy companies are all "rich enemies," so who among the world's many energy companies takes the most advantage of money?
Yesterday, the famous PFC energy company unveiled its top 50 list of energy companies listed in 2011, with U.S. oil and gas producer ExxonMobil cashing in at $406.3 billion, followed by China Petroleum and Royal Dutch Shell.
In the PFC list, PetroChina was asked twice in 2007 and 2009, with ExxonMobil occupying the top spot for the rest of the year.
In the top 50 list in 2011, a total of three companies from mainland China were shortlisted, along with China Petrochemical, ranked ninth, and China Ocean Oil, 15th.
But despite the fact that oil prices are now much higher than they were four years ago, according to PFC's CEO, there are many reasons for the low total market capitalization, including a decline in North American gas prices and global stock market activity low.
According to the Xinhua news agency, heavy pollution in and around Beijing increased from 16 to 19, with an "explosion watch" in the city of AQI in Shijiazhuang, Xinji and Handan in Hebei Province.
U.S. changes green card rules
The United States will introduce new immigration plans to amend green card regulations, the media said, citing President Donald Trump's speech.
The scheme is intended to reduce legal immigration to 50,000 per year, and temporary work visas, as well as family-oriented visa applications, are subject to stricter regulations.
The new rules are proposed by Republicans and backed by the president.
The draft law will be discussed in both chambers.
"This law will reduce poverty, raise wages, save taxpayers billions of dollars, and realize these benefits by changing the way the United States issues green cards to citizens of other countries," Trump was quoted as saying by US media.
The law would replace the current program and reduce chain migration.

To optimize the landscape environment and build the beautiful South Yue, recently, the South Yue District Tobacco Bureau (Branch) "636" volunteer service team launched "mountaineering forest, love home" environmental activities.
The activities were not only supported by all the staff of the District Tobacco Bureau, but also attracted retired senior cadres and family members to participate in environmental practices. The three generations worked together, climbing forests and cleaning up rubbish to build the "beautiful South" a part of yourself.
This voluntary service, which aims to protect the landscape resources of Nanyue, promotes the concept of "caring for others, caring for society, caring for nature" and also allows the next generation to accept and pass on the virtues of volunteerism.
Since its inception in early April this year, the "636" volunteer service team has developed 16 members to visit stranded retail customers, help tobacco farmers to care for tobacco leaves, Ya'an earthquake love donations and other voluntary activities, become a volunteer force that delivers positive energy.

Sex robots are really on the rise, but we should be cautious
Just when you feel like 2017 is not going to be more bizarre, the sex robot field has released a new technology development report.
Yes.
Now sex robots are a big thing.
Recently, the Responsible Robotics Foundation (FRR) released a report looking ahead to the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years.
"We need to start taking the rise of sex robots seriously," said Noel Sharkey, an honorary retired professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of FRR.
Customers can choose the robot's eye color, nipple shape and nail type.
"People laugh behind their backs, but the big companies do launch a lot of sex robots and we will see more," Sharkey said at the launch of the new report.
Modern sex dolls have evolved from inflatable dolls into robots that have silicone skin, feel warm, and deliberately use artificial intelligence to set up a human-like sexual response.
Users can also "customize" their robots to satisfy their preferences, from eye color, nipple shape to nail type or color can choose.
But even more disturbing is the fact that many robots with "personality" make "replicating a petite wife" look sophisticated.
Modern sex toys have evolved into robots with silicone skin.
For example, the RealBotix robot is able to come from definitions, such as shyness, based on characteristics that users consider attractive.
There is also the Roxxxy Gold sex robot, developed by True Computer, which can pre-set personality traits, including a slightly shy "cool Farah" and "willing to take risks" of "wild Wendy."
"The Roxxxy Gold robot has the personality to match you as much as possible," says the True Computer website.
So she loves what you love and does evil to you.
She had the same little emotions as normal people in those days!
She can be lazy, can be talkative, can also be 'sexually active'!
The rise of sex robots brings a lot of unease - not just the replacement of real human relationships - but the humbling female character and the hint of rape pumping in the cool (read: Resist) Farrah is the most worrying.
True Computer compares Roxxxy to a man's vibrating stick on its website.
The website says, "If a woman has a vibrating stick, then why can't a man have a Roxxxy?"
Yet these sex robots are not a mere fetish, nor are they just a sex toy.
Their emergence and growing maturity point directly to the darker, deeper parts of our culture: Fleeing from perfect gender equality to sex with subjects as an add-on option.
Of course, most men don't have sex robots, and while FRR points out that sex robots are becoming more popular, they are still on the edge of consumer culture.
But what permeates from the edges allows us to see the course of this era in which we live.
Many people are uncanny and unaggressive until the free market gives them a chance to become so.
It is no coincidence that these elaborate sex robots have emerged in an era of global threats to women's rights, and that the White House also has a president bragging about sexual violence against women.
The most chilling part of the TV drama "The Handmaid's Tale" lies not in the realistic picture, not in the hanging body, nor in the eyes that are dug out, but in the overly real imagination.
The Republic of Gilead is a jump, but now it looks like this is not far away.
The goal behind these sex robots is to do everything technically possible to create bodies that are most similar to real women (though in proportion to porn stars).
The creators of these robots want them to have a human touch and mimic real human movements.
But to put it bluntly, their "personality" does not represent real women.
They cannot break up or run away.
They have no recourse agencies and no follow-up stories, no independence at all, and no possibility of breaking the illusion of outright slavery.
In other words, they are love slaves.
Or according to the popular word of 2017: Maids.
In ancient times, the Great Wall tells the story of an elite Chinese force fighting a life-or-death battle with monsters on the world-famous Great Wall to defend humanity.

"On the show, the same thing I won't do, keep up to date," he said.
Trump's great merit?
Make Mitt Romney the epitome of common sense.
Political divisions have polarized American voters and, from a microscopic point of view, have undermined the rapprochement of American families, which is no surprise to the Trump era.
Around Christmas and Thanksgiving, major American newspapers filled their op-ed columns with fear of how to respond to the vote-elect Trump relatives.
It is often assumed that we are doing all we can to puncture our "filter bubble."
Less vocal is the power of Trump to bring his family together.
I mention this because my cousin, a left-wing poet who lives in Chicago, has long been at odds with the Republicans in our home, and this week he is coming to New York to visit me.
She reminded me that coming together against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.
As a result of working with Trump in the White House, all the people she knew, including even relatives of Republicans who had been in a political row for decades, are now suddenly and strangely on the same front.
It would certainly be a good thing if it were all at the table, but what struck me was that, from a broader perspective, it would pose a significant risk.
While leftist figures have long been egged on by Trump, the warping effect of his presidency has pushed us all to the right.
When we talk about "normalisation" and Trump, we are referring to the possibility of concern that his outlandish behavior might stop some day.
There is, however, a more worrying long-term scenario in which Trump wants to "normalize" relations with right-wing Republicans, who had previously opposed the standards of Mr. President, and now suddenly look like a symbol of reason.
I find myself recently somewhat nostalgic for the Mitt Romney version of insanity: Putting a dog in a car, 14% income tax (but at least we know his tax returns), for the crimes of those two moves seem true too lightly.
After the Trump era has passed, the next Republican candidate only needs to rationally qualify for immeasurable improvement.
When my cousin lived in town, we took our children to the merry-go-round in New York Park, the largest merry-go-round horse run by Central Park Management in New York, if you don't need coffee, these three-dollar tickets you are the most valuable consumer in the city.
The sound of the Trojan horse is as loud as thunder, the central cylinder is designed for fiberglass, all the clowns and animals twist their heads, look at their shoulders in horror and danger, and the tinkling music strangely rings.
Too many vulgar cities are disappointing: The landscape from high-rise buildings becomes old-fashioned, the skyline becomes too familiar to offer too much excitement, and the reality of the city doesn't hold up the dream.
Thirty-five years later, I have not completely forgotten that day, I found that this "Swiss cottage" was not actually a Swiss cottage, but an old Swiss cottage in the theme bar. No, but near an intersection in north London.
However, Central Park's merry-go-round remains a magical experience, with everyone playing well for two 2-year-olds, an 11-year-old and four 40-year-old girls who are both available for the event happy.
If I could evaluate the merry-go-round, I would give it a full score, but fortunately no one asked.
But this week at a department store, before brushing a credit card, I was asked to score one to five stars on my deal, Experience.
The same is true in the coffee shop in the corner of my street, in addition to the option of scoring with a 15 per cent tip, which is for shopping on the counter.
The effect is not only to slow down what should have been a neutral deal, but also to put pressure on waiters to add personal factors to unwanted scenarios.
The poor woman in the department store was sorry to smile, while I was tired and the credit card trading experience gave her a five-star rating.
Oscar Pistolis moved from prison to hospital with chest pain
This is the second time Pistolis has left prison and transferred to hospital.
He was taken to the hospital last year to treat a wrist cut, which prison officials said was caused by his fall in the cell.
Pistolis was convicted of murder after prosecutors appealed the original wrongful killing ruling.
On Valentine's Day 2013, at his home in Pretoria, he shot Sting Camp several times through the toilet cubicle until his death.
Pistolis claims to mistake his girlfriend for the intruder who was hiding in the cubicle at night.
Prosecutors have announced their intention to appeal again, this time for a six-year prison sentence against Pistolis, which they consider too merciful.
The State Prosecutor's Office indicated that it would appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa and that the appeal could be heard this year.
If prosecutors win, Pistolis faces an increase to a 15-year sentence.
South Africa has no death penalty.

On May 18, the Ministry of Finance announced the Financial Management Scheme for the Special Award for Structural Adjustment of Industrial Enterprises, which will arrange special incentive funds to help defuse excess capacity in the coal and steel industries, totalling 100 billion yuan.
Recently, several local governments in Shanghai, Shanxi, Shandong, Jiangsu and Heilongjiang have proposed reforms to eliminate excess capacity.
Among them, many provinces have even suggested that they should actively seek financial support from the central government for their provinces' capacity to go.
One supporting evidence is that the coal-to-capacity target, published in just eight provinces, stands at 90 percent of the nation's coal production cuts.
In an interview with reporters, Lin Baoqiang, president of the China Institute of Energy Policy at Xiamen University, said the steel and coal industry's "go-to capacity" is not enough to rely on the central 100 billion yuan.???
The coal-to-capacity implementation rules recently published in Shanxi Province propose to restructure Shanxi Coking Coal Group into a state-owned capital investment company, reorganize the assets and operations of the enterprise and build a new business model.

Does meat, dairy and chocolate help alleviate inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)?
Meats and chocolates may sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.
But a new study suggests the opposite: A diet rich in meat protein and dairy products can help alleviate the associated symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease.
The incurable disease affects the lives of about 1.3 million Americans and about 300,000 Britons, leading to stomach cramps and abdominal bloating, recurrent or hemorrhagic diarrhoea, weight loss and extreme tiredness.
Researchers at the University of Washington typically advise patients to avoid eating meat and dairy products to relieve symptoms, but the researchers found that the key amino acid-tryptophan of proteins helps boost immune cell growth, which boosts gut tolerance.
Dr Marco Colonna, the lead researcher, explained that immune cells patrol the gut to ensure that harmful microbes hidden in food do not crept into the body.
There is a balance between the cells that cause inflammation and those that promote tolerance, protecting the body without damaging various sensitive and vulnerable tissues.
Inflammatory bowel disease can occur when the equilibrium state is too biased towards inflammation.
In the experiment, it was found that a cell that promotes immunity appears in mice carrying special bacteria.
Bacteria need tryptophan (one of the components of the protein) to form the appearance of the cells.
"We have established a link between a bacterial population (Roe Lactobacillus, which is a normal part of the gut microbiome) and the development of cellular populations that can promote tolerance," Professor Colona said.
The more tryptophan the mice consume in their diet, the more immune cells they have.
If humans use the same approach, he suggests, a combination of Lucian Lactobacillus and a tryptophan-rich diet could form a more stress-resistant, less inflammatory gut environment.
Luisa Cervantes-Barraganwas, a postdoctoral researcher, studied an immune cell that boosts tolerance when she discovered that one group of mice had such cells, but another. A group of the same strains were kept separately.
She suspected that the difference was related to the intestinal microbiome of mice (referring to bacteria, viruses and fungi that usually live in the gastrointestinal tract).
DNA sequencing of cholesterol in mice found that six bacterial populations were present in mice with immune cells, but not in mice without immune cells.
Mice are kept in a sterile environment, so they lack gut microbes and do not have this immune cell, and the presence of Lactobacillus produces immune cells.
To understand how bacteria affect the immune system, the researchers cultured Lucius lactobacillus in the liquid and then transferred a small amount of the bacteria-free liquid to immature immune cells isolated from the mice.
The immune cell develops into a force-resistant cell.
When the active ingredient is purified from the liquid, it can be proved that the active ingredient is a byproduct of tryptophan metabolism, called indole-3-lactic acid.
When researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in mouse feed, the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent, but when tryptophan levels were halved, the number of cells decreased by half.
Dr Cervantes-Barragan explains that people, like mice, have the same cells that promote tolerance, and that most of us have Lucius lactobacillus in our gastrointestinal tract.
It is not known whether humans, like mice in the experiment, can induce cell development from the tryptophan byproduct of Lactobacillus, but the genetic defects associated with tryptophan have been found in inflammatory bowel patients.
She said: "The development of these cells may be exactly what we want to get because these cells can control the inflammatory response on the surface of the gut."
It can be said that the presence of high levels of tryptophan in Lactobacillus may lead to an increase in the number of strains.
Jose Mourinho believes Manchester United sign 'talented' Nemanja Matic
After Nemanja Matic made his debut against the opposition in Sampdoria on Wednesday night, Jose Mourinho decided United had signed a 'talented' midfielder.
Martial, who is from Chelsea with a £40million signing, opened 2-1 in the final pre-season game of the league ahead of Dublin's European Super Cup against Real Madrid on Tuesday, winning Paul Bogba and Andreas Pereira favour.
However, on the Bruce pre-season Asian Tour, Martial is in a serious state of play and has only completed 45 minutes, with Mourinho admitting improvements are needed before the start of the Premier League season.
"He needs time, but he has the experience, the wisdom and the way the genius thinks - he thinks about football," said Mourinho.
"We'll help him get ready as soon as possible."
Mourinho began arranging his starting line-up at the start of the season, with new signings Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku also starting at the Aviva Stadium, as did Mattich.
The Independent reported this week that Mourinho still wants to bring in three more signings, but insisted that the club was "working well" and that he had four first-choice signings in his heart, three of which the club had introduced.
"I am very grateful to the club for bringing in three of these players," he added.
"I would have been happier if the club had been able to bring in all four players, but they have made a lot of effort for me," he said.
Will China lag behind if it does not build this type of warship at the climax of the global hatchback frigate?
With the recent announcement by the world's major naval powers of plans for the construction of new frigates, it seems that overnight frigates have become the focus of the naval attention of major powers, first in Japan's 2018 defense budget to purchase two new frigates after a substantial breakthrough, Lockheed Martin recently unveiled the latest plan for the US FFG frigate, where is the new Chinese frigate going?
With the downpour of one of the newest Type 054 A frigates in late 2017, marking up to 29 already built by the 054A frigate, it is close to the total of the 053H series from 2006 the first 054A has been under construction for 12 years, and even around the world, so many high-performance universal frigates have been built, with the exception of China, and only the United States in the last seven centuries the "Perry" frigates built in the '80s can be compared to each other.
And the simple reason why so many 054A should be built is that it is affordable, useful, and supplemented by years of naval debt.
The 054A frigate has been favored for years by the Chinese navy for its high cost and good combat power, with about 4,000 tons of water, carrying a 76-mm main gun, 32-unit sea red flag-16 fish-8 anti-submarine missile co-launch pituitary systems, 8 Eagle Strikes 83 and a straight-9 helicopter, although it was built in 2006 and was designed to be an early type of ship, but its combat power is not even present too bad to see the world's frigates can also reach the mid-level.
But this is, after all, a ship designed at the beginning of the 21st century, with its weapon configuration on one side and its power systems and electronic radar equipment already very different from the world's mainstream frigates, like the European equivalent. In the case of small multi-function phased array radar and large-size helicopter deck, it is time to develop a new type.
So how China's new frigate should develop is directly related to its future positioning and the strategic approach of our Chinese navy.
The future of China's navy is bound to be a blue-water navy, and the future is bound to be toward the ocean, with rapid deployment in areas where China's vital interests are at stake, demonstrating the presence of force and, if necessary, the vital interests of the region are not damaged, so it seems that the new type of Huiwei River is bound to develop into a large ocean.
Looking at the positioning of a new type of frigate in future Chinese naval sequences, the future Chinese navy should be similar to that of the United States Navy. Apart from the necessary offshore defense vessels, other major ships will form carrier battle groups or amphibious attacks, as needed ship strikes.
The role of a new type of frigate in the future carrier battle group should act as an anti-submarine main and near-central location, and in the amphibious assault ship strike group should act as a guard ship, according to such requirements the new type of frigate must have a strong anti-submarine capability and a good mid-range clearance capability.
Based on the above positioning, it is possible to think boldly about the appearance of the future domestic frigate.
In the first place, there will be a significant increase in the volume of discharge relative to the current Type 054 A frigate, which is estimated to be about 5,000-6,000 tons; a QC280 modified gas system will be used the combined power propulsion system, consisting of turbines and two diesel engines, is expected to have a maximum speed of about 30 knots and a significant increase in capacity; for weapons, 76 mm main guns and 1,130 near guns, one more red flag 10 launch system, the main gun should be followed by a 32-48 unit red flag 16 modified and a fish-8 pendant system, which should be fitted with a large 8-16 unit in the rear of the vessel systems are used to launch Eagle Strike 18 and new cruise missiles; hangars and downtime platforms will also increase to the parking and storage of two 10-ton helicopters; for electronic radar systems, high-grade equipment should be developed a small, four-sided fixed-phase array radar with a low-fitting, multi-function rotating phased array radar similar to the one on a European frigate.
As a result, the overall level of the new frigate will reach its current world-class level, even when compared with FFG in the United States.
Of course, the above concept is only the author's conjecture about the new type of frigate, how we can only wait until the new type of frigate under the water, let us look forward to it together.

In recent years, we have encouraged enterprises to participate actively in the construction of national, industry standards and regional group standards. We have awarded $300,000 to enterprises that are or are involved in setting standards for manufacturing groups in Zhejiang Province. The maximum amount of the reward inspires the enterprise to participate in the enthusiasm of the target.
Recently, Wang Li Group's production workshop, the group's head of the system, Gao Jian, together with staff, is packing a security door sealing box as a standard standard standard working sample for Zhejiang manufacturing groups to be sent to Shaoxing Quality Inspection Center.
Just two days earlier, Wang Li had passed the "Zhejiang Manufacturing" certification expert group's on-site audit.
Mr Gao said the professional team, made up of industry technical experts and quality certification organizations, praised the group's achievements in the core areas of quality excellence, independent innovation and agreed to be fully compliant and that Wang would be the first to test one of those businesses that passed the standard.

I. China's growing housing debt crisis
The National Financial and Development Laboratory of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, November 2017, according to data from a review published on January 17 in the overseas edition of People's Daily. The third-quarter China deleveraging process report, released by the National Center for Balance Sheet Research, noted that residential sector leverage continued its upward trend, rising 1.3 percentage points from 47.4 percent in the second quarter of 2017 to 48.6 percent in the third quarter, up 3.8 percentage points for the first three quarters of 2017.

Studies have shown that the liabilities of Chinese households in financial institutions are dominated by consumer loans, which account for about 2 / 3 of the residents' liabilities, or about 2 times that of operating loans.
Among them, home-based medium- and long-term loans account for about 80 per cent of consumer loans, but in incremental terms, short-term consumer loans are growing faster than medium- and long-term loans.
On top of that, China's household debt ratio only counts the total amount of credit the household sector receives from financial institutions, while Chinese households still have a lot of private borrowing, including borrowing from relatives and friends, with large-scale hidden debt.
It is surprising to see such data. According to statistics from the Suning Institute of Finance, China's residents' leverage rate was only 3 per cent in 1996 and 18 per cent in 2008, but it has started rapidly since 2008 growth has doubled in just six years to 36.4 per cent, and by the third quarter of 2017 residential leverage was already at 48.6 per cent.
By contrast, last May, HSBC released a survey of nearly tens of thousands of respondents across nine countries.
The report targets young millennials in nine countries (born between 1980 and 2000).
The report notes that China has a home ownership rate of up to 70 per cent for young people after 80 or 90, ahead of second-place Mexico (46 per cent) and two times the U.S. target (35 per cent).
The data tell us one of the most likely problems is that the biggest potential "grey rhino" for Chinese residents at this stage is estimated to be out of debt compared to not being able to afford a home.
II. Why is the housing debt crisis the most serious problem?
As in our previous analysis, while we have been saying that Chinese house prices are higher, China's housing ownership rate is actually quite high compared to the rest of the world, so it is not so expensive to buy a home now the problem with many friends is that you can still afford the loan?
As we look at real estate markets around the world, China's real estate market has not experienced a major real estate crisis since it started late, except for Hainan, as we said before, but just a decade ago the world financial tsunami began in the United States...
The cause of the US real estate crisis was blamed on two houses: Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
In the golden age of the United States, real estate companies sold their homes to low-income people at the time in order to expand their sales, and the real estate market was booming at a time when the American economy was good. With growth stagnating in the US economy, which has caused a drop in income for home buyers, large amounts of household spending are starting to fall.
But the current state of the United States was an integral part of American household assets and real estate assets, and almost all of America's low-income groups were real estate, while most of the top 20 percent of high-income groups were financial assets the higher the debt ratio for poor households' real estate.
A serious fact is that these people are buying homes when the economy is better, so the money to pay for a mortgage is also calculated on their better income, and when there is a downturn in income, not only is the mortgage pressure without a reduction or even an increase in subprime lending, the housing problems of these American families have evolved into a real estate crisis.
So some people can't afford the mortgage because their income is too low, so the banks begin to take back the property and sell it at a very low price when the banks take it back from delinquent buyers, leading to a gradual decline in house prices in the region. It also triggered a further decline in house prices, creating a vicious circle in which more and more buyers, after falling to a certain extent, found their homes worth even less than their own loans, and more people continued to stop repaying the mortgage has caused more bad debts.
As a result, a huge vicious circle has formed:
"The economy is depressed - incomes are falling - some people cannot afford to pay their mortgages - banks are selling their homes at low prices - house prices are falling - more people stop paying their mortgages - banks are selling them again - and house prices are falling...."
The problem is more than that, because house prices continue to fall, and you don't have a debt when you stop lending your home to the bank, and if the money you get from the auction house is not up to you then pay back, simply assume you paid £600,000 on a loan of £2.4 million to buy a house that was worth £3 million at the time, and when it fell to just £2 million, you stopped lending the house to the bank after the bank auctioned the house, you lost not only your own initial payment of 600,000, but also your debt to the bank of 400,000, you still have to pay the money back.
Thus, in such a vicious circle after another, the United States economy gradually collapsed, eventually triggering the 2008 financial crisis in the United States.
So the fact that China's household debt ratio is at a high of 46.8% at this stage is a matter of great concern. The figure is still below that of developed countries, but the problem is beginning to grow and the country has stressed repeatedly since last year deleveraging is a very prescient judgment that household debt ratios, if allowed to continue to climb, are bound to raise huge risks, so be wary of the emergence of financial risks.
So after the house is used to live, not to fire the positioning, the state is more accelerated to establish multi-subject supply, multi-channel guarantee, rent purchase and raise the multiple measures, further defusing the potential risk.
For our individual families, we must abandon the speculative thinking of real estate, do our best when buying a house, and avoid a huge burden on our families. Only a reasonable assessment of their income and debt levels is a healthy path to family wealth development.

British inventors implant chips in their own bodies and wave in to get in the car
A British inventor installed a chip for himself, simply waving a wave to open his front door, enter the office and even start the car, becoming the first person in the country.
Steven Northam, 33, implanted a tiny chip between his thumb and forefinger and is now offering the service to companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives, implemented by his company, BioTeq, through technology.
He has joined forces with Dr Jeff Watson, a senior consultant anesthesiologist at the Royal Hampshire Hospital in Winchester, Hampshire, to ensure the implant process meets medical standards.
The technique is similar to a cat dog chip implant, and takes just 30 seconds.
Mr Northam's company will also change the locks of rooms and vehicles to be compatible with the chip, costing £300 per lock.
The married father, who has a child, has now installed the technology for both his home and his BMW Z4, and he can start the car as long as he puts his hand on the steering wheel.

White House props cost thousands
According to military records released by Time magazine, last month the White House decided to transport a Marine helicopter to the South Lawn to highlight the immense glory of American manufacturing at a cost of up to $24,000.
Green-and-white Sikorsky VH-3D (also known as Marine One when the president was riding) is an important exhibit on the White House's July 17 campaign to highlight American construction projects.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and senior White House officials toured manufacturing products from all 50 states.
Exhibits include a Connecticut-made helicopter, a Maine yacht, a Wisconsin fire truck and a Mississippi forklift.
The White House military office asked the helicopter to show up on a daily order (FRAGO) to land on the South Lawn for the special, according to records from the Force Marine Corps Helicopter First Flight Team (HMX-1), which operates the helicopter it was only 36 hours before the event.
The day before the event, Commander HMX-1, in an e-mail to the superior Marine Corps Flight Deputy Commander, said, "I just want to make sure you know, because this event is highly valued."
The information indicates that the helicopter will arrive on the South Lawn at about 7am on July 17 for the 3pm event, leaving only after the lawn was cleared at 6pm to 9pm on the same day.
The message also said in case the departure time from the White House was delayed, the return flight would require a second crew because of the time limit on duty.
The original crew was on standby at the helicopter side during the event, while security forces personnel were on standby nearby while the aircraft was on the ground.
The records obtained by Time magazine do not clearly indicate whether a second crew is ultimately required.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using government property for political purposes.
Records noted that HMX-1 had asked if the event was a violation of the bill.
"One of the questions we asked was whether this was a violation of the Hatch Act and was told there was no violation," the commander wrote.
"It sounds like you are locked," the deputy commander replied.
The White House defines the "Made in America" campaign as an official event and is therefore not governed by the Hatch Act.
But even official activity is politically charged.
At the event, the president promoted the topic of the Senate at the time: Health care reform, and trumpeted control of government regulations.
The use of Marine Corps One or Air Force One aircraft for political propaganda purposes is nothing new.
Successive presidents have been asked to travel on these planes.
But it is not common to expropriate them for photo purposes only.
Trump received attention in February when, in Melbourne, Florida, the presidential jet glided slowly, ending up in the background cloth of his first campaign rally, and his Twitter account was flooded with complaints about the former president's use of presidential jets.
"The White House is excited by this' Made in America 'exhibition, which shows products from all 50 states that are manufactured by American workers using American materials," said Lindsay Walters, a White House deputy press spokesman.
The HMX-1 crew regularly conducts flight training near the Washington area and on the South Lawn, practicing the accurate placement of the US president in the White House.
HMX-1 practiced 58 landings at the White House during Trump's G-20 summit in Germany in early July.
The U.S. manufacturing flight was included in crew training requirements this month, an official said.
The helicopter unit also flew an extra 11-hour "non-presidential support mission" on the same day.
The White House said the taxpayer did not cover the cost of any other props at the event.
A Sikorsky spokesman said the company was not involved in arranging the South Lawn helicopter display.
HMX-1 does not keep the budget records for the presidential flight, so it is very difficult to determine the exact costs incurred by the event.
However, according to the Ministry of Defence's hourly cost records for fiscal year 2017, the VH-3D Ministry of Defence is reimbursed at US $24,380 per flight hour.
The force recorded a 30-minute flight each time the plane flew from a base at the Quantico Marine Corps Airport in Virginia.
The White House said the cost of operating the helicopter was far lower than the cost.
Mr Walters said "it is very misleading to estimate the costs incurred by the taxpayer on the basis of reimbursable expenses."
These estimated costs include personnel costs, maintenance costs and many other sunk costs included in the annual appropriations.
A 2015 RAND study showed that the MoD's reimbursable expenses do not include personnel costs, but do include oil, maintenance and contracting costs.
At the time, former White House press spokesman Sean Spicer defended the use of the helicopter for the event,
"The idea is to show what is made in the United States this week,
And I know both Sikorsky and Connecticut are proud of it, both of them contributing a force to our national security, and I suspect that hundreds of jobs, if not thousands, depend on it.
And I feel that, like most Americans, we are all proud of this helicopter and other military equipment, the result of the indefatigable efforts of countless Americans.
So it is certainly not out of place to highlight this. "
We don't know if Trump interacted with the helicopter as he toured the South Lawn during the event, but he did get on the driver's seat of the fire truck.
Inside the White House, Trump addressed Sikorsky's representatives, joking with the media about the company's aircraft he owned.
He said, "I know the Sikorsky plane well. I have three."

From 2005 to 2011, our provincial GDP rose from the middle to the bottom of the table, according to the Market Star.
However, the economic growth of our province still has the dilemma of low investment efficiency and lack of core competitiveness of the industrial economy. To this end, the provincial economic information center's latest issue of Economic Blue Pages recommends improving the quality and efficiency of economic growth.
Based on some representative indicators of the economy of our province in 2005 and 2011, they are compared with the national and central regions.
In terms of industrial economic benefits, in 2011, a significant proportion of industrial energy, raw materials and other energy-intensive industries in our province were affected by market fluctuations and overcapacity "double pressure," while leading industries such as appliances and automobiles lacked innovation, resulting in a meagre profit.
However, the large amount of investment did not bring corresponding economic benefits, which is the main reason that the economic growth quality and efficiency of our province is not high.
In this regard, experts suggest that effective measures should be taken to encourage enterprise innovation, and the scientific and technological achievements of universities and research institutes should be "transferred" to enterprises in a timely manner.
For the low economic benefits of industry, experts say, should also actively promote industrial merger reorganization, optimize industrial layout, extend industrial chain.

UK General Trade Union (GMB) looks at investment targeting McVitie's Glasgow factory
The union wants the cookie maker McVeigh's management to pledge a long-term commitment to production at the Rasco plant.
The UK General Trade Union Scotland said it had been "silent" about the future of investment in the Tollcross plant.
The plant has more than 500 employees and produces products such as oatmeal biscuits (Hobnobs), thick tea biscuits (Rich tea).
Pladis, owner of McVeigh, said the company had invested more than five million pounds in the plant over the past few years.
He added that if there were changes in factory operations, employees and union representatives "would be the first to know."
In a letter to the director of the company, the Scottish chapter of the British General Trade Union called on McVeigh to "resolve the problem of money not being carried over to the modernization of the production line."
Drew Duffy, senior organiser of the UK General Trade Union, said: "We are unable to get a clear picture of Tollcross's future business needs and investment plans from the general manager of the plant, which makes our members. Deeply concerned.
Generations of families working here, and a high concentration of labour in the local community and the Greater Glasgow area, are important pillars of decent employment in areas with high unemployment and social deprivation.
So, in terms of jobs, pay and economic prosperity, in the context of Brexit, rising living costs and a long-term decline in manufacturing, the east of Glasgow desperately needs McVeigh's expanding production network.
A spokesman for the company said: "The director of Tollcross has just received a letter from the Scottish branch of the UK General Trade Union yesterday and the company will respond immediately as we value continuing contact with employees and union representatives.
Two months ago, we had a regular meeting at Tollcross with staff and representatives of the UK General Trade Union to discuss a number of issues publicly.
We had discussions with staff and then, like all other companies operating in an environment of intense competition and economic uncertainty, we reviewed the continuing operating model we applied to businesses and factories in order to remain competitive.
She added: "In recent years, we have invested more than five million pounds in the Tollcross plant, particularly in production lines and operational improvements."
We are fully aware of the historic status of Tollcross as a production base, and if there is any change in our operations at the plant, employees and union representatives will be the first to know.
On May 11 th, the deputy director of the Tibet Sports Bureau of the Tibet Autonomous Region, Neymar Zhiren, said at Mount Everest's North Slope stronghold that the future clean-up of living rubbish on the northern slopes of Zhufeng would be a public benefit move towards normalized behavior led by the Chinese government and involving all international circles.

Paris Saint-Germain will not give up signing Neymar after making an offer of 189 million pounds to try to get it to exercise the exemption clause, but have they warned Barcelona three years ago to launch an attack on the world record attacker?
The sensational approach has opened the summer transfer window with the Bundesliga club set to break the world transfer record at more than double the previous transfer record, with Paul Bogba returning to Manchester United last season for £89m.
Once the transfer is complete, Neymar will jump to become the highest-priced player in the world, as well as the highest-paid professional athlete in the world - Paris Saint-Germain offering after-tax pay of more than £500,000 a week.
Barcelona were angered by Neymar's approach and the way out, and sources with knowledge of the Catalan team's board insisted the club had been doing all it could to care for him after his arrival from Santos in 2013.
But has the president of Paris Saint-Germain made such predictions about the football world three years ago?

"I'm not worried because they know that if they come into contact with any of our players, we will definitely be pitted against them and we will contact their players as well," Alhlaifi said.
"We respect all the clubs.
But if they try to sign up for our players, then they will do the same. "

Paris Saint-Germain have made it clear they will not allow the Italian international to leave anyway, and Barcelona are likely to be heavily affected by the loss of centre-half talent Neymar.
