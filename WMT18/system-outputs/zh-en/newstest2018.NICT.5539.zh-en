Last week, a temporary suspension of the old-fashioned drama "Beauty's Private House Cuisine" accidentally sparked a heated discussion about the fake ratings of domestic dramas.
Civil rights groups issue travel warning against Missouri
As a result of discriminatory policies and racist attacks in Missouri, the NAACP has issued travel warnings to people of color preparing to travel to Missouri.
"the NAACP Missouri Travel Advisory, which came into effect on 28 August 2017, calls upon all African-American travelers, tourists and Missouri people to pay special attention and exercise extreme caution when travelling in Missouri as a result of a series of recent suspicious racial incidents in Missouri," the group's statement said.
The NAACP noted that a recently passed Missouri law made it harder for people to win discrimination lawsuits and that law enforcement in the state partly targeted minorities, prompting the group to issue travel warnings.
Violations of civil rights are happening to people.
They were stopped for questioning because of their skin color, beaten or killed, "Rod Chapel, president of NAACP, Missouri, told The Kansas City Star.
"we have received many complaints, an unprecedented number." "
This is the first such warning issued by the organization in the United States against a state.
The organization cited racial slurs against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, a 28-year-old black male from Tennessee.
Sanders, who died in suspicious circumstances earlier this year, was detained without charge by Missouri police after he ran out of fuel while traveling in Missouri.
The consultation also noted that a recent report by the Missouri attorney general's office showed that "black drivers in the state are 75 percent more likely than whites to be stopped and checked."
"the consultation was to raise awareness and warn people about what might happen to their family, friends and colleagues in Missouri," Chapel said.
"people need to be prepared, whether it's carrying bail to Missouri or letting relatives know they travel within the state."
Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest data from the FBI's hate crime reporting program; based on the number of crimes, the state ranked 16th nationally.
The travel warning is also a response to a new Missouri law that would make it more difficult to prosecute housing or employment discrimination against businesses.
The move comes after U.S. states passed immigration enforcement laws requiring local law enforcement to detain immigration violators, and the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) said the move would increase the number of racial lawsuits and issued travel advice for Texas and Arizona.
Travel warnings are usually issued by the U.S. government against other countries, but more recently, advisory groups have taken this approach in response to certain laws and trends within the United States.
After the "golden age" of the 2015 box office surge, the overall film market in 2016 entered a period of calm, and the ability to break through last year's total of 440.69 billion yuan became a suspense.
According to figures released by the National Bureau of Statistics, the price of new and second-hand homes in Beijing cooled in October, rising only 0.6 per cent and 1.1per cent.

The BBC calls Beijing the most exciting city: Making foreigners feel "living in a new era"
Beijing may have a long history of 3,000 years, but it is also rapidly becoming the modern glamour city it is today, according to a report in the British media on January 18.
The Chinese capital, with its surprisingly fast Internet, sophisticated technology such as face recognition software, huge investments in artificial intelligence and unrivalled international energy, is one of the most exciting cities for exploring foreigners.
"if I can be successful there, I can be successful anywhere in the future," said Clemens Seshi, a German expatriate who cited the lyrics of singer Frank Sinatra's praise of New York City, according to the BBC website.
"if Sinatra lived to this day, he would probably sing about a city like Beijing," said Serhi, who works as creative director at Voyager Archives, saying that living in the city will make you feel "living in a new era" and always keep up with the trend.
"the general feeling that people are at the centre of something grand is hard to say, but it keeps many foreigners there for a long time. They want to see what it will become and want to see for themselves," Simon Norton, who is based in England but recently living in Beijing, said in an article on the personal blog site 4Corners7Seas.
The city's premium high-speed internet and technology friendly environment make daily life easier than ever, the report said.
"Beijing is rapidly turning into a cashless society, with the internet integrating the functions of traditional wallets into smartphones, making it easier for everyone to do a lot of deals," said Andy Penifueldt, from Manila, who is currently co-editor at the Beijing Children's website.
But smartphones are just the beginning of Beijing's technological ambitions and facial recognition software has become popular, with many mobile phone apps using the technology to make bank transfers and payments, get people into apartments and offices, and even use it to verify the identity of the driver of the Netflix, the report said.
Beijing also recently announced plans to spend 1.38 billion yuan to build an artificial intelligence technology park where more than 400 companies will work, focusing on developing artificial intelligence technologies ranging from biometric to self-driving cars.
Food is also at the heart of many major festivals in the Chinese calendar year. Participation in these celebrations is highly appreciated by foreigners, and the Spring Festival is one of the most important social and economic festivals and one of the most accessible to foreigners.
"I suggest helping Chinese friends prepare for the New Year, cleaning their apartments and putting a red spring union with New Year's greetings on their homes is just as important. On New Year's Eve, all family members gather together for a big meal, then stay up until midnight and welcome the New Year with loud fireworks.
Beijing has a large and growing number of foreigners, but China's language barriers and the ease of communication between foreigners can easily be an excuse for not being fully integrated into local culture, the report said.
"some foreigners have been living in China for years, but have little experience of their host country, and if your initial attempts to reach out to the Chinese are not successful, it's easy to have or feel easier to get along with other foreigners," Seshi said.
In these so-called "foreigner bubbles," which refer to foreigners mixing only among foreigners, without contact with locals and local cultures, foreigners gather in their own communities, eat in Western restaurants, and have only foreigners among their friends.
The easiest way to overcome this is to learn a little Mandarin - which is easier than one might think.
"an hour or two of private Chinese classes a week or an entry-level radio drama should suit everyone's busy schedule," he said.
Even learning a few classic short sentences can help with shopping, ordering a meal in a restaurant or chatting in a taxi.
Stubborn air pollution is also a fact of daily life, although government efforts in recent years have contained some of the problems, the report said.
Residents stressed the importance of outdoor activities during warmer months when pollution tends to be lighter, using blue sky days as an opportunity to hang out in the historic alleyways or explore the popular Japanese Park.
"Beijing is the Chinese city that can find the most things below the surface, and you can find very good art and music activities, indulgent nightlife, historical wonders, ultra-modern business districts and ancient alley areas," Norton said.
According to the report, the role of ageing as an obstacle to the growth of human capital is increasingly evident, especially in the north-east, where the average annual contribution of ageing to human capital growth is -1.28 per cent.
Pan pointed out that the risk of cross-border capital flows is manageable and the fundamental factors underpinning the balance of payments are still long-standing.
Beijing, Dec 17 (journalist Gao Kai) The 2016 International Forum on Restoration and Conservation of Ancient Chinese Books and Paintings opened on December 17 at Renmin University of China.
The European Commission in April accused Google of forcing phone manufacturers to preload software such as Google Search and Chrome browser, otherwise it would not be allowed to use other Google applications.
The European Commission sees the move as detrimental to consumers and an impediment to competition.
EU regulators initially asked Google to respond by July 27.
If convicted of antitrust charges, Google faces a fine of up to 10% of its global revenue, or about $7.4 billion.
Google was not immediately available for comment.
Google is also facing an EU investigation for favouring its own shopping services in search results.
Zhang Yining's stay is real, it can be said that he achieved from the country green to the "jump" is not by accident, and his leap to growth is still surprising.
A graphic to read: The legal status of Bitcoin around the world
Summary: In addition to the price correction naturally triggered by speculative attributes, the collapse of the digital currency has something to do with the "old enemy" - regulatory risk.
From the visual map, the East is more conservative about bitcoin than the West, and the countries that dominate the world are still waiting for the legitimacy of the digital currency, representing the "black swan risk" remains large.
* This article is from Wall Street View (micro-mail ID: Wallstreetcn), editor Wang Mun. For more highlights, please visit wallstreetc.com, or download the Wall Street View AP. *
The global digital currency, led by bitcoin, suffered a bloodbath this week as regulatory storms erupted in major bitcoin markets such as China, South Korea and the European Union, and the price of bitcoin fell below the $10,000 psychological integer on Tuesday, its biggest daily drop in three years.
In addition to the price correction naturally triggered by speculative attributes, the current slump in the digital currency has something to do with the "old enemy" - regulatory risk.
At this important juncture, the visual big-data website PostMuch.net has produced a map showing the legitimacy and degree of regulation of bitcoin in countries around the world.
Green represents the legal market for bitcoin, as shown in the figure below; orange represents the neutral market, although it has not publicly legalised bitcoin status, but there are no major restrictions on its use; pale pink represents restricted markets, where local governments try to use digital currencies through red line policies or regulation; dark pink represents countries where bitcoin is defined as illegal; and grey is a country that has yet to comment.
 (Pictured above from the Albert Much.Net visualization team mapping on 15 January) 
The paper points out that the traditional Eastern countries have a more conservative attitude towards bitcoin than the West, as can be seen from the distribution of non-green color blocks.
Russia is currently the largest country to define bitcoin as illegal, China is one of the largest restricted markets for bitcoin, and India is one of the largest countries that has yet to comment on bitcoin and has no policy in place.
North America and Western Europe are the regions with the highest acceptance of bitcoin, that is, the distribution of green blocks is more concentrated.
In the Middle East and Latin America, the perception of bitcoin is sharply divided, with a more mixed distribution of color blocks in the region.
Iraq, Iran, Turkey, Brazil are all legitimate Bitcoin markets, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Bolivia and others have some restrictions on their trading and use, and more Latin American countries have yet to speak out about bitcoin.
Taken together, the data show that a total of 99 (or 40 per cent) of the 246 countries surveyed globally do not impose restrictions on the trading and use of bitcoin, namely green and orange areas.
Seven countries (or 3 per cent) are restricted markets (pale pink), 10 countries (or 4 per cent) define bitcoin as illegal (dark pink) and 130 countries (or 53 per cent) do not yet have more treatment of digital currency information (grey).
This suggests that the countries that make up the world's main body (53 per cent, more than half) are still waiting to see the legitimacy of Bitcoin-led digital currencies within their borders, and that the "black swan risk" of bitcoin remains high, as some of them may end up with legislative decisions to limit it.
The paper argues that global regulators have not fully understood the emerging category of digital currencies and may be the main reason why most countries have not yet taken a position.
While Bitcoin's "popularity" has grown exponentially since last year and does not represent the interest of all countries, some may be concerned that local French currency is threatened as a result, or more worried about digital currencies being used by criminal organizations.
Wall Street has written a detailed summary of international regulatory news against bitcoin since last week, including China's move to crack down on online platforms and mobile App, South Korea's continued consideration of shutting down the digital currency exchange, the EU's belief that bitcoin is not yet widely accepted and warning investors of the risk of "losing money."
From any point of view of regulation, acceptance / criticism, and adoption, 2018 will be the first year of digital currency for central banks around the world, as noted by Wall Street editor-in-chief.
The criticism of Bitcoin's legitimacy by big powers such as Russia is also intended to make way for the official issuance of digital currencies.
Madrid, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Barcelona's new aid Coutinho made his first appearance in a Barca shirt at the Nou Camp on Tuesday.
Coutinho had passed a medical examination of Barca that morning and had signed a contract with Barca's president, Najib, which was due to expire in the summer of 2023.
He then appeared as a Barca player in front of nearly 7,000 fans at the Nou Camp.
According to Spanish media, Coutinho's transfer fee, which amounts to 160 million euros ($7.77), is the first in the history of the Barca club and La Liga.
With Coutinho still injured, he will have to rest for nearly 20 days to make his debut in a Barca shirt.
What else is sacred?
Now Trump's White House is targeting the Statue of Liberty
The most definitive sign of regime change was when they began to attack the statue.
Americans, like anyone else, agree with this, and as a result, Saddam Hussein in Baghdad's Paradise Square was deliberately knocked down in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the Trump administration's key think tanks, must have known what would happen to his symbolic cut-off of the statue of liberty during a heated debate with CNN's Jim Acosta over the president's proposal to impose strict restrictions on legal immigration.
To be fair, Miller did not attack the statue itself.
If he does, then a group of cruise ship owners and liberal followers will surely eat him alive.
But he did attack the significance of the statue, especially when Emma Lazarus's famous poem was engraved on the base in 1903 (the monument was built 17 years later).
As Miller chided Acosta, "I don't want to talk about all the facts of history here, but the Lady of Liberty is a symbol of American freedom to light up the world...
The poem you are referring to, which was added later, is not part of the original Statue of Liberty. "
In fact, Miller is right, but as he himself said, it's not really about history.
This involves a modern echo of Lazarus's thriller, and the only country that seems to invite not only any old immigrants, but also the poorest of the poor: "your exhaustion, your poverty, or your crowded masses eager to breathe freely, / The suffering people reject your crowded beaches."
There is no "suffering people refuse" at a moment when our screens become more prickly.
Miller, who has not worked in literary commentary, made it clear that these people would not be welcome in the United States in the Trump era.
This conflict over the meaning of the statue is part of a broader political and cultural war: It is actually in conflict with the American spirit.
Lazarus, as well as her friends who held events after her death to engrave her verse on the base, are well aware of the highly political nature of the acts in which they are participating.
The sculpture is intended to express the connection between French and American republicanism through an old, classic metaphor as the female incarnation of the Lady of Liberty.
Lazarus changed this meaning: In her poem, the female image is no longer abstract, she wants to voice.
She gave herself a very different name: The mother of exile.
The combination of the poem and the painting was a successful feminist coup and a devastating blow to nativism in the United States.
Just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, the right has always wanted to change it back to its original meaning.
Rush Limbaugh, the great speaker who came to Trump as a Baptist, argued in 2010 that liberalism was not an invitation to anyone, and that he was now an early neoconservative who brought America's flame of wisdom to the world of ignorance: "the goddess of liberty is brave."
She meant to carry the torch of freedom from the United States to other parts of the world.
The torch is not the way to light up America, "he said.
Unusually, Lin Bo was actually moved by something.
The significance of the statue depends entirely on the cognitive perspective.
Lazarus's imaginative approach is to be able to see it, when the tired, poor but hopeful will be able to see it on the deck of the ship after a long and often terrible journey.
On the surface, this involves looking at the world from the perspective of those who seek asylum and have the opportunity to improve their lives.
Her statue conveyed to them the meaning of hope and welcome that they needed to hear.
Of course, this is not a view that Miller and Trump wanted to admit.
Their torch is not to light up the road, but to ignite the hatred of their only source of power.
In 2006, he joined Universal in a unique style of music, becoming the first Chinese to sign a contract with Universal's UK headquarters.
World Championships 2017: Neil Black highly praised the Scots in the UK squad
Eilidh Doyle recalled that there were only two Scots in the British national team at the time.
Neil Black, executive director of the British Athletics Association, said a team of 16 strong Scots in the World Championships team would make a "significant contribution to the national team."
The number of Scottish field athletes selected for the 2017 London Athletics World Championships, which open on Friday, is the highest in history.
Blake believes that "Scotland is making extraordinary progress" and that British track and field athletes must learn from it.
"we accept and try to understand that, and we will stick with it until we succeed," Black said.
"I talk to people at the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they do.
Scottish track and field athletes think it has to do with what they do.
The British Athletics Association believes this is related to their actions.
Even street people think so.
No matter what the situation is, this is extremely brilliant. "
A number of Scottish track and field athletes are medal contenders, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart, who will match Mo Farah in the 5,000m, while Eilidh Doyle has been chosen as captain of the team.
"ed is a little modest.
Her captain's speech was really incredible, "Black said.
"many track and field athletes, whether or not they are Scots, or no matter where they live or train, walk out of the door with pride and enthusiasm.
Ed's natural passion and true feelings are very good, "he said.
The Commonwealth silver medallist, who competed in the 400m hurdles in his fifth world championships, said it was "incredible" that there were 16 Scots in the British national team.
Previously, the highest number of Scottish track and field athletes in the World Series was seven, or the number of entries made in 1983 and 2015.
Middle runner Muir is the leader. She has set five British records and two European records in the past year.
She will compete in the 1500m and 5,000m events.
Chris O'Hare, who is competing in the 1500m event, is another Scottish player to watch, having previously scored well in the season, winning the UK National against qualifiers and the Olympic anniversary race respectively.
Doyle recalled her participation in the first world championships, when the only other Scot in the team was Lee McConnell.
The captain said she was deeply proud that so many of her compatriots would not only join the team but also, in some cases, challenge medals and compete to reach the final.
"what's special about being captain of the national team is that it's voted for by the rest of the national team, so it's a great honour for me to know that your teammates voted for you to go for the most extraordinary achievement anyway," she added.
"of course I am very proud of all the Scottish players.
It just shows how far we've come.
And they are the established track and field athletes here, the track and field athletes who are about to make their way to the podium.
How was my captain's speech?
Well, I think it's fantastic.
I have just referred to the fact that, in this case, we are very lucky because we have the World Championships at home.
That is why it is really important that we build on our home support and that we grow as a result of our return to the Olympic Stadium.
I will get a second chance to compete and the atmosphere there will be fantastic, "he said.

Shield critics in face books: Don't run for office if you can't stand the blame of voters
The father of our nation understands the style of bad media.
Americans love Washington, but soon after, major newspapers began slamming him for everything, from domestic policy to political principles.
He was annoyed by the criticism, no doubt about it.
But he did not silence these critics.
Because as early as 1783, Washington said, "freedom of speech is denied - and we will be slaughtered like a lamb in silence and ignorance."
It made me think of Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, who needs to learn from Washington.
Hogan's staff blocked and deleted the posts of at least 450 people as they posted their views on his Facebook page.
The American Civil Liberties Union filed a lawsuit against him earlier this week.
The governor's staff dismissed the lawsuit as hasty, with online reports littered with their strong resistance: "who cares?"
A lot of people say "it's just Facebook."
But, it's important.
This is particularly important because it is facing people like Hogan.
This is a Republican who served as governor in a state with a democratic majority, and he's surprisingly popular.
Of the 50 governors in the country, he received the second highest praise.
Hogan is not a reactionary edgy.
He was smoothly in charge of Maryland, strictly following the rules.
He is also very good at using Facebook as the main way to connect with voters, playfully showing off his post-chemotherapy bald head on his home page for the first time.
So it is totally unnecessary, and ultimately dangerous, to block people who come to comment on the governor's home page, which is a public forum, an official management platform touted by public tax-paying employees.
In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan's spokeswoman, Amelia Sasse, defended the governor's actions, saying she thought blocking their comments was simply an attempt to keep them in check.
But they were too hasty to describe it as a monster or a cynic sweeping the web.
The Washington Post has spoken face to face with people blocked by Hogan.
They are just ordinary people talking to their own elected leaders: They are teachers, small business owners, and priests, and they are not a monster.
They say that their comments have depth, respect, and are not lewd.
The priest, who quoted the Bible in his post, called on Hogan to remember his Catholic faith.
Lakshmi Salma Lamani, a lawyer for Bowie, Maryland, was not cynical, but she asked about hate crimes.
'i am polite to comment that I am disappointed that he did not respond to hate crimes and other recent news events, 'she wrote in the Washington Post news story review section.
I also don't like a bunch of people commenting on the same topic, because these people will be directly ignored by some people as so-called crowd psychology, rather than treating them as a group of citizens who are worried about their country. "
What the governor's staff called "intensive garbage information bombing" may seem to others to be "insistence."
The Facebook era makes it easy to modify a message, only to shield a critic or delete a negative comment.
And it is far cleaner than it used to be, and to do the same in the past years would require sending staff out to collect and burn newspapers with critical comments, or to arrest or silence protesters.
But that is really what is happening right now, but on a digital level.
Hogan is not the first public official to be blamed for snoring others on Facebook and other social media.
President Trump is being sued by Twitter users because he blocked them on Twitter.
Last week in Virginia, there was a landmark ruling on such issues.
According to District Judge James C. Kataris of Alexandria, United States of America, the chairman of the Loudoun County Oversight Committee has violated the First Amendment by blocking voters from her Facebook home page.
Kentucky Gov. Matt Bevin (R) has also been patronized by the American Civil Liberties Union for his use of Facebook and Twitter.
It shouldn't be so hard.
In the Washington era, affordable postage had a similar influence to the Internet.
The number of news newspapers has increased fourfold between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letters have been written sharply criticizing his leadership.
And even at that time, there were anonymous hordes against him in Washington.
People have written to the newspaper to criticise Washington for its decision-making.
According to historical documents collected by the George Washington newspaper's online project, his office was inundated with petitions criticizing his attitude on the Treaty of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation between His Majesty the King of England and the United States of America, signed with the United Kingdom.
But he did not silence them.
Freedom of expression, freedom of dissent and freedom of speech are the foundations of this country.
And real leaders need to accept that.
The wind and grass movement of the property market silk all affect people's sensitive nerves.
The restriction is a hard bar of the real estate regulation policy in many cities.
In May 2017, a provision was issued for undergraduate students to pay social security for six consecutive months and enjoy the same housing policy for local residents of permanent residence;
In June, Wuhan introduced a policy that requires college students to graduate within three years on the basis of a graduation certificate and an employment certificate.
Then policy added, the official said, "college students can buy a house at 20% below the market price";
In July, Chengdu issued a regulation that young people with a bachelor's degree or above in a foreign university can apply to Chengdu on the basis of their graduation certificate.
In addition, some cities or regions, such as Kunshan and Shanghai, have also introduced "talent introduction" policies to lower the threshold for the purchase of talent.
Zhang believes that this is actually the competition of the big cities for the population, especially the talent, to retain the population, especially the talent, the city is competitive, which is the most important significance of these real estate policies.
Some even argue that this means that the time has come for the housing market to be "limited" to be cancelled.
The film was planned for a long time, the director said on the same day, the first adaptation of the script was in 1999, and even to find the Golden City Wu to play Yan 13.
Ronan Lafferty looks forward to enjoying the feeling of home at Renaissance Club
The East Lothian Renaissance Club hosts the 25th Scottish Evergreen Open, and former European champion Ronan Lafferty will enjoy the feeling of home for the next three days.
The Northern Irishman, who led Archerfield Links next door to the final last year but lost to Paul Iris, now works for the new venue, representing the club's founder and chief executive, Jerry Salvati, as an ambassador for the event.
"I have witnessed the establishment of the Renaissance Club and we will witness its glory through this competition," Lafferty said.
The athletes will see the best face and the best form of this stadium.
Jerry set up the place unrivalled.
He is a passionate advocate of the competition and he is very proud of his achievements here.
This is the best stage to show this stadium, "he said.
England man Ilves is looking forward to defending his title for the first time, although he has won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour in his 32-year career.
"it's really very special," he said.
I did not defend the Estremadura Open because in the second year of my victory, the match was cancelled.
It feels amazing to come to this place,
It's wonderful to play golf here.
Last year's memories come up, and for me and my wife Sharon, last year's win has a special meaning for us.
That was really a special memory that we will always remember, "he said.
Back in the race was Gary Orr, who turned 50 earlier this year and then took part in the European Evergreen Tour.
This time he is playing in Scotland for the first time since the 2013 Scottish Golf Open.
"it always makes more sense to go home and compete in the country," he said.
You want to do well; but you can feel the extra pressure.
I really enjoy being able to play again, I've been playing golf.
I'm very satisfied with the current situation, "he said.
Joining the on-field trio are former Masters winner Ian Woosnan and Evergreen competition winners Paul Brodhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNuerty.
Of the six Scottish players on the field, Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are two, while the other four are Andrew Audconn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Lang and Ross Drummond.

In August, 57 cases of continuous daily punishment were carried out nationwide, and the newly revised Environmental Protection Law implemented at the beginning of this year clearly added to China's environmental law enforcement efforts, the director of the Environmental Protection Bureau of China's Ministry of Environmental Protection said in Beijing on Tuesday.
At present, environmental protection organs in all parts of China may use punishment methods such as daily continuous punishment, seizure and seizure, production restriction and suspension, and transfer to administrative detention to investigate and punish environmental violations and cooperate with judicial organs to punish environmental crimes.
In August, a total of 335 cases of seizure and seizure were carried out in various parts of China; 177 cases of production restriction and cut-off were carried out; 189 cases of administrative detention were transferred and 166 cases of suspected environmental pollution crimes were transferred.
Among them, Henan carries out the daily continuous punishment of 7, at present, China is from the end of the control to the whole process embedded, full force environmental pollution control.
Despite the downward pressure on the economy, China's Ministry of Environmental Protection has previously made clear that China should properly handle the positioning of environmental protection in economic development and strengthen its "green fixed power." the more the economic growth rate goes down, the more it can't relax environmental protection and play an optimal role in the economy.
There is no highest, only higher, Guizhou Maotai share price in the innovative high road can not stop at all.
The shares hit a new record high on January 9, closing at 782.52 yuan, with a total market value of 98.3 billion yuan, just a step away from the trillion-dollar market value.
The guided price of $1,499 was up $200 from the previous retail price of $1,299.
On December 28, 2017, Guizhou Maotai announced that the study decided to raise the price of Maotai wine by an average of about 18% from 2018.
The move spurred a surge in the share price of Guizhou Maotai, which rose 95 yuan, or more than 14 per cent, in the eight trading days since the announcement of the price increase, according to the Beijing Morning News.
Statistics show that in 2017, Guizhou's 1-3 quarter gross domestic product was 95 billion yuan, and Maotai's market value left the province's GDP far behind in the first three quarters of last year.
Under the drive of Maotai, the liquor listed companies have opened the pace of price increase control, sitting on the dividend of consumption upgrade.
Since 2017, the share prices of most of the liquor-listed companies have continued to rise steadily, with more than double the number of shares in Waterfield, Wuyuan, Shanxi, and Guizhou Maotai.

Russian media say Putin will have a new domestic car: The unit price is 15% cheaper than Mercedes
Russian Minister of Industry and Trade Vladimir Manturov said the unit price of President Vladimir Putin's "motorcade" started at 6-7 million rubles, Russian media reported on January 18.
The budget target is to keep the price at 15 per cent lower than the Mercedes-Benz S class.
Russia's National Institute of Motor Engineering (NAMI), the president's main research and development unit, will deliver 16 vehicles to the Federal Guard Service between late February and early March, the company said.
The "fleet" project, which has a budget of 12.4 billion rubles, calls for the use of a unified modular platform to build three types of cars - longer cars, three-car cars and minibuses - for the country's top leaders, the report said.
News of the creation of the president's first domestic extension car since the Soviet Union came about five years ago, according to a plan by the research and development unit to install 800 horsepower engines and armor, weighing six tons.
It is reported that the engineering team of the German Porsche company was involved in the development of the power unit.
Mantulov told reporters that the "fleet" of cars will be available for retail sales starting in 2019 and will be available in a variety of configurations, the agency said.

"no one dared to walk around the village after 5 p.m.," she said.
It was a rare glimpse of daily life in the Papua Highlands, once a Dutch colony that was incorporated into Indonesia after the 1969 referendum, but it was also controversial, when only 1,026 elders were forced to vote by show of hands in front of the occupying army.
The current campaign for independence and against Dutch rule was quick to point the finger at the Jakarta government, which imposed high-handed rule over the region and isolated foreign journalists and activists.
In 2003, the province officially split into the provinces of Papua and West Papua, while Papua New Guinea independently controls the eastern part of the island.
It would take a 90-minute plane from Chayaprah, the provincial capital, to get there, and a five-hour drive by car, all the way to the bottom of the stomach.
There is no public transport here.
In this town of about 19,000 people, the wooden house is surrounded by bamboo fences, and the pleated tin roof is a yellow-brown cover made of rust.
Few Indonesians come, not to mention journalists, and there are few foreigners.
Before the arrival of the Christian evangelist, the Mee Pago Papua people believed in a god called Uga Tamee.
There are other changes here, too.
"we can't get used to these clothes," she said, referring to her brightly coloured hand-woven headscarf, dark shirt and bright half-skirt.
"we used to cover our bodies with only leaves."
Papua is the poorest province in Indonesia, where 28 per cent of the population lives below the poverty line and is the region with the highest infant mortality rate and the lowest literacy rate in Asia.
But this is also the Jinzhou of Indonesia.
The largest and most profitable gold mine in the world, Grasberg, is only 60 miles away and is owned by Phoenix-based Phillip McMoran Bronze Gold, which is located in the Highlands, about the same size as New Jersey, with 153,000 people.
In 2015 alone, Phillip mined about $3.1 billion worth of gold and copper mines here.
In addition, Papua is rich in timber resources, with an estimated value of $78 billion.
But these rich resources are also a source of tragedy for the Papua people, and Indonesia's powerful military might has been able to keep them down.
According to a 2005 New York Times investigative report, the company paid nearly $20 million to local military personnel and troops between 1998 and 2004, up to $150,000 for an official alone.
The Papua people's growing desire for independence has threatened the golden lord and they have been subjected to cruel treatment.
According to activists, more than half a million Papua people have been killed and thousands have been raped, tortured and imprisoned by the Indonesian army since 1969.
According to the Asian Human Rights Commission, the mass killings in the tribal heights of Papua in the 1970s had escalated into genocide.
Last year alone, Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful protesters.
A 2016 report by the Catholic diocese of Brisbane, "We're going to lose everything," includes evidence of the previous year's atrocities, such as extrajudicial executions, torture - another report says rape and electrocution are particularly common - and a brutal crackdown on peaceful demonstrations.
"the violence is happening every day, so it's hard to count the number of victims," said Andreas Halsono, an Indonesian researcher at Human Rights Watch.
Papua's resources attracted large numbers of migrants outside Indonesia, and oppression began.
Eighty-three per cent of the province's population of 3.5 million is Christian, but its demographic structure has changed since the arrival of Muslim economic migrants from the densely populated islands of Java, Kalimantan, Sumatra and Sulawii.
Java's snack stand sells fried chicken and vegetables with a mix of more and more, with peanut butter.
The locals fought hard.
"those immigrants started selling chicken and vegetables in traditional markets at a lower price than the local Papua people," explains Ampos Yu, a 24-year-old native of Paniai, who moved to Chayaprah, the provincial capital, to look for work.
This has cost the local Papua people - the women of Papua - their market, "he said.
Indonesian President Zoko Widodo, often referred to as Jokowi, vowed during his 2014 election campaign to address inequality and abuse of power in Papua.
The once carpenter's path to Jakarta's presidential palace is supported by 27 of all 29 districts - including Paniai.
But Papua has changed nothing, and today, the locals feel betrayed.
Yoo said "we are heartbroken and we voted for Zokovi in 2014 in the hope that he will live up to our aspirations and restore fairness."
In fact, just two months after Jokowi took office in October, Paniai has suffered his worst nightmare.
On December 7, 2014, 11 children in Enarotali were singing Christmas carols in front of a bonfire outside when two Indonesian soldiers suddenly rushed over on a motorcycle.
The frightened children told them they should turn on the headlights.
One of the soldiers, who was unhappy with their tone, then returned with four soldiers, according to the local priest, Yvette Tebay.
Victims and witnesses said the drunk soldiers used their guns to chase the group of children.
One of the soldiers then fired a gun at the group of children.
Yulianus Yemin, 16, was left in a coma after he was badly beaten.
A few hours later, the nearby government body, the Electoral Commission building, burst into flames, and the incident escalated the next day.
About 1,000 young Papua men, women and children gathered at a football stadium in front of the local police station and military command centre to demand justice.
Armed with a ceremonial bow, they danced the waita dance of the Papua Mee Pago tribe - running around in circles and mimicking birdsong.
Some of the protesters began throwing stones at regular military posts.
When emotions continued to intensify, soldiers received orders via internal radio: "if the crowd resisted more than three times, shoot immediately," according to an official document seen by Time magazine, but the document was not released to local media.
Jeremias Kayamu, 56, the head of the Kego Koto neighbourhood of Enarotali, felt the danger was imminent and called on the crowd to calm down and begged them to return home.
But no one was in the mood to listen to him.
Standing on the porch of his brightly coloured wooden house, he told Time magazine, "When I turned around, my left wrist suddenly got shot."
Kayama still doesn't know who fired the gun, but he said the bullets came from among the assembled soldiers.
He added that "it was crowded, they fired a lot of shots."
He witnessed the shooting and saw Olfyus Juul shot three times in the body, according to his cousin, who is a local.
Yohanes sadly told Time magazine, "I ran over to check his body to see if it was him,
I found him dead... I kissed him, "he said.
The chief inspector of Papua police, Yoje Mende, told reporters that his subordinates were simply "protecting" the police station because it had been attacked.
"when someone threatens to kill us, we have to defend ourselves," said Phuket Sulistio, a spokesman for Papua police in 2015.
It is a matter of life and death. "
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and many more injured.
The next day news of the killing spread only slowly in Jakarta.
Three weeks later, Jokowi gave an emotional speech in Chayaprah, expressing deep sympathy for the victims' families and vowing to address the abuse of power left over from Papua history.
"I hope the case will be resolved as soon as possible so it doesn't happen again in the future," he said.
In October 2016, the security minister said he wanted to set up a non-judicial mechanism to address the historical legacy of human rights violations.
But the excuse for the push also sounded almost immediately.
"most of the violations occurred a long time ago," he said.
Some were in the 1990s and early 2000s.
The focus is that we are committed to addressing these violations, but it needs to be a process, "he said.
Then, on June 5, in Jakarta, Mr. Villardo, speaking with Time magazine, said he had no plans to set up a complaint mechanism in Papua.
Instead, he said, "everything will be resolved in accordance with the law."
The United Nations has filed a complaint against Villando for "crimes against human rights" over the deaths of more than 1,000 people in East Timor's bloody independence vote in 1999, but he says 11 human rights violations in Papua have been resolved, including the Paniai incident.
The families of the victims of the Paniai incident scoffed at these statements.
"I've been interviewed four times in the last three years, but things haven't progressed at all," he said.
Years later he said "I'm tired."
He still lives in fear now.
He said "I was scared.
I was afraid of being arrested by the army, I was afraid of being shot, "he said.
His brother, Yucabus, also believed that the people of Paniai were afraid to talk about the incident.
He said he was beaten by the military after helping bury four victims.
He said "after the body was buried, the military came to me."
The shooting did not stop.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police shot and killed villagers in Deyai county, a neighboring county of Paniai.
A construction company manager refused to help transport a unconscious man to hospital as the two sides clashed, killing one and injuring 17 others, including children.
A 24-year-old man who drowned while fishing on a nearby river died on his way to the hospital.
Angry villagers protest in front of the company's field office.
Police said villagers threw stones at officers, so police fired warning shots.
But the riot mobile unit (Indonesian paramilitary police) began shooting at the crowd and one person was killed.
"we were all panicked and now we're afraid they're going to get revenge," Domingvale Buddy, 29, who lives near the hospital where he witnessed the wounded being rushed to hospital, told TIME.
"I hid at home for two days." "
The Deyai parliament has called for the police involved to be brought to justice and riot control mobile units to be evacuated from the area.
It has always been a place for the Indonesian government.
The lack of effective development has contributed to the discontent of the people of the Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal tribes, which are scattered in the lush central heights of Paniai.
Many have joined the Free Papua Movement (OPM), a rebel army that claims to protect the rights of the Papua people through scattered attacks and raids on the abduction of Indonesian soldiers.
Part of the senior leadership of the Free Papua Movement was born in Paniai, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Judas Kogoya.
As a result, thousands of Paniai have been arrested and deliberately detained by the military in recent years under the guise of "safeguarding national sovereignty."
Some never showed up again.
In the eyes of the people of Papua, Paniai is a "place of forgotten tragedy."
Poverty breeds discontent.
He sold so little rice that the locals simply couldn't afford to buy it.
Bread is simply out of reach.
People here grow everything they can eat: Mainly sweet potatoes and some fruit and leaf vegetables.
Farming is a woman's job, and every woman can take care of four or five sweet potato fields.
They usually leave most of the harvest for writers and sell the rest on the local market.
Ten sweet potatoes are worth only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Over time, economic inequality has opened up among the local Papua and new immigrants, whose numbers have increased significantly since the opening of the new route to the airport.
The small amount of work available usually falls into the hands of better educated and richer immigrants.
Papua people rarely have the funds or the necessary skills to run competitive companies.
"young people don't want to stay in this village... because there are no jobs and no money," said John Gobay, president of the Paniai Tribal Council.
Papua is isolated.
In addition, restrictions on international media coverage remain tight.
Earlier this year, French journalists Frank Escudi and Basel Lonchan were expelled from Papua because they "did not cooperate" with the agencies involved, even if they had been given rare permission to shoot.
According to Hashim Kane, deputy director of Human Rights Watch Asia, Zokowi's election pledge to lift reporting restrictions to promote transparency and development has not been realized.
"if foreign journalists try to cover Papua and West Papua, Indonesia's most eastern disgruntled provinces, they have a new risk: Denial of visas and blacklisting," he said in a statement.
The absence of media oversight means that international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely confined to Papua's neighbours.
In March, six Pacific countries - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands, Solomon Islands - asked the United Nations Human Rights Council to investigate "all kinds of widespread human rights violations" in Papua, including the Paniai shooting.
These countries have also supported the Free Papua Movement.
"there is still democracy in Indonesia and freedom of the media, so it is very difficult to hide evidence of human rights violations," Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesman Almanata Morsi told reporters in Jakarta in response to the group's allegations.
Locals want more foreign governments to pay attention.
When Dutch human rights ambassador Keith Wan Barr led a delegation of officials to Chayaprah on May 4, local people broke their silence and pleaded, "We want freedom," according to a person familiar with the matter, who also attended the meeting but requested anonymity.
Indonesia will hold its next presidential election in 2019, but Papua says it is unlikely that they will do so again.
Gobai, the president of the tribal council, said "Zokovi's intentions were good, but he was surrounded by people who were involved in the Paniai shooting."
He wants Jokowi to know that the people of Paniai not only live under the threat of a greedy army, but also have nothing, a region with little education and poor public health care.
Gobai said the people of Paniai, like the rest of Papua, thought their vote for Zokowi was a debt he had to pay.
He said "they don't need money, they need justice."
Even under threats and intimidation, the families of the victims of the Paniai shooting made their last symbolic resistance: To bury the body of one of the victims opposite that military police post.
They know that justice may never come, but at least they won't let those responsible forget their crimes.
He bowed his head and said, "My family has been killed,
What else can we do? ""
On February 10, 2017, the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) approved the start-up application of Guangdong Shanghai Home and Home Co. Ltd., issuing a listing pass for Chinese companies on the Shenzhen Stock Exchange, more than 20 days after the start of the IPO.
According to the industry, with the product home matching and European home access point listing, the custom home area that is already in the wind will change from product competition to capital competition.
At the beginning of the new year, the custom home industry, a typical representative brand, will be on the market, attracting the attention of the entire home industry.
Beijing, Sept 9 (Reuters) - Samsung Electronics on Tuesday unveiled components for its first self-driving car in a joint venture with Harman International, as well as information and entertainment solutions, in a major move into the automotive electronics market, the company said.
Samsung Electronics acquired Haman International about a year ago.
At this week's Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas, Samsung released car cameras with collision warning, lane shift warning, and cruise control features that were developed in collaboration with Haman.
Samsung plans to start shipping the camera system this year, which is built on technologies such as automatic machine learning and augmented reality.
Samsung also features a "digital cockpit," a system that allows users to download drivers' information from mobile devices and clouds, even if the driver is not the owner of the vehicle.

Fire again engulfs Dubai 'Torch' Mosman Tower
A fire at one of the world's tallest residential buildings in Dubai on Friday forced hundreds of residents to flee the 337 metre, 79-story ultra-high building.
It was the second fire to sweep high-rise buildings in just two years, and happened to take place in what is known as the "Torch."
The building has been evacuated, no injuries have been reported and the cause of the blaze has not yet been found.
'we were sleeping and then we were woken up by the fire alarm and people started screaming.
We ran down the stairs and it took about 10 minutes to run down the 50th floor, "a resident named George told Reuters.
The fire brigade put out the blaze at around 04: 00 local time (0000 GMT) and is cooling the building, civil defence authorities in Dubai said.
The Government indicated that efforts were being made to provide places of refuge for those affected.
The accident could once again raise concerns around the world about the safety of high-rise buildings using external wall materials.
An investigation by the management of the Torch skyscraper in the wake of its 2015 fire found that most of the objects damaged were cladding outer wall panels for decoration and insulation.
Police in the UK have said they believe problems with the insulation and cladding system at London's Grenfell Tower may have contributed to the rapid spread of the fire in June, which killed about 80 people.
The Williams team also hinted at the possibility of a return, although he has announced his retirement.
With only a month to go until the opening of the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea, on January 9, the atmosphere in South Korea has become increasingly strong as the Olympic flame is preheated from the south to the north and preparations are under way.
South Korean public opinion expects the long-standing inter-Korean talks to bring an egg a month to the countdown to the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics.
The Pyeongchang Winter Olympic flame arrived in South Korea on November 1 last year.
The boom of the flame was directly reflected in ticket sales for the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics.
Just over two months ago, the rate of ticket sales for the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics hovered at 32%, compared with 4.3% for the Winter Paralympic Games, which at one point raised concerns about the popularity of the Pyeongchang Winter Games.
But as Li Hee-fan, chairman of the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics organizing committee, recently predicted to reporters, "As the Olympic flame passes across South Korea, the heat of the Winter Olympics is growing, and it is believed that ticket sales will soon improve."
As of January 3, ticket sales for the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics had reached 64 percent, and ticket sales for the Winter Paralympic Games had exceeded 50 percent, according to South Korean media reports.
In an effort to encourage foreigners to visit South Korea, the Republic of Korea also announced on Thursday that it would extend the stay of foreigners who visit South Korea to watch the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics for up to 120 days.
The survey found that more than one in five American travelers board the plane with prohibited items
A survey of plane passengers found that more than 20 per cent of passengers had deliberately or unknowingly picked up illegal items to board through U.S. Transportation Security Administration checkpoints, with at least 6 per cent of them unknowingly carrying prohibited knives or other edged objects on board.
Less than 1 per cent of passengers claimed that they only found out afterwards that they were travelling with firearms, ammunition or explosives.
The survey of more than 1,000 people, conducted by charter services company Stratos Jet Charters Inc., also found that young travellers were more likely to openly ignore the rules.
Of the respondents who admitted to deliberately carrying TSA items on board, 19.7 per cent were millennials, compared with less than 15 per cent of Generation X.
The most common items that deliberately slip through TSA security personnel are food and drink.
More than 3 per cent admitted to deliberately carrying a blade through security, while 2.2per cent of female respondents and 3.7per cent of male respondents also said they had deliberately taken the banned drug on board.
The company said it was investigating travelers across the country to find out the number of people who were accidentally carrying and deliberately carrying prohibited goods across aircraft security checks.
It is not surprising that the people most likely to carry prohibited goods through security - intentional or unintentional - are those who fly most frequently.
However, the company points out that the TSA guide is a bit complex and difficult to understand.
People are usually not sure what and how much liquid they can carry.
It is not surprising, therefore, that TSA seized the most prohibited liquids.
It was once thought that TSA might have treated books as prohibited goods as well.
Domestic flights are allowed to carry liquids, but international flights are not allowed.
EPA chief changes mind on Obama-era emissions reduction regulations
A day after he was sued by 15 states, Environmental Protection Agency Director Scott Pruitt reversed his earlier decision to delay implementation of Obama-era regulations to reduce emissions of smoke air pollutants.
Pruitt proposed the change because EPA was able to respond more quickly to the needs of state agencies that regulate the environment than previous governments.
He did not mention the legal challenge filed by the Federal Court of Appeal against his former post.
The dispute focused on setting October 1 as the deadline for states to begin meeting the 2015 ground ozone standards.
In June, he announced that he would delay performance for a year in order to give the Environmental Protection Agency more time to study the plan and avoid "interfering with local decisions or impeding economic growth."
Before being appointed by President Donald Trump, Pruitt was Oklahoma's attorney general, long opposed to the tightening of environmental regulations.
Since arriving in Washington, he has repeatedly turned to blocking or delaying regulations opposed by the chemical and fossil fuel industries.
Wednesday's sudden reversal is one of the latest legal hurdles on the regulatory return agenda.
Last month, the federal appeals court in Washington ruled that the head of the Environmental Protection Agency had exceeded his authority in an attempt to delay implementation of Obama administration rules requiring oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leaks.
In a statement released Wednesday night, Mr. Pruitt made a big shift in his approach to ozone standards, saying he would strengthen the Environmental Protection Agency's commitment to work with states to adopt complex procedures to reach new standards.
"under the previous administration, the EPA usually did not meet the specified deadline, and then waited for activist groups and others to sue and agree to establish a designated timetable by agreement," he said, launching more than a dozen lawsuits against the EPA in his previous work.
"we don't believe in regulation through litigation, we take deadlines seriously.
We also take regulations and authorities seriously, "he said.
Nonetheless, the EPA statement said the company may again use his "extension and all other legally available authorizations" to ensure that the provisions are in line with "good policy and the best information available."
Republicans in Congress are pushing for a broad rewriting of the ozone layer regulations.
The House bill, approved last month, aims to delay implementation of the 2015 rule for at least eight years.
The measure has not yet been voted in the Senate.
New York State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman led a coalition of states that sued the EPA this week, saying it intends to maintain legal pressure.
"the EPA reversal - after we filed the lawsuit - is a significant victory for the health and safety of 6.7 million New Yorkers, with communities of more than 115 million Americans directly affected by the smoke emissions," Schneiderman said.
California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington state and the District of Columbia joined New York in the case.
Ground ozone is formed by the reaction of common pollutants emitted by cars, power plants, refineries, chemical plants and other sources to sunlight in the atmosphere.
The resulting smoke can cause serious breathing problems for sensitive populations, causing thousands of premature deaths each year.
Public health advocates and environmentalists, of course, cheered the surprising shift.
Lori Ann Bird, of the Center for Biological Diversity, said: "it is disturbing that this common sense measure has come under enormous pressure from the head of the department protecting the air we need to breathe."
"we must fight to the end with the Trump administration's ideological campaign to cater to polluters and special interest groups."

Since the second half of 2009, the sales volume of flowers and trees in Xiaoshan has remained relatively high, especially this spring, when it reached a new record high, with a sharp increase in sales and high prices. According to statistics, the sales revenue of trees in Xiaoshan from January to June this year increased by 48% compared with the same period last year, the largest increase in nearly 20 years.
Shi Haiyong, deputy director of Xiaoshan Forestry Bureau, said that along with the good sales situation, Xiaoshan flower and wood production has also achieved a relatively rapid development.
In the past two years, the area under flower and wood cultivation in Xiaoshan has expanded by 30,000 acres, reaching a total area of 180,000 acres; at the same time, it has been actively developing outside the country.
At the same time, the planting area has been expanded, the quality of seedlings has been continuously improved, the storage value of nursery beds has been increasing, large-scale and high-quality trees have been retained, and some of them have been sold.
Shi also warned that in the face of the current boom in production and marketing, producers should be calm and objective, both to see that social demand for flowers and trees will be long-term and increasing, and to recognize that market competition will become more intense.
On the morning of July 13, Beijing time, the US company Somaltus filed a lawsuit in the East Texas District Court accusing Apple of violating a battery technology patent it filed in 2010.
The company has previously sued Hua, Lenovo, Samsung, Sony and Toshiba with the same patents.
Both the iPhone 6s and similar Apple devices violated U.S. patent No. 7,657,386, known as the Integrated Battery Service System, according to the lawsuit.
The plaintiff wanted cash compensation, or a patent fee for the infringing equipment after the judgment was announced.
Judging from the indictment, the plaintiffs appear to believe that the iPhone's fast-charging function violated the company's patent.
A fast-charging iPhone will quickly charge up to 80% of its power, followed by a trickle charge.
Somaltus is in fact a so-called "patent hooligan," because the company does not offer obvious products and services, and it is difficult to find information online.
However, they have successfully reached an out-of-court settlement with car makers such as Ford and Nissan over the patent.
The meeting held that it is of great significance to accelerate the development of information technology, promote the integration and efficient use of resources, and raise the level of digital and intelligent industry to promote "Made in China 2025" and mass entrepreneurship and innovation, foster new kinetic energy and improve the quality of life of the masses.

Trump has pressed Mexico to pay for a border wall, according to leaked phone records
The Washington Post leaked records of conversations between US President Donald Trump and the leaders of Mexico and Australia.
On January 27, in a call to Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto, Trump urged him to stop publicly saying he would not pay for the proposed border wall.
The US president reportedly expressed his dissatisfaction with his public attack on the wall, allegedly telling him: "you don't tell the media."
During his presidential campaign, Trump promised to build a wall along the southern border of the United States, and solemnly declared that Mexico would pay for the project.
A transcript of his phone call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has also been released, which shows a tense exchange between them.
Trump told Turnbull that it was "absurd," "obnoxious" and "stupid" for the US to take on a deal to send refugees to Australia, and that his suggestion that the US ban on refugee resettlement and now insist on a deal brokered by the Obama administration would make him look like a "fool."
Trump hung up after telling Turnbull that "this is the most unpleasant call of the day."

Seoul, January 9 (Xinhua) -- South Korea and North Korea concluded high-level talks in Panmunjom in the evening, issuing a joint statement and reaching agreement on the DPRK's participation in the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics and military sector talks between the two sides.
According to the joint statement issued by both sides, the DPRK will send a high-level delegation and the delegation of the National Olympic Committee to participate in the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics.
In addition, the DPRK will send teams of athletes, cheerleaders, artists, journalists and other groups to visit the Republic of Korea, which will provide the necessary facilities.
The two Koreas also agreed to ease current military tensions and decided to hold talks between the military departments of the two Koreas.
The report analysed the results of a questionnaire survey of 1,045 foreign tourists who visited Seoul in December.
According to the report, the per capita amount of shopping by foreign tourists was 1.06 million won.
Chinese tourists accounted for the largest amount of shopping per person, at 2.13 million won, 6.5 times that of Japanese tourists and 3.2 times that of US and European tourists.
Asked about the purpose of the trip to Seoul, 62.2pc of Chinese tourists answered "shopping" and 94.9pc of Chinese tourists bought cosmetics.
96.3 per cent of Chinese tourists shop at duty-free shops in urban areas, at a cost of 1.56 million won per person.

Moore Beach massacre: Activists recreate racist lynchings, access to justice
A 1948 Ford Mercury made its way through a crowd of onlookers in the small town of Monroe, rumbling toward the tiny Moore Beach Bridge.
The vehicle was carrying four black passengers and a white driver, and before the vehicle arrived at the bridge, a group of white men with guns approached and blocked the car's way forward.
The leader of the mob - a middle-aged man in a pinstriped suit - took a deep breath of a cigar and put his eyes through the windshield.
The passengers in the car were filled with fear.
"we want - Roger!" the man shouted.
'drag him out of the car! '
A young black man was dragged from the passenger seat in the front row and screams punctured the silence.
Fortunately, the horrific scene on July 22 was just a repeat.
But when "Roger" had a noose around his neck, there were real gasps from almost all the onlookers.
Since 2005, civil rights activists have returned to Moore Beach Bridge to recreate scenes from the night two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcon, as well as George and Maree Dorsey - were lynched by the Three K Party in 1946.
No one has ever been charged with murder.
"while we know who they are, and even though we've seen them in the community, it's unbelievable that none of them have been arrested over the years," said Tyrone Brooks, who helped organize the repeat.
"it's a stain on history, a burden on our souls."
Brooks, 71, is a former lawmaker and lifelong activist.
For him, a repeat is a compelling call to action, an annual reminder to people in the Monroe community that injustice has never been corrected.
"we want to prosecute, we want to close the case, we want to heal, we want reconciliation, but we have to get justice first," he said.
"unless we get justice, we will not get healing and reconciliation."
On 27 July 1946, the coroner put a sheet over the body of a Moore Beach lynching victim.
According to FBI files obtained by NBC News, more than 50 men from Monroe and surrounding counties were suspected of being involved in the lynching.
But none of them have been charged.
While the suspects have been at large for decades, civil rights activists say the dual motive for lynching is well known throughout the town: Politics and sex.
In April 1946, a Supreme Court ruling enabled thousands of black citizens to vote in the primaries for the first time later that summer.
At about the same time, according to FBI statistics, black tenant farmer Roger Malcolm stabbed white landlord Barnett Hirst in a struggle - looking like it was for a woman.
Brooks said the town rumors were that Hirst slept with Malcolm's wife, Dorothy, and that her baby was not her husband's.
On July 25, 1946, Roy Harrison, a prominent white landlord, paid $600 to bail Malcolm out of prison, the FBI said.
Dorothy and cousins Mike Murray and George Dorsey accompanied him to the prison.
But when they returned from prison and approached the Moor Beach Bridge, a lynching mob surrounded the car.
"it turns out that it was Harrison who organized and ordered the execution of the murder," an FBI report concluded.
"it is clear that there is a conspiracy between state and local law enforcement, who not only participated in the murder, destroyed the evidence, but also concealed the identity of the witness."
Brooks is very concise.
"this is a voting rights tragedy," he said.
"they were killed, and it was the killer who sent a message to the black people of this community:" if you sign up and vote, you will have the same end. "
For nearly a decade, Cassandra Green has been in charge of leading the annual repeat of the Moore Beach Bridge lynchings.
Her style of expression was vivid and gripping, with a deeply racist background that many hoped would no longer exist in the United States.
It's hard to see, it's harder to see, but Green says that's the key.
"we don't want to talk about lynchings because they make us face the ugly face of all people," she said.
'but if you don't listen to me or you don't hear me talk about my experiences, I can't build a relationship with you. '
This year's show began in June, the first day with nearly 30 actors - a dozen white, the rest black - packed into a room to hear Green release a rehearsed overview of the show.
Wade Malbau served as co-director of Green.
For years, he played the role of the Triple K party, but he said the role was never easy.
"I feel dirty because I'm not that kind of person," Malbau said.
"but I think it's very important to keep this history alive because we don't want to go back to that era."
In the room, actors Darios Bradshaw and Nick Russell, who play Roger Malcolm and Barnett Hirst, rehearse their lines.
When the play began, Malcolm shouted and pushed Hurst away, angry that he had slept with his wife, Dorothy.
"I said, get out of my territory!"
Lackner shot back.
And then they fought.
Then everyone (at least all the black actors) erupted in laughter.
Green laughed the most.
"what's the matter?!" asked Lackner.
He was alarmed, confused.
Am I acting too much?
"no," Green said, laughing.
"I just don't think white people are going to say," Oh, no, "when they hit back.
"yes," another black actor quipped.
"your tone has to be tough." "
In this way, the energy in the room changed; the feeling of camaraderie drove away the discomfort.
Everyone tried to do so, not only to perform the play, but also in memory of the four victims.
The scene begins again.
This time, when he said the word "ah," the tone was sharp and powerful.
Not one of them had a laugh.
The repeat ended forcefully and quickly.
There were screams, gunshots, and then there was a silence.
One woman, dressed in funeral black, stood by the actor's body and sang Billy Halede's words of mourning, "Strange Fruit."
Her voice ran over the other words.
A hundred yards away, about forty spectators kept wiping sweat and tears.
Blacks and whites accounted for almost half of the audience.
There was a couple who came to see the show from Ithaca, New York, and a lot of people who lived near the road.
Brooks took them to Malcolm and Dorothy's Cemetery, nearly eight hours away, and everyone was suffering from Georgia's uncomfortable sense of loneliness.
Until then, the murderer was still a mystery, but now, standing on the same land where lynchings took place, there was anxiety in the air.
When the final notes of the song disappeared, Green asked people to come closer and examine the bodies played by the actor.
The children leaned down, looked at fake blood and dead bodies, and whispered to each other.
"they're not really dead," a little boy mumbled, as if reminding himself.
A few minutes later, Green thanked the crowd and then the show ended.
The actor shook off the lynching rope and wiped away tears.
Bradshaw embraced the role of Triple K party head suit man Mal Pao.
Nick Lascona hugs two of his colleagues, losing his voice and crying in their arms; the emotions in the performance eventually infect him.
"it's okay," whispered one of the women.
'we know it's not like that in your heart.
You do it for a reason, "he said.
After that, the audience sat down to dinner with the actor.
At the same table, a white couple from Atlanta had an intimate chat with a black couple they had just met about a repeat.
It's hard to find words to describe how she felt after watching it.
"it's hard to imagine the terrible words and actions... being said and done by people like you, because they look like you," she said.
"for me, it really makes me think that lynching is still going on," she added, "and now this kind of thing is only called police shooting."
In the room, Tyrone Brooks sat at the table watching, tasting and thinking of civil rights.
He said he had already started planning next year's show.
"it's an inspiring way to repeat it, because it describes the horrors we've experienced, but it's also very educational," he said.
"if you don't learn from it, it could happen again.
Those who do not study and do not understand their own history are destined to do so. "
For natural gas market reform, the importance of the reform of "network independence" is self-evident, but the resistance and controversy are also greater.
At 11: 25 a.m. on July 7, 13 workers were trapped when an explosion occurred at the emulsion workshop of Kaifu Group Chemical Co., Ltd., located in the ancient area of Shenzhen City, Hebei Province, the reporter said.
So far, of the 13 people trapped, one has been rescued and rushed to hospital, while the remaining 12 are under intense search and rescue.
It is understood the scene has been cordoned off and local public security, fire and medical services are on the scene.
According to witnesses, there was a loud bang at the time of the incident, and a cloud rose out of the sky in an instant.
According to the personnel of Kaifu Group, which organized the search and rescue on the spot, the company is located in the northern part of Zhao Zhouzhuang, the ancient metallurgical district of Shenzhen City, Hebei Province, and is a designated production enterprise for civilian blasting equipment approved by the state.

Us media: China Air Force Engineering University scientists study laser satellite, used to remove space waste
Chinese scientists have come up with a bold and innovative proposal to use large lasers to clean up the mess of Earth's orbit and destroy old satellites as well as its sky waste, according to a media report on January 18.
Researchers from the China Air Force Engineering University have written a paper entitled "Space-based laser removal small-scale space debris transformation model study," which describes how space debris can be exposed by lasers to smaller, less hazardous debris through the use of UN-SPIDER lasers, according to Newsweek's website.
Space waste has been a concern for international space agencies for years, and NASA has considered a variety of options to track, detect and remove artificial debris, the report said.
The way to remove large-scale space debris includes giant nets used to clean and collect waste, as well as a network that can be used to suck them out of orbit, and Chinese scientists conducted laser simulation studies that concluded that this would be an effective way to clean up Earth's orbit.
" (the simulation study) provides the necessary theoretical basis for the application of space debris removal technology for UN-SPIDER lasers," the paper's summary said.
A 2014 study by US defense giant Lockheed Martin found that there are about 200 threats a day for satellites that are in orbit.
High-speed debris moving along Earth's orbit is seen as a serious threat to future space missions and has been described as a "deadly chain of threats" by experts at the European Space Agency, which has continued to increase in each of the past year.
Space is largely empty, but the space next to the Earth is becoming more crowded, and each satellite we send into space will eventually become another piece of debris orbiting the Earth, and it will pile up over time, according to a report on the website of the American Journal of Mass Machinery.
The more debris, the more likely a satellite that is still functioning is to be hit by debris, thereby damaging or destroying an investment worth millions of dollars.
All space agencies have plans in place to remove space waste in the future, the report said.
NASA is considering reducing the speed of debris with jet gas to get it out of orbit, Europe is considering launching a satellite carrying a large net to catch debris and bring it back to Earth, and Japan's idea is to capture debris with an electric chain.
For now, China is also proposing a solution to space waste by using a large laser to knock floating space debris into smaller, less harmful pieces.
Installing such a laser on a satellite would be effective enough to clean up space, at least according to the simulation, according to a paper published by a group of researchers at the Chinese Air Force Engineering University in the German journal Optics.
The only way to prove effectiveness is to test it, and there are no arrangements for such missions, but it may be time for someone to install a laser on a satellite and send it into space, the report said.
Once we do, we can finally begin to eliminate the problem of space garbage once and for all.

Person Group cuts 3,000 more jobs, slashes dividend to revive business
British education group Payson said on Friday it would cut another 3,000 jobs and sharply cut its interim dividend by 72pc as it began another restructuring project to deal with business pressures.
Chief executive John Fallon said most of the job cuts would take place in the second half of 2018 and the first half of 2019, with 4,000 jobs cut in the previous restructuring.
In May, the group announced plans to cut another 300 million pounds ($394 million) in costs in its third cost-cutting project to revive a business hit by the rapid development of digital learning.
Last month, the company agreed to sell its stake in Penguin Random House to partner Bertelsmann and published a report that its underlying sales rose 1 per cent to 2.05 billion pounds in the first half, but said the outlook for the year remained unchanged.
A few days ago, the China Field Association issued a serious notice to crack down on the running phenomenon, and was prepared to impose a life ban on the offenders.
NATO soldiers killed in suicide bombing attack on convoy Kabul
A military convoy was attacked by suicide bombers in the Afghan capital, Kabul, killing one NATO soldier and injuring several others, according to sources.
According to the NATO statement, five soldiers and an interpreter were wounded.
According to unconfirmed local reports, three civilians also died in the incident, which took place in the Karabah area of the city.
It is the latest violent attack in Afghanistan - the Herat mosque bombing that killed more than 30 people on Tuesday.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
On Thursday night, a joint Afghan and NATO coalition patrol was attacked by "individuals carrying improvised explosive devices," according to a NATO statement.
All of the injured are in stable condition and are being treated at the U.S. military hospital at Bagram Air Force Base, the statement said.
The growing presence of the Taliban and the so-called Islamic State (IS) group in the Karabakh region has raised serious concerns among NATO forces stationed near Bagram, according to journalists.
According to the United Nations, at least 1,662 civilians died in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, compared with about 20% in the capital.
At least 30 people were killed in a suicide car bomb attack in Kabul's predominantly Shiite area at the end of July.
The Taliban claimed they carried out the attack.
On May 31, a huge explosion killed more than 150 people in central Kabul, the deadliest militant attack in the country since a U.S.-led multinational force toppled the Taliban in 2001.
The violence highlights the dangerous security situation in the country at a time when US President Donald Trump is weighing up whether to send more troops to Afghanistan to support its troops and police.
The suicide bombings in Kabul in recent weeks have also triggered a crisis of public confidence in the government and its policies, in particular the reputation of President Ashraf Ghani, according to journalists.
U.S. National Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) lawsuit after overturning resolution, delays smog regulations
Obama took office with a rule requiring states to curb all types of smoke-causing emissions, and 15 states sued the U.S. National Environmental Protection Agency for the regulation, which the EPA overturned a day after the lawsuit.
On Wednesday, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency announced its decision to continue the so-called "2015 ozone compliance zone" and pledged to work with the states.
"we are confident in dialogue with our national partners and are committed to responding to it," U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Director Scott Pruitt said in a statement.
In June, Pruitt announced that the EPA plans to delay the implementation of ozone-compliant zone standards until October 2018, with a one-year delay - according to which existing smoke pollution in some areas is measured to determine which areas should be reduced in order to comply with air quality standards.
Fifteen major Democratic states, as well as the District of Columbia, filed a lawsuit Tuesday claiming that the act was illegal.
As part of a broader agenda, President Donald Trump's administration has been working to restore various environmental regulations introduced by former President Barack Obama to stimulate economic growth.
But those efforts have sparked opposition from Democrats and conservative groups, who fear more emissions will affect public health.
The US EPA website claims that breathing ozone-containing air "reduces lung function and increases respiratory symptoms," such as asthma.

McKee Garcia and Vasily Lomashenko meet for the first time to explore a possible future showdown
The most high-profile under-147 pound boxing match will take place soon, with Vasily Lomachenko and McKee Garcia, who are currently in a state of potential conflict, meeting for the first time on Thursday.
They were in separate rooms at the ESPN office in Los Angeles, where unbeaten World Boxing Council lightweight champion Garcia took the lead down the aisle to greet the World Boxing Organization super-featherweight champion, Loma Chico.
In Saturday's Showtime boxing match, the judges unanimously decided that Garcia had beaten quarterback Adrian Blona to win, making both fighters the top five on the same heavyweight list.
Garcia held out his right hand and said: "champion, how are you?
Good luck. ""
Lomashenko saved his status with a victory over Miguel Mariaga on Saturday night at 7 p.m. on ESPN.
When the two took photos, Lomashenko's agent, Eris Klimas, pointed out that the potential matchup between the two players depended on "the perfect size."
"I was lightweight before," Garcia said.
"I raised my grade to fight Burona (140 pounds), but I didn't weigh that much," he said.
Compared to 140 pounds, I'm still close to the weight.
I want to go back to lightweight.
And he has to reach lightweight (135 pounds) and then we can fight.
That's what fans want, too.
Then we will satisfy them, "he said.
Loma-chenko agrees.
"the boxing world needs this fight." "
Klimas asked if he should be charged a second time, and part of his strategy was to have Lomashenko make his debut against a 135-pound player later this year, thinking a date would be set for next summer with Garcia (37-0, 30 knockout), who is also interested in taking on the winner of Jorge Lineres-Luke Campbell's fight after the Forum's lightweight title fight on September 23.
"because all the fans are asking this question, this matchup could be on a fee basis," Garcia said, after which he was open to playing on the network that offers the best financial options.
"we are the main people.
It is not possible for others to produce such a degree of tolerance.
As long as they are ready... "
Garcia praised Lomashenko as "an excellent player" and could be watching him live for Saturday's boxing match.
But Lomashenko balked at Garcia's praise, saying he thought the three-point winner from Riverside looked "slow. I'm sorry, McKee... You'll be out."
The focus, Garcia said, is to show the power of the fist, and then boxing.
They all said they could feel the momentum of their own boxing.
"this is a fight that must be fought,
Tolerance and heat are beyond the reach of any other boxing match.
I'm more than happy to compete, "Garcia said.
"I've been waiting for top fighters and this time it's McGee's turn," he said.
It's going to be a great matchup, "he said.
Promoting Environmental Protection Yesterday, the West District held a large-scale environmental volunteering event on the theme of "Green Home for the West"

At present, many children in the country, because of the goal of professional golfers, gave up their studies, but on the career path smooth, do not consider university.
China Development and Reform Commission officials to the eleventh five-year emission reduction target ahead of schedule, giving the steel industry with limited electricity production suppression strong expectations of a resumption of production.
Although the steel plant has not received a clear notice from the local government that the energy-saving and emission reduction work has been completed, the industry estimates that, around December 15, 2010, production will be completed and steel prices will start to come under pressure.
There has been no notice of the end of power restrictions, but in fact the pressure on companies is much smaller than in September and October, a private steel company in Hebei province told reporters.
Some parts of Hebei have repeatedly issued electricity-limited production documents, and at one time took the form of forced brake to restrict the production of enterprises.
Reporters from local enterprises know that at present, most of Hebei's steel mills have resumed work, limited production pressure relief.
Zhang Tieshan, an analyst at my steel network, expects terminal demand for construction steel to gradually weaken from strong to weak as the north enters winter.
Together with the gradual end of energy-saving and emission reduction, most of the mills will be back in production by December 15, and products will arrive in local markets before New Year's Day.
The increase in the supply of resources will put some pressure on steel prices, which are currently rising just right.

Latest results of age assessment test for asylum seekers in Sweden released
The Swedish asylum test used the latest method to medically assess their age, and the latest results showed that more than 80 per cent of the subjects were judged to be over 18 years of age, but not all were convinced of its accuracy.
The Swedish National Centre for Forensic Medicine (R? Ttsmediinalverket) began the test earlier this year.
After being accused of failing to accurately assess the age of some of the refugees claiming to be minors, the Swedish Migration Board (Migrationsverket) designed these tests with a view to conducting a more accurate age assessment during the asylum process.
To date, the Swedish Migration Board has sent 6880 testers, and the Centre for Forensic Medicine has now published the results of a total of 2,481 testers between mid-March and 31 July 2017.
Eighty per cent (2002) were found to be 18 years of age or older, but in another 25 tests, the Swedish National Centre for Forensic Medicine determined that the subjects "may be 18 years of age or older."
In 432 tests, the result was that the person "may be under the age of 18."
The test is only for people whose age is in doubt.
These results are consistent with those of the previous months, according to John Glanson of the Centre for Forensic Medicine.
"these figures are not very different from those of previous months, the numbers are very consistent," he told The Local.
The high proportion of cases found to be over the age of 18 does not necessarily mean that these asylum-seekers have lost their age.
In May, the center published 581 test results and said 442 cases "indicated that the subject was 18 years of age or older."
Svenska Dagbladet, a news newspaper, surveyed 581 tests and found that 243 of them had publicly said they would be 18 years old this year.
X-rays of wisdom teeth, MRI scans of joints, the results of which are then analysed by dentists and radiologists, have also been questioned in some areas.
One of the sceptics is Claude Marcus, an endocrine scientist at Caroline College, whose work includes assessing people's biological maturity to determine whether they experience puberty earlier or later than normal age.
He told the news newspaper Metro: "I have reason to think so, and I don't think the measurement used should be that way.
It is not accurate to determine physiological age in this way.
If we cannot guarantee accuracy, we should not pretend that we can do it, "he said.
But Glenn, of the Centre for Forensic Medicine, defended the accuracy of the tests: "generally speaking, the risk of uncertainty in determining a child as an adult is small."
The biggest risk is that the person is just under 18 years of age, which is about 10 per cent.
West Virginia governor announces party change
On Thursday night, the Democratic governor of West Virginia, Jim Justice, announced at President Trump's rally that he would change his party.
"like it or not, the Democratic Party has left me," the governor's judge said.
"today, after a lot of prayer and a lot of thought, I'm going to tell you... I'm going to tell you today as a West Virginia that I can no longer help you as a Democratic governor."
The rally erupted in cheers.
"so, tomorrow, I'm going to change my party membership to the Republican Party," Justes added.
"as a coach, I'm going to tell it's time to start another game." "
Trump earlier promised a major announcement at a rally in West Virginia.
Mr. Trump won 42% of the vote in West Virginia, and Mr. Justes did not support Hillary Clinton, the Democratic candidate.
Justes was selected as the state's only billionaire in 2016, according to Forbes.
Forbes noted that he inherited his father's coal industry and owned coal mines in all five states.
Currently, he is worth about $1.59 billion.
At the same time, the Republican National Committee issued a statement Thursday night saying, "Governor Justis's party change is yet another blow to the Democratic Party, which, far from preventing our country from becoming great again, will make our country great again."
"the Democratic Party currently has only 15 governors, and control of the state legislature is at its lowest level in history, and the governor's statement is the latest rejection of such a party that has lost leadership from top to bottom and has been unable to find a positive unity slogan," Rona McDaniel, the Republican National Committee's women's chairman, said in a statement to CBS News.
Fang Wenshan confessed that it was his dream to tell a complete story in music.
A song for four to five minutes, it's difficult to tell a story in full.

Sebastian Coe praises Russia's "frank" apology for doping scandal
On Thursday, Sebastian Coe, president of the International Association of Athletics Federations, praised Russia's apology over the doping scandal and said it was "candid," but reiterated that it was not the time for Russia to return to the sport.
Mitri Chirac, president of the Russian Athletics Federation, told the IAAF conference on the eve of the World Athletics Championships that his country was right to be banned from the sport and that he was determined to fight doping.
He said he regretted that "all the athletes who won gold and silver medals in the competition were stripped of their medals."
Despite his comments, the IAAF General Assembly voted in favour of maintaining the ban, which was imposed in November 2015 after the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) report referred to the discovery of evidence of state sponsored doping in Russia.
"I think the response today was very frank, very candid introduction," IAAF president Coe told reporters.
"the entire Council and the General Assembly are pleased... the Russian Federation acknowledges that it has been through a very intense period and is doing everything possible to ensure that Russia can return to the game."
Coe said he was also "pleased" that Russia had accepted the criteria for reentry.
"I think it's a very constructive day and I think we've made some progress, but the IAAF General Assembly supports the recommendations of the panel and now is not the time to restore Russia's eligibility," Coe said.
"we need to do everything we can in the next few months to normalize this situation.
Our guiding principle has always been the desire to separate clean athletes from the contaminated system, "he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes meet the strict standards of the IAAF and will compete as neutrals at the World Athletics Championships in London on Friday.
Fran Anderson, head of the IAAF panel, said on Monday that Russia had yet to meet a number of criteria for the resumption of the competition.
He told reporters after a speech to the IAAF Council in London that drug testing is still inadequate and banned coaches are still coaching.
At a publicity event held this morning on the first anniversary of the implementation of the Beijing Regulations on Tobacco Control, the winning young student representatives of the "My Declaration on Tobacco Control" national youth tobacco control video interact with Huang Xuan, the national ambassador for tobacco control publicity.
The French reporter learned from the event, the young actor Huang Xuan was hired as the national tobacco control propaganda ambassador.
Huang Xuan, who had smoked since the University of Tokyo, successfully quit smoking after becoming fully aware of the dangers of smoke. This time, he took on the role of an ambassador for smoking cessation, calling on teenagers to stay away from tobacco.
The audience puts on a mask and becomes a ghostly presence in the story, which is the biggest rule of the game for "Sleeping Night."
People's currency median price of 6.4401 depreciation of 66 basis points of continuous rise suspended
Macroeconomic Tencent Finance 2018-01-18 09: 50 Sharing

Almost all of the 12 Fed regions reported moderate to moderate growth in economic activity in early 2018 and remain optimistic about the outlook for the year, according to the Federal Reserve's economic report.
Meanwhile, the U.S. unemployment rate remained at 4.1pc in December, the lowest since 2000, and businesses are expected to raise wages in the coming months.
Fed officials generally view the tax overhaul as a factor supporting this moderately stronger economic outlook, with the Fed forecasting growth of 2.5pc and three rate hikes in 2018.
Market sources point out that, in recent times, the European Central Bank's monetary policy has tightened expectations to push up the euro, the dollar index has fallen continuously, and the renminbi has followed a rapid rally against the dollar. However, it is unlikely that the ECB will soon adjust its policy stance.
It is worth noting that, as market expectations for the renminbi become more stable, the appeal of renminbi assets to foreign investors has become more prominent.

What is the impact of football's financial rules on Neymar's move to Paris?
Rules designed to prevent unrestricted spending by big European football clubs will not prevent Neymar from moving from Barcelona in Spain to France's Paris Saint-Germain Football Club (PSG) at record prices.
The result has been a further relegation of the Paris Saint-Germain football club by the UEFA, the governing body of European football, which has the power to ban teams from participating in the much-watched Champions League.
The Financial Fair Competition Rules (FFP) introduced by UEFA in 2011 meant that Paris Saint-Germain Football Club would eventually have to prove that Neymar's transfer was funded without causing a huge loss.
FC Barcelona have paid €222 million ($262 million) just to pay for the Brazilian player's settlement, while Neymar's salary will be tens of millions of dollars a year.
Here are some of the financial implications of Neymar's move to France.
Given that the team is funded by the wealthy Qatari ruling family, Paris Saint-Germain Football Club could, of course, sign Neymar in cash and include him in the ranks of other stars.
Clubs can spend huge sums of money on players, but they have to use legitimate sources of revenue to make up for the huge sums they spend to break even in their football-related business.
The financial fair play rules were conceived by Michel Platini after he was elected UEFA president in 2007.
The former French player believes that for clubs that are heavily indebted in pursuit of success, if banks or owners withdraw support money, they are actually cheating and putting the club at risk of destruction.
In 2011, the focus of the Rules shifted from the issue of the club's debt to the monitoring of the club's loss situation.
The change means that the business model used by Roman Abramovich when he bought Chelsea in 2003, to buy a club with potential and then spend heavily on improving the team and building it into a global brand, is now in a tougher position.
The club could lose 30 million euros in the three-year review of the Rules to 2018.
Although Mr Abu was disparaged by the then chairman in 2015, Aleksander Ceferin, UEFA's successor, is still working to stop excessive spending.
"of course, the Rules have not expired, and we will certainly strengthen future regulations," Andrea Traverso, UEFA's director of rules-related matters, told The Associated Press last week.
While the Paris Saint-Germain Football Club will pay off Neymar's buy-out clause in one lump sum, it can also allocate the amount for accounting purposes over the duration of the contract.
Neymar has signed a five-year deal, so the transfer fee is likely to show a fee of £44.4 million in the annual accounts for the next five years.
The first wave of Rules sanctions, imposed in 2014, put Paris Saint-Germain Football Club, as well as the Manchester City club owned by Abu Dhabi, under the most severe sanctions.
Paris Saint-Germain Football Club was fined 60 million euros ($82 million at the exchange rate at the time), later reduced to 20 million euros, and called for the team to be reduced to 21 players in the Champions League for the 2014-15 season, instead of the normal 25.
UEFA is staring at clubs that are trying to raise revenue by linking up with club owners and defrauding financial regulators.
While Qatari companies can sponsor the Paris Saint-Germain Football Club, UEFA will not consider it a legitimate income if the amount of sponsorship is deemed to exceed the standard market price.
It was something that happened in 2014, when UEFA ruled that the Qatar Tourism Board's sponsorship of the Paris Saint-Germain football club had been exaggerated.
According to reports, part of Neymar's income at Paris Saint-Germain Football Club may have come from payments made by the Qatar 2022 World Cup organizing committee.
But both Paris Saint-Germain Football Club and the organising committee denied Neymar would be an ambassador for the World Cup and it would be easy for UEFA regulators to make such a move.
The recent sanctions imposed on the Paris Saint-Germain football club mean UEFA will be more wary of any attempt to circumvent the rules.
UEFA did not have advance discussions with Paris Saint-Germain Football Club about Neymar's transfer, people familiar with the matter said on Thursday.
The above-mentioned individuals contacted The Associated Press only on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the status of the Paris Saint-Germain football club.
Last published accounts show that Paris Saint-Germain Football Club had operating revenues of €542.4 million in 2015-16, making a profit of more than €10 million.
The accounts for the previous fiscal year have not yet been published.
Paris Saint-Germain Football Club expects Neymar's arrival to bring the gospel to sponsorship activities, franchises and jersey sales.
The club expects to see revenue growth of at least 30 per cent following the signing of Nema.
Apparently, the Spanish league was furious to see one of the most famous players leave, trying to block Neymar's move and claiming that Paris Saint-Germain Football Club was in breach of the Rules.
Javier Tebas, the president of La Liga, told Spanish newspaper AS that "this is a clear example of the fact that the club and the country are the same," referring to Qatar, which has the ultimate ownership of the Paris Saint-Germain Football Club.
Arsène Wenger, the manager of the Arsenal team, which is owned by the American sports mogul, has reservations about the state funding of the club and the La Liga league.
"this is the consequence of ownership and this has completely changed the whole ecology of football over the past 15 years," Wenger said on Thursday.
"once the country has the club, then anything happens.
That would make it very difficult to comply with the Rules, because there are many different ways or various interests for a country to ask big players to represent a country, "he said.
Smart interactive robot R & D firm Rokid gets new investment in Temasek lead
In recent years, start-up companies in the field of artificial intelligence have continued to receive a capital boom.
Artificial Intelligence Rokid recently completed a new round of financing, led by Temasek, followed by institutions such as Credit Suisse, CDIB (an investment arm of Taiwan's China Development Financial Holding Company) and old shareholder IDG Capital.
The current round of financing is said to be about $100 million, with Credit Suisse and CDIB appearing for the first time in domestic financing deals in the field of artificial intelligence.
Rokid is a research and development firm of intelligent interactive robots, dedicated to the field of robotics. The products can control smart devices in the home, have the function of continuous independent learning and growth, as well as recognition, understanding and feedback.
This round of financing will be used mainly for research and development, the introduction of talent, strategic promotion and industrial chain investment layout.

From February 28 this year, according to Apple, the iCloud service in mainland China will be operated by the company.
"the partnership will allow us to continue to improve the speed and reliability of iCloud services, as well as China's new rules for cloud services to be operated by local companies," Apple said.
During the phase-out, user data previously stored in iCloud will also be stored in iCloud and will not be lost.
If the user wishes to use the iCloud service after 28 February, the new terms and conditions will need to be accepted first to ensure that the account is reactivated and moved to Guizhou.
At the same time, Apple stressed in its statement that "Apple has strong data privacy and security protection mechanisms and will not create a backdoor in any of our systems."
The main data centre will also be Apple's first data center project in China, which, when completed, will be used to store data on Apple users in China.
When built and put into use, Chinese users upload and download data without having to travel long distances back and forth between China and the United States to increase speed and reduce delays.

At the opening ceremony of the 3-D animated film "Bean Fun" in Wuhan on Tuesday, the director of "Bean Fun," the director of "Bean Fun," and the animated director of "Bean Fun," the film's soundtrack producer and Emmy winner, Tom Disher, appeared on the scene to share the story behind the film's creation.
Based on the story of Wang Liu'an of Huangnan in the Han Dynasty in Chinese traditional culture, "Liu An made tofu by mistake," the novel tells the story of the hero "Bean Fu" from a bean into a human form, overcome difficulties, and adhere to the dream of improving the fairy.
Wudang Mountain is one of the world's cultural heritage sites announced by the United Nations. It is also the birthplace of Taoist culture and Wudang martial arts. It is called "the world's first fairy mountain."
The director said that in the early days of the film, he had travelled with the main team to Wudang Mountain.
He said that the story of "Bean Fun" took place in the West Han Dynasty, under the background of Liu'an, the king of Huangnan, and the film's protagonist, "Bean Fu," was a bean that accidentally turned into a human form in Liu'an.
In addition to Wudang Mountain, which is the birthplace of the Daoist culture, Hubei also has deep roots with China's long-standing traditional musical instrument, the chime.

Nostalgia is popular in the market - "Hara Summer Camp" and "Detective Shuang"
Retelling the story is an attempt to miss the years of the actors' 80s and the years of trash in the 90s (before and after David Wayne and Michael Schwaite made the sketch comedy "The Nation" for MTV); as well as the nostalgia itself, the memory of 2001; a year before many stars such as Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Luther had yet to come to life.

It was a moment of random madness that might power the movie, like the recurrent "Seven Years of Life" series, until I came to what I thought was the logical conclusion: "Hala Summer Camp: Twenty Years Later," the final act of which was for the group to see the film premiere of "Hala Summer Camp."
Meanwhile, Amazon's "Detective Twins" speaks of different nostalgic content: The Cold War revival of "The American Dream," the film "The City of the Cold," and even the East-West wrestling imagery of "GLOW: Gorgeous Women's Wrestling League."

The main characters - the hardcore Grigor and the idealistic Ezekiel - are played, respectively, by Florin Pierce, Jr., and Korneliu Ulitch, whose dialogue is voiced in English by Channing Tatum (also executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
This is a wonderful idea.

There are some good visual tips (the police spend time playing chess on TV because Americans like to play football).
And there are a number of celebrity soundtrack actors - including Jenny Slater, Nick Offman, Mach Sarah Hashbaz Ali, and Colo Cervini - who have created a wonderful sound event.
But "Detective Twins" is so devoted to creating a boisterous propaganda comedy - in which there is a killer wearing a Reagan mask - that it usually plays.
The six-episode long TV is slightly delayed, and the effects are not released quickly or frequently enough.

Reporters recently learned that the benefits of iron and steel, rail transit, ships, machinery manufacturing and other industries in northeast China have generally declined, and even suffered losses.
Some experts believe that in the current situation, the new revival of northeast industry is not only related to the national economic recovery, but will also have an impact on the long-term development of China's manufacturing industry and international competitiveness.
The main performance of Northeast industry in the current economic downturn is the general decline of corporate efficiency in traditional industries and the serious decline or even loss of the benefits of the raw materials industry and heavy machinery equipment manufacturing.
In the past, in the economic downturn, mainly low-end, primary products hit the characteristics, but this economic volatility, the northeast traditional industrial high-end, low-end industrial products are affected.
In previous years, Angang started by restructuring its products to focus on high-end panels such as container boards, rail tracks, ship boards and civilian household appliances, but sales of these varieties have fallen sharply this year, especially since they fell by 50 per cent over the same period last year.
 (Hu Qinghun, head of the metallurgical division of the Liaoning Provincial Commission of Engineering and Technology, said that metallurgical is the third largest industry in Liaoning, with 60 million tons of iron and steel production capacity ranked third in the country.
From January to May this year, the output of crude steel in Liaoning Province was 22.54 million tons, and the production and marketing situation of products needed for projects encouraged by state policies and built by local governments was relatively good, and the decline of products with more intense market competition was another feature of the northeast manufacturing industry.

Japan's Olympic Committee has said it is aiming for 30 gold medals at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics and is in the top three of the gold medal table.
In October last year, the chairman of the sports committee of the Japanese Olympic Committee said he expected the Japanese to win 2.5 times more gold medals at the Tokyo Olympics than at the Rio Olympics.

The Bank of England will maintain an interest rate of 0.25%
The Bank of England will announce at a later date that interest rates will remain unchanged, after weak economic growth and loose inflation have dashed hopes of a rise.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will continue to be "weak" as it controls interest rates while tightening household incomes.
Policymakers on the bank's monetary policy committee voted 6-2 to maintain an interest rate of 0.25 per cent, while a handful of members this month called for higher interest rates, even if weak economic growth has weakened the boost.
In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank of England reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 and 2018 to 1.7pc and 1.6pc, respectively, and warned that household income tightening would continue, while inflation would soar to nearly 3pc in the autumn.
But it says it will need to raise interest rates in the next few years to curb inflation from Brexit, while borrowing costs may need to rise more sharply as expected in financial markets.
A year ago, under the influence of Brexit, a massive economic-promotion policy was implemented, and members voted to withdraw it.
The Bank of England will announce the suspension of its regular funding plan to provide cheap money to banks starting next February, although it says it will now need an additional 15 billion pounds on top of 115 billion pounds.
In the minutes of the interest rate decision, the Bank of England said: "gross domestic product (GDP) remains weak in the near term, as the tightening of real household incomes will continue to suppress consumption."
On interest rates, the bank has repeatedly reiterated the need for "some monetary tightening" to crack down on inflation, and for a "greater degree" than markets expect.
The market is now expected to grow for the first time in the third quarter of next year and for the second time in 2020.
But the bank stressed that any increase would be "slow" and "restrained."
The bank's growth forecasts for this year and next are on a downward trend, compared with forecasts of 1.9pc and 1.7pc in May.
The bank maintained its forecast of 1.8 per cent growth in 2018.
The pound fell against the dollar, followed by the euro.
The pound fell 0.5 per cent to 1.31 against the dollar and 0.4 per cent against the euro to 1.11.
The unchanged decision comes after rising expectations were dashed by recent gloomy growth figures, with GDP rising to 0.3% in the second quarter, compared with 0.2% in the previous three months.
The bank said growth was likely to remain at 0.3pc in the third quarter, although it will rise slightly at the end of the year.
Ordinary households have been hit by a surge in inflation and wage growth has been negligible, and the Bank of England's recent inflation report has not given them good news because the bank says austerity will get worse before it gets better,
It said monetary policy "cannot prevent" a hit to revenue over the next few years, but wages are expected to recover "on a large scale" at the end of the three-year forecast.
At the same time, with the fall in the pound and a surge in demand for British goods, the economy will be stimulated to offset some of the low consumption.
The decision comes a year after the shocking EU referendum sent the pound plummeting, with interest rates cut to 0.25% in August.
The Bank of England estimates it could take four years to have a full impact on prices and the British economy.
The call for higher interest rates came ahead of the bank's latest rate ruling, as inflation added to already stressed households, while three policymakers called for an increase in interest rates to 0.5pc in July.
Inflation fell to 2.6pc last month from 2.9pc in June, although the Bank of England said this was expected and would rise again in the next few months.
The bank said the excess, relative to its 2 per cent target, was already entirely the final bottom line for the weak pound.
"given the recent fall in swap rates, the mortgage market looks set to become more competitive again, as lenders make a strong call for more business and look forward to a positive end to the year," said Andrew Monterrey, director of Coreco Mortage Brokers.
Such a market looks particularly favorable for those who may be nearing the end of existing deals, as remortgages (many of which are free of fees and low interest rates) become increasingly popular.

Controversial HIV drug on the NHS gives green light
Patients will be able to access "transformative" HIV prevention treatment starting in September, after the High Court settled on drug funding for the NHS.
NHS England has announced that pre-exposure preventive medication (PrEP), a drug that can be taken before sex, has been shown to reduce the risk of infection in high risk groups by about 86 per cent, and health services will now deliver the drug to an estimated 10,000 people through a three year initial trial.
It agreed to fund the trial after the Court of Appeal upheld the High Court ruling last year, which said the NHS was entitled to pay for PrEP despite claims that local authorities should fund the drug.
The move announced on Thursday was described as a "major new intervention" by Simon Stevens, chief executive of the NHS, while the National AIDS Trust (NAT) described it as a "critical moment."
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to be registered. More clinics will be joined in October, followed by full implementation across England in April 2018.
Pre-exposure prevention medication (PrEP) is an HIV drug taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
Tests have shown that PrEP can significantly reduce HIV transmission among people at risk of infection.
Taking PrEP before sex means there are enough specific drugs in the body to prevent HIV infection.
The drug can be taken every day or two hours before sexual intercourse.
Those eligible for treatment include gay, bisexual men, transgender people and positive people living with HIV who have not been successfully treated.
The clinic will determine whether eligible participants who agree to the trial, including men, women, transgender people, and their sexual partners with HIV status, are receiving antiretroviral treatment unknown.
People who live in England and register as general practitioners can also sign up at their local sexual health clinics.
The scheme will cost £10m, while the NHS England branch has signed a contract to procure the drugs this week following international competitive procurement.
The trial aims to assess the full potential of PrEP by gathering clinical evidence on how it is positioned, absorbed and implemented on the basis of large samples.
Mr Stevens said: "this major new intervention should be a broad and increasingly successful complement and reinforcement of HIV prevention.
This is another milestone in more than 30 years of action worth making progress in addressing the major health challenges of humanity, "he said.
Deborah King, chief executive of the UK AIDS Trust (NAT), said: "this is a critical moment in the fight against AIDS.
If it does target people in need and at risk, pre-exposure preventive medication offers the possibility of changing the UK's AIDS epidemic.
Starting in September, people at high risk of HIV will be given a permitted new tool through the NHS-funded trial in England, a tool that can truly be implemented alone and without consultation with sexual partners, which will lead to improvements in the lives of many people.
We have two hands in favor of this announcement, "he said.
Ian Green, chief executive of the Terrence Higgins Trust, said: "the priority now is to ensure that trials are quickly pushed away across the country and that none of the people living with HIV can fall.
Now that we have purchased the PrEP trial drug, we are ready to protect more than 10,000 people at high risk for HIV, "he said.
Sharon Hodgson, the shadow public health minister, said: "after months of delays and government delays, the start of the PrEP trial is welcome and should come sooner.
The evidence shows how this drug can bring about change as part of our approach to preventing HIV and stopping the spread of this deadly infectious disease.
This trial will give us a further and full understanding of the advantages of PrEP.
It is now very important that this trial be launched throughout the country as soon as possible in order to protect people exposed to HIV and to help us further end the spread of HIV in society. "
In 2015, for the purpose of technical cooperation or M & A, he led a team to visit many of the car factories.
High quality of life: Use the loft and clever design to make the Earl's Palace apartment into a spacious home
Joanne Ray, a former banker, was keen on refurbishment and, in 2014, moved from her large house in Knightsbridge to the Earl's Palace apartment.
The apartment is located on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - Joanne didn't pack up to sell it, which is a powerful testament to the new design.
"before that, my ex and I lived in a bigger house in Knightsbridge," Joanne said.
"I was looking for the right house for the offer.
I saw the apartment at the Earl's Palace, which also had a high ceiling.
I liked it, and I made an offer the same day. "
Since seeing it for the first time, the 1,000 square foot apartment has now completed a thorough overhaul.
The apartment was originally a complex single room - needed to walk through the kitchen to get to the bedroom - and Joanne wanted to add storage space and loft at the time to make the most of the ample ceiling height.
"I want high ceilings, big windows, plenty of light.
That's what I asked for, "she said.
To that end, she hired Elvan Azadi, from the Duck Bay Shed Building and Design Studio (in Notting Hill), to use the 12.5-foot ceiling to create a home that is not only a development project, but also a place where Joanne lives.
The height of the ceiling is not enough to add two upper and lower spaces, so the architectural challenge is to create a loft high enough to stand.
Elvan has to play creative thinking so that he can solve this problem.
"the steel structure is quite complex," he explained.
"we have to arrange the space for it to be displayed up and down, and we don't have to shrug our backs.
It's not just about building a simple platform, it's about starting the steel so that it's at the right level of functionality, "he said.
Through this arrangement, Elvan was able to get two full-body rooms in the space - which could add a lot of interesting elements.
The loft features a Retrovius brand of retro copper windows overlooking the charming living area.

Two brothers stage $500 million real estate empire battle
Forty years after his Italian family founded the dynasty, the brothers fought for one of Victoria's largest real estate empires, worth more than $500 million.
Colin De Lutis, a former Carlton Football Club director and developer, lives in a mansion in the Tukala district, and the three doors are at the residence of his brother Paul, who took him to the Supreme Court over the division of their real estate and business assets.
Paul has been hoping to break away from the family business since 2014, but the brothers had a heated argument in the Supreme Court over the asset split.
The brothers and their mother owned a total of 38 real estate properties, worth more than $500 million, which had accumulated since the family bought Smith Street, Collingwood, in 1973.
There, the family founded Westco Jeans and gradually developed it to the size of 160 retail chains.
In 1999, the company sold for $85 million.
The money was then put into real estate, and the de Rutis family's portfolio now includes city office buildings, the Brunswick and Sorrento development, the Gold Coast and Mount Buller apartments, and suburban shopping centres.
Under an agreement with his late father, Colin, known by his brother Paul as the "main mover and dominant figure" of the De Rutis family, has about two-thirds of the company's assets, while Paul accounts for about a third.
Documents filed with the court said that, converted, Colin owned property worth $316 million, while Paul owned property worth $176 million.
Paul came to believe that the division of real estate and cash proved to be the crux of the talks.
"Colin's proposal for the division of property left him with what I consider to be the best property," he wrote in a 2015 first court affidavit.
On Friday, the Supreme Court held its first hearing after several failed mediation attempts.
Now, the two brothers are still fighting for control of the existing business, and Paul says Colin has kicked him out.
Colin denied this and accused Paul of poor management of certain real estate.
In an early affidavit submitted by Colin, he expressed a desire to resolve the dispute.
"my Italian heritage determines that the family is the most important option. My Italian origin determines that the family is the most important," he wrote.
The cost of the case has been rising, along with hundreds of pages of statements of defence, e-mails, and company reports from top law firms such as Deloitte, Pitcher Partners, Charter Keck Cramer, Allan Myers, QC, and senior lawyers hired by both parties.
Ms. de Rutis and her late husband Luigi, who were both Italian immigrants, had been running mass restaurants and deli since the late 1950s and had bought a shop in Brunswick in the early 1970s.
They used collateral to buy the Collingwood property, where Colin opened the family's first jeans shop.
Colin said, "I read my senior year," where he started Westco, "at the time, Paul was small (about 10)."
Anna de Rutis says she and Luigi, who died in 2012, want to be able to pass on the property peacefully to their son
"Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to end up in court," she wrote.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer members of De Rutis Group, and Colin said Mark paid him $10 million when he left the company, and $26 million to Luke.
Both Luke and Mark "expressed dissatisfaction with the terms of their property division," Paul said.
Despite being a board member of the former AFL club, Colin has kept a low profile, according to a biography by TV star Eddie McGuire, which was published in 2015.
"Fairfax Media" contacted Colin and Paul, as well as their lawyers, on Friday.
But only Colin replied by text message, saying that because the case had been referred to the court "I really can't say too much."
"my brother Paul chose to sue me and bring our family affairs to court, which is very, very sad," he wrote.
In mid 2016, Colin wrote in a court filing that he had tried to meet the demands of his brother.
"our father does not want to see Paul and I end up in a dispute like this at the moment," he said, adding that he "remains hopeful that the dispute will be resolved."
On Friday, that hope seemed dashed.
"our problems will be resolved through the courts in the near future," Colin wrote.

Trump's new chief of staff plans to limit the president's media time
Others have tried, but all have failed.
John F. Kelly might really be able to do it.
If that's true, then he's the first person.
According to the US political news website Politico, the new White House chief of staff plans to limit the flow of information to President Trump - including news media reports - with a view to ensuring greater stability for the big boss.
Here is a passage from journalist Josh Dorsey:
"when the new White House Chief of Staff John F. Kelly began his first day of work and gathered with senior officials, he pointed out that he wanted to address one of President Trump's main problems in the White House: The bad information flowing into the president's hands."
Kelly told the officials that receiving good information would help the president make better decisions, so that information would need to go through his hands - both in writing and in briefings.
Kelly's diagnosis is similar, but others have tried to tame it by monitoring Trump's media time, but it has failed.
President Trump has a long history of television addiction - and now in the White House, his habit of watching television is still deepening.
In February, Sam Norberg, a former campaign adviser, told Politico: "if candidate Trump is frustrated by unfair reporting, it would be helpful to let him know that he also has positive coverage in credible channels.
Tara Palmeri of Politico wrote at the time that "based on the experience of six former campaign officials, the focus of the habit of controlling Trump's tweets is to ensure that there is always some praise in the media messages he receives personally."
It's not a problem at all.
But the idea that Trump's Twitter habit was once "controlled" is laughable.
Perhaps these campaign officials know something we don't know - that Trump's tweets would have been even more furious had it not been for their intervention.
We may never know those tweets that Trump did not send.
If his staff were able to save him from the fire, even if only a few times, their efforts would be worth it.
But no one has always been able to prevent Trump from being controversial.
Part of the problem is that, in a White House of competing groups, people advance their cause by presenting Trump with information that may or may not be reliable to promote their world view.
Politico - all about the story - reported in May on advisers' penchant for strategically providing dubious information to the president.
This is an example described by journalist Shane Goodman:
"current and former Trump officials say that Trump's response to negative news clips, such as volcanic eruptions, especially damaging leaks of information, will be frantically trying to find its source.
At the end of February, a malicious copy of an article on the Web demagogue Charles C. Johnson's website, GotNews.com, accused Deputy Chief of Staff Katie Walsh of being the White House's "source of a lot of information leaks," as Trump did at the time.
Even if Johnson had been permanently banned by Twitter for harassment, he had not provided any concrete evidence, and he had blown up a large number of false allegations, which he later publicly denied.
Trump read the article and then began to ask officials about Walsh. "
Goodman also said the then chief of staff, Reince Priebus, and White House Secretary Rob Porter "tried to create a system to manage and document the documents Trump received."
The result?
Kelly intends to do the same, after three months.
He may prove to be a more efficient manager than Priebus, but Trump is still the impulsive Trump, and his aides are still competing for influence.
These eternal influence factors will make Kelly's task difficult.

Caravans negotiate ditches, return to "Rich Street"
Some of the richest owners in the West Midlands are once again at loggerheads with determined caravans, who negotiate a ditch dug by the government for land outside of the mansion.
The caravans parked their 20 trailers in a vacant lot outside the bustling Solihull Street, which has been dubbed the "Rich Street."
Caravans, with horses, babies in their arms and a motorcade, returned after being driven away in May, and the "moat" dug up by the municipal authorities did not stop them from entering.
The sleek and sophisticated team found a gap in the line of defence, through which their vehicles pushed in, although there was no roadblock for passage.
Angry residents have lashed out at the Solihull Council, saying it is "doing badly" in dealing with the problem.
One resident, who did not want to be named, said: "they were there on Monday night, before coming to Bentley Heath Street and throwing stones at passersby.
The committee should be ashamed of what they are doing, because they are simply useless in dealing with problems.
The passengers came here in May and were then driven away, and now they are back.
A lot came last night and it could be a lot more today, "he said.
She added: "Birmingham City Council knows how to deal with it by implementing a long ban to protect its parks.
I live on Smartsbrook Road and would not be willing to continue paying council tax if the council could not prevent such a thing.
One local resident, who did not wish to be named, said: "this is ridiculous, we have just seen the last batch of caravans go, just to facilitate the destruction of another.
The number has increased again this time, and some have even seen horses eating grass on the park lawn, "he said.
A Solihull Council spokeswoman said: "we are aware of unauthorized camping on a vacant lot in Swartsbrook Road and we are now working with Solihull Police and taking the necessary legal action to move them out as soon as possible.
To support us in gathering evidence, it is important that as many local residents as possible report any antisocial or criminal behaviour to the police by calling 101.
This helps us to provide an overview of the situation when we submit cases to the Court for its review. "

Italy takes an aggressive approach to non-governmental organization migrant boats
Italy has warned non-governmental organizations operating migrant boats in the Mediterranean that they will not be allowed to continue their rescue efforts without signing up to new operational management norms.
"if non-governmental organizations do not sign up to the new code of conduct, it is hard to see why they will follow," Interior Minister Marco Minty told the Turin daily News.
Minty's warning came a day after Italian officials seized a German aid group, Youth Aid, on suspicion that the crew of a ship actually colluded with traffickers to assist illegal immigrants.
The aid group, which has only been operating for a year, declined to comment on the specific subject of charges by Italian prosecutor Ambrosio Cartorcio.
"saving lives is and will be the most important thing for us, so we regret not being able to operate in the search and rescue zone right now," the group said in a social media statement.
"after collecting all the information, we can only assess all the allegations and the situation at the moment." "
Italian officials have been monitoring the "youth rescue" group's ship, the Iuventa, since October.
Its crew is suspected of carrying migrants transported directly from small boats by traffickers and allowing smugglers to flee in a hurry and reuse their ships.
At least one such meeting allegedly took place at sea 1.3 miles off the coast of Libya, according to the prosecutor's document, which was published by Italian media.
Its crew is suspected of blatant disregard for the authority of the Italian Coast Guard, which oversees rescue operations in the area for humanitarian enthusiasm rather than any other motive.
According to the code of conduct, ships such as Iuventa are clearly in need of an Italian police officer on board to monitor their activities.
Currently, only three of the nine non-governmental organizations involved in search and rescue operations have agreed to abide by the code of conduct, namely Save the Children, the Marta-based migrant maritime aid station and Pro-Activa Open Arms in Spain.
The latter said on Thursday that it did not believe the new rules were necessary but acceptable because they would not bring any "significant changes and obstacles" to its rescue operations.
Among the organizations that refused to sign were the Nobel Prize-winning organization Doctors Without Borders (MSF).
At the same time, Minty said the number of migrants arriving in Italy has plummeted in recent weeks, suggesting that efforts to strengthen the Libyan coast guard and unite local mayors are beginning to bear fruit.
"in recent days, we are beginning to see light at the end of the tunnel," the minister said.
He unveiled plans for in-depth talks this month: With Libyan mayors on economic development activities, and with Chad, Niger and Mali on how to reduce the number of migrants who want to leave those countries for Europe.
Lianping, the bank's chief financial scientist, said industrial value-added growth was expected to accelerate to 6.6pc in December, as the first three quarters of 2017 were marked by an end-of-season upswing.

While industrial production will be weaker than in October, it will be roughly the same as in November.
In December, China's manufacturing investment was low, but there was a slight improvement in capital investment, so fixed asset investment is expected to be flat in November.

Michelle Carter sentenced for texting to encourage Conrad Roy to commit suicide
A Massachusetts woman has been sentenced to two and a half years for encouraging her boyfriend to commit suicide through text messages and phone calls.
Michelle Carter, 20, will serve 15 months of his sentence, which can be converted to probation, plus five years of probation.
Carter was convicted in June of whether or not to commit intentional manslaughter against Conrad Roy, who committed suicide on July 13, 2014.
Roy's father said at Thursday's hearing: "my family is devastated.
My son is my best friend. ""
While awaiting appeal, Carter was allowed to maintain personal liberty.
She faces up to 20 years in prison, but her lawyers believe that both she and Mr. Roy are mentally ill.
At the time of sentencing, Carter stood, wearing red trousers and a beige blouse, his hands tight, his eyes tearful, his eyes down.
"her actions killed Conrad Roy," the prosecutor told the court.
'she ended his life for the sake of living better.
She did not take responsibility, "the prosecutor said.
"she doesn't have any remorse."
But Carter's lawyer said it was "a terrible consequence, and she felt very sorry."
However, Judge Lawrence Moniz said he did not find that her "age or maturity, or even her mental illness, would have any significant impact on her behaviour."
'i don't have a day where I don't feel the pain of losing my beloved son, 'a prosecutor read a statement from Roy's mother, Lynn Roy.
I hope he is proud of me and what I have done, and I am trying to stand with his sisters in all my pain, which will be with us forever, "the statement said.
Mr Roy's sister, Camdyn Roy, testified that she was "distraught" because she realised she would never be able to attend her brother's wedding or become an aunt to his children.
"it is a pain to lose someone who has been with me since I was born, and it will be with me for the rest of my life," she said.
The case appears to set a legal precedent because Massachusetts law does not make it a crime to incite others to commit suicide.
In 2014, Roy was found dead from carbon monoxide poisoning in his car; that year, Carter was 17.
The case sparked national attention after Carter's text messages revealed she encouraged him to commit suicide.
"there are many ways of hanging, jumping, stabbing himself," she said in several text messages sent two weeks before his death; he was on holiday with his family.
In the period before his suicide, she wrote: "you need to do this, Conrad," and "all you have to do is start the generator and then be free and happy."
Judge Muniz said Carter had drawn attention through Mr Roy's death and ordered her not to profit from the case through any media.
There are legal differences of opinion in this case.
One of the few to defend Carter is Amanda Knox, who was acquitted two years after being charged with the murder of her British roommate in Italy in 2007.
"Michelle Carter deserves sympathy and help, not imprisonment," Ms. Knox, 30, said in a column published in the Los Angeles Times.

Automakers face shock, Audi to retrofit up to 850,000 diesel cars
The day before Audi announced the conversion, BMW said it would provide software upgrades for more than 350,000 vehicles.
BMW's chairman said the company believes there are "more smart options for driving than restrictions," meaning that major European cities - including Munich, where BMW is headquartered - consider banning or restricting diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced Tuesday that it will retrofit 3 million Mercedes cars in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions.
None of the companies claimed the move as a recall.
European automakers are aggressively promoting the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to help meet carbon dioxide emissions regulations.
But nitrogen oxide emissions from diesel engines are considered carcinogens and can lead to asthma.
The cost of car companies installing equipment to offset diesel vehicle emissions is also increasing, making it difficult to keep diesel cars competitive in price.
As German automakers face scrutiny, the government led by Chancellor Angela Merkel has also been accused of allowing the powerful car companies too much and ignoring signs of the problem.
The companies are trying to avoid a repeat of Volkswagen's attempts to cover up their use of so-called defeat devices, adjust emissions to comply with regulations when cars are tested, and return to normal driving conditions.
Multiple VW executives have been charged in the United States, while others are being investigated by countries on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former head of thermodynamics at the Audi engine research and development department was arrested in Germany.
Former manager Zachero Giovani Palmio, who is Italian and therefore not subject to extradition protection, could face trial in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi was embroiled in a German criminal investigation involving VW, in which the German government accused Audi of installing systems to evade emissions requirements in Europe, expanding an investigation previously limited to the United States.
Audi's investigation could have a major impact on VW: Luxury automakers account for a disproportionate share of Volkswagen's profits.
It is common for a film to take a year or two, or even a few years, from preparation to release.
The animated film "Big Fish," which took 12 years from preparation to release, has been announced for release on July 8.
Mr. Liang, a 21-year-old author of "The Big Fish," founded the other side of the world with his friend Zhang Chun. In 2008, he won a $1 million venture to launch the first animated film, "The Big Fish."
The film has won many awards at home and abroad in the creative film stage, and has been included and praised as "one of the most outstanding works of art" by the Centre for Contemporary Art in Pompidou, France.
Over the course of six years from creativity to production, the film has been dubbed "the pit" by millions of fans looking forward to its release.
"big Fish" tells a fantasy story that belongs to the Chinese, and with the release of the trailer, it brings new expectations to all audiences.
"these 12 years have only done this one thing, and now it's gone from a dream to a reality, and I'm nervous and excited," Liang said.
"the team is going to be driven crazy by me trying to do exactly the same picture effect with 50 per cent of someone else's budget," Zhang said.
Dongguan, a "world factory" that once relied on processing and mass production, is setting its sights on the high-level talent who can lead the city to reposition.
In a recent week of high-level talent activities organized by the government of Dongzhou, the first financial reporter saw a number of strong local enterprises participating in the Talent Fair.
In the orange background wall against the particularly bright billboard, they each marked an expensive price tag.
Therefore, the China Television Production Industry Association decided that it would join the national television production industry to sign a convention on self-regulation.
Provence lavender threatened by climate change
Lavender has become a symbol of the city of Provence in southern France, but now there is bad news it is under threat from climate change.
Lavender is in decline due to persistent drought and the emergence of virus-carrying insects, which is a headache for scientists and farmers trying to find solutions.
Eric Chaisse, an expert at the Institute for Agricultural Research in Provence, said: 'lavender in Provence is facing a huge threat as the plant has been affected by climate change in recent years, with significantly reduced rainfall in the spring and heavy rain in the fall.
This affects the life cycle of lavender.
There is also a smaller individual, a leaf dada that can spread tiny bacteria and, in very dry weather, they appear in large numbers. "
The key is its huge number.
In addition to attracting holidaymakers, the elegant lavender field is also sought after by the perfume and cosmetics industry.
Eric Chase said: "in contrast to plants that can have many large flowers and have long grain ears, we have problems with smaller individuals, poor growth, loss, or weakness.
So we have less essential oils, "he said.
Solutions under study include better irrigation techniques and the mitigation of soil moisture evaporation, the spraying of protective mixtures of clay and water on plants, and the development of more drought-tolerant varieties.
Compared with the science-fiction elements of the film, the two stars are more attractive to them than the story in the film.
On the afternoon of September 5, the Huaxi Metropolitan News reporter, a series of interviews with a number of prominent people in the cross-talk world, as well as two cross-talk artists, surprisingly, they were almost silent.
One is a Berlin film emperor, one is a rising young actor, "psychological crime" is also the first partner of Liu Fan and Li Yi Feng.
Mexico in danger, journalists killed
The entire staff of the weekly newspaper Riodoce usually meet on Wednesday to review their plans to report on the riots in the state of Sinaloa, caused by criminal organizations, corrupt officials and the endless war on drugs.
But today, the shadow of tragedy hangs over them, and they come together to discuss security issues.
It is important that they are told to change their daily habits.
Two senior journalists discussed what would be more safe: Whether to bring their children to the office, which had been hit by a grenade in 2009, or to leave them at home.
Security experts wrote three words on the blackboard at the front of the room: Enemies, neutrals and allies.
They asked the reporters to give their names under each column - no evidence, observation and intuition would be enough.
There are suspected drug traffickers, politicians, businessmen and journalists on the government list, or cartels, and these villains make reporting in Mexico dangerous.
The violence has never stopped and there have been more and more journalists throughout the country: According to the Committee to Protect Journalists, at least 25 journalists have died since President Enrique Peña Nieto took office in December 2012; 589 journalists have been under federal protection following attacks and threats; and so far this year, at least seven journalists have died in seven states.
The last one to die was their editor and inspiration, as well as Javier Valdez Cardenas, the co-founder of Riodoce.
Valdez, who has written many books about drug violence, wrote in one of them: "the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and become a journalist."
There was a deep sense that he had left, although he was everywhere - a huge photograph hung on the front of the Riodoce office building, Valdez with a middle finger and the word "justice"; and the T-shirts worn by two journalists in their 30s, Aaron Iwala and Miriam Ramirez, showed his smile, wearing glasses or his trademark Panama straw hat.
The seminar was held less than two months after his death; journalists rushed to discuss their shared trauma, nightmares, insomnia and paranoia.
Although a special federal prosecutor's office was created in 2010 to deal with journalists' cases, the office prosecuted only two people, according to records from the Committee to Protect Journalists.
Most of the thousands of crimes committed each year involve drug trafficking and organized crime, so the perpetrators of journalists are rarely brought to justice.
In "Riodoce," they insist on reporting on the violence in the state of Sinaloa, although they are heartbroken, even though the land has been devastated.
There is no information about the killer, there is no justice, and there is little use in holding security seminars, he said.
"it's stupid to waste time attending seminars like this," he said.
As long as we don't know why, you don't trust anyone, "he said.
On the morning of 15 May, Valdez left the office of Riodoce in the capital, Culiacan.
His red Toyota Carola was stopped by two men after only a few blocks out; they forced him out of the car and fired 12 shots, presumably because of the newspaper's name - translated as The Twelfth River.
The gangster drove away in his car and crashed it nearby.
Valdez is 50.
Left behind his wife and two children who were already adults.
Culiacan is full of gossip.
But on the subject of Valdez, there is virtually nothing but silence.
Since Guzman was arrested last year and extradited to the United States in January, the state of Sinaloa has become one of the country's bloodiest battlefields, where hostile forces have gone on a rampage.
Every day, one or more people are shot in the streets of the state of Sinaloa, and the cemetery is full of the drug lord's ornate two-story mausoleum, which has become commonplace.
Temporarily forgetting the "calm" state is when only one cartel controls the seaside state and its ports and drug trafficking routes to the United States.
Even so, even though Valdez is well aware of the dangers of the job, the 60-year-old co-founder and director of Riodoce, Ismail Pohoquay, is guilty of failing to protect his friends.
He believes two mistakes caused the tragedy.
First, an interview with Damaso Lopez, who led a cartel fighting against several of Guzman's sons, was published in February.
The report may have angered the sons; the newspaper was bought out by suspected gang members as soon as it arrived at the newsstand.
The second mistake was not to force Valdez to leave Mexico for his own safety after another newspaper covering the same story was confiscated.
Valdez is a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his death is of great significance to the violence against journalists in Mexico.
His spirit lives on, and his friends and colleagues believe that he has always been with us.
He was also a senior correspondent for Noroste in 2003, when he teamed up with five colleagues to start Riodoce and sell a $50 stake.
In the state of Sinaloa, he said, "it is impossible not to deal with the drug problem in journalism."
As time went by, the newspaper gained a good reputation for its bold and honest reporting, and sales and advertising increased.
Journalists like to be able to publish critical investigative reports without fear of censorship, and readers like newspapers to publish stories that others are afraid to report.
Five years after its creation, "Riodoce" was awarded the Mariana Cabo Press Award for Latin American countries.
That same year, the Association for the Protection of Journalists awarded Valdez the International Press Freedom Award for his courage in pursuing the most authentic Mexican drug coverage.
He confessed that he was scared, too.
When the Society for the Protection of Journalists awarded the award, he said, "I want to continue to live."
Later, in late October, in an interview with local television station Rompeviento TV, he said that "drug trafficking is a way of life in the state of Sinaloa,
You have to take on the task that falls on your shoulders as a journalist - either so, or pretend to be deaf.
I don't want to be asked 'What did you do in the face of so much death... why don't you speak up about what's happening?'
All the staff of "Riodoce" miss Valdez. They miss him cursing like a docker. They miss the friend who never gives a hug and advice, and the teacher who knows how to live.
They rely on his habits.
He used to wear that hat.
The El Guayabo bar, on the opposite side of the office, was always sitting on the same table.
Now, they will ask: Was it his daily habits that caused his fall?
His death also forced them to think about how to do a good job and live well.
'They don't like the fact that you're causing trouble to their women and children, or that you're influencing their legitimate companies and the secret airports used to transport drugs, 'he said.
These have crossed their line, "he said.
The result is to maintain a high level of self-censorship and self-protection, even in the most secure of times.
Trust your instincts.
If you smell the danger, get away from it.
The problem, says Andreas Villarreal, editor of Riodoce, is that "the breath is a feeling of being cheated... and then something like Havel happens."
He and others say that the previous rules no longer apply in the state of Sinaloa - just as they do in the states of Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero, and others, where smuggling routes are lucrative and institutions are weak, government officials corrupt, and smoky.
The situation is constantly changing.
Mobile phones were suddenly not allowed in the room where Riodoce employees participated in security training; a few days earlier, spyware allegedly sold only to the Government had been used in Mexico to spy on journalists and activists.
Outside, two police officers took shelter from the high temperature of 104 degrees (40 degrees Celsius) in the shade of a tree.
They were sent by the state government to protect the offices of Riodoce, which are located in a four-story building in the middle-class block of Culiacan.
Some reporters, half-jokingly, wondered if the police officers would be 50% of what the governor himself had said.
Journalists have been going to the mountains for a few months, where drug cartels are under the control of a physical presence.
Three major events were featured in this week's "Riodoce."
Among them was the killing of the brother of Julio Cesar Chavez, the great former boxer of the state of Sinaloa,
And the disclosure of government funds in the governor's hometown,
As well as the kidnapping inside an expensive restaurant in Culiacan, which is just a block from the prosecutor's office.
Officials don't release information about the victims and the process of kidnapping, so it takes caution to write down what the city knows: The restaurant is a place where drug traffickers and officials love to go.
One journalist learned from public archives that the restaurant was registered in the name of a politician of the ruling Revolutionary Democratic Party (PRI), which dominated the political class almost throughout the last period.
Recently, several Revolutionary Party governors have been accused of corruption in several high-profile cases.
Villarreal asked reporters to write about what had happened at the site before, including the case of a son of Mexico's top drug lord, Guzman, fleeing a military attack.
If, a few months ago, readers would have looked at Valdez's column to find the most powerful information about the kidnapping.
"before, we knew what was going on," said Villarreal, 46, who is known as "skinny" because of his thin figure.
Now all of our communication channels for information sources have been cut off.
Valdez's office is now being used to store signs and stickers protesting the killing of journalists, as employees become what they never wanted to be: Activists representing the media.
The next morning, journalist Miriam Ramirez grabbed a sign and walked out of the room, heading to the local prosecutor's office to take part in a march related to another reporter.
Salvador Adami disappeared in the western state of Michoacan three days after Valdez was killed.
Officials found a charred body and said that, according to DNA tests, it was his body.
Across the country, journalists have become more outspoken, organizing protests and putting the words "save the media" on sidewalks and buildings.
On this day, the director is not in Washington, and he is trying to bring justice to the Valdez case and win international support.
The day after Valdez was killed, in a meeting with the governor of the state of Sinaloa, Ramirez accused officials of spying on journalists and killing them because they had told the truth.
She has also asked to resign from her position covering government affairs, given that her anger has affected her objectivity.
Valdez has repeatedly reiterated that journalists in Mexico are "surrounded" by organized crime, fellow government officials and an indifferent society.
In his last book, "Drug Journalism," he wrote that journalists were not only maimed by drug cartels, but were also on the list of politicians and security forces linked to organized crime.
Articulo 19, a media watchdog group, blamed police and public officials for more than half of last year's attacks on journalists.
"in Mexico, they let you die just to shut you up," Ramirez said.
Obviously, these murders are chilling.
No one has forgotten that six years ago, the blogger Maria Elizabeth Mathias died on the northern border of Tamaulipas.
Next to her body was a note allegedly signed by the Zetas cartel: "I'm here for my report."
Her head was cut off, with a computer keyboard and headphones next to her.
Some newspapers, such as El Norte, on the northern border of the state of Chihuahua, have chosen to shut down after the killing of Milosrava Braci in March.
Others continue, with the killing of the director of "El Manana of Nuevo Laredo" in 2014, but they continue.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juarez used a headline story to speak openly about the drug cartel, with the title "What do you want from us?"
Part of the journalists fled their home town, or even left the country.
This is a difficult choice.
It is difficult to find work in exile, and they still need to be careful and alert to danger in the streets.
Sometimes they are arrested, and in 2015 photographer Reuben Espinosa is said to have been killed along with four women in a Mexican city three months after fleeing Veracruz.
For those who stay behind the scenes and continue to work, this is the daily dance step for high-risk decision-making.
Iwala, who had wanted to become a poet, admitted that reporting on the drug trade had scared him.
He said "Mexico is turning into hell, so I became a journalist."
In the middle of the night on a recent Friday, the latest edition of the newspaper had been printed, and the editors of Riodoce were sitting on the aisle outside the office drinking beer when suddenly their phones rang.
Nineteen people have been confirmed dead in a series of gunfights between rival gangs and security forces near the beach resort city of Massatland.
The fighting is escalating, as foreshadowed by a series of cartel information found in the region.
By the side of the road, they uploaded the news on their mobile phones to the website of Riodoce.
The next day's headlines had to change.
Sirens rang nearby - another gunfight for a life and death duel in the area.
He glanced at the police officers, who were standing there, to see if they were alert.
If they had a little bit of fear, then they didn't show it either.
The founder of the newspaper had been killed, and in his large portrait, his middle finger pointed to what needed to be looked at throughout the state of Sinaloa, followed by the entire staff of Riodoce.
"how could you even want to shut down? On the same day that Havel was killed, the intern asked me to send her to the street to take part in the story," he said.
China's Self-driving Tourism 2020 Market Scale or Breakthrough 100 Billion
In the context of the rise in consumption and the prevalence of free movement, self-driving is encouraged by national policies and popular with more and more consumers.
But at the same time, the self-driving market, which is expected to break through the trillions, faces a double challenge.
In the context of the rise in consumption and the prevalence of free movement, self-driving is encouraged by national policies and popular with more and more consumers.
But at the same time, the self-driving travel market, which is expected to break through the trillion-dollar scale, faces a double challenge. On the one hand, the development of the self-driving industry is not proportional to market demand.
Accounting for 60% of the total number of domestic visitors, the market size is expected to break the trillion
With 4.40 billion domestic trips in 2016, self-driving tourism accounts for about 60 per cent of the total number of domestic trips, and the market is expected to exceed trillion by 2020.
According to statistics from the China Travel and Shipping Association, the number of people travelling by car has continued to grow over the past five years, accounting for more than half of the total number of tourists in the country.
At the same time, more attention and support have been shown at the regional and national levels in the emerging area of self-driving, with policies and regulations in place from 2016 to 2017 relating to self-driving, caravans and camping tourism.
In July 2017, eight departments, such as the National Tourism Administration and the National Sports Administration, jointly issued the "Plan for the Development of Auto Self-driving Sports Camp"; in the same month, the Action Plan for the Promotion of the Quality of Rural Tourism Development (2017), issued jointly by the Development and Reform Commission and the Ministry of Finance, was highlighted.
The introduction of the policy provides opportunities and policy guidance for the development of domestic self-driving tour.
Self-driving tour club profit is modest, complete industrial chain is the key
Despite the great potential of the domestic self-driving tourism market and the active guidance of national policy, the self-driving tourism industry is still in its early stages.
According to the 2016-2017 annual development report on self-driving tours in China, there are thousands of self-driving clubs, car clubs, car parks, etc., but tourists make up the majority of self-driving trips, with only about 15 per cent participating in various institutions, such as car parks and self-driving clubs.
At the same time, there are only a handful of online travel companies and traditional travel agencies that develop their own self-driving products. Many online travel platforms sell only self-driving products from some suppliers, and some self-driving clubs are important suppliers.
In terms of organizing self-driving activities, it covers many aspects of "eating, living, travelling, swimming, buying and selling," with a high degree of fragmentation, heavy upstream supply chain and random consumption by tourists.
Li Guanjie, founder and CEO of Beijing Motor Club, believes that the self-driving club is essentially similar to the travel agency, and that the main profit model in the early years was under-line activities, with the core point being self-driving line products and tour leader services.
But now in the field of self-driving travel line products are highly homogeneous, the service level of the team leader is uneven, the self-driving club is facing the need to transform again.
It can be seen that self-driving tourism itself is not an independent industry, but with the displacement characteristics of self-driving tourism to form a cross-regional and industrial ecological circle, it is very important to form a complete industrial chain.
Experts point out that, in addition to basic tourism consumption, experience is the more important element of consumption.
Therefore, for the development of self-driving tourism industry, should enhance the experience characteristics, develop the theme of "self-driving travel +" and the IP of self-driving travel products.
The scenic road is not only the road, the car camp should not only meet the accommodation
In the face of the rise of self-driving tourism, the basic supporting development of self-driving travel is also relatively junior.
Li pointed out that the tourist scenic road is not just a road, but needs to integrate the elements of transportation and tourism, but the road repair and tourism itself are the two departments responsible, the transportation department added tourism elements, but also in the construction of toilets, counselling centres, propaganda bars and other facilities, and tourism integration is not high.
Compared with the well-known self-driving route "American Highway 66," the construction experience is worth learning from.
The landscape road design is no longer the most direct and fast route between destination and destination. Instead, it follows the concept of "experiencing the pleasure of driving" and provides the best enjoyment for self-driving tourists to enjoy the beautiful scenery. It can connect the point-shaped and face-shaped tourist landscape, preserving the historical and cultural value of the eco-tourism resources along the route.
In addition to the scenic road, the camp is also an important supporting facility for self-driving tours.
But of the self-driving tourists known to reporters at the Beijing News, few consumers have chosen to stay in the camp.
They argue that many camps tend to be infrastructure-oriented and can only meet the need for food and shelter, low grade, single product, and self-driving, which includes many elements.
People in the industry, who did not wish to be named, said that many of the enterprises that did camp in previous years were to take the land, after the land, the supporting infrastructure construction and services have not kept up, many of the operating conditions are losses, and there is no late capital injection, it is difficult to do some matching products.
Consumer group
In terms of age, the self-driving group is concentrated in the 21-40 age group, especially in the 31-40 age group, which has a certain economic base and a high demand for personalized tourism, according to data released in 2017 by the China Travel and Shipping Association.
According to the accommodation survey, the self-driving people prefer non-standard accommodation.
In terms of the type of self-driving, peripheral self-driving is the most important type of self-driving travel, accounting for 84. 32%.
Exit self-driving is the desire of many people, but the proportion is still small.
At the same time, as consumer demand increased, tourists who used to prefer self-driving "tourist attractions" began to change their minds. Instead of "getting out of the car to take photos and go to bed," they paid more attention to the experience and process of travel.
Dinosaurs use camouflage to avoid enemy
At first glance, it's terrible, but it looks like a statue.
Researchers have released the first study of a rhino-sized, incredible fossil found by Canadian miners, pointing out that the fossil is well preserved, so experts are calling it the "Mona Lisa of the dinosaur world."
The fossil was so well preserved that it was even able to determine that its scaly skin was red and brown, suggesting that it had had some "troubling experiences."
Related reports in the journal Current Biology describe it as "the most well-preserved manicure dinosaur ever found, and one of the best dinosaur specimens in the world."
The fossil is a newly discovered species of nodule dragon that lived between 110 and 112 million years ago in the middle of the Cretaceous period.
It was extremely well preserved and shocked researchers, who described it as "truly stunning."
According to National Geographic magazine, the herbivore is the most well-preserved fossil of its kind ever found.
On March 21, 2011, Shawn Funk found the fossil while digging at the Suncor Millennium mine near Fort McMurry, northern Alberta, Canada.
At the time, he came across something that seemed different from the rocks around him, and he decided to take a closer look.
After that, the fossils he found were sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology in Canada.
It took six years for the researchers to show off the beast hidden inside the 2,500-pound (1,100-kilogram) block.
After such hard work, the final results have only now been published.
"if you look at it, you can almost believe it's sleeping," said Caleb Brown, a scientist and first author at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature is on display
"it will become one of the most beautiful and well preserved dinosaur specimens in the history of science - the Mona Lisa in the dinosaur world."
By studying its skin, the researchers found that the herbivore creature, although covered in armor, like a walking tank, could be exposed to significant threats from carnivore dinosaurs.
The heavily armoured dinosaur uses red-and-white camouflage to hide from predators and uses what is known as "anti-shade," a technique also used by many modern animals.
In this way, experts say, it can better integrate with the surrounding environment and thus avoid the enemy, suggesting it was preyed on by larger dinosaurs.
The 110 million-year-old creature, part of the nodule dragon family, was first introduced in May and is currently on display at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.
After Mark Mitchell, a museum technician who was part of the team, spent 7,000 hours carefully unveiling the behemoth, researchers are now looking at it and naming it "Borealopelta marquee."
The samples are extremely well preserved, allowing Dr Mitchell, as well as the international team of scientists, to record the patterns and shapes of the scales and armor on their bodies.
They discovered the "anti-shade" technique, a common defense in the animal world, which means the creature's back is darker than its side.
Although "anti-shade" was common, the findings were surprising, as the dinosaur was much larger than the existing animals using anti-shade.
The dinosaur, which was under pressure to be hunted by meat dinosaurs, evolved in a favourable direction, enabling it to hide in pairs as a means of survival.
However, most of the existing anti-shade animals, such as deer, zebra, or mackerel, are as small and vulnerable as prey, suggesting that the creature is under real pressure to survive.
"the wild predation of large heavy-armor dinosaurs shows how dangerous it is to be a carnivore dinosaur in the Cretaceous period," Brown said.
Chemical analysis of organic compounds in its scales also showed that the dinosaur's skin color was red-brown.
Scientists are continuing to study the creature's life clues, including its retained stomach contents, to find the last food to eat.
They believe the dinosaurs fell into the river at the time of their death and were then rushed into the sea, eventually sinking back down to the bottom of the sea.
At the time, Alberta's climate was as warm as it is today in southern Florida, and rivers and oceans may be further inland than they are now.
"this nodule dragon is truly amazing because it is completely covered in preserved scaly skin and, to this day, has been preserved in V-space, thus preserving its original shape," Brown said.
"as a result, the creature is now in almost the same shape as it was during the Cretaceous period.
You don't have to use too much imagination to rebuild it; if you look at it, you almost believe it's sleeping. "
The Cretaceous period was the period when large animal-foot dinosaurs, walking on two feet, roamed the earth.
Although the Tyrannosaur was the king of the dinosaurs, it did not appear until millions of years after the machete dinosaur, which may have been killed by some of its ancestors.
They include the high thorn dragon, a giant animal weighing six tons and measuring 38 feet (11.5 metres) long.
New research has found that scientists, who appear in the journal Current Biology, believe the nodules were washed into the sea after they died and later formed mummies in the soil.
On March 21, 2011, Sean Fink dug into the creature at the Millennium Mine near Fort McMurry, Alberta, Canada.
According to the museum, it is the best preserved manicured dinosaur in the world, complete with skin and armor in areas from the nose to the hip.
The creature weighs an average of 18 feet (5 meters) and weighs 3,000 pounds (1,300 kilograms).
It has two 20-inch-long sharp horns raised from the shoulders.
Researchers believe the herbivore machete dinosaur was active in what is now western Canada before being washed into the sea by a river that burst into flood waters.
However, the dinosaur was buried at the bottom of the sea, allowing for the complete preservation of its armor.
The fossil remains of this particular sample are very well preserved, leaving the remaining skin still covered with bumpy patches of the dinosaur's skull.
As Michael Greshko wrote in National Geographic, this level of preservation, like medium color, is quite rare.
The more I look at it, the more I find it incredible.
The remaining skin fossils are still covered in mottled armor on the dinosaur's skull.
Its right front hand is located on its side, with five toes spread upward.
I can count a piece of it, "he said.
The reporter learned that adding natural or plant-based algal acid, humic acid and amino acid efficiency carriers to the production process could improve the efficiency of traditional urea, resulting in an increase of 5-10 percentage points in the utilization rate of algal acid, zinc humic acid, and albumin.
Environment-friendly, crop production potential is obvious, especially large particle value-added urea is BB fertilizer high-quality raw materials.
This total number of security personnel is double the number of security personnel at the 2012 London Olympics.
To ensure the safety of the Rio Olympics, Brazil will launch its largest ever security linkage programme.
Earlier, the Brazilian government said a total of 85,000 people from the army and police, including 20,000 troops and 65,000 police officers, would fight the war.
Most of the military will be responsible for defending Olympic venues, while the additional 3,000 will be responsible for security at international airports, subway stations and streets.
Police patrol other parts of the city, including subways, buses and streets.
It is understood that 6,000 military personnel have arrived in Rio for Olympic security services.
In addition to the four major races in charge of the Rio Olympics, they are also responsible for patrolling the airport and the main roads connecting the airport and Olympic venues.
The introduction of evaluation mechanisms in the service sector is not new, and for evaluation mechanisms to be effective, it is important to make regulation more effective and less formal.
How activists learn to answer the question: "whose streets?"
On 9 August 2014, Brittany Ferrell was in a state of trepidation.
On the first day of his trip to New York City, the St. Louis native was sitting on a rental bed and browsing Facebook on his mobile phone.
She stumbled upon a post from a high school student.
"police just killed an 18-year-old child who was still lying in the street," it read.
She was confused to find that no one else on the feed had posted the message. She turned off Facebook and turned on Twitter.
A @ ThePharoah user kept pushing the dynamic Times to her.
The rapper in the St. Louis area tweeted live about the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old black man who was killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri.
He posted a picture of Brown's body lying on the street, where he had lost vital signs, and his body lay on the street for four hours.
"crazy," Ferrell thought.
But death is nothing new for her and her community.
She put down her phone and did not turn on Twitter again until the same evening, reading tweets about the gathering of people on Canfield Avenue.
There were police videos and pictures of people shouting, and a picture of a man claiming to be Brown's father, which read: "Ferguson police just killed my unarmed son!"
She saw a live feed, and a police officer standing in front of a group of protesters with a barking dog.
In another video, another police officer holds up his rifle and screams, "I will kill all of you... animals," she said.
"it's not normal," Ferrell said, recalling.
"this is not what we are used to and can be called a typical murder."
At that moment, I felt a shiver.
I was angry and I was crying, "he said.
She booked a return flight and went home the next day.
After landing at 11pm, she picked up her six-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided that the two would travel to Ferguson the next morning.
Over the next three years, what happened to Ferrell and Ferguson was the subject of a new documentary, "Who's Street?," which opens in theaters on August 11.
It's a story about survival and protest, love and loss, strength and toughness from the perspective of the people who live in this community and fill the streets to demand answers.
As Ferrell drove to Ferguson with his daughter (dressed in a floral skirt and accessorised with a crown), the pair revisited the topic they had discussed countless times before that morning - "about the black experience and the condition of black people."
"do you remember when I taught you when black people had to fight for their faith?" she recalled.
'we're going to Ferguson now because the police killed an 18-year-old boy, and that's not right.
I had to take her with me, "Ferrell said later.
"what happened today is the culmination of all the things of the past.
She wants to know, see, and rise from this.
She needs not only to develop well in radicalism and organization, but to understand the different dimensions of the black experience and condition, and what we have to do to be free and liberated.
Even if I had the privilege of providing her with a racist experience she had not experienced firsthand, she was no different to other black girls.
If I protect her in this matter, I feel like I'm hurting her, "she said.
They arrived at Ferguson's first stop at a venue opposite the South Frorisan Road police station, which became their camp after the militants waited until the result of police officer Darren Wilson's eventual failure to prosecute.
Ferrell and her daughter got in touch with a local business owner who made a bagged lunch.
They prepared the bags and were responsible for passing them on to the protesters.
Slowly, Ferrell began to form a new kind of activism.
"my radicalism changed completely after August 9," she said when she was an undergraduate at Missouri State University in St. Louis, where she was president of the Association of Minority Nursing Students, focusing on food justice and health disparities in black communities.
"I have no organizational experience.
That's how it all came about, "he said.
A few weeks later, Ferrell met with the film's co-director, Sabah Fowler, during a night parade.
Fowler said she and her photography director Lucas Alvarado Farr "just wanted to document" what happened.
Ferrell had a question in mind: "do you want to record or do you want to find a story you can use?"
This suspicion stems from many of these cases: People - often white - enter a community in order to benefit from its pain and toughness.
As Fleyan explained in a recent interview, "We've heard that native people in Ferguson don't concentrate their voices, and we want to do it differently."
Floyd has been in touch with co-director Damon Davis, a regional artist known for his radicalism against dead prisoners.
His involvement led Ferrell, along with six other locals, to join the "Who's Street?" project team for several years after Brown's shooting.
"this documentary is not someone speaking for us or talking to us, this is our statement," Davis said.
'i'm mainly focused on how these characters are presented, because that's also how I'm presented. '
Although the goal is not to focus on Ferrell's experience - but to show that the movement is "not about savior leaders, it's about community cohesion," says Fleyan - she has proved to be the most open of the film's participants.
As a result, "whose streets?" surprisingly records Ferrell's personal life, such as falling in love and stepping into marriage.
"I feel naked," Ferrell laughed when he first saw the finished product.
"but I understand that there has to be a degree of vulnerability to do this work and humanize black people." "
In addition, Ferrell's story reaffirmed and repositioned the role of Black Cool women in the broader Black Lives Matter movement.
Two of the movement's three founders - who created # BlackLivesMatter on social media in the wake of the 2012 shooting of black teenager Trevor Martin - have been identified as Cool.
"black Cool women in the leadership have supported the movement in general," Ferrell said, "and that's because we keep fighting on multiple fronts.
Black Cool women have to bear it, "she said.
Floyd agreed and mentioned that "the movement really has the support of black women and a lot of black Cool women."
Because of her identity, Ferrell was chosen to be at the heart of the film, however, she insisted that "this is not affirmative action for things."
"she was the one who inspired that energy," she said.
'even though she's on the front line, it's no coincidence, because you've got a lot to do as a black Cool woman in the life of these intersections.
Through the screen, you can feel her energy, "she said.
Meanwhile, in Ferguson, news cameras have long since disappeared, but tense race relations between the community and the police remain.
Ferrell was sentenced to more than two and a half years of probation for trying to block the highway during a march.
She described the sociopolitical climate in the region she called home: "a mess."
Still, since taking to the streets of Ferguson three years ago, she has stuck to the chants she struggled to remember.
"we have a responsibility to fight for freedom.
We have a responsibility to win.
We must love each other and support each other.
We have nothing to lose but the chains of our bodies. "
In fact, an online translation service was already available on the Internet a decade ago, and, in fact, the argument that "machines are about to replace humans for translation" has been heard all over the world.
Similarities: The artist uses Chelsea Manning's DNA to create portraits
There are multiple faces in the middle of the pavilion at the Friedman Museum of Art in New York: White, black and brown, each with almost undetectable similarities, tied by a rope hanging from the ceiling.
The 30 portraits were created by the artist, Heather Dewey-Hagborg, using cheek swabs and hair fragments sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
The former intelligence analyst was sentenced to 35 years in prison for leaking classified diplomatic cables through the WikiLeaks website after Manning sent hair debris from the prison.
The exhibition, which opens on August 2, is titled "similarities."
It was the result of two years of correspondence between Dewey Haggenberg and Manning, who combined his discipline with his own in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a prominent dissident who had been jailed and had completed sex reassignment surgery in prison, where former President Barack Obama pardoned the rest of her sentence three days before the end of her term.
Through an algorithm analysis of Manning's DNA and the creation of 30 portraits of a "likely appearance," Heather Dewey Harburg made a scathing and slightly heartless comment, both about DNA and about the concept of identity itself.
Manning, who was born with the name Bradley Edward, who had publicly admitted to thinking she was a woman during adolescence, was convicted in 2013 of 20 charges, including six counts of espionage law violations, computer fraud and theft.
In prison, her image was suppressed, with only one photo, a grainy black-and-white selfie, looking visibly upset, sitting in the driver's seat, wearing a gold-colored wig.
In 2015, Heather Dewey Harburg was a huge success in her 2012 project, "Stranger Faces."
In that work, she uses medium court evidence from cigarette butts and gum, DNA extracted from debris, to create 3D portraits of characters that may be similar in appearance.
That was just when she received an e-mail from Paper magazine.
"they want to interview Chelsea Manning in prison and need a portrait photo," Heather Dewey Harburg told the media at the opening of the exhibition.
Chelsea Manning was unable to visit or take photos at the time, so they contacted Chelsea to ask if she was interested in making a DNA portrait.
So the artist and her imprisoned Muse became unlikely pen pals, exchanging many letters over the course of two years.
They even created a comic book, "Stopped Head," by Shoili Kanungo, which envisaged that the president could grant Manning privileges in the future and that she would be able to see the exhibition in prison.
It may be a coincidence that Obama asked for her release just days after the book was published, when Manning was in his seventh year at the Kansas military prison.
Moreover, there is another dimension to this exhibition, which is designed to bridge the current US, where the Trump administration has repeatedly declared war on government leaks and transgender soldiers, while at the same time looking for new ways, which can be hyped on Twitter, to stir up division.
When asked about the special timing of all this, Heather Dewey Harburg said, "there's a reason for anything to happen."
In the artist's statement written on the gallery wall, Manning's oversized signature is below (the "i" in the name is painted with a heart), calling for an end to "partisanship based on gender, sexual orientation and culture."
On the opposite wall was a sequence of her mitochondrial DNA, which used a pencil twist to write the Cs, Gs, and As symbols.
By containing 200 letters (or nucleotide, the complex scientific dictionary of each artist), Heather Dewey Harburg hopes to express that this is true of everyone, at least in terms of physiological structure, by drawing these strangely similar portraits.
"I hope people get out of this, that our genome doesn't care about who we are, how open genetic data is interpreted, how subjective it is," said Heather Dewey Harburg, whose 2007 video work, "Fake Memory," is also on display.
"DNA data can tell us a lot of different stories, so this is 30 of them." "
The last work in the exhibition, in a room, comes from a page in the previous illustration.
Showing soldiers in the United States holding a megaphone under the flamboyant, King Kong-shaped Manning.
"when they bring your speech down, they win," wrote the wall.
"so, don't shut up." "
"the content comes directly from a letter she wrote to me," said the artist from Philadelphia.
"I'm afraid again, and I'm still going to say it."
Manning has not seen the exhibition in person, as foreseen in the comics, but when she does, she will be covered by her own DNA portrait mask, like a group of protesters getting cheers in the center of the pavilion.
It also had a purpose and, as with all the items in the exhibition, reached the height of her genetic single-fold group information written in pencil (5.2 feet, Manning's height).
"in the past, I hung them on the wall, but I wanted them to feel like a bunch of people," Dewey Haggburg said of the portrait.
"but I want them to feel like a group of protesters following Chelsea, just as people protested at the time to release her."
Northwestern University professor and Oxford University employee wanted for homicide
Police said a man was found fatally stabbed inside a luxury Chicago apartment and a Northwestern University professor and an Oxford University employee were subsequently wanted and are searching for suspects across the country.
Cook County Court records show that on Monday, Windham Lyceum, 42, and Andrew Warren, 56, were issued with first-degree arrest warrants for murder without bail in connection with the death of Trenton H. James Connell Dulanlo.
Cornell Dulanlo, 26, died as a result of multiple stab wounds, according to the documents.
A community alert issued by the Chicago Police Department said the body was found on July 27.
Upon receiving the call, the police arrived at the Grand Plaza apartment and found a number of lacerations on the victim's body.
Cornell Dulanlo died on the spot and detectives are investigating the killing, while police are actively searching for two suspects, police said.
Lyceum has been an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Corbetch, deputy director of campus relations, said in an emailed statement that Lyceum has now been removed and has been banned from the Northwestern campus.
"now this is a criminal case, authorities are investigating and Northwestern University is actively cooperating with the investigation," Mr Corbetch said.
Warren is a senior finance assistant at Oxford University.
A spokesman for Somerville College, Oxford University, said in an emailed statement: "we have been in contact with British police and stand ready to assist U.S. investigative agencies as required."
Warren's colleagues were deeply shocked and hoped he would turn himself in, the statement added.
Anthony Gulelmi, chief liaison officer of the Chicago Police Department, expressed strong encouragement for the suspects to turn themselves in to the authorities.
Mr Guglielmi said "the police have had a general idea of their whereabouts and we are working hard to locate possible locations."
Mr Guglielmi said local, regional and national authorities were doing their utmost to assist in the search for the suspects.
He said police received a call from the manager of the Grand Plaza apartment, who had just received a secret tip that something was happening in apartment 1008.
Police said the situation was horrific at the time.
Mr Guglielmi said it was still unclear whether the incident also occurred on July 27.
According to security cameras, he said, it was confirmed that Lyceum and Warren were in the building at the time.
"we believe that Professor Lyceum has something to do with the victims," Guglielmi said.
"the police are currently studying the timeline and background of the victim and are investigating various motives, including a possible domestic incident," Grand Plaza's management team said in a statement to residents.
"we will complete the road map for the World Anti-Doping Agency in the near future," Russia's deputy prime minister said
Vitaly Mutko, Russia's deputy prime minister, said it would not take too long to implement the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) for the restoration of the rights of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA).
"implementation of the road map standards has reached a certain stage and RUSADA has been granted the right to work with UKAD (UK Anti-Doping Agency) on planning and testing.
The WADA road map has been updated in this regard, "Mr Mutko said on Thursday.
In his comments on the second part of the World Anti-Doping Agency's road map, Compliance, which sets out the criteria for restoring RUSADA's rights, the Deputy Prime Minister made the statement and was recently posted on the organization's website.
According to Mutko, the standards do not contain anything that might be of concern to Russia.
"everything has to be announced, everything will be implemented," he added.
In the near future, the results will be submitted to the International Olympic Committee (IOC), the International Olympic Committee (IOC), the International Olympic Committee (IOC), and the International Olympic Committee (IOC).
One of the criteria mentioned in the list, however, is that the Russian Anti-Doping Agency must publicly accept the findings of the investigation, approved by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren, concerning Russian state support for doping in national sports.
Turning to the matter, he said: "we are investigating and there is no doubt that our anti-doping system has failed.
All measures have been implemented.
But there is no national plan behind this, and we will not acknowledge what does not exist, "he said.
His remarks echo those of Vitaly Smirnoff, head of Russia's independent public anti-doping commission.
"we have said many times on various occasions that the report contains controversial positions and regulations," said Mr. Smirnoff, who acknowledged past problems with the Russian anti-doping agency during a media visit earlier in the day.
No one plans to accept the report unconditionally, "Smirnoff said.
In the wake of the doping scandal in November 2015, WADA suspended RUSADA's right to carry out doping inspections in Russia.
But in June this year, RUSADA was granted permission to plan and coordinate testing this year under the supervision of international experts and UKAD.
During a visit to the organization's headquarters in Moscow in July, the Director General of WADA, Olivia Nigel, said RUSADA was "moving in the right direction" in an effort to restore its rights.

No longer need to find a substitute! These more than 8000 products have zero tariff
At a regular press conference held by the Ministry of Commerce on January 11, a spokesman for the Ministry of Commerce said that to date, there are 15 free trade agreements in force, covering 23 countries and regions, covering more than 8,000 imports with zero tariffs.
At the same time, imported cosmetics, Icelandic salmon, Chilean red wine, ASEAN tropical fruit... you don't have to buy these products at a big price.
At present, our country has signed 16 free trade agreements with 24 countries and territories, and 15 have entered into force, covering more than 8,000 imports with zero tariffs.
In the case of agricultural products, with the implementation of the free trade agreement, consumers will be able to taste agricultural products from different places of origin, high quality and low prices all year round.
In ASEAN, for example, import tariffs on tropical fruits such as durian, lychee and python fruit fell from 15 to 30 per cent to zero.
The import tariff on Icelandic salmon was reduced from 10 to 12 per cent to zero;
For red wine in Georgia and Chile, import tariffs fell from 14 to 30 per cent to zero;
There are also significant tax cuts on special agricultural products such as beef and milk powder in New Zealand.
In the case of industrial goods, for example, import tariffs on some cosmetics in Switzerland have been reduced to zero;
Import tariffs on some watches have been reduced by 50% and will be reduced to zero in a few years;
South Korea's import tariffs on refrigerator, rice cooker, massage device, beauty instrument and other products have been reduced by 40%, and will be reduced to zero in a few years;
There are also consumer electronics and so on have a significant reduction in taxes.
At the same time, the zero-tariff products under the free trade zone include many intermediate products and raw materials needed for the manufacture of domestic end consumer goods, which have also contributed to the structural upgrading of domestic consumer goods.
A spokesman for the Ministry of Commerce said that nearly one-third of China's total imports could benefit from preferential tariffs under the free trade agreement, most of them end-of-life consumer goods, bringing tangible benefits to consumers.
Further reduction of import tariffs on consumer goods
Since December 1, 2017, China has adjusted the import duties on some consumer goods, further reducing the import duties on consumer goods, covering various types of consumer goods such as food, health care products, pharmaceuticals, Japanese-made articles, clothing, shoes and hats, household equipment, culture and entertainment, and daily goods.
The average tax rate on these consumer goods will be reduced from 17.3pc to 7.7pc, and will almost be "held back"!
Since 1 January 2018, China has also made partial adjustments to other import and export tariffs.
The import duty on some cosmetics such as lipstick, eye shadow and perfume was reduced from 10 per cent to 5 per cent;
Lower tariffs mean that consumers do not have to buy on their behalf, nor do they have to travel all the way abroad to buy foreign products they like.

Report: End-of-year U.S. mall rules differ big shopping returns need to be cautious
China New Network, December 29
According to the US newspaper World Daily, there was a wave of returns on Christmas Day.
More than half of the goods sold last Christmas were returned, according to the ABC.
In addition, readers have been duped many times, and consumers need to pay more attention when shopping on informal websites.
In general, large shopping companies have formal and reasonable return procedures, but they must be careful when buying gifts or electric shopping from small shops.
Ms. Hu, of Roland, bought a coat for more than 60 yuan (US $) at an online store specializing in print coats on December 1 local time, and it has not been sent yet.
She sent an email to the customer service, and she did not reply.
After a trip to the United States last year to buy a mobile phone from a third-party seller, it was found to be a box of rubber.
After knowing to be cheated, apply to the website for a refund, fortunately get a full refund.
But there are also customers who believe that the website refund service is not 100 per cent perfect.
Mr. Wang, a Chinese resident of Northern California, said he had twice bought an emergency distribution service for a Web site and four yuan for an emergency service, but neither had been delivered on time.
A refund was then applied for, and no response was received.
Large shopping malls or shopping areas have a better return policy.
Macy's has a full refund within 180 days for most of its goods.
However, the goods must remain "original" and require purchase vouchers, such as receipts or bank purchase records.
If there is no voucher, customers can also get mall points, which can be used to purchase other goods.
Target usually has a 90-day return period for general goods and 15 days for electronic goods.
However, the return period for electronic and recreational goods purchased during the period from 1 November to 25 December 2017 was extended to 30 days.
It is important to note that the 30-day refund period begins on December 25 and is due to be returned by January 25, 2018.
The ultimate shopping experience, the coming of a new era of shopping development in the business circle
More than a decade ago, our country was still in the seller's market in general, people's choice is limited and demand is limited.
But after a decade of development, the market has long since transformed from a seller's market to a buyer's market, and today's consumer tastes have become more sophisticated, and they are no longer content with simple "pay-as-you-go" shopping.
Therefore, how to give consumers an extreme shopping experience has become the next point of competition for real estate developers.
And among the many factors that affect the consumer shopping experience, shopping centres in the business circle have the most significant impact.
See how city builders everywhere pay attention to the shopping experience.
There are no two exactly the same leaves in the world, much less two exactly the same shopping centers, a famous shopping centre must have its own characteristics.
For example, in Turkey's world-famous Kanyon shopping centre, its unique wave-shaped architectural design is inspired by the Grand Canyon, so Kanyon, known as the harmonic, seems to be inside the Grand Canyon in the 200-meter walk of the minister in Kanyon.
In addition to the gorge design, there is also a large oval venue in the middle of the shopping centre, which has a unique shape and often features performances.
Because the open platform is designed to allow visitors to walk on each floor to look down at the activities carried out in the "canyons" and have the effect of moving and changing the landscape.
At home, the Nanjing Forest Moore Commercial Street, known as China's first forest-style stroll, combines shopping with ecology and fairy tales.
Seven thousand square metres of green space square, 3,000 square metres of rooftop water terrace, the project consists of nine single buildings, which are connected to each other in the air, and are designed to sink into the courtyard as a whole in order to create a forest-like feel.
Walking into the forest moles is like accidentally falling into the rabbit hole in Alice's Odyssey, climbing along the trunk to surround the building, the grass, the clear spring, and bring people into the forest full of life and vitality.
It is also planned to introduce more than 50 top international flagship stores, more than 100 top international brands and more than 500 well-known domestic and foreign brands in Chongqing, making it a commercial center with a concentrated service industry and a distinctive theme.
Not only that, but it also integrates ecology into architecture, is oriented towards TOD public transportation, brings together fashion shopping, living services, catering, entertainment, education and sports, and leads consumers to enjoy the unique "waterfront culture" of Chongqing, integrating shopping with water entertainment and leisure.
As can be seen, some housing companies have gained insight into the discovery trajectory of this new urban business, and industry insiders say that this consumer-focused consumption model, which combines shopping and experience, will also be the mainstream of urban development in the future.
Today's business circle is not only a hub for goods, but also a complex of art, culture and creative themes. It also carries the responsibility for urban living.
Therefore, while meeting the needs of consumers to eat, drink and buy one-stop material, maximizing the transmission of the multi-level spiritual needs of culture and art, and giving play to the needs of habitable housing, is bound to be the high point of the future development of the business circle.
In Chongqing, the north coast of Guoxing, located in the north of the river, near the Guanyin Bridge, the world's best business, international giants around the world, first-class brands gathered, close to the international fashion.
Here step-by-step prosperity, the essence of the world;
Dongyuan Jinyu has a better shopping environment. It is close to Nanping Business Circle and enjoys the leading four-story three-dimensional transportation system in the west and even in the country, which enhances the comfort of shopping.
In addition, two pedestrian streets, Huiche Road and Wanda Square, have been upgraded, about 300 trees have been planted and 40,000 square metres have been converted to enhance the image of Nanping business circle;
The Long Lake, near Chongqing's first low-density waterfront business circle, is surrounded by nine parks, with low density and open street areas, making people more willing to stop, stop and enjoy shopping slowly, rather than being rushed forward by the crowd behind them, to truly achieve "walking shopping."
Today's commercial competition will only become more and more intense. How to kill a bloody road in a highly homogeneous market and capture the reputation of a "shopping shrine" in the minds of consumers in the future deserves serious consideration by all real estate developers.
The strategy alone is not enough. Only those developers who really put consumers in their hearts, rush consumers, want consumers to think, and provide consumers with the ultimate and simple shopping experience, will be able to laugh in the storm market.
Of course, in the end I think the most happy is the people of Chongqing, have such a good shopping experience and business circle, put 10 years ago no one can imagine today's prosperity.
Festival of Things: Consumerist orgy masks real environmental prices
$168.2 billion, which is the amount of money spent by sky cat users during the 24 hours of the "Sky Cat Double 11 Global Carnival" on November 11, 2017.
Specifically, after the start of "Double 11," in just three minutes, the number of cats has exceeded 10 billion, more than 20 billion yuan in 6 minutes and 05 seconds, and 100 billion in 9 hours.
On this day, the total number of payments made by global consumers through PayPal reached 1.48 billion, an increase of 41 per cent over last year.
These consumption will result in 812 million logistics orders.
And whether the sky cat net purchase platform or pay the payment platform, all belong to Ma's Ali Group.
Ten years ago, no one thought that the "Spotlight Day" subculture, created on November 11 by single youth out of self-deprecation, would become a phenomenon-level "Double 11" shopping carnival.
On November 11, 2009, Alibaba used for the first time the "Spotlight Day" marketing campaign: No one is in love with you, so "single dogs" come to the net to buy.
The results came as a surprise, with Tabao Mall (the predecessor of "Skycat") trading more than 52 million yuan on the day, 10 times the daily turnover at the time.
Since then, "Double 11" has become Alibaba's shopping carnival, starting with domestic buyer sellers enjoying themselves, and now with the influx of businesses around the world, nine years on, the "Double 11" billion-dollar deal is more than 3,200 times that of that year.
Following the "Double Eleven" promotion, there are a number of electric vendors, of which "Beijing East" is the strongest.
"Beijing East" has its own shopping festival, "6.18," but no "Double 11" has had a big impact, with total sales reaching 12.71 billion yuan this year from November 1 to 11.
And after the "double 11," followed by a similar "double 12" discount revelry, Christmas New Year shopping slot.
Across the New Year, waiting for Chinese consumers also before the Spring Festival annual shopping slot, Valentine's Day shopping slot, consumption, no holiday.
The environmental problems brought about by the mass consumption of instant time have attracted the attention of professionals and institutions.
At least 300,000 tons of garbage were generated during the "Double 11" period this year, according to a conservative estimate by the industry's usual standard of 0.2 kg per package, Xinhua reported.
Liu Hua, director of the pollution prevention and control program at Greenpeace East Asia Division, told the Chinese-foreign dialogue that this year's order volume for "Double 11" cats will produce 160,000 tons of packaging waste.
In 2016, the State Post Office issued a report noting that during the "Double 11" period (November 11-16) in 2015, the volume of express items was about 780 million, using more than 3 billion woven bags, 99.22 billion boxes, 16.985 million metres of tape, and the length of the tape could circle the Earth's equator 425 laps.
This year, the National Post Office estimates that there will be more than 1.5 billion express items in the "Double 11" business.
Wang Shi, manager of a garbage incineration center in Beijing, told Xinhua that more than 2,000 tons of garbage were entered daily after "Double 11," which also exceeded the capacity of the burning station.
Express delivery companies have been aware of the environmental pollution caused by the express delivery industry cannot be underestimated.
Some electronics companies, including Suning, have introduced recycled plastic delivery boxes, recycling bags that can be used repeatedly as shopping bags and garbage bags before "Double 11," but troubled consumers have been less receptive.
Ma also tweeted a call for the logistics industry to support "green packaging" and "green logistics."
The microblog has harvested more than 68,000 "praise."
What kind of mobile payments do Germans want?
Zhang: The mobile payment war in Germany is not to be expected.
Micro-credit payments and payments have only moved the battlefield to Europe, the competitors have not changed, the positions have not changed - the Chinese, this is globalization?
Where there is a treasure to pay, there will be a small letter to pay.
Under an agreement with Wirecard, the German electronic payment provider, micro-credit payments officially began landing in Germany in November this year and are gradually being laid out in European-wide businesses.
This foreign reunion of the two "old country" took place in Europe.
All along, PayPal and micro-credit payments have been singing along the path of globalization.
For China's global approach to mobile payments, the study of China's third-party mobile payment industry, 2017, concluded in two ways: One is to invest strategically, export experience, buy shares and support local mobile payment companies abroad.
Second, through the consumption behavior of Chinese tourists abroad, to promote mobile payment services to foreign businesses, thereby changing the local recognition and acceptance of China Mobile payments.
Indeed, the Chinese get the world.
With China's rapid economic growth and a large population base, the cost of Chinese tourists in Europe is an attractive figure.
But it is also doomed, this time in Germany, the China Mobile payment war is not expected.
Micro-credit payments and payments are just moving the battlefield to Europe, the competitors have not changed, the positions taken have not changed - or the Chinese, this is globalization?
A more pioneering discussion is whether China's mobile payments can open up territory on European soil?
Take Germany, for example.
The "new retail" that has been charmed
Mr. Chen, Mr. Yang: Amazon announced its foray into bookstores and grocery stores as it squeezed into the world's top 10 retailers. Both timing and motivation are well worth playing with.
In November 2015, Amazon opened its first physical bookstore in Seattle, followed by two bookstores in Portland and San Diego.
At the start of 2017, Amazon opened stores in New York and plans to have at least eight stores by the end of the year.
Almost at the same time, Amazon announced a trial run of its unmanned supermarket, where customers do not have to line up or check out their stores, sweep through the door and leave with what they want, and the purchase amount is automatically deducted from the customer's Amazon account.
As far as Amazon is concerned, it has been a surprise in recent years to suddenly move on top of the store.
Because back in 2007, in an open letter to shareholders, CEO Jeff Bezos stressed that Amazon would not open stores easily unless the following four conditions were met at the same time:
1. We must be sure that this new opportunity will pay off the investment of shareholders;
2. We must be sure that this new opportunity is of great significance to the whole company;
3. We must be sure that this new opportunity is ignored by the market;
We must be sure that in this market, we have enough resources to make a customer-oriented decision.
Bookstores and grocery stores, the most rickety classification of retail in both entities, were the first rivals to fall after the rise of Amazon.
Amazon announced its foray into the two physical markets as it squeezed into the world's top 10 retailers, and both timing and motivation are well worth playing with.
Amazon's approach, contrary to the guarantee in the shareholder letter?
A similar sound was heard at the other end of the globe, and on the morning of October 13, 2016, at the 2016 Hangzhou Cloud Congress, Mr. Ma, president of Alibaba, delivered a keynote speech.
"from next year, Alibaba will no longer mention the term 'e-commerce'," he said.
The era of pure electric business will soon come to an end, with no e-commerce for the next decade or two, replaced by 'new retail'.
The combination of line-on-line and logistics will produce new retail. "
For a while, the three words "new retail" as if by magic, people in the industry frequently on the lips.
But what exactly does "new retail" mean?
If it's just a combination of the line and the line, then the concept is not new.
In 2016, eMarketer, after tracking 180 of the largest electric companies, estimated total sales at about $200bn, with the largest 25 accounting for more than $159bn.
Of the 25, 18 are traditional retailers that have only started online in the past five years (such as Macy's, Nordstrom, Target, Gap, etc.).
And Alibaba Group 283 billion yuan to take a stake in the Suning cloud business, is also in the eye.
Globally, retailers and electricity vendors are moving from a single channel to a full-channel retail system covering retail stores, electric dealers, mobile end and social media.
Is Mr Ma's "new retail" more of a summary than a vision of the future?
If not, what is the difference between the concept of full channel and "new retail"?
Perhaps, the key question is not whether or not online and below the line will blend, but how.
Looking back at the retail industry over the past 20 years, the rise of electric retailers, like the rise of discount retailers in the early years, has focused on price and convenience.
Relying on these two pain points, electric vendors move highly standardized products, such as books and CDs, down the line to the line.
With the development of online consumption habits and the continuous improvement of customer experience, electric companies extended their tentacles to other categories, and began to improve efficiency.
In the words of Alibaba CEO Zhang Yong, "Using Internet ideas and technology to overhaul and upgrade the existing total of about 30 trillion social retailers makes it possible to effectively meet the escalating consumer demand of Chinese consumers and make the whole process of commodity production, circulation and services more efficient because of the extensive use of the Internet and big data."
Therefore, the electric business road, is a surface light assets, the actual heavy assets of the road.
"light" means that the burden of fixed assets, staffing and management processes is not as large as traditional retail sales; "heavy" refers to the need for huge investment in logistics, warehousing, etc.
The change of the logistics mode ensures the high efficiency of the electric business.
Premier Li Keqiang chaired an executive meeting of the State Council on April 28, which concluded that expanding domestic consumption demand is an important measure for steady growth and structural adjustment, according to the Chinese government's website.

On January 18, Alibaba held a summit dialogue in Chongqing, announcing that it would boost accurate poverty eradication and rural revitalization by exploring a new model of "Internet + poverty eradication."
This is after the introduction of the rural strategy, the launching of the rural Tabao project, on-line rural poverty alleviation platform, the establishment of Alibaba poverty alleviation fund, Ali's fight against poverty again.
The fight against poverty is one of the most important national strategies in China today.
Comprehensive poverty eradication has never been achieved in China for thousands of years.
"it is an innovative step in the new round of poverty alleviation, and it is an important way to achieve accurate poverty alleviation and poverty alleviation.
The central government attaches great importance to and points out that the Internet can play a role in promoting poverty alleviation, promoting accurate poverty alleviation, and getting agricultural products out of the countryside through the Internet. "
As a result, Ali proposed a rural strategy as early as 2014, along with big data cloud computing and globalization, as Ali's three core strategies for the next 20 years.
In the same year, Ali launched a rural Tabao (village park) project to recruit "village two" in the countryside, leading farmers to get rich through electricity traders.
In 2017, Ali worked with business departments to create a poverty-alleviation channel for farmers and farmers, with a total of 13 provinces and 120 poverty-stricken counties at the state level.
The village of Tabao, created by the Ali platform, has 2118.
Of these, nearly 400 appeared in provincial poverty-stricken counties and 33 in 13 national poverty-stricken counties.
In 2017, sales across the country reached 120 billion yuan on Alibaba's China retail platform.
Mr Zhang said that in the face of a national strategy to fight poverty, Mr Ali had been thinking about how to take a new path out of poverty with the technology, big data, cloud computing and other innovative capabilities of Ali's economy.
Among them, the village is the main carrier platform of Ali electric business to get rid of poverty, and went through a direct-selling Internet anti-poverty new link.
In the planting link, village farmers and ant gold suits jointly carry out agricultural and agricultural tools and micro-credit support.
In 2017, of the 832 poverty-stricken counties at the national level, the ant gold suits served 795, providing them with convenient payment, credit and other services.
The rookie deals with storage and logistics, the sky cat is responsible for sales, the big data of Ali cloud to guide agricultural production, further improve the supply standard, quality and market competitiveness of agricultural products.
The development of the electric business out of poverty requires not only products, sales channels, industrial planning, but also talent.
By offering electric business courses at Tabao University, Ali taught farmers standardization, quality and large-scale planting methods, and achieved a combination of "help-the-poor + help-the-mind" so that farmers can get out of poverty in a sustainable way.
These courses already cover about 92 per cent of the poverty-stricken counties at the national level.
And the idea of "public interest mentality, business means" can also guarantee Ali to do "real poverty alleviation" in poverty alleviation.
Mr. Ma, Alibaba's chairman, has said that poverty eradication should be divided into three stages: Poverty alleviation, poverty alleviation and enrichment.
To help the poor is to teach people to fish, to get rid of poverty is to give people to fish, to get rich is to create a "fish pond" for farmers, so that farmers have fish to feed.
Electric business-driven industry poverty alleviation, is to build fish pond.
In terms of industrial poverty alleviation, the model created by Ali in cooperation with Lochuan, Shaanxi Province, has been replicated and promoted throughout the country as a model by the relevant authorities.
Ali's pro-poor work has also been recognized at the decision-making level.
The electric business enterprises represented by Alibaba have been sent a message, through the line down channel, to ensure that farmers increase production and income.
A number of village two and ant gold suit employees have also been invited to the United Nations and Africa to share the experience of electric operators in getting out of poverty.
At present, the China office of the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP), together with the villagers, has launched a pro-poor electricity industry in Anhui province and other areas.
The third meeting of the new economic think tank, co-organized by the Ali Institute and the China Vision think tank, was held on January 16 and was attended by Zhang Li, director of the Institute of Electric Commerce of the Ministry of Commerce.
She believes that, in fact, our globalization ignores the most important issues, namely, the nature and use of globalization, and the stage of globalization.
In this way, many people believe that globalization has stalled, and that many developed and developing countries, in the new phase, have different attitudes to globalization and are different to the model.
The second concept is the question of the medium-term phase of globalization, and what are the constraints of the medium-term phase of globalization?
Constrained by the foundation of the economic environment, it is precisely because of the changes in the economic base that globalization has been restricted.
Zhang believes that at the end of 2017, the global economic adjustment is largely over, after 2018 will enter a new period of growth, the next round of growth must be driven by raw products.
There are plans to build more than 1,000 stores across the country over the next three to five years, with the opening of the first fresh supermarket in Beijing.
"new retail stores" began to pile up and "call each other out" on innovative models and even prices, along with Ali's box of horses, Yonghui's super species, Suning's Su, and the American group's palm fish, among others.
New supermarket competition escalated, has become a phenomenon-level topic in the new retail sector, where is the new retail?
"we will quickly enter the country in 2018, and we will open a large number of stores in Beijing, Shanghai and Hangzhou before the Spring Festival."
At the second new retail summit on Thursday, the CEO of the new company, Hu Yi, revealed a "new approach" for 2018.
"starting in 2018, Box Horse is a fresh electric manufacturer, but a life-class electric manufacturer that meets the immediate service of consumers.
The core mode line is the drainage, the experience, the line is the real sales. "
Unlike traditional stores and supermarkets, the box horse is a fun and delicious "red shop" in the eyes of many consumers, and even some intermediaries have come up with the concept of "box room."
Online platform and under-line retailers have their own advantages and disadvantages, but consumers appear in a variety of channels, so both sides are trying the full channel model.
The industry believes there will be a growing number of "box horse" stores in 2018, against the backdrop of rising consumption.
And box horses continue to explore more areas of consumption from the beginning of life, foreshadowing more innovation in the retail market in the new year.
"for example, the line on-line combination of the business model, attracted the attention of consumers, everywhere out of the fresh supermarket call again."
"but it doesn't work to talk about these relationships any more, and in the end it comes down to whether you're giving the consumer a good experience, and I'm willing to pay for it."
In the new retail environment, consumer habits have changed and the demand for purchases has changed, according to Yuan Bing, co-CEO of the company.
The original pure line, the line is split, the line to beat the line, the line to counter-attack line, now is holding hands together, because the consumer has no line line under the distinction.
The capital rush into the market, so that the current fresh supermarket as a representative of the new retail fire.
According to the analysis, the current competition for new retail in the first-tier cities is far from the Red Sea pattern, and a large number of second-tier cities have yet to be explored, and there is still a lot of opportunity and space in the market.
Different types of industry for the new retail layout, will bring the development of new retail into a diversified state of development.

What are the trends in the development of the global electric business?
Let's find out for all of you.
Record-breaking growth rate of total sales returns to accelerated track
Since 2006, China's online retail sales can be said to have been super-high growth, it is estimated that the Internet shopping is very new, can buy things without going out, too cool!
But starting in 2013, online retail growth began to fall below 50 per cent, falling below 40 per cent for the first time in 2015, and turned to 26.2 per cent in 2016.
But things are different this year, with online retail sales accelerating again, with growth picking up to 34.2 per cent between January and September this year.
Significantly higher than the rate of growth in 2015 and 2016.
Maybe we go around in a circle and find that it's better to buy or buy.
Of these, online retail sales of physical goods amounted to nearly 508 trillion yuan, and online retail sales of services amounted to nearly 149 trillion yuan.
The share of total retail sales of social goods reached 13.6 per cent, an increase of nearly 3 percentage points year on year.
Students, don't doze off, draw the point, the service online retail sales is absolutely a great success!

Help you avoid the company becoming the next great start-up
Amy Erett once wanted to investigate employee happiness at her e-commerce startup, but the survey was of little use.
The responses received are often vague and unhelpful, and even worse, deceptive responses.
Even if she promised anonymity, some employees still don't trust the process.
Ms Erett, who manages the 75-person San Francisco e-commerce hair care company Madison Reed, said there was "a lack of consistency and objectivity in the responses received."
So she called for help.
A new batch of human resources startups have sprung up to help companies understand how employees feel.
They build and authorize software specifically designed to measure employee participation, allowing companies to quickly poll specific teams and population groups, provide anonymous and complaint hotlines for employees and, in some cases, allow whistleblowers to bypass executives to report directly to the board.
"now, you can track your health with tools like Strava and Fitbit, but where is the company Fitbit?" says Jim Barnett, co-founder and chief executive of Redwood City startup Glint, a software analytics tool used by companies to measure employee engagement.
Within three years, she says, she used Glint to gain more insight into what employees think and feel.
In addition to the team-specific quick surveys and polls, Glint also provides company heat maps of which units make the most complaints and which managers approve low scores, at a glance - allowing her to gain insight into why.
Companies are beginning to realize that they must master the company's workplace culture so as not to be the next best step, after a blog post by former employees describing the harassment environment, where the speakers were punished by the company, led to a scandal.
For start-up companies like Glint, the company's desire for oversight is a money-free business opportunity.
By 2020, the global governance, regulatory and compliance industry could be worth more than $187 billion, according to the financial technology analysis website, S\ x {5db0} apos; s Talk Payments.
The Denver, Colo., startup, which works to help companies prevent and detect bad behavior, saw an increase in interest and activity during the damage to its reputation earlier this year.
Convergent has nearly 600 customers, including Eminem, Microsoft, and Tesla.
Uber recently signed up as a customer.
Like Glint, Convergent allows companies to send customized "diagnostic" surveys, collect confidential responses in real time, and view heat maps of their problem areas.
It also provides an anonymous text message hotline for employees to report misconduct.
If the chairman is implicated, then the complaint will go directly to the board.
Patrick Quinlan, founder and chief executive of Conversation, said: "the court of opinion has usurped the power of the regulator.
If a company is found to treat employees badly or be unethical towards them, even if regulators do not intervene, the company could face high consequences of consumer resistance, staff loss and involvement in litigation, Mr Quinlan said.
Ruby Tuesday, a restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees across more than 500 locations, has been using Convergent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of work guidelines and protocols and provide easy access to headquarters.
Until then, if employees want to report problems, they must find their headquarters phone number or e-mail and file a formal complaint, which they hope will be taken seriously.
This is often a daunting and disturbing experience, says James Vitano, general counsel at Ruby Tuesday, who doesn't think there is a good way to track complaints from employees.
But now that the company uses Conversation, it can more quickly identify and resolve issues previously unknown to executives in remote offices, cities, or states - such as discrimination, harassment, or unfair wage practices.
"I can get a more near-Earth, 360-degree overview of the work experience," says Vitano, who is in charge of Ruby Tuesday's risk management team.
"we are protecting our shareholders from employment litigation." "
Mr Quinlan said companies had placed more emphasis on ethics, values and employee professionalism since 2002, following the collapse of Andorra's accounting firm in the wake of the Enron scandal.
But it wasn't until "social media went into its own world" that companies realized they couldn't stop their bombshell from going viral online.
"before using technology to monitor ethics, people see hope as a strategy," he said.
Both Glint and Convent offer their software as a service and charge companies recurring fees for the use of their products.
Such business models and business opportunities are supported by venture investors, who already support the two start-ups.
In February, it raised $10 million from companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, and its total capital rose to $47 million.
Glint received $10 million from Bessemer Ventures Partners in November, bringing its total funding to $60 million.
These investments are hardly surprising given the interlinkages between companies, culture and venture capital.
A growing body of research shows that employees today have higher expectations of the workplace than before.
In a competitive market like Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are just bets.
Employees want to feel that they are accepted, valued, and that their time is spent on a company with a positive mission.
"when people are happy to join the company, feel that their voices are being listened to, and the work they do is beneficial, they are more committed to making the company successful," says Nina McCartney, vice president of global welfare and employee experience at LinkedIn, which uses both Convent and Glint.
Investors achieve returns when their portfolio companies perform well; the company does well when its employees are loyal and committed.
If third-party analysis tools promise to increase staff loyalty and commitment, it is no surprise that they will seek financial support.
Workplace culture experts say it is important to have data on employee engagement.
But the data is useless unless the company's administrators take action.
In fact, if a company asks for feedback from employees, it can be expected that the company is making changes.
If change is not moving fast enough, or without a bit of progress, it can lead to disappointment and lead to employees leaving the company.
"if you're looking for 4,000 suggestions, you need to be ready for 4,000 conversations," said Russell Raith, head of consulting at Cotter International, a business management firm that has seen some companies rely too heavily on data collection errors.
"because if you don't follow up all the way, employees will think, 'Did you really hear me?
Do you care?
If you don't care, why should I care? '
Mr Elrett said Madison Reed, who now conducts monthly staff surveys, had been able to take action on the day that Glint reported the problem.
Gathering feedback from employees that they were frustrated by the speed of decision-making and the quality of communication, she was able to solve the problem by restructuring the company's internal team and increasing communication training.
Ruby Tuesday is gaining new insights into its employees and, in the long run, is hoping to make a shift in an industry known for its high turnover of talent to better retain staff.
"if you're not committed to creating a culture of transparency, you lose talent," Vitrano said.
"if you lose talent, you will lose customers.
And when you lose customers, you lose the company, "he said.

NCAA cancels twice daily practice to extend Bears' daytime practice
Close to 11 p.m., members of the UCLA football team hovered and chatted next to the team's new campus practice field.
Some players have taken off their sweatshirts to reveal the sweaty body of the camp's first day of hard training.
For a large part of the team, this spare few minutes is a break.
Players attending summer classes will return to the dormitory after three hours of practice to prepare for final exams and then return to the Wasserman Football Centre for a meeting at 6: 30 a.m. the following morning.
"the next three days are a grind for these guys," Bears coach Jim Mora said Monday as he headed into Tuesday.
The NCAA canceled two practice sessions a day (designed to ease the burden on players), but actually extended their daytime practice - at least until the end of Friday.
That's why UCLA's first three workouts are scheduled to start at 7: 15 p.m. to accommodate the player's already congested schedule.
From cancelling two workouts a day to doing more workouts a day, the Bears began training almost a week before last season, with Mora training at summer school for the first time in his six seasons at Westwood.
They plan to start 18 training sessions on August 20, before they begin pre-game preparations for their first official game in September against the Texans.
Mora said he supported the NCAA rule adjustment, although that would have added another item to the player's busy schedule.
"in three or four days, we're going to put a huge amount of training on them, it's very challenging," Mora said.
"they have just passed, too. They are honing, they are great kids.
I thought about Saturday and we'll have more time, really great, "he said.
As soon as the training camp is over, UCLA will stop training, which is not an easy task given the clear view of the adjacent parking lot and the Ruskin Center, a senior hotel that has been littered with football thrown through the net behind the goal post.
The Bears players will be staying at the hotel starting this weekend, but Mora admitted there could be problems once the rooms are vacant during the season.
"we will take security measures," Mora said.
"this is a really worrying issue, and the idea that someone might rent a room and sit in a room and record a training scene is not far-fetched.
If you have a training tape, it's pretty good, too.
But we will take security measures there, and we will take security measures in parking lot 8.
We will use the resources available to do the best we can.
I wouldn't worry too much about that.
We have a plan in place, "he said.

Facebook to launch fact verification feature to combat fake news
Facebook, the world's largest online social network that is trying to crack down on so-called fake news, said on Thursday it would send more potential prank articles to third-party testing agencies and display the results below the original post.
In a statement on its website, Facebook said that it would begin using an updated machine to learn to detect possible pranks and send them to the fact checker, possibly showing the results of the fact check below the original post.
Facebook has been criticized as one of the main distribution points for so-called fake news, and many believe it influenced the 2016 US presidential election.
The issue has also become a major political topic in Europe, with voters facing a flood of false stories ahead of France's presidential election in May and Germany taking the lead in passing support for a fine plan ahead of the September election, with fines imposed if social media networks fail to remove hate posts in time.
In a separate statement in Germany on Thursday, Facebook said it was launching a new fact-checking function test in the United States, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
"in addition to seeing which stories are being questioned by third party fact inspectors, people want more context to help them make informed decisions about what they read and share," Sarah Sue, Facebook news feed product manager, said in a blog post.
She added that Facebook would continue to test its "related articles" feature and make other changes to its news feed to reduce fake news.
Creating a graphic novel: The story of a castle in England
Recently, the tiny Scottney Castle starred in compressed music films, and at one point became a haven for Margaret Thatcher during the 1970s and 1980s.
But Scotney, who witnessed 700 years of turbulent history in the cosy position of the Belle River Canyon in Kent, is now the inspiration for graphic fiction written by Jamie Rhodes (a Yorkshire man with a particular penchant for historical documents and with his head in tow).
"I could see the handwriting of the ancient people 300 years ago, and I found it so beautiful," he said wistfully.
"what kind of interpersonal fate this is to make this letter fall into my hands."
Across the Middle Ages until the Edwardian era, the book "A Castle of England" chronicled the families living in Scottney, and each story was written by different, future British artists such as Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer, and Isabel Greenberg.
This is not Roz's first book with archives as raw material: He also wrote The Teeth and Other Tales of the Dead in 2014, a book inspired by the literature of the British Library, a work he has done with an uncontrolled passion for creation.
"I couldn't contain my writing impulse from the moment I saw the thumb mark on the side of the letter, written by an 18th-century double agent who worked for the Jacobs," he said.
"that's his fingerprint!
And the letters smell like smoke all the time, because at that time, you need an ignition to have light.
For us 300 years later, the smell makes it feel like they're there for us, too.
Oh, I love archival literature! ""
For those touched by the old paper, having the support of the National Trust and the Arts Council of England and living in the castle for almost four months ("I've been around a little bit longer, to be honest") seems fantastic and simply unconvinced.
Rhodes spent days visiting Victoria's "new" castle, looking through archives, studying many of the estate's treasures and antiques, such as hyena heads hanging on walls, and bottles that have spent centuries in moats.
He roamed the land and ruins of the old castle, chatting with vagrants, gardeners and, at times, illustration artists for his book.
Then in the evening, he would "have a drink of whisky and write."
Scotney's secret history is not yet clear, as the National Trust only fully entered after the death of the last heir, Elizabeth Hersi, in 2006.
Ten years later, when Rhodes arrived, the staff began to process the files, which he described as "hundreds of years ago the aristocrats were going:" Oh, put it in the loft. "
Diaries, letters from the time of the British Empire, maps of national boundaries: "you'd think land disputes would be boring," Rhodes said, "but there would be two families fighting over a birch tree.
Let go, guys!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Some of the stories in the work take the castle as their starting point and go on to study British history at a broader level, including The Labourer, which follows a man who left the new castle to take part in the 1381 uprising.
"the story in the book," Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex, "chronicles a riot in the castle in 1380," says Rhodes.
"the uprising began in that area, and I think it's a good place to start an uprising.
Perhaps there is a correlation between the two? "he said.
Other stories are deeply rooted in the history of the castle, such as The Priest, which tells the story of the Darrell family who hid a Jesuit priest for seven years during the English Reformation.
Or The Stranger, which is owned by the 18th-century smuggler Arthur Darrell, who is believed to have given himself a funeral by filling his coffin with stones (his coffin was discovered years later when it came to the ground).
"the Darrell Family" is Roz's favourite Scottney Castle family: "these gentlemen seem to be rogue, constantly borrowing money and spending money on things they can't afford.
Generations of Darrell men solve their debt problems by marrying wealthy old women, and I think they should be a group of handsome lads who know how to pursue women, "he said.
As his mission in the castle came to an end, Rhodes began looking for other exotic writing experiences.
He spent two weeks in the wilds of Finland completing a graphic novel about "El???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
But Scott has a special status for him.
"I'm very happy to leave," he said.
"it's like," Oh, I'm going to have to go face to face with the real life of the cake. ""
According to the news reporter, the ZTE smart car team is based in Zhuhai, the executive vice president of ZTE.
The big energy companies are all "rich and powerful," so which of the many energy companies in the world is most likely to take advantage of the money?
Yesterday, China Petroleum and Royal Dutch Shell were closely followed by US oil and gas producer Exxon Mobil's $406.3 billion market value in the top 50 ranking of energy companies listed in 2011.
In the PFC list, China's oil company was named twice in 2007 and 2009, with ExxonMobil taking the top spot for the rest of the year.
In the top 50 list in 2011, three companies from mainland China were shortlisted, in addition to China Petroleum, ranked No 2, and Sinopec, ranked No 9, and China Marine Oil, ranked No 15.
However, despite the fact that oil prices are much higher than they were four years ago, the CEO says there are a number of reasons for the low total market value, including lower gas prices in North America and low volatility in global equity markets.
According to the Xinhua news agency, the heavily polluted weather in Beijing and the surrounding areas began on the 16th and intensified on the 19th, with an "explosion watch" showing up at AQI in the cities of Shijiazhuang, Hsin, and Zhai in Hebei province.
U.S. changes green card rules
President Donald Trump is quoted in the media as saying that the United States will launch a new immigration plan to change green card rules.
The plan is intended to reduce legal immigration to 50,000 a year, and temporary work visas and family-oriented visa applications will be subject to stricter rules.
The new rules were proposed by Republicans and supported by the president.
The draft law will be discussed in both chambers.
"this law will reduce poverty, raise wages, save taxpayers billions of dollars, and achieve these benefits by changing the way the United States issues green cards to citizens of other countries," Trump said, as quoted by US media.
The law would replace the current programme and reduce chain migration.
This new application process is conducive to applicants who speak English, have financial support and have skills that are conducive to economic development, "he said.
On May 29, the first Chinese fireworks safety and environmental protection fair will be held in Fuyang.
The event will focus on the theme of "technology, safety and environmental protection" for two days and will bring together the state-of-the-art fireworks machinery, the most safe and environmentally friendly materials and new products.
The Expo will invite a large number of experts, entrepreneurs, the fireworks industry academic exchanges, sharing fireworks safety and environmental protection of the latest technological achievements.
Among them, the mechanical production equipment of fireworks and the display of safety and environmental protection products will be carried out in the town. The main items in the exhibition will include the production of drug-related machinery and equipment for fireworks with mature technology, scientific and technological identification and safety demonstration.

In order to optimize the environment of the scenic area and build a beautiful Nanyue, the "636" voluntary service brigade of the tobacco bureau (branch) of Nanyue District recently launched an environmental protection campaign entitled "Mountaineering forest protection and home care."
The activities have not only received the support of all the cadres and staff of the District Tobacco Bureau, but have also attracted retired cadres and family members to participate in environmental protection practices, and the three generations of the old and young people have made concerted efforts to protect forests and clean up garbage in order to contribute their own efforts to the construction of the "beautiful Nanyue."
The volunteer service is aimed at protecting the landscape resources of Nanyue, promoting the concept of "caring for others, caring for society and caring for nature," and allowing the next generation to learn from childhood and pass on the virtues of volunteerism.
It is reported that since its establishment in early April this year, the "636" volunteer service brigade has developed a total of 16 members, and has carried out a series of voluntary service activities, such as visiting disabled retail customers, helping tobacco farmers to care for tobacco leaves, and contributing to the Yaan earthquake.

Sex robots are actually on the rise, but we should be careful
Just when you don't think 2017 will be more bizarre, the sex robot field has released a new technology development report.
Yes.
Now sex robots are a big deal.
Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) released a report looking ahead to the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years.
According to Noel Sharkey, emeritus professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of FRR, we need to start taking the rise of sex robots seriously.
Customers can choose the robot's eye color, nipple shape and nail type.
"people laugh behind their backs, but companies do launch a lot of sex robots, and we will see more," Sharkey said at the launch of the new report.
Modern sex dolls, which have evolved from inflatable dolls into robots, have tanned skin, feel warm and deliberately use artificial intelligence to set up a human sexual response.
Users can also "customize" their robots to meet their preferences, with options ranging from eye color and nipple shape to nail type or colour.
But what is even more disturbing is that a lot of robots with "personality" will make "copy the wife" look advanced.
Modern sex toys have evolved into robots with tanned skin.
The RealBotix robot, for example, is able to come from definitions based on characteristics that users find attractive, such as being shy.
There is also the Roxxoxy Gold sex robot, developed by True Compassion, which pre-sets personality traits, including the slightly shy "cold-hot Farrah" and "wild Wendy" who is "willing to take risks."
"the Roxxxy Gold robot has the personality to match you as much as possible," says the company's website, with interest.
So she loves what you love, and evil what you do.
She also had small emotions in those days just like normal people!
She can be lazy, she can be talkative, and she can be sexual. "
The rise of sex robots has brought a lot of jitters - not just replacing real human relationships - but the grovelling female features and the hint of rape twitching on the cold (read: Resist) Farah are most worrying.
On its website, True Compassion likens Roxoxy to a man's shock stick.
"if a woman has a shaking stick, then why shouldn't a man have Roxoxy?" the website says.
However, these sex robots are not a mere fetish, and are not just a sex toy.
Their emergence and growing maturity point directly to the darker, deeper parts of our culture: From a perfect escape from gender equality to sex with a suit as an additional option.
Of course, most men don't have sex robots, and while FRR points out that sex robots are becoming more popular, they are still on the edge of consumer culture.
But what seeps from the edges allows us to see the course of the era we are in.
Many people are not weird or aggressive, until the free market gives them a chance to become so.
These fine sex robots come at a time when the rights of women around the world are under threat, and it's no coincidence that the White House also has a president bragging about sexual violence against women.
The most chilling part of the TV drama "The Handmaid's Story" lies not in the realistic picture, not in the hanging corpse, not in the eyes that have been dug out, but in the overly real imagination.
The Republic of Gilead is a jump, but now it looks like it's not far away.
The goal behind these sex robots is to do everything technically possible to create the body most similar to that of a real woman (though in proportion to porn stars).
The creators of these robots want them to have human touch and to mimic real human movements.
But to put it bluntly, their "personality" is not representative of real women.
They can't break up, and they can't leave.
They have no recourse institutions and no follow-up stories, no independence at all, and no possibility of breaking the illusion of complete slavery.
In other words, they are taste slaves.
Or in the popular phrase of 2017: Maid.

"on the show, I'm not going to do the same thing, keep it up to date," Mr Deng said.
Trump's great feats?
Let Mitt Romney be the epitome of common sense
It is no surprise to the Trump era that political differences polarize American voters and, from a micro point of view, undermine family harmony in the United States.
Around Christmas and Thanksgiving, major newspapers in the United States filled commentary columns with fears about how to deal with voting for Trump's relatives.
It is generally thought that we are doing everything we can to prick our "filter bubble."
Less of a voice is Trump's power to bring his family together.
I mention this because my cousin, a leftist poet living in Chicago who has long been at odds with Republicans in our family, is coming to visit me in New York this week.
She reminds me that uniting against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.
By working with Trump in the White House, all the people she knows, even relatives of Republicans who have been in political bickering for decades, are now suddenly and strangely on the same front.
It's certainly a good thing if it's all at the table, but it's a shock to me that, from a broader perspective, it raises significant risks.
While leftist figures have long been encouraged by Trump, the warping effect of his presidency has pushed us all to the right.
When we talk about "normalization" and Trump, we are referring to the possibility of concern that his outlandish behavior may one day stop.
There is, however, a more worrying long-term scenario in which Trump wants to "normalize" relations with right-wing Republicans who have previously opposed Mr. President's standards and now suddenly seem to be a symbol of reason.
I find myself recently nostalgic about Mitt Romney's craziness: Putting the dog in the car, with 14% of income tax (but at least we know his tax returns), does seem to be too minor a crime compared to Trump.
After the Trump era has passed, the next Republican candidate only needs to be sensibly qualified for inestimable improvement.
When my cousin lived in town, we took our kids to the New York Park carousel, the largest carousel run by the administration of New York's Central Park, and if you don't need coffee, the $3 ticket is your most consumer value in the city.
The sound of the horse is as loud as thunder, the central column is designed for glass fiber, all the clowns and animals turn over and look at their shoulders in horror and evil, while the tinkling music is strangely ringing.
Too many vulgar cities are disappointing: The view from high-rise buildings becomes clichéd, the skyline becomes too familiar to provide much excitement, and the reality of the city does not support dreams.
Thirty-five years later, I had not quite forgotten that day, when I discovered that this "Swiss cottage" was not actually a Swiss cottage, but one located in the theme bar, the Old Swiss Cottage, which I could not remember, but near an intersection in north London.
However, Central Park's carousel is still a magical experience, and for two 2-year-olds, an 11-year-old, and four girls in their 40s who can take part in the event, everyone is having a good time.
If I could evaluate the carousel, I would give it full marks, but fortunately no one asked.
But this week at a department store, before brushing my credit card, I was asked to score one to five stars on my trading "experience."
The same is true at my coffee shop in the corner of the street, with the option of scoring with a 15 per cent tip to buy over the counter.
The effect is not only to slow down what should have been a neutral deal, but also to put pressure on the waiter to add a personal element to the unwanted scenario.
The poor woman in the department store smiled apologetically, while I was tired and the credit card trading experience gave her five stars.
Oscar Pistorius transferred from prison to hospital with chest pain
This is the second time that Pistoris has left the prison and transferred to a hospital.
Last year he was taken to the hospital to be treated for a cut to his wrist, which prison officials said was the result of a fall in his cell.
He was convicted of murder after prosecutors appealed the original manslaughter ruling.
In the early hours of Valentine's Day 2013, he shot Steenkamp multiple times through a toilet compartment door at his home in Pretoria, to his death.
Pistoris claimed to have mistaken his girlfriend for an intruder who was hiding in a cubicle at night.
Prosecutors have announced their intention to appeal again, this time for a six-year sentence against Pistoris, which they consider to be too kind.
The State Prosecutor's Office indicated that it would appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa and that the appeal could be heard this year.
If prosecutors win, Pistoris faces a sentence that will be increased to 15 years.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.

Two Nigerians detained for illegal camping in Greece
Two Nigerians were detained in Greece for illegal camping, BTV said, citing Foreign Ministry sources.

According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, two Nigerians were subsequently released.

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs said the court could impose fines on casual campers.
On May 18, the Ministry of Finance announced the Measures for the Administration of Special Awards for the Structural Adjustment of Industrial Enterprises, which will arrange special prize funds to help eliminate excess capacity in the coal and steel industries, for a total amount of 100 billion yuan.
Recently, a number of local governments, including Shanghai, Shanxi, Shandong, Jiangsu and Heilongjiang, have put forward reform proposals to address excess capacity.
Among them, many provinces have even proposed to actively seek financial support from the central government for the production capacity of their provinces.
One proof is that coal-to-capacity targets announced in just eight provinces stand at 90 per cent of the national coal production cuts.
In an interview with reporters, Lin Boqiang, dean of the China Energy Policy Research Institute at Xiamen University, said that the "go-to-capacity" of the steel and coal industries was not enough to rely on 100 billion yuan from the central government, and that more money needed to be solved by local governments and enterprises.
In the rules for the implementation of coal de-production capacity recently published in Shanxi Province, it is proposed to restructure Shanxi Coking Coal Group into a state-owned capital investment company to restructure and consolidate the assets and operations of enterprises and build a new business model.
The actual funding gap is likely to be three times higher than the subsidy, after the Minister of Human Resources and Social Security, Yin Weimin, said preliminary estimates put the coal system at 1.3 million people and the steel system at half a million people.
A reporter from the provincial environmental protection department today said the results of the 2012 environmental protection credit rating for key pollution sources in Guangdong province were being made public.

In the proposed red card enterprises, mainly electroplating, printing and dyeing, prevention and control of heavy pollution enterprises more, some sewage treatment plants are also on the list.
The Department of Environmental Protection said that in order to reflect the principles of openness, fairness and impartiality, and subject to public scrutiny, the results of the ratings will be posted on the website of the Department.
During the publicity period, the Environmental Protection Department receives calls, letters and visits from members of the public. The Office will investigate, verify and deal with the problems.

Does meat, dairy products and chocolate help alleviate inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)?
The meat and chocolate may sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.
But a new study suggests the opposite: A diet rich in meat protein and dairy products can help alleviate symptoms in patients with inflammatory bowel disease.
The incurable disease has an impact on the lives of about 1.3 million Americans and about 300,000 Britons, leading to stomach cramps and abdominal bloating, recurrent or bloody diarrhoea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
Researchers at the University of Washington usually advise patients to avoid eating meat and dairy products to relieve symptoms, but researchers have found that protein's key amino acid, tryptophan, helps boost the growth of immune cells, which can boost gut tolerance.
Dr Marco Colonna, lead researcher, explained that immune cells patrol the gut to ensure that harmful microbes hidden in food do not sneak into the body.
Maintain a balance between the cells that cause inflammation and those that promote tolerance, protecting the body without damaging various sensitive and fragile tissues.
Inflammatory bowel disease can occur when the equilibrium state is too biased towards inflammation.
In the experiment, a cell that promotes immunity was found to appear in mice carrying special bacteria.
Bacteria need tryptophan (one of the components of the protein) to form the appearance of the cells.
Professor Cologne said: "we have established a link between a bacterial population (Roe's Lactobacillus, which is a normal part of the gut microbiome) and a population of cells that can promote tolerance.
The more tryptophan the mice consumed in their diet, the more immune cells they had.
He suggested that if humans used the same method, a combination of Leptobacilli and a diet rich in tryptophan might create a more resistant, less inflammatory gut environment.
Luisa Cervantes-Barraganium, a postdoctoral researcher, studied immune cells that enhance resistance when she found that one group of study mice had such cells, but not when another group of the same strains were raised separately.
She suspects the difference is related to the gut microbiome (bacteria, viruses and fungi that normally live in the gastrointestinal tract) community in mice.
DNA sequencing of cholesterol in mice found that six bacterial populations were found in mice with immune cells, but not in mice without immune cells.
Mice are raised in sterile environments, so they lack gut microbiome and are unable to develop such immune cells, which are produced by the presence of Lactobacilli.
To understand how bacteria affect the immune system, the researchers cultivated Leptobacter in the liquid and then transferred a small amount of bacteria-free fluid to immature immune cells isolated from mice.
The immune cells develop into resistant cells.
When the active ingredient is purified from the liquid, it can be proved to be a by-product of tryptophan metabolism, known as tryptophan-3-lactic acid.
When researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in mouse feed, the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent, but when tryptophan levels were halved, the number of cells decreased by half.
'people, like mice, have the same cells that enhance tolerance, and most of us have tryptobacillus in our gastrointestinal tract, 'explained Dr Cervantes - Barragan.
It is not known whether humans, like mice in the experiment, can induce cell development of tryptophan by-products from luteus, but genetic defects associated with tryptophan have been found in patients with inflammatory bowel disease.
She said: "the development of these cells may be exactly the result we want because they can control the inflammatory response on the surface of the gut.
It is not accurate to say that the presence of high levels of tryptophan may lead to an increase in the amount of the disease.
Jose Mourinho believes Manchester United have signed 'genius' Nemanja Match
After Nemanja Match made his debut against Sampdoria on Wednesday night, Mourinho decided United had signed a "talented" midfielder.
Match, from Chelsea, signed for 40 million pounds and played 2-1 in the final pre-season match of the European Super Cup against Real Madrid in Dublin on Tuesday, winning the favour of Paul Borgba and Andreas Perera.
However, on Bruce's pre-season tour of Asia, Martial was badly in form and completed only 45 minutes, with Mourinho admitting there was a need for improvement before the Premier League season began.
"he needs time, but he has experience, wisdom and a genius way of thinking - he thinks about football," Mourinho said.
"we will help him get ready as soon as possible." "
Jose Mourinho began scheduling his starting line-up at the start of the season and, like Martinic, new signings Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku have also started at the Aviva Stadium, where they have been linked with a move to the top of the table.
The Independent reported this week that Mourinho still wants to bring in three more signings, but insists the club is "doing a great job" with four first-choice signings in mind and the club has brought in three of them.
"I am very grateful to the club for bringing in three of the signed players," he added.
"I would have been happier if the club had been able to bring in all four players, but they have done a lot for me." "
Will China lag behind if it does not build this type of warship at the height of the global frigate?
With the recent announcement by the world's major naval powers of plans for the construction of a new frigate, as if overnight the frigate had become the focus of the Navy's attention, after Japan decided to purchase two new frigates in its 2018 defense budget, leading to a substantial breakthrough in Japan's DEX frigate program, and the recent announcement by Lockheed Martin of the latest plan for a US FFG frigate.
With the launch of one of the latest 054A frigates at the end of 2017, marking the construction of as many as 29 frigates, approaching the sum of the 053H series, it has been 12 years since the first 054A was launched in 2006. Even in the world, such a large number of high-performance general purpose frigates have been built, with the exception of China, only the "Perry" frigates built by the United States in the 1970s and 1980s.
And the reason why so many 054A have to be built is simple: Cost-effective, easy-to-use, and the addition of years of naval arrears.
The 054A frigate, which has been favored for many years by the Chinese navy for its high value for money and good combat capability, carries about 4,000 tons of water, a 76 mm main gun, 32 units of sea red flag-16 and fish-8 anti-submarine missiles, eight Hawk-83 and a straight-9 helicopter, even though it was built in 2006 and has been designed for a very early period of time, but it is not as good as it is today.
But it is, after all, a ship designed at the beginning of the 21st century, with its weapon configuration set aside and its power systems and electronic radar equipment already far apart from the world's mainstream frigates, such as those in Europe, which are equipped with full-power propulsion, small multi-purpose phased array radar, and large-size helicopter decks, the time has come to develop a new type.
So how China's new frigate should be developed is directly related to its future positioning and the strategic approach of our Chinese navy.
The future development of China's navy is bound to become a blue-water navy, and the future is bound to go to the ocean, with areas that are closely related to China's vital interests for rapid deployment, demonstration of the presence of force and, if necessary, strong combat capability to ensure that China's vital interests in the region are not damaged.
Looking at the positioning of the new frigate in the future Chinese naval sequence, the future Chinese Navy should be similar to the US Navy, with the exception of the necessary offshore defence vessels, other major vessels will be required to form carrier battle groups or amphibious assault ship strike groups.
The role of the new frigate in the future carrier battle group should act as an anti-submarine main and mid-to-near space location, in the amphibious attack ship strike group should act as a guard ship, so according to this demand, the new frigate must have strong anti-submarine capability and a good medium-range area.
Based on the above-mentioned positioning, it can be bold to imagine the future of the domestic frigate.
In the first place, there should be a significant increase in the amount of water to be discharged in relation to the current 054A frigate, which would be fitted with a new type of frigate, which would be approximately 5,000-6,000 tons; the power system would be equipped with an integrated electric propulsion system consisting of a QC280 modified gas turbine and two diesel engines, with a maximum speed of about 30 knots; and, in the case of the weapon configuration of a 76 mm-mm and a large system, the main system, the main system and the main system.
As a result, the overall level of the new frigates will reach the current world-class level, even when compared with the United States FFG.
Of course, the above concept is only the author's guess of the new domestic frigate, exactly how we can only wait until the new frigate into the water, let's look forward to it.

In recent years, our city has encouraged enterprises to take an active part in the construction of national, industrial standards and regional group standards, and awarded 300,000 yuan to enterprises that are mainly or participate in the formulation of standards for Zhejiang manufacturing groups, and 500,000 yuan to enterprises that have been certified through Zhejiang manufacturing brands.
A few days ago, in the production workshop of Wang Li Group, Gao Jian, the head of the group's system, together with the employees, was packing a box of anti-theft security doors as a sample of standard matching work for the Zhejiang manufacturing group, to be sent to Shaoxing Quality Testing Center.
Just two days ago, Wang Li had passed the on-site audit of the "Zhejiang Manufacturing" Certification Expert Group.
Mr Gao said the professional team, made up of industry technical experts and quality certification organisations, praised the group's performance in core areas such as quality excellence and autonomous innovation, agreed that it was fully compliant and that Mr Wang would be one of the first companies to pass the standard as long as the product passed the test.
Wang Li Group is just a microcosm of the transformation and upgrading of the standard industry.
Our city is in step with the Zhejiang manufacturing group standard matching and meeting the standards of the work of the group, and the group rise group.
Since the Zhejiang manufacturing team standard set by our city's anti-theft safety gate industry last year, Star Moon, Xindo and other enterprises are also actively applying to dock the work.
In recent years, there has been a huge influx of capital into the film and television market, and the popularity and remuneration of star actors has soared, with producer He Jing saying that the two actors in one of the hit films were paid nearly $1 billion and ended up spending only two days together.
At a time when actors are playing around, women are starring in different groups at the same time, making it impossible to appear on the set at the same time, and the cast is forced to use a replacement to ensure the cycle.

Is it more terrible that China's household debt rate is closer to that of the United States than it is to be unable to afford a home?
In recent times, there has been a lot of discussion about the recent changes in real estate policy. Is real estate policy going to be loose again? Will the diversification of the supply of land policy lead to a decline in house prices?
But, at a time when we are worried about real estate prices, about macro-economic regulation, about the future of the real estate market, the People's Daily is writing again, the last time we devoted our comments to real estate regulation, and now the People's Daily is writing about a more serious issue than buying affordable housing, is that even if you can afford to pay for it?
Today, we come to talk about a more serious problem than buying a house: Loan repayment.
I. China's growing housing debt crisis
In November 2017, according to data from the National Financial and Development Laboratory of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences and the National Balance Sheet Research Center, the third-quarter China Leveraging Process Report, the resident sector's leverage rate continued its upward trend, rising from 47.4pc in the second quarter of 2017 to 3.6pc in the third quarter of 2017, according to the overseas edition of the People's Daily newspaper, which published an opinion article on January 17, 2017.
The share of debt of the residential sector in the overall real economy has increased, and leverage has risen at a faster rate.
Research shows that the debt of Chinese households in financial institutions is dominated by consumer loans, accounting for about two thirds of the debt of residents and about two times that of operating loans.
Among consumer loans, housing loans account for about 80 percent of medium- and long-term loans, but on an incremental basis, short-term consumer loans are growing at a faster rate than medium- and long-term loans.
On top of that, China's household debt rate only counts the total amount of credit that the household sector receives from financial institutions, while Chinese households also have a number of private loans, including borrowing from relatives and friends, with large hidden debts.
According to the Suning Institute of Financial Research, the leverage rate of Chinese residents was only 3% in 1996 and only 18% in 2008, but it has begun to grow rapidly since 2008, doubling to 36.4% in just six years.
To compare the data, in May last year, HSBC released a survey covering nine countries, with respondents close to thousands of people.
The report was aimed at "millennials" young people in nine countries (born between 1980 and 2000).
According to the report, China's housing ownership rate for young people after 80 or 90 years is as high as 70%, well ahead of second-place Mexico (46%) and twice that of the United States (35%).
The data tell us that one of the most likely problems is that the biggest potential "grey rhinos" for Chinese residents at this stage are estimated to be out of debt than they can afford to buy a house.
II. Why is the housing debt crisis the most serious problem?
As we have analysed before, although we have been saying that Chinese house prices are higher, but compared with other countries in the world, China's housing ownership rate is actually quite high, so not so much that prices are too high to afford housing, I'm afraid that many friends now have to ask the question of whether you can afford a loan?
As we look at real estate markets around the world, China's real estate market, with its late start, has not seen much of a real estate crisis, except in Hainan, as we said before, but just a decade ago the origin of the global financial tsunami of 2008 was the real estate crisis in the United States.
And the cause of the US housing crisis has been blamed on two companies: Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
In the golden age of the United States, real estate companies sold homes at very low down payments to low-income people in the United States at that time, and the housing market was booming at a time when the economy was improving, but the good times were short, and as growth stalled in the United States, resulting in a decline in income for home buyers, large amounts of household spending began to fall.
At that time, however, the state of affairs in the United States was part of the financial assets and real estate assets of American households, and almost all of the household assets of low-income groups in the United States were real estate, while most of the assets of the top 20 per cent of high-income groups were financial assets.
It is a serious fact that these people buy their homes when the economy is better, so the money they pay for home loans is based on their better income, and when income falls, the pressure on home loans not only does not decrease, but even as some subprime schemes become floating, so the housing problems of these American families have evolved into a real estate crisis.
As a result, some people can't afford to pay for their home, so banks start to take back their property, and when they sell it at very low prices from home buyers who default on their loans, which leads to a gradual decline in house prices in the region, creating a vicious circle in which more and more home buyers find that the value of their home is even lower than their own, and more people continue to suffer from bad loans.
As a result, a huge vicious circle was formed:
"the economy is down - incomes are down - some people can't afford to pay home loans - banks sell people's homes at low prices - house prices fall - more people stop paying home loans - banks sell again - house prices fall again..."
The problem is more than that, because of the continuing decline in house prices, when people stop repaying the house to the bank, it's not like you don't have any debt, and if the money you get from the house auction doesn't add up to the money you owe to the bank, you still need to pay back the money, simply assume that you used a down payment of $600,000, a loan of $2.4 million to buy a house that was then worth $2 million, and then to the bank of the house.
So, in one vicious circle after another, America's economy gradually collapsed, eventually triggering the 2008 financial crisis in the United States.
Therefore, it is a matter of great caution that China's household debt ratio has reached a high of 46.8pc at this stage, which is still below that of developed countries, but the problem has begun to emerge, and the country has repeatedly stressed the issue of leverage since last year, which is a very presentable judgment. If it is allowed to continue to climb, the household debt ratio will inevitably raise huge risks, so financial risks should be kept in check.
So after the house is used to live, not to fire the location, the state has accelerated the establishment of multi-subject supply, security, rent and purchase, and other measures to further mitigate the potential risks.
For our individual families, we must give up the speculative thinking of real estate, buy a house when we can, avoid their families into a huge burden, only a reasonable assessment of their income and debt levels is a healthy family wealth development path.

The British inventor implanted a chip in his body and waved his hand into the car
A British inventor is the first person in the country to install a chip to open his front door, enter his office or even start his car with just a wave of his hand.
Steven Northam, 33, implanted a small chip between his thumb and index finger, and is now offering the service to companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives, which his company, BioTeq, is using technology to do.
He has teamed up with Dr Jeff Watson, a senior consultant at the Royal Hampshire Hospital in Winchester, Hampshire, to ensure the implants meet medical standards.
The technology is similar to a cat and dog chip implant and takes only 30 seconds.
Mr Northam's company will also replace the locks of the rooms and vehicles to be compatible with the chip, costing £300 per lock.

White House props cost thousands
Last month, the White House decided to ship a Marine helicopter to the South Lawn to highlight the great glory of American manufacturing, at a cost of up to $24,000, according to military records released by Time magazine.
The green-and-white Sikorsky VH-3D (also known as Marine One when the president was on the ride) is an important exhibit at the White House's July 17 event highlighting construction projects in the United States.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and senior White House officials toured manufacturing products from all 50 states.
The exhibits are Connecticut-made helicopters, a Maine yacht, a Wisconsin fire truck and a Mississippi forklift.
The White House military office asked the helicopter to show up on a routine order (FRAGO), just 36 hours before it landed on the South Lawn for the "special" event, according to records from the Marine Corps Helicopter First (HMX-1), which operates the helicopter.
"I just want to make sure you know, because this event is highly valued," the HMX-1 commander said in an email to his superior Marine Corps deputy commander the day before the event.
The information indicated that the helicopter would arrive on the South Lawn for the 3pm event at about 7am on July 17, before leaving after the lawn was empty between 6pm and 9pm that night.
The message also said that in the event of a delay in departure from the White House, the return flight would require a second crew because of the time limit on duty.
The original crew was on standby at the side of the helicopter during the event, while security forces personnel were on standby nearby while the aircraft was on the ground.
The records obtained by Time magazine did not clearly indicate whether a second crew was ultimately needed.
The Act prohibits federal employees from using government property for political purposes.
The record noted that HMX-1 had asked if the event was a violation of the Act.
"one of the questions we asked was whether this was a violation of the Act and was told there was no violation," the commander wrote.
"sounds like you're locked up," the deputy commander replied.
The White House defined the "Made in America" event as official and therefore not subject to the Act.
But even official activities have political overtones.
At the event, the president pursued what was then the Senate's agenda: Health-care reform, and touted the control of government regulations.
The use of Marine Corps One or Air Force One aircraft for political propaganda purposes is nothing new.
Successive presidents have been required to travel on these planes.
But it is not common for them to be commandeered for the sole purpose of taking photographs.
Trump came under scrutiny in February, when the presidential plane glided slowly to the background of his first campaign rally in Melbourne, Fla., and his Twitter account was flooded with complaints about the former president's use of the presidential jet.
"the White House was thrilled by the" Made in America "exhibition, which featured products from all 50 states made by American workers using American materials," said Lindsay Walters, a White House deputy press spokesman.
The HMX-1 crew often conduct flight training near the Washington area and on the South Lawn, practicing the accurate placement of the President of the United States in the White House.
HMX-1 practiced 58 landings at the White House during Trump's G-20 summit in Germany in early July.
The US manufacturing flight was included in this month's crew training requirements, an official said.
The helicopter force also flew an extra 11 hours of "non-presidential support missions" on the day.
The White House said taxpayers did not bear the cost of any other props at the event.
A Sikorsky spokesman said the company was not involved in arranging the South Lawn helicopter display.
HMX-1 does not keep a budget record of the presidential flight, so it is very difficult to determine the exact cost of the event.
But the Department of Defense reimbursement for VH-3D is $24,380 per flight hour, according to the Department of Defense's hourly costs for fiscal year 2017.
Troop records recorded a flight time of 30 minutes per flight from the base of the Marine Corps airport in Martinico, Virginia.
The White House said the cost of operating the helicopter was far lower than the cost.
"estimating the cost to the taxpayer on the basis of reimbursable fees is very misleading," Walters said.
These estimated costs include personnel costs, maintenance costs and many other sunk costs included in the annual appropriations.
A 2015 RAND study showed that the Department of Defense's reimbursable costs do not include personnel costs, but do include oil, maintenance and contracting costs.
At the time, former White House press spokesman Sean Spike defended the use of the helicopter at the event,
"the idea is to show something made in the United States this week," he said.
And I know both Sikorsky and Connecticut are proud of it, both of them contributing to our national security, and I guess hundreds of jobs, if not thousands, depend on it.
And I feel that, like most Americans, we are proud of this helicopter and other military equipment, the result of the hard work of countless Americans.
So it is certainly not out of place to highlight this, "he said.
We don't know if Trump was interacting with the helicopter when he visited the South Lawn during the event, but he did sit in the driver's seat of the fire engine.
Inside the White House, Trump addressed representatives of Sikorsky, joking with the media about the company's aircraft, which he owned.
"I know the Sikorsky very well," he said. "I have three."

UN says Afghan democracy depends on women's political status
Only elections with the participation of all members of society, including women, are representative, the head of the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan said Wednesday.

It was compared with the national and central regions on the basis of some representative indicators of the economy in 2005 and 2011.
In terms of industrial economic benefits, in 2011, high energy-consuming industries, such as industrial energy and raw materials, which account for a significant proportion of the industrial economy, were affected by market volatility and "double pressure" on excess capacity.
The large amount of investment does not bring corresponding economic benefits, which is the important reason for the low quality and efficiency of economic growth.

The British General Trade Union (GMB) is concerned about investment in McVitie's Glasgow plant
The union wants the company's management to guarantee a long-term commitment to production at the Russo plant.
The Scottish branch of the British Federation of Trade Unions said it had been silent about the future of investment in the Tollcross plant.
The plant, which employs more than 500 people, produces products such as oat crackers and rich tea biscuits.
Pladis, the owner of the company, said it had invested more than £5 million in the plant over the past few years.
If there is a change in plant operations, staff and union representatives "will be the first to know," he added.
In a letter to the company's director, the Scottish branch of the British Federation of Trade Unions called on the company to "address the problem of funds not being carried over to the modernization of the production line."
"our members are deeply concerned that we have not been able to get a clear picture of Tollcross's future business needs and investment plans from the factory's general manager," said Drew Duffy, a senior member of the British Federation of Trade Unions.
Generations of families work here, and the high concentration of labour in local communities and the Greater Glasgow area is an important pillar of decent employment in areas with high levels of unemployment and social deprivation.
So, in terms of jobs, pay and economic prosperity, in the context of Brexit, rising costs of living and a prolonged decline in manufacturing, there is an urgent need for McVeigh to expand its production network in the east of Glasgow. "

We had discussions with staff and then, like all other companies operating in an environment of intense competition and economic uncertainty, we reviewed the ongoing operating model we applied to businesses and factories in order to remain competitive.
"in recent years, we have invested more than £5m in the Tollcross plant, particularly in production lines and operational improvements," she added.
We are fully aware of Tollcross's historical position as a production base, and if there is any change in our operations at the plant, staff and union representatives will be the first to know, "he said.
In the future, the clean-up of domestic waste on the northern slope of Everest will move from past public welfare actions to normal behavior led by the Chinese government and with the participation of all sectors of the international community, said Nima Ziren, deputy director of the Tibet Autonomous Region Sports Bureau on May 11, 2008 at the base camp of Mount Everest.
On May 10, environmental volunteers loaded classified waste into trucks.
In the past decade, with the rapid increase of mountain explorers and tourists on Mount Everest, the environmental protection problem is becoming more and more prominent in the area where the mountain peaks are located.
In the spring of 1997, the Tibet Autonomous Region Mountaineering Association launched its first clean-up campaign on the northern slope of Mount Everest, cleaning up a batch of domestic waste such as oxygen cylinders left over from the 1960s and 1970s. The video was also broadcast exclusively at the World Climate Conference in Tokyo that year.
After 1997, the public welfare team swept the north slope of Mount Everest, but most of the participants were non-professionals, according to Nima.
Paris Saint Germain warned Barcelona three years ago to sign Neymar?
La Liga may regret throwing an olive branch on Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain will not give up signing Neymar after making a £189m offer to try to get it to exercise the exemption clause, but did they warn Barcelona three years ago to launch an attack on the world record raiders?
The sensational approach has opened the summer transfer window as the French club prepare to break the world transfer record by more than twice the previous transfer record, with Paul Borgba returning to Manchester United for £89m last season.

Barcelona are angry about Neymar's style of attack and the way out, and sources close to the Catalonia board insist the club have been doing everything they can to take care of him since his arrival from Santos in 2013.
But did the president of Paris St Germain issue such predictions about the world of football three years ago?
When Manchester City expressed an interest in signing Bryce Matedi in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi issued a stern warning to any club looking to sign Paris Saint-Germain's best player.
"I'm not worried because they know that if they come into contact with any of our players, we're going to go against them and we're going to get in touch with their players as well," Alhleifi said.
"we respect all the clubs.
But if they try to sign our players, they also have to deal with the consequences. "
The Spanish club appeared to cross the line earlier this summer, with Barcelona throwing an olive branch to Paris St Germain midfielder Marco Verratti.
Paris Saint-Germain have made it clear that they will not allow the Italy international to leave anyway, and Barcelona are likely to be affected by the loss of the talented Neymar.
