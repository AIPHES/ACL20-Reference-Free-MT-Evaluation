Civil rights groups send travel warnings against Missouri State
As a result of Missouri State discriminatory policies and racist attacks, the American Association of Color Promotion (NAACP) issued a travel warning to colored people who were preparing to travel to Missouri State.
"The NAACP Missouri State Travel Advisory, which came into force August 28, 2017, called for a series of suspicious ethnic incidents in the recent Missouri State, and all African-American travellers, tourists and Missouri State should pay special attention and take a very cautious attitude in Missouri State Travel," the group's statement declared.
NAACP noted that a recent Missouri State law had made it more difficult to win discrimination lawsuits, and that the state's law enforcement was partly targeted at minorities, prompting the organization to issue travel warnings.
Violations of civil rights are taking place in people.
They are being interrogated for their skin tones, beaten or killed, "Missouri State NAACP, chairman of Rhodes Chapel, told the Kansas City Star (Kansas City Star).
"We have received many complaints, an unprecedented number. ”
This is the first such warning issued by the organization against a state in the United States.
The group cites the racial defamation of black students at the University of Missouri and the death of the 28-year-old Tennessee State black male Tolly Sanders.
Earlier this year, Saunders died in suspicious circumstances. He ran out of fuel during his travels in Missouri State and was detained by Missouri State police without charge of a crime.
The consultation also noted that a recent report by Missouri State's attorney general's office showed that "black drivers in the state are 75% more likely to be parked than whites."
Chapel said: "This consultation is to raise people's awareness, warning their families, friends and colleagues in Missouri State what may happen." ”
"People need to be prepared to go to Missouri State with bail, or let their relatives know they are traveling in the state."
According to the latest data from the FBI Hate crime reporting program, Missouri State recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015, and the state ranked 16th in the country according to the number of crimes.
The travel warning is also a response to Missouri State's new law, which will make it more difficult to prosecute companies for housing or employment discrimination.
The U.S. Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) said it would increase the number of ethnic lawsuits and issued travel advice for Texas and Arizona, State, after states passed immigration law to require local law enforcement officials to detain immigration violators.
Travel warnings are usually issued by the United States Government to other countries, but more recently, advisory groups have adopted this approach in response to certain laws and trends in the United States.

BBC says Beijing is the most exciting city: let foreigners feel "living in a new era"
According to the January 18 news media reported that Beijing may have a long history of 3,000 years, but it is also rapidly changing into today's modern charm City.
The Chinese capital, with its astonishing internet, sophisticated technology such as face recognition software, invests heavily in artificial intelligence and has unparalleled international energy, is one of the most exciting cities for the adventurous foreigners.
"If I can succeed there, I will be able to succeed anywhere," said Clemens Sechy, a German diaspora, according to the BBC website January 16. "He quotes the lyrics of singer Frank Sinatra? praising New York.
"If Sinatra lived to this day, he would probably sing a song about a city like Beijing," said Thracian, who is the creative director of the Journal Traveller Archives. "Living in this city will make you feel like you're living in a new era," he says, "and always keep up with the trend."
Simon Norton, who lives in England but recently lived in Beijing, wrote in a personal blog site 4corners7seas: "It's hard to say that people have a general feeling of being at the center of something grand, but it keeps many foreigners there for a long time." They wanted to see what it would be like, and they wanted to witness it. ”
reported that the city's high-quality high-speed Internet and the technology-friendly environment makes daily life easier than ever before.
"Beijing is rapidly turning into a cashless society, where the Internet integrates the functions of traditional wallets into smartphones, making it easier for everyone to do a lot of deals," said Andy Penafuerte, who comes from Manila and is currently deputy editor-in-chief of the Beijing Children's website. ”
But smartphones are just the beginning of Beijing's technological ambitions, and facial recognition software is already popular, with many mobile applications using the technology to transfer and pay for banks, to get people into apartments and offices, and even to verify the identity of the drivers, the report said.
Beijing has recently announced plans to spend 13.8 billion yuan on an artificial intelligence technology park, which will have more than 400 companies settled there, focusing on the development of artificial intelligence technologies ranging from biometrics to self-driving cars.
Food is also the core of many major festivals in China over the years, to participate in these celebrations are respected by foreigners, the Spring Festival is the most important social and economic festivals, is one of the most easy to participate in the festival.
Thracian said: "I propose to help Chinese friends to prepare for the new year, it is equally important to clean the apartment and post the Red couplets with New Year's greetings on the House, on New Year's Eve, when all the family members gather for a hearty feast, and then stay till midnight, and greet it with brilliant fireworks. For foreigners, spending the night with friends and family is indeed an opportunity for integration. ”
reported that the number of foreigners in Beijing and growing, but China's language barriers and the facilitation of communication between expatriates can easily become their excuse for not fully integrated into the local culture.
Thracian said: "Some foreigners have lived in China for many years, but have little experience with their host country." If your initial approach to the Chinese is not a success, then it's easy to get along with other foreigners.
"In these so-called" foreigner bubbles "(" foreigner bubbles "means foreigners mingle only among foreigners, not locals and local cultures), foreigners hold groups in their communities, eat in western restaurants, and only foreigners are friends.
The easiest way to overcome this is to learn a little Mandarin-which is simpler than one might think.
Thracian said: "A two-hour weekly Chinese private class or an entry-level radio series should fit everyone's busy schedule." ”
Even learning a few classic phrases can help with shopping, ordering meals in restaurants or chatting in taxis.
reported that persistent air pollution is also a fact of daily life, but in recent years the government has tried to contain some problems.
Residents stressed that it was important to have outdoor activities in the warmer months of pollution that were often lighter, and that blue skies were a chance to wander through the historic hutongs or explore the popular Sun Park.
"Beijing is a Chinese city that can find the most things below the surface, and you can find great artistic and musical activities, indulgent nightlife, historical wonders, a surreal business district and an ancient Hutong area," Norton said. ”
The report argues that the aging of human capital growth in the obstruction of increasingly obvious, especially in the Northeast region, the aging of human capital growth rate of annual contribution is 1.28%.

A picture to understand: the legal status of bitcoin around the world
Absrtact: In addition to speculative property triggered by natural price correction, this round of digital currency miserably and "old enemy"-regulatory risk is not unrelated.
From the visual map, Oriental countries are more conservative to bitcoin than the West, the world's main countries are still waiting to see the legitimacy of digital currency, representing the "Black Swan risk" is still very large.
* This article is from the Wall Street knowledge (micro-letter Id:wallstreetcn), editor Wang Mu. For more information, please login to wallstreetcn.com, or download the Wall Street News app. *
The global digital currency, led by Bitcoin, has been brutally washed this week after a storm of regulatory turmoil in key Bitcoin markets such as China, South Korea and the European Union, which fell below $10,000 trillion in psychological numbers in Tuesday and hit its biggest one-day decline in three years.
In addition to the natural price correction triggered by speculative attributes, this round of digital currencies has been linked to the risk of regulatory risks that have long been the "old enemy".
At this important juncture, the visualization of the large data site Howmuch.net produced a map showing the legitimacy and degree of regulation of Bitcoin in all countries around the world.
As the following illustration shows, green represents the legal market for bitcoin; Orange represents the neutral market, although it has not yet publicly legalized bitcoin status, but there is no major use restrictions; pale pink represents a restricted market in which local governments try to use red-line policy or regulation to approach digital currency ; Dark pink represents a country where bitcoin is defined as illegal; Grey is a country that has not yet commented.
(pictured above from the Howmuch.net visualization team on January 15)
The paper points out that the traditional Oriental countries ' attitude towards Bitcoin is more conservative than that in the west from the distribution of the green color in the map.
Russia is now the largest country to define bitcoin as illegal, and China is one of the biggest market-constrained markets for bitcoin, one of the biggest countries to which Bitcoin has not commented and has not yet enacted policies.
North America and Western Europe are the regions with the highest acceptance of Bitcoin, that is, the distribution of green blocks is more concentrated.
The views of the Middle East and Latin American countries on Bitcoin are markedly differentiated, and the distribution of color patches in these regions is even more mixed.
Iraq, Iran, Turkey, Brazil are the legitimate Bitcoin market, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Bolivia, etc. to their trading and use of a certain degree of restrictions, more Latin American countries to the bitcoin has not been audible.
This data shows that of the 246 countries surveyed globally, a total of 99 countries (or 40% per cent) have no restrictions on the trading and use of Bitcoin, that is, green and orange areas.
7 countries (or 3%) are restricted markets (light pink), there are 10 countries (or 4%) that define Bitcoin as illegal (dark pink) and 130 countries (or 53%) have no more treatment for digital currency information (gray).
This shows that the world's main (53%, more than half) of the countries are still watching the digital currency led by Bitcoin in the legitimacy of the territory, but also represents the bitcoin "Black Swan risk" is still very large, because some of these countries may eventually make a legislative decision to limit the digital currency.
The article argues that global regulators have not fully understood the emerging category of digital currency, probably the main reason why most countries have not yet made a statement.
Although Bitcoin's "popularity" has grown exponentially since last year, it does not mean that all countries are interested, and there may be fears that local fiat money is being threatened or that the digital currency is being used by criminal organizations.
The story of Wall Street has written a detailed summary of international regulatory news on Bitcoin since last week, including the central service online platform and mobile app that China started to crack down on OTC exchanges, South Korea is still considering closing the digital currency exchange, which the European Union believes is not widely accepted and warns investors of the risk of "losing the money".
"Read the News |2018:" The first year of digital money opened by the world's mother? said that, from any point of view of regulation, acceptance/criticism and adoption, 2018 years would be the first year of the global central bank's digital currency.
Russia and other big powers have criticized Bitcoin's legitimacy as a way of giving the official digital currency its place.

What other sacred things are there?
Now Trump's White House is targeting the Statue of Liberty.
The most definite sign of regime change is when they start attacking the statue.
Americans agree with this as anyone else. As a result, Saddam Hussein of the 2003 Baghdad Paradise Square was deliberately pushed down.
Stephen Miller, one of the key thinkers of the Trump government, Accosta Jim Acosta, CNN, on the president's controversial proposal for a strict restriction on legal immigration, He must have known what would happen if he had chopped a symbolic axe at the Statue of Liberty.
It is fair to say that Miller did not attack the statue itself.
If he did so, a group of cruise owners and libertarian followers would surely devour him.
But he did attack the significance of the statue, especially in the 1903 when the famous poem of Emma Lazarus was carved on the pedestal (the monument was built 17 years later).
As Miller rebuked Accosta: "I don't want to talk about all the facts of history here, but the Statue of Liberty is a symbol of American freedom to illuminate the world ...."
The poem you are referring to, which was added later, is not part of the original Statue of Liberty. ”
In fact, Miller is right, but as he says, it's not really about history.
This relates to the modern echoes of Lazarus's language of the world, the only country seems to invite not just any old immigrant, but also the poorest of the poor: "Your exhaustion, your poverty, or your huddled masses desiring to breathe freely,/the suffering of those who refuse your crowded beaches." ”
There is no "suffering person refuses" at the moment our screen becomes more dazzling.
Miller has not been involved in literary criticism, and he has made it clear that these people will not be welcomed in the Trump age of the United States.
This conflict over the meaning of statues is part of a broader political and cultural war: this is actually in conflict with the American spirit.
Lazarus (Lazarus), as well as her friends who held events after her death, etched her verses on the pedestal, were aware of the highly political nature of the acts they were engaged in.
The purpose of the sculpture is to express the link between French and American republicanism through the ancient classical metaphor of the female incarnation of the Statue of Liberty.
Lazarus changed the meaning: In her poem, the image of the female is no longer abstract, she wants to make a sound.
She gave herself a very different name: the mother of exile.
The poem's combination with the painting is a successful feminist coup, and a devastating blow to American nationalism.
Just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, the right-wing people have been trying to change it back to its original purpose.
Great speaker, Rush? Rush Limbaugh (Rush Limbaugh), Tramplay a makeshift Baptist, said in 2010 years that liberalism was not an invitation to anyone, but that he was now an early neo-conservative who brought the American wisdom flame to the ignorant world: "The Statue of Liberty has never been before."
Her intention was to bring the torch of freedom from the United States to other parts of the world.
The torch is not the way to illuminate America. ”
Unusually, Limbaugh was actually touched by something.
The meaning of a statue depends entirely on the perspective of cognition.
The most imaginative way to Lazarus is to be able to see it. When weary, poor but hopeful people will see it on the deck of the ship after a long and often dreadful journey.
On the face of it, it involves people who seek refuge and have the opportunity to improve their lives to see the world.
Her statues conveyed to them and needed the hope and welcome they had heard.
Of course, this is not the point that Miller and Trump had wanted to admit.
Their torch is not to illuminate the road, but to ignite the hatred of their only source of power.

2017 World Championships: Neil Blake highly praised the Scottish team in England
Eirid Doyle, Eilidh Doyle, recalls that the England national team had only two Scots.
Neil Blake, executive director of the British Athletic Association, said a team of 16 strong Scots in the world championships would make a big contribution to the national team.
The number of Scottish field athletes selected to attend the 2017 World Championships in London at the opening of the Friday was the highest in history.
"Scotland is making extraordinary progress," Blake says, and British athletes must learn from it.
"We accept and try to understand this, and we will stick to it until we succeed," Blake said.
"I'm talking to someone at the Scottish Sports Institute. They think it has something to do with their act.
The Scottish track and field athletes think this is related to their acts.
The British Athletics Association thinks this has something to do with their role.
Even the street people think so.
No matter what the situation is, it is extremely glorious. “
A number of Scottish track and field athletes are medal contenders, including Laura Muir (Laura Muir) and Andrew Butchart (Andrew Butchart), who will be at a ratio of 5,000 metres to Mu Farah (Mo Farah), while Eirid Doyle (Eilidh Doyle ) was selected by the group as the captain.
"Eirid a little humble.
Her captain's speech was unbelievable, "Blake said.
"Many athletes, whether they are Scottish or not, live or train anywhere, get out of the door with pride and enthusiasm," he said.
Eirid natural devotion to passion and true feelings are very good. ”
The British Commonwealth silver Medalist, who will take part in the 400-metre hurdles at its fifth World championships, said it was "unbelievable" that there were 16 Scots in the UK national team.
Previously, the number of Scottish track and field athletes participating in the World Series was up to 7, the number of participants in 1983 and 2015.
The runner Muir is a leading figure. She has made five British records and two European records in the past year.
She will participate in the 1500-metre and 5000-metre project competition.
Chris O ' Hare, who took part in the 1500-meter project, was another Scottish contestant who had scored well in the season before winning the qualifying and Olympic Games in the UK.
Doyle recalls her participation in the first world championship, when the only other Scot in the team was Lee McConnell (Lee McConnell).
The captain said she was proud that so many of her compatriots joined the team and, in some cases, challenged the medals and competed in the final.
"The special thing about being captain of the national team is that it was voted by other members of the national team." So knowing that your teammates are voting for a very unusual achievement is a great honor for me anyway, "she added.
"Of course, I am very proud of all the Scots.
It just shows how far we've come.
And they are the veteran track and field athletes here, the athletes who will march towards the podium.
How about my captain's speech?
Well, I think it's very good.
I have just referred to the fact that under such circumstances, we are very fortunate because we hold the world championships at home.
So it's really important that we get home support and grow back into the Olympic Stadium.
I will get a second chance to play and the atmosphere there will be fantastic. ”
A total of 180,000 employees in 2016, the cost of employees as high as 121.8 billion, an increase of 21%.
Shielding critics from Facebook: If you can't stand the voters ' censure, don't run for office.
Our father knows the style of bad media.
The Americans loved Washington, but soon the newspapers began to lash out at him, from domestic policy to political principles.
He was annoyed by these criticisms, no doubt.
But he has not silenced the critics.
Because as early as 1783, Washington said, "Freedom of expression is denied-we will be slaughtered in silence and ignorance like a lamb." ”
It reminds me of the governor of Maryland, Larry Hogen, who needs to learn from Washington.
Hogan's staff masked and deleted posts from at least 450 people as they posted their views on the official Facebook page.
The ACLU filed a lawsuit against him earlier this week.
The governor's staff thought the lawsuit was sloppy and the online coverage was full of their strong resistance: "Who cares?" ”
A lot of people say, "It's just a face book." ”
But that's very important.
This is especially important because of the people who are in the face of Hogan.
This is a Republican who is governor in a Democratic majority state, and he is surprisingly popular.
Among the country's 50 governors, he received the second highest praise.
Mr Hogan is not a reactionary impatient molecule.
He was in charge of Maryland and was in strict compliance with the rules.
He is also very good at making Facebook the main way to connect with voters, jokingly showing his bald head after chemo for the first time on the homepage.
So shielding people who come to the Governor's homepage for comment is totally unnecessary and ultimately dangerous. This homepage is a public forum, an official management platform for employees who are taxed by the public.
In an interview with The Washington Post, Mr. Hogan's spokesman, Amilia Chasse, defended the governor's actions, saying she thought shielding their comments was just a matter of trying to restrain them.
But they are too hasty to describe it as a scourge or a cynic who sweeps the web.
The Washington Post spoke to people who had been Hogan.
They are just ordinary people talking to their elected leaders: their identities are teachers, small business owners and priests, not scourges.
They say their comments are deep, respectful, and not indecent.
Quoting the Bible in his post, the priest appealed to Hogan to remember his Catholic faith.
Lakhimi Salma Lamagne, a barrister at Bowie, Maryland, was not cynical, but she asked about hate crimes.
"I politely commented that I was disappointed that he did not respond to hate crimes and other recent news events," she wrote in the Post's news story review.
I also don't like a group of people commenting on the same topic, because these people are directly ignored by some people, thinking that they are the so-called herd mentality, rather than treating them as a bunch of youguoyoumin citizens. ”
What the governor's staff call "dense spam bombing" may seem to others to be "sticking to the idea".
Facebook makes it easy to modify a piece of information, only by shielding a critic or deleting a negative comment.
And it's much cleaner than it used to be, and in the past the same effect needs to be done by sending staff out to collect and burn newspapers that criticize or arrest or silence protesters.
But that's really what's happening right now, but on a digital level.
Mr Hogan was not the first public official to be blamed for silencing others in Facebook and other social media.
President Trump is being sued by Twitter users because he blocked them on Twitter.
There was a landmark ruling in Virginia State last week about such issues.
According to U.S. Alexandria District Judge James C. Charis, the chairman of the Lloyd's County supervisory committee from her Facebook page to screen voters ' behavior violates the First Amendment.
Kentucky State Governor Matt Bevin (R) was also patronized by the ACLU for the use of his Facebook book and Twitter.
This should not be so difficult.
In the era of Washington, affordable postage and the internet had similar influence.
The number of newspapers doubled between 1776 and 1800, with anonymous letters criticizing his leadership.
And even at that time, Washington had an anonymous scourge against him.
People use pseudonyms such as Yurikla, Vallerius, Bailey, Pogius, and so on to write to newspapers to severely criticize Washington's decisions.
According to the historical documents collected by the George Washington newspaper Online project, his office was inundated with petitions criticizing his attitude to the British Royal Majesty and the United States of America Treaty on Amity, Commerce and navigation.
But he had not silenced them.
Freedom of speech, freedom of dissent and freedom of speech are the foundations of this country.
And the real leader needs to accept that.
property market A trace of the slightest hint of the touch of people's sensitive nerves.

Poverty and death in Jinzhou, Indonesia
Baddin Na Dai Jie Cook without a stove.
She seldom even uses a pan.
Her cabin is located in Rotali, the capital of Parni, in the Indonesian province of Papua, where the housewife usually simply puts a sweet potato-locals call it "Nota"-directly into the fire.
Half an hour later, the burnt sweet potato was taken out by a pair of hands that had not been washed, and devoured.
Dai Jie sits in the mud--she has no furniture, and this is where she does her daily chores, such as washing clothes and washing clothes that are so cloudy that they come from a nearby swamp.
There is a bucket in a room without a roof, and this is the outdoor toilet.
She was the youngest of her husband's four wives, so she was not taken care of in the fields.
The phenomenon of polygamy is common here.
Of course it's dangerous to be at the party: Most men in the village don't work, and a lot of them are drunk, plus there are a lot of soldiers.
"No one dares to walk around the village after 5 o'clock in the afternoon," she said. ”
This is a rare glimpse of daily life in Papua Highlands, once a colony of the Netherlands, incorporated into Indonesia after the 1969 referendum, but the referendum was also controversial when only 1026 elders were forced to vote by hand in front of the occupying forces.
The current campaign for independence and opposition to Dutch rule is soon to be directed at the Jakarta government, which has imposed a repressive regime on the region, isolating foreign journalists and activists.
The province was formally divided into Papua and West Papua provinces in 2003, while Papua New Guinea independently controlled the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali location is remote, desolate and uninhabited; to get here, you need to take a 90-minute flight from the provincial capital Jayapura to the Thunder, then rent a car for 5 hours, boil the stomach.
There is no public transport here.
In a town of about 19,000 people, the wooden house is surrounded by bamboo fences, and the corrugated metal roof is a yellowish-brown covering made of rust.
Few Indonesians came, let alone journalists, and hardly any foreigners.
Before the arrival of the Christian preacher, Mee Pago Papuans believed in a god named Uga Tamee.
There are other changes here as well.
Dai Jie said, "We can't get through these clothes." She was referring to her bright-coloured hand-knitted scarf, dark shirt and bright half skirt.
"We used to cover our bodies with leaves," he said. ”
Papua is the poorest province in Indonesia, where 28% of the people live below the poverty line and the region with the highest infant mortality and the lowest literacy rate in Asia.
But this is also the Indonesian Jinzhou.
Parni County is located in the Highlands, about the same size as New Jersey, with 153,000 people. Grasberg, the world's largest and most lucrative gold mine, is only 60 miles from here, which is owned by the Felip McMoRan Copper Company headquartered in Phoenix.
In 2015 alone, Felip mined about 3.1 billion dollars worth of gold and copper.
In addition, the timber resources in Papua are very rich with an estimated value of USD 78 billion.
However, these rich resources are also the source of Papuans tragedy, Indonesia's strong military force is thus able to keep them suppressed.
A 2005-year survey by the New York Times shows that Felip paid nearly 20 million dollars to local military personnel and troops from 1998 to 2004, with a single official up to $150,000 trillion.
The rising demands of the people of Papua for their independence threatened the king, who had thus been treated cruelly.
More than 500,000 people have been killed since 1969 and thousands have been raped, tortured and imprisoned by Indonesian troops, according to activists.
According to the Asian Human Rights Commission, the mass killings in Papua tribal highlands in 1970 have escalated to genocide.
The Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful protesters last year alone.
A 2016-year report by the Catholic Brisbane, "We will lose everything," includes proof of the manifest of the previous year, such as extrajudicial executions, torture-another report that rape and electricity are particularly prevalent-and the brutal repression of peaceful demonstrations.
"Violence occurs every day, so it is difficult to calculate the number of victims," said Andrias Harsono, an Indonesian researcher at Human Rights Watch. ”
The resources of Papua brought in large numbers of immigrants outside Indonesia, and oppression began.
83% of the 3.5 million people in the province are Christians, but the demographic structure of Muslim economic migrants has changed since they arrived from the densely populated island of Java, Kalimantan, Pulau, Pulau Sumatera and Pulau Sulawesi.
The Javanese snack stalls sell fried chicken and vegetables mixed with extra extra, with peanut butter.
The locals struggled to fight.
The 24-year-old Parni Apos You moved to the provincial capital, Jayapura, to find a job, explaining that "those immigrants began selling chicken and vegetables in the traditional market at a lower price than local Papua."
This has left the local Papua--the Papua women--Mama-mama their markets. ”
Indonesia's president, Zocco Vidodo (often called Zokovi), vowed in his 2014 campaign to address the problem of inequality and abuse of power in Pakistan's Papua.
The former carpenter's road to the presidential palace in Jakarta has been supported by 27 of all 29 regions-including Parni AI.
But Papua has not changed anything, and today the locals feel betrayed.
"We have been heartbroken," said Zokovi, who voted for us in 2014, hoping he would fulfill our aspirations and return to justice. ”
In fact, only two months after Zokovi's inauguration in October, Paniai suffered the most terrible nightmare.
On December 7, 2014, 11 children Enarotali A Christmas carol in front of a bonfire outside, and two Indonesian soldiers suddenly rushed over on a motorbike.
The frightened children told them that they should turn on the headlights.
According to the local priest, Tes Tes, one of the soldiers was dissatisfied with their tone and then returned with four soldiers.
The victims and witnesses said the drunken soldiers used their guns to chase the group of children.
Then one of the soldiers fired at the group of children.
The 16-year-old Julianus Yeme was badly beaten and unconscious.
A few hours later, a fire broke out at the Election committee building near the government agency, and the second day escalated.
About 1,000 young Papua men, women and children gathered at a football field in front of the local police and military command centre to claim justice.
They carried ritual hunting bows and danced the Waita of the Papua Mee Pago tribe-running around in circles and imitating birdsong.
Some of the protesters began throwing stones at the Army's regular sentry posts.
As the mood intensifies, soldiers receive orders via an internal radio: "If the crowd resists more than three times, they are summarily shot," according to an official document from Time magazine. "But the document was not released to the local media.
The 56-Year-old Jeremias Kayamu, head of the koto block of Rotali Kego, sensed imminent danger, and appealed to the crowd to calm down and begged them to come home.
But no one was in the mood to hear him say.
He stood on the porch of his brightly coloured wooden house and told Time magazine "When I turned around, my left wrist was suddenly shot." ”
Kayamu still doesn't know who fired the gun, but he said the bullets came from the assembled soldiers.
He added, "It was so crowded that they fired a lot of guns." ”
According to local Orff Yousse Yours's cousins, he witnessed the shootings and saw Orff Yousse Yours shots.
"I ran over to check his body to see if it was him," Juhanes told TIME sadly.
I found out he was dead ... I kissed him. ”
Papua Police Governor Zayuj Mende told reporters that his subordinates are only in the "protection" of the police station, because the police were attacked.
"We must defend ourselves when someone threatens to kill us," said Puggio Sulistio, a police spokesman and police chief in 2015.
This is a matter of life and death. ”
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and more were injured.
The next day's news about the killings spread only slowly in Jakarta.
Three weeks later, Zokovi an emotional speech at Jayapura, expressing deep sympathy for the families of the victims and vowing to address the abuses left behind in the history of the Palestinian people.
"I hope the case will be resolved as soon as possible so that it will not happen again in the future," he said. ”
Security Minister Villando said in October 2016 that he would set up a non-judicial mechanism to address the historical legacy of human rights abuses.
But the excuses were almost immediately sounded.
"Most of the violations took place a long time ago," he said.
Some were in the 90 's and the early 2000.
The point is that we are committed to addressing these violations, but this will require a process. ”
Then, on June 5 in Jakarta, Villando in a dialogue with Time magazine, saying he had no plans to establish a complaint mechanism in Papua.
Instead, he said, "everything will be settled by law." ”
The United Nations has charged Villando with "crimes against human rights" for the death of more than 1000 deaths in East Timor's bloody independent vote in 1999, but said 11 human rights violations in the Papua region had been resolved, including the Paniai incident.
The families of the victims of the Paniai were dismissive of these rhetoric.
"I've been interviewing four times in the last three years, but things haven't progressed," Juhanes said. ”
Years later he said, "I'm tired." ”
He still lives in fear now.
He said, "I'm scared."
I was afraid of being arrested by the army and afraid of being shot. ”
His brother Jucabus also believed that the Paniai people were afraid to talk about the incident.
He said he was beaten by the military after helping to bury four victims.
He said, "After burying the body, the military came to me." ”
The shooting didn't stop.
Tuesday, Indonesian police in Parni AI neighboring counties Deyai County shooting villagers.
A construction company manager refused to help transport a comatose man to a hospital where clashes took place, killing one person and injuring 17 others, including children.
La Vianus Dor, a 24-year-old man, drowned while fishing near the river and died on his way to the hospital.
Angry villagers protested in front of the company's live office.
Police said the villagers threw stones at the police, so the police fired a warning.
But riot-police forces (TNI) began shooting at the crowd and one was killed.
Doming Badi, 29, told Time magazine, "We were all in a panic, and now we're afraid they'll retaliate." He lived near the hospital when he saw the wounded man rushed to hospital.
"I hid at home for two days." ”
The Deyai Parliament has called for the police to be brought to justice and to evacuate riot-resistant mobile units from the area.
Paniai has always been a right and wrong place for the Indonesian government.
The absence of effective development has fostered discontent among the Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal tribes, scattered in the central highlands of Parni.
Many have joined the Free Papua Movement (OPM), a rebel army that has claimed to protect the rights of the Papua people by dispersing attacks and raids to kidnap Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the top leaders of the Free Papua movement were born in Parni, including Tadius Yugi and Daniel Judas Kogau.
Thus, in recent years thousands of Paniais were arrested and deliberately detained under the guise of "safeguarding national sovereignty" by the military.
Some people never show up again.
In the eyes of the people of Papua, Paniai is a "forgotten place of Tragedy".
Poverty breeds discontent.
Enarotali in the sale of poor rice, the local people can not afford.
The bread is simply out of reach.
People here grow everything they can eat: mainly sweet potatoes and some fruits and leafy vegetables.
Farming is a woman's job, and every woman can take care of four or five sweet potato plots.
They usually leave most of their harvests at home, and the rest are sold on the local market.
Ten sweet potatoes are worth only 10,000 Indonesian rupee (75 cents).
Over time, economic inequalities have been opened up in local Papuans and new arrivals, and the number of migrants has increased considerably since the opening of new routes to that airport.
The small amount of work that is now usually falls to a better educated and wealthier immigrant.
The Papua people have very little money or necessary skills to operate a competitive company.
"Young people do not want to stay in the village," said John Gobai, president of the Paniai Tribal Council. Because there is no work and no money. ”
Papua is isolated.
In addition, the restrictions on international media coverage are still very tight.
Earlier this year, French journalist Frank Escoudis and Bassel Lonchamp were expelled from Papua because they were "not cooperating with the authorities", even though they had been given a rare license to shoot.
According to Felim Kain, deputy director of Human Rights Watch Asia, the electoral oath that Zokovi has withdrawn its reporting restrictions to promote transparency and development has not materialized.
He said in a statement that "if foreign journalists try to cover the most eastern Indonesian provinces of Papua and West Papua, they are at new risk: refusing visas and pulling the blacklist." ”
The lack of media oversight means that international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely confined to Papua's neighbours.
In March, 6 Pacific countries-Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands, Solomon Islands-asked the United Nations Human Rights Council to investigate the "widespread human rights violations" in Papua, including the Paniai shootings.
These countries have also supported the Free Papua movement.
Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesman Almanata Nasil the group's accusations, he told Jakarta's reporters, "Indonesia is still in the democratic system, and media freedom, so the evidence of human rights violations is difficult to conceal." ”
Locals want more attention from foreign governments.
When the Dutch human rights Ambassador Kess Wan Barr led an official delegation to visit Jayapura on May 4, the local people broke the silence and begged, "We want freedom," said one person familiar with the matter. He also attended the meeting, but asked for anonymity.
Indonesia will hold its next presidential election in 2019, but Papuans says they are unlikely to vote Zokovi again.
Tribal Council President Gobai said "Zokovi's intentions were good, but he was surrounded by people involved in the Paniai shootings." ”
He wants Zokovi to know that Paniai not only lives under the threat of a greedy army, but also has nothing, a region with scant education and poor public health services.
Gobai says the Parni people, like other Papua people, believe that the vote they voted for Zokovi is the debt he must repay.
He said, "They don't need money, they need justice." ”
Even under threat and intimidation, the families of the victims of the Paniai shootings still made their last symbolic revolt: burying a victim's body opposite the military Police sentry.
They know that justice may never come, but at least they will not let the culprits forget their sins.
"My family was killed," Jucabus said with a low head.
What else can we do? ”

Fire again engulfed Dubai "torch" Ferris Tower
A fire in the world's tallest residential building in Dubai in Friday forced hundreds of residents to flee the 337-metre-high, 79-storey high-rise building.
It was the second big fire that swept through high-rise buildings in just two years, and it happened to be the Ferris Tower, known as the torch.
The building has been evacuated and no injuries have been reported, and the cause of the fire has not yet been found.
"We were sleeping, and then we were woken up by the fire and people started screaming," he said.
We ran down the stairs, and it took about 10 minutes to run from the 50 floor, "a resident named George told Reuters.
Dubai's civil defense authorities say the fire brigade put out the blaze at about 4 o ' clock local time (Greenwich Mean time 0000) and is cooling the building.
The Government has indicated that it is working to provide shelters for affected persons.
The incident may yet again spark concern around the world about the safety of exterior-wall materials used in high-rise buildings.
A survey conducted by the Torch's skyscraper management in the aftermath of its 2015 fire found that most of the damaged objects were sheathing and insulating cladding of exterior wallboard.
British police have said they think the problem with the heat and cladding of the Grenfell building in London could be the cause of the rapid spread of fire in June, which killed about 80 people.
Williams also hinted that Massa might return, even though he has announced his retirement.
January 9 distance Korea Pingchang Winter Olympic Games only one months left, with the Olympic flame from the south to the north of the transmission preheating and preparations for the work, South Korea's domestic Winter Olympics atmosphere is increasingly strong.
South Korea's public opinion looks forward to the long absence of the DPRK-ROK talks, to the Pingchang Winter Olympics countdown one months to bring an "egg."
November 1 last year, the Pingchang Winter Olympic flame arrived in Korea.
The upsurge of the torch was directly reflected in the sale of tickets for the Pingchang Winter Olympics.
Just two months ago, the Pingchang Winter Olympics ticket sales rate is only hovering at 32%, the Winter Paralympic Games ticket sales rate is only 4.3%, the low rate of ticket sales at one point to the outside world for the Pingchang Olympic Games of the popularity of worry.
But as Li Xivan, chairman of the Pingchang Winter Olympics, recently predicted, "as the Olympic flame is being passed around South Korea, the Winter Olympics are becoming more and more hot, believing that ticket sales will soon improve."
According to South Korean media reports, as of January 3, Pingchang Winter Olympics tickets sales have reached 64%, Winter Paralympic Games ticket sales rate also exceeded 50%.
To encourage foreigners to attend the South Korean games, the South Korean Ministry of Law 8th also announced that the Pingchang Winter Olympics will be extended by foreigners to stay in Korea for up to 120 days.
More than one-fifth of U.S. travellers carry prohibited items to boarding, the survey found
A survey of aircraft passengers found that more than 20% of passengers had intentionally or unintentionally smuggled illegal goods through the United States Transportation Safety Administration checkpoint, with at least 6% of passengers intentionally carrying prohibited knives or other bladed objects aboard.
Less than 1% of passengers claimed that they had later discovered a trip with guns, ammunition or explosives accidentally.
The survey, conducted by Chartered Air Services company Stratos Jet Charters Inc., also found that young travellers were more likely to defy the rules, according to an investigation of more than 1000 people.
Of the respondents who had tried to intentionally carry TSA contraband, 19.7% were in the millenium, compared with less than 15% for generation X.
The most common items that deliberately sneak through TSA security inspectors are food and beverages.
More than 3% admitted to having been deliberately carrying a knife through security, while 2.2% of female respondents and 3.7% of male respondents also said they had deliberately taken the illegal drugs aboard.
The company said the national travellers surveyed were trying to understand the number of passengers who accidentally carried and deliberately carried embargoed items to the airport.
It is not surprising that people who are most likely to carry embargoed security checks-intentionally or unintentionally-are the ones who fly most frequently.
However, the company pointed out that the TSA guide was a little complicated.
People are often unsure about what and how much fluid they can carry.
So it's not surprising that the TSA has the most seizures of contraband liquids.
It was once thought that the TSA might use books as an embargo.
Domestic flights are allowed to carry liquids, but international flights are not allowed.
EPA chief Prut changes to Obama-era emissions regulations
A day after being sued by 15 states, EPA director Scott Prout changed his earlier decision to postpone the Obama-era policy of reducing emissions from smog and air pollutants.
Prut proposed this change because the Environmental protection Bureau could respond more quickly to the needs of the environmental monitoring State agencies than the previous government.
He made no mention of the legal challenges raised by the Federal Court of Appeal against his predecessor's position.
The controversy has focused on setting a deadline of October 1 for States to start meeting the 2015 ground ozone standards.
In June, Prut announced that he would delay performance for a year to give the EPA more time to study the plan to avoid "interfering with local decisions or impeding economic growth".
Before being appointed by President Donald Trump, Prut, the Oklahoma attorney general, has long resisted the tightening of environmental regulations.
Since arriving in Washington, Prut has repeatedly stopped or postponed laws against the chemical and fossil fuel industries.
The abrupt reversal of the Wednesday was the latest legal obstacle to the Prut regulation's return to the agenda.
Last month, the federal appeals court in Washington ruled that the director of environmental protection had overstepped its authority and tried to postpone the Obama administration's requirement that oil and gas companies monitor and reduce methane spills.
In a statement released in the evening of Wednesday, Prut made a big turn in his attitude towards ozone standards, saying he wanted to strengthen the EPA's commitment to cooperate with the States and adopt complex procedures to reach new standards.
"Under the previous administration, the EPA usually did not meet the specified deadline, and then the activist groups and others sued and agreed to set a timetable by agreement," Prut said. "He has initiated more than 10 prosecutions against the Environmental Protection Agency in his previous work.
"We do not believe in the regulation through litigation, we take the deadline seriously."
We are also serious about regulations and authorities. ”
Nonetheless, the EPA statement said Prut could again use his "deferred authorization and all other legally available authorizations" to ensure that the rules were "good policy and best available information".
Republicans in Congress are pushing for a broader rewrite of the ozone layer.
The House bill, approved last month, aims to postpone the 2015-year rule for at least eight years.
The measure has not yet been voted on in the Senate.
New York State Attorney General Eric Sch the state union this week sued the EPA, saying it intends to maintain legal pressure.
"The reversal of the EPA--after we filed a lawsuit--is a significant victory for the health and safety of 6.7 million of New Yorkers, with more than 115 million Americans directly affected by smog," says Schneider Derman. ”
California State, Connecticut State, Delaware State, Illinois State, Iowa, Maine State, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico State, Oregon State, Pennsylvania State, Rhode Island, Vermont State and Washington state, and Columbia, Dist. Of all joined the New York State in the case.
Ground-level ozone is caused by the reaction of common pollutants emitted by automobiles, power plants, refineries, chemical plants and other sources in the atmosphere.
The resulting smog causes severe respiratory problems for sensitive people, causing thousands of premature deaths each year.
Of course, public health advocates and environmentalists cheered Prut's surprising shift.
"It is disturbing that this commonsense measure is under great pressure from the head of the department that protects the air we need to breathe," says Lorry Ann Boude of the Biodiversity Center. ”
"We must fight with the Trump government in order to cater to the polluters and the special interest groups of the ideological movement." ”

Moore beach massacre: Activists reproduce racist lynching and justice
A 1948-Year-old Ford Mercury car runs through a crowd of onlookers in the town of Georgia State, toward the tiny Moorish beach bridge.
The car was loaded with four black passengers and a white driver, before the car arrived at the bridge, a group of white men with guns to the front, blocking the road ahead of the car.
The head of the mob-a middle-aged man in a fine striped suit-took a deep puff of a cigar and glanced into the windshield.
The passengers in the car were full of fear.
"We want--Roger! The man shouted.
"Pull him out of the car!" ”
A young Negro was dragged down from the front passenger seat, screaming and piercing silence.
Fortunately, the horrific scene of July 22 was just a repetition.
But when the "Roger" was putting a noose around his neck, almost all the spectators gave a real gasp.
Since 2005, civil rights activists have returned to Moore Beach Bridge, recreating the scene of two black couples-Roger and Dorothy Sil Malcant, and George and Meyres Dossi-who were lynched in 1946 by the Ku Klux Klan.
No one has ever been charged with murder.
"Although we know who they are, and although we have seen them in the community, none of them have been arrested in the past few years, which is unbelievable," said Thiron Brooks, who helped organize the replay.
"It is a stain of history, a burden on our souls." ”
Brooks is 71 years old and is a former Georgia State and lifelong activist.
For him, repetition is a remarkable call for action, reminding the people of the Monroe community every year that injustice has never been rectified.
"We want to sue, we have to close, we want to heal, we want reconciliation, but we have to get justice first," he said.
"Unless we have justice, we will not be cured and reconciled." ”
On July 27, 1946, the coroner covered the body of a victim of a Moorish lynching with a sheet.
More than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding counties were suspected of lynching, according to the FBI files obtained by NBC News.
But none of them has been prosecuted.
Although the suspects have been at large for decades, civil rights activists say the double motive for lynching is well known throughout the town: Politics and sex.
A Supreme Court ruling in April 1946 allowed Georgia State black citizens to vote for the first time in the primaries later in the summer.
At about the same time, according to the FBI, Roger Malkom, a black tenant, killed a white landlord in a struggle Bannett Herst-it looked like a woman.
Brooks says the town is rumored to be Hearst sleeping with Malcolm's wife Dorothy, and her baby is not her husband's.
The Federal Bureau of Investigation said July 25, 1946, the prominent white landlord Loy Harrison spent 600 of dollars to bail Malcolm out of jail.
Dorothy and the cousins Mai Merri and George Dorcy accompany him to the prison.
But when they came back from the prison and quickly arrived at Moore Beach, a group of lynchings surrounded the car.
"It turns out that it was Harrison who ordered and executed the murder," an FBI report concluded.
"It is clear that there is a conspiracy between state and local law enforcement, not only in the murder, in destroying the evidence, but also in concealing the identity of the witness." ”
Brooks is very concise.
"It was a vote-right tragedy," he said. ”
"They were brutally killed, and the murderer sent a message to the Negro in the community: ' If you sign up and vote, you'll end up the same way." '”
For nearly a decade, Cassandra Green has been responsible for the annual recurrence of the massacre of the Moorish beach Bridge.
Her expressive methods are vivid and gripping, with a deep racist background. Many people hope that this racism will no longer exist in the United States.
It's hard to see, it's harder not to look, but Green says that's the point.
"We don't want to talk about lynching, because lynchings make us face the ugly side of everyone," she said.
"But if you don't listen to me, or if you don't hear me tell me about my experience, I can't build a relationship with you." ”
This year's show began in June with nearly 30 actors-more than 10 whites, the rest of them black-huddled in a room and listened to Green's release of a rehearsed performance overview.
Wede Malbau as Green's joint director.
For years he has played the role of the Ku Klux Klan, but he says the role is never easy.
"I feel dirty because I am not such a person," Malbau said.
"But I think it's important to keep this history alive because we don't want to go back to that time." ”
Room, playing Roger Malkom and Bannett Herst actors Darios Bradshow and Nick Rascona rehearsing their lines.
At the beginning of the scene, Malcolm shouted and pushed Hurst, angry at him for sleeping with his wife, Dorothy.
"I said, get the hell out of my place!" ”
Rascona back to the road.
Then they hit it.
Then everyone (at least all the black actors) broke out laughing.
Green laughs best.
"What's wrong?!" , "Rascona asked.
He was alarmed and puzzled.
Did I play too much?
"No," said Green with a smile.
"I just think the white man won't say ' ah ' when he comes back." ”
"Yes," quipped another black actor.
"Your tone must be tough. ”
In this way, the energy in the room changed, and the feeling of fraternity drove off the discomfort.
Everyone tried to do so, not only to perform the scene, but also to commemorate the four victims.
The scene begins again.
This time, Rascona said this "ah" word, the tone is sharp and powerful.
No one laughs.
The repetition came to a swift and forceful conclusion.
Screams, gunshots, and then, silence.
A woman in a funeral black dress stood by the actor's body, singing Billy Har Billie's Mourning word "strange Fruit".
Her voice pressed over the other words.
100 yards away, about 40 spectators kept wiping their sweat and tears.
The audience of blacks and whites accounted for almost half.
A couple came to see the show from Ithaca, New York, and a lot of people lived near the road.
Brooks took them to Malcolm and Dorothy's Cemetery to worship, and for nearly eight hours, everyone was suffering from the uncomfortable heat of Georgia.

American media: Scientists at China Air Force Engineering University study laser satellite to remove space junk
The Chinese scientists have proposed a bold and innovative proposal to use large lasers to clean up cluttered Earth orbits, destroying old satellites and their sky trash, according to the January 18 news network.
According to the United States Newsweek website January 15 reported that researchers at the China Air Force Engineering University wrote a paper entitled "Space-based Laser clearance of small-scale space debris orbital models", which describes how space debris can be irradiated by lasers into smaller, less damaging fragments by using space-based platform lasers.
The report says that over the years, space junk has been a concern for international spatial agencies, and NASA has considered a variety of options for tracking, detecting and removing man-made debris.
The way to clear large-scale space debris includes giant nets used to clean and collect waste, and magnets that can be used to suck them out of orbit. Chinese scientists have conducted a laser simulation study, drawing the following conclusion that this will be an effective way to clean up the Earth's orbit.
"(Simulation research) provides the necessary theoretical basis for the application of space-based platform for laser clearance of space debris," the paper said. ”
The 2014 study by U.S. defense giant Lockheed Martin found that there were about 200 threats per day for satellites orbiting the orbit.
High-speed debris along the Earth's orbit is seen as a serious threat to future space missions, described by European Space Agency experts as a "deadly chain of threats". Over the past year, high speed debris has continued to increase.
According to the U.S. "Mass machinery" monthly website reported January 17, space is basically empty, but next to the Earth's space increasingly crowded. Every satellite we send into space will eventually turn into another piece of debris that moves around the earth, and these fragments accumulate over time.
The more debris there is, the higher the chance that a satellite will be hit by fragments, damaging or destroying an investment worth millions of of dollars.
Reports say all space agencies have plans to clean up debris in the future.
NASA is considering using jet gas to reduce debris, leaving it out of orbit, and Europe is considering launching a satellite carrying a large net, capturing debris and bringing it back to Earth, with Japan's idea of capturing debris with an electric chain.
Now, China has also proposed a solution to the space junk, which is to use a large laser to turn the floating space junk into a less harmful piece of debris.
Installing such a laser on a satellite would be effective enough to clean up space, at least according to the simulations, according to a group of researchers at the China Air Force Engineering University in a paper published in the German journal Optics.
reported that the only way to prove effectiveness is to test, there is no such task, but perhaps sooner or later someone will install the laser on the satellite and send it into space.
Once we do that, we can finally start to eliminate the problem of space junk once and for all.

They were in separate rooms at the ESPN office in Los Angeles, the undefeated World Boxing Council lightweight champion Garcia took the lead down the corridor to greet the world Boxing Group's Machenco champion Luo.
At the Showtime boxing match in Saturday, the referee unanimously found that Garcia defeated the four regional world champion Adrian Brona to win, and thus, the two fighters have become the same heavyweight list of the top five players.
Garcia stretched out his right hand and said: "Champ, how are you?"
Good luck. ”
In the ESPN game at 7 o'clock in Saturday, Luo Machenco defeated Miguel Mariaga and saved his position.
When their two photos were taken, Machenco's agent Eguise Klimas pointed out that the potential showdown between the two players depended on the "perfect size".
"I was lightweight before," Garciati said.
"I raised my level to fight Blorna (140 pounds), but I didn't weigh that much," he said.
My weight is almost 140 pounds.
I want to go back to lightweight.
And he has to be lightweight (135 pounds) before we can play.
That's what fans want.
Then we'll meet them. ”

"We are the main figures.
It is impossible for others to have such a large degree of attention.
As long as they are ready ... "

But Luo Machenco is hesitant about Garcia's praise, saying he thinks the three-zone champion from Riverside looks "slow." I'm sorry, McGee. You're going to be eliminated. ”
The point, Garcia says, is to show the strength of the fist and then the boxing.
They all say they can feel the momentum of their boxing game.
"It's a battle that has to be done,
Attention and Heat are not the same as other boxing competitions.
I'd love to compete, "Garcia said.
Luo Machenco said: "I have been waiting for the top fighters, this time to Mai-ji."
It's going to be a great battle. ”

Swedish asylum-seekers age assessment test latest results released
Swedish asylum-seekers tested the latest method to assess their age in medical terms, and the latest results showed that more than 80% of subjects were judged to be over 18 years old, but not everyone believed their accuracy.
The Swedish National Center for Forensic Medicine (R?ttsmedicinalverket) started the test earlier this year.
After the alleged failure to accurately assess the age of some of the refugees claiming to be minors, the Swedish Immigration Authority (Migrationsverket) designed these tests to provide a more accurate age assessment during the asylum process.
So far, the Swedish immigration agency has sent 6880 testers, and the Forensic Medicine Center has now released the results of a total of 2,481 testers from mid-March 2017 to July 31.
80% (2002 persons) were judged to be 18 years of age or above, but in another 25 cases, the Swedish National Center for Forensic Medicine decided that subjects were "likely to be 18 years or older".
In 432 cases, the result was that the person was "probably under the age of 18".
Tests are only for people who have questions about their age.
These results are consistent with the results of previous months, according to John Gransen of the Forensic Science Center.
He told The Local: "This data is not much different from the data in previous months, and the numbers are very consistent." ”
The high proportion of cases judged to be over 18 years old does not necessarily mean that these asylum-seekers are falsely lying about their age.
The centre published 581 test results in May and said 442 cases "indicate that the subjects were 18 years of age or older".
Svenska Dagbladet, the News newspaper, surveyed the results of 581 cases and found that 243 of them had publicly indicated that they would be 18 years old this year.
An X-ray examination of the wisdom teeth, an MRI scan of the joints, and an analysis of the results by dentists and radiologists are also being questioned in some areas.
One of the sceptics is Claude Marcus, an endocrine biologist at Caroline College, whose work involves assessing people's biological maturity to determine whether they have experienced puberty before or after normal age.
He told the News newspaper Metro: "I have reason to think so, and I don't think that's the way it should be measured."
In this way to determine the physiological age is not accurate.
If we can't guarantee accuracy, we should not pretend we can do it. ”
However, Gransen of the Forensic Science Center defended the accuracy of these tests: "It is generally said that the risk of determining a child as an adult is small." ”
The biggest risk is that this person is just under 18 years of age, which accounts for about 10%.
The governor of West Virginia State announced a change of party
In late Thursday, Jim Justis, the Democratic governor of the West Virginia State, announced at President Trump's rally that he would change his party.

The rally erupted with cheers.
"So tomorrow, I'm going to change the party membership to a Republican," Justis added.
"As a coach, I'm going to tell you it's time to start another game," he said. ”
Trump promised to make a big announcement earlier at a rally in West Virginia State.
Mr Trump won 42% of the Virginia State in West, while Justis did not support Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
According to Forbes, Justis was named the state's only billionaire in 2016.
Forbes noted that he inherited his father's coal industry and owned coal in five states.
At present, he is worth about 1.59 billion dollars.
At the same time, the Republican National Committee issued a statement late in Thursday saying: "The change of Governor Justis is another blow to the Democratic Party, which will not prevent our country from becoming great again, but it would make our country great again." ”
"The Democratic Party currently has only 15 governors, and the number of controls on the state legislature is at its lowest level, and Governor Justis's statement is the latest rejection of a political party that has lost leadership and is unable to find a positive unifying slogan," The Republican National Committee's Chairperson, Lorna. In a statement to CBS news, McDaniel said.

He said he was also "delighted" that Russia had accepted the criteria for a new entrant.
"I think this is a very constructive day and I think we have made some progress, but the IAAF General Assembly supports the Ad Hoc Group's recommendations and it is not time to resume Russia's eligibility," the department said.
"We need to do what we can to normalize the situation over the next few months," he said.
Our guiding principle has been to keep clean athletes out of contaminated systems, "he added.
19 Russian athletes meet the IAAF's stringent standards and will compete as neutral players in the Friday World Athletics Championships in London.

What is the impact of the financial rules of the football world on Neymar's transfer to Paris (Neymar)?
The rules aimed at preventing European giants ' clubs from spending without restrictions will not hinder Neymar from Spain's Barcelona club to France's Paris Saint Germain Football Club (PSG) at record prices.
The result is a further downgrade of the Paris Saint Germain football Club by the European Union of Football Associations (UEFA). UEFA is the governing body of European football matches and has the right to ban teams from participating in the Champions League, which is widely watched.
The 2011 UEFA Financial Fair Competition rules (FFP) mean that the Paris Saint Germain football Club must eventually prove that Neymar's transfer is funded without causing huge losses.
The Barcelona club has already paid 222 million euros (262 million dollars) to pay for the Brazilian player's severance, and Neymar's salary will be as high as $ tens of millions of a year.
Here are some of the financial implications of Neymar's transfer to France.
Given that the team's money comes from the rich and rich Qatari ruling family, the Paris Saint Germain football Club can, of course, sign Neymar with cash and incorporate him into other star-studded teams.
Clubs can spend huge sums to buy players, but they have to use legitimate sources of income to make up for the huge sums they spend and to achieve a break-even in their football-related businesses.
The Financial fair competition rules were conceived by Michelle Platini (Michel Platini) after her election to the Uefa presidency in 2007.
The former French player believes that for a club that is saddled with debt for success, if banks or everyone withdraws their support, they are actually cheating and placing the club at risk of destruction.
In 2011, the rules ' focus shifted from the club's debt problem to the club's monitoring of loss status.
The change means that the business model used by Roman Abramovich to buy a Chelsea club in 2003, buying a potential club and then spending a huge Roman on improving the team and building a global brand, is now facing a tougher situation.
The club may lose € 30 million in the three-year rule assessment period up to 2018.
Although Abramovich was disparaged by the presidency in 2015, Saifore, Aleksander Ceferin, the UEFA successor, remains committed to preventing excessive spending.
"Of course the rules have not lapsed, and we will certainly strengthen future regulations," Andrew Traverso, who is responsible for the rules in Uefa, told The Associated Press last week. Andrea Traverso.
Although the Paris Saint Germain football Club will lump out the Neymar buyout clause at once, it can also be allocated for accounting purposes within the term of the contract.
Neymar has signed a five-year agreement, so the transfer fee may show up to € 44.4 million in an annual account for the next five years.
The first wave of rules imposed in 2014 brought the most severe sanctions on the Paris Saint Germain football Club and the Manchester City club of Abu Dhabi.
The Paris Saint Germain football club was fined € 60 million (at the current rate of $82 million), then reduced to 20 million euros and asked to reduce the player to 21 in the Champions League in the 2014-15 season, rather than the normal 25 players.
UEFA is eyeing clubs that seek to increase revenues by hooking up with club owners to deceive financial regulators.
Although Qatar's companies can sponsor the Paris Saint Germain football Club, Uefa will not see it as a legitimate income if the sponsorship amount is considered to exceed the standard market price.
This is what happened in 2014, when Uefa ruled that the Qatar Tourist Board's sponsorship of the Paris St Germain football Club was exaggerated.
It is reported that Neymar's income in the Paris Saint Germain football Club may have come from the 2022 Qatar World Cup organizing committee payments.
But the Paris Saint Germain football Club and the organizing committee deny that Neymar will be the World Cup ambassador, and it is easy for Uefa's regulators to make such a move.
The recent sanctions imposed on the Paris St Germain football club mean that Uefa will be more vigilant about any attempt to circumvent the rules.
In Thursday, people familiar with the matter said UEFA had not discussed the transfer of Neymar with the Paris Saint Germain football Club.
The above-mentioned persons contacted the Associated Press only anonymously, as they were not authorized to discuss the status of the Paris St Germain football Club.
The last published accounts show that the Paris Saint Germain football Club's operating income in 2015-16 was € 542.4 million, earning more than € 10 million.
The accounts for the previous fiscal year have not been published.
The Paris Saint Germain football Club is expected to bring the Gospel of sponsorship, franchise and jersey sales to Neymar.
The club is expected to increase its revenues by at least 30% per cent after signing the Neymar.
It was clear that the Spanish union was furious at seeing the most famous player leave, trying to block Neymar's move and claiming that the Paris Saint Germain football club violated the rules.
Javier Buss, the Spanish league president, told Spain's newspaper as saying, "This is a clear example of a ' financial stimulant ', the club and the state are the same," referring to Qatar, which has final ownership of the Paris St Germain football Club.
The Arsenal team (the club's owner is the US sports tycoon) manager Arsene Arsene Wenger (Arsene Wenger) has reservations about the state-sponsored club's attitude to the Spanish league.
"This is the consequence of ownership, which has completely changed the entire ecology of football over the last 15 years," Wenger said in Thursday.
"Once the country has a club, everything happens."
This would make it very difficult to comply with the rules, because there are many different ways or interests for a country to require big-name players to represent a country. ”

"Toofo biography" from the Chinese traditional culture in the Han Dynasty huainan Wang Liuan story, derived from the "Liu An do tofu, due to the wrong" of the traditional allusions, tells the protagonist "Bean Fuk" from a bean into adult form, overcome difficulties, adhere to the Fairy dream story.

Nostalgic appeal popular market-"ha-camp" and "Detective double-Male"
Retelling the story is to miss the actors in the 80 's scenery years and the 90 's garbage age (David Wehn and Michael Repair for MTV production sketch comedy "Country" before and after); At the same time nostalgia itself, the memory of the 2001; Before that year, such as Elizabeth Banks, Amy · Boyle and Paul Rudd wants and many other stars have yet to wind up.
As a kind of cultural works of art, it is our face Book era of permanent Memories of imitation and embodiment.
But as a series, it feels like time is not enough.
"Camp first Day" after the broadcast of the strong response, but this is not only because of its absurd humor (the plot is about a can talk of canned vegetables, the original story by H. Joen Benjamin dubbing).
The storyline doubles in the use of the core terrier--the middle-aged actor plays a child of age--making it a part of the joke that it's impossible to go back to the past.
In the decade after, adults actually act as adults, the mood is not too deep-rooted, the imitation is more undisciplined, including the 90 's to follow the film improvisation, such as "The cradle of the hand."
At some point, a character is stuck in an apple notebook, some straight skates and "Something else for 1991 years".

As always, the best part of this series is to interject.
It was especially interesting to see this forever young Mr. Luthor, who showed off Matt Diron's soul patch in the movie "singles", and Andy now feels like a giant in the "Campus giant".
It's a random, crazy moment that might be driving the movie, like the Recursive "life of Seven Years" series, until I think the logical conclusion: "Ha-summer camp: 20 years later," It's the last scene is to let the card department to see the "Ha Camp" film premiere.
At the same time, Amazon's "Detective duo" tells a different nostalgic content: The Cold War revival of the "American Mission Dream", the film "extremely Cold City", and even the East and West wrestling image of the "GLOW: Gorgeous Women wrestling League."
The comedy, created by Blaine Guettes and Alexandro Tanaka, was pushed by the director Riss Thomas on the TV screen: A pair comedy, set in Romania in the 80 's, about two Bucharest officials fighting for truth, atheism and Marxist-Leninist lines.
The main characters-the hard Grigore and idealistic Aiseve-were played by little Florin Pilszy and Cornelio Ulich, whose dialogues were dubbed by Chaning Tatum (also executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt in English.
This is a wonderful idea.
But it's not just an idea.
There are some good visual gimmicks (the police are playing chess in the TV game because Americans like to play football).
And there are a number of celebrity dubbing actors-including Jenny Sch, Nick Offman, Mahsalahasbaz Ari and Collo Sevigny-to create a wonderful sound event.
But the "Detective duo" is so committed to creating a noisy, lifelike propaganda comedy--a killer with a Reagan mask--and it usually plays that role.
The six-set-long TV is slightly tardy and the comedy effect is not released quickly or frequently.
The detective duo, who was more rigorous in editing, had a better Aiseve when Gregor and the United States Embassy repeated visits to the U.S. embassies, because there were always two fat men in the embassy lobby who devoured a stack of hamburgers.
For the imagined communist audience, this message means that Western culture can throw anything into material to revel in.
The creators of this fictional story of Romanian fiction are not wrong, and we will even use our modern history and their history to tell the story.
Reporter recently learned that the Northeast steel, rail transit, shipbuilding, machinery manufacturing and other industries benefit generally decline, and even loss.

The Bank of England will maintain a 0.25% interest rate
The Bank of England will announce at a later stage that interest rates will remain unchanged, after weak economic growth and loose inflation have dashed hopes for a rise.
The Bank of England has issued a warning that economic growth will continue to be "weak" as it controls interest rates while tightening household incomes.
Policymakers at the Bank's Monetary policy Committee (MPC) voted 6-2 to keep interest rates at 0.25%, and this month a handful of members called for higher interest rates, even though weak economic growth has weakened the upward boost.
In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank of England narrowed its growth forecasts for 2017 and 2018 to 1.7% and 1.6% respectively, warning that household income tightening would continue and that inflation would soar to nearly 3% in the autumn.
But it says in the next few years it will need to raise interest rates to curb inflation from Europe, while borrowing costs may need to rise more sharply than expected in the financial markets.
A large economic promotion policy was implemented a year ago by the impact of the euro-de-Europe, and members also voted to withdraw it.
The Bank of England will announce a halt to its regular financing plan to provide cheap money to banks starting next February, although the bank says it now needs to add another 15 billion pounds on the basis of 115 billion pounds.
In the record of the interest rate decision meeting, the Bank of England said: "In the MPC's core forecasts, gross domestic product (GDP) remains weak in the near term, as real household income tightening will continue to depress consumption." ”
With regard to interest rates, the bank has repeatedly reiterated the need for "certain monetary tightening" to quell inflation and to demand "a greater degree" than the market expects.
The market is expected to achieve its first growth in the third quarter of next year, the second time in 2020.
But the bank stressed that any increase would be "slow" and "restrained".
Growth forecasts for the bank this year and next are on a downward trend, compared with a May forecast of 1.9% and 1.7%.
The bank maintained a forecast of 1.8% growth in 2018.
Sterling fell against the dollar and the euro followed.
Sterling fell 0.5% per cent against the dollar, to 1.31, and 0.4% per cent to the euro, to 1.11.
Before the decision to remain unchanged, the rising expectations were dashed by recent gloomy growth figures. GDP grew to 0.3% in the second quarter, compared with 0.2% in the first three months.
The bank said growth in the third quarter was likely to remain at 0.3%, although the end would be slightly higher.
The Bank of England's latest inflation report did not bring good news to the average family, which has been hit by an inflationary boom, which says it will get worse before it gets better.
Monetary policy "cannot prevent" a blow to revenue over the next few years, but wages are expected to recover "massively" at the end of the three-year forecast.
At the same time, the economy will be stimulated to offset the effects of some of the lower consumption because sterling is devalued and demand for British goods has risen sharply.
A year before the decision was made, the stunning EU referendum allowed Sterling to plunge, with interest rates down to 0.25% in August.
The Bank of England reckons it could take four years to have a full impact on prices and the UK economy.
Before the bank announced its latest interest rate decision, interest rates were rising, as inflation exacerbated the already stressed average family, while three policymakers called for an increase in interest rates to 0.5% in July.
Inflation retreated from 2.9% in June to 2.6% last month, although the Bank of England said it was expected to rise again in the next few months.
The bank says its target of 2%, more than its part, is already the bottom line of the weak pound.
Andrew Montrec, director of Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: "Given the recent fall in swap rates, the mortgage market appears to be becoming more competitive again, as lenders are strongly calling for more business and are looking to take a positive stance for this year's perfect ending."

Britain's National Health Care System (NHS) controversial HIV drug green light
Patients will be able to receive "transformative" HIV prevention treatment from September after the High Court has settled on the provision of drug aid to the NHS.
NHS England has announced that prophylactic drug use before exposure (PrEP), a medication that can be taken before sex, has been shown to reduce the risk of infection in high-risk populations by about 86% per cent. The health service will now provide the drug to the estimated 10,000 people through a preliminary three-year trial.
It agreed to provide funding for the trial after the Court of Appeal last year supported the decision of the High Court. The ruling says the NHS has the right to pay PrEP, although the NHS claims local authorities should fund the drug.
The Thursday announcement was dubbed a "major new intervention" by Simon Stevens, chief executive of the British NHS, and the National Aids Trust (Simonstevens) described it as a "critical moment".
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Shffield will be the first to register sexual health clinics. More clinics will be added in October, followed by a full implementation in England in April 2018.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is an HIV drug that is taken prior to sexual intercourse to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
The results showed that PrEP could significantly reduce the spread of HIV among people at risk of infection.
Taking PrEP before sex means that there are enough specific drugs in the body to prevent HIV infection.
The drug can be taken two hours a day or before intercourse.
Those eligible for treatment include homosexuals, bisexual males, transgender people and HIV carriers who are not successfully treated.
The clinic will identify participants who are eligible and agree to the trial, including men, women, transgender persons, and whether their sexual partners are HIV-infected and who are not known for antiretroviral treatment.
People who live and register with a general practitioner in England can also sign up for their local sexual health clinics.
The plan will cost 10 million of pounds, while the NHS England branch has signed a contract to procure the drugs this week after international competitive purchases.
The experiment aims to assess the full potential of PrEP by collecting clinical evidence on how it is positioned, absorbed and implemented on a large sample basis.
"This major new intervention should be a broad and increasingly successful complementary and reinforcing role in HIV prevention," Mr. Stevens said.
This is another milestone in more than 30 years of action worthy of progress in addressing the major health challenges of humankind. ”
"This is a crucial time to fight AIDS," said Dipora King, chief executive of the UK's AIDS Trust Fund.
If it does target people who are in need and at risk, preventive medication before exposure offers the possibility of changing the UK's AIDS epidemic.
Starting in September, the HIV high-risk population will be funded through the NHS, in England, to acquire a new, licensed tool that can truly be implemented alone and without consultation with partners, which will lead to improvements in the lives of many people.
We are in favour of this announcement. ”
Ian Green, chief executive of the Terence Hopkins Trust, said: "The first task now is to make sure that the trials are pushed across the country quickly and that none of the people infected with HIV can fall."
Now that we have purchased the PrEP test drug, we are ready to protect more than 10,000 people at high risk of HIV. ”
"After months of delays and the government's procrastination, PrEP's first start was very popular and should have come early," said the shadow public health minister, Sharon Hodgson.
The evidence suggests how the drug can change as part of our approach to preventing HIV and spreading the deadly disease.
The experiment will give us a further and fuller understanding of the advantages of PrEP.
It is important now to launch this pilot nationwide to protect people exposed to HIV and to help us further end the spread of HIV in society. ”

High-quality life: the use of attic and ingenious design, will be the Earl's Palace small apartment building as a spacious home
Joannie Rey, a former banker, was keen to renovate her house, and in 2014 she moved from a big house in the Knightsbridge to a small apartment in the Earl's Palace.
The apartment is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne's terrace--a powerful proof of the new design that Joanne has not packed her bags to sell.
"Before that, I lived with my ex-boyfriend in a bigger house in Knightsbridge," Joanne said.
"I was looking for the right house with the quote.
I saw this apartment in the Earl's Palace, and it had a high ceiling.
I'd like to make an offer on the same day. ”
The 1,000-square-foot apartment has now been thoroughly overhauled since the first time the house was viewed.
The apartment was originally a very complex single room--needed to walk through the kitchen to the bedroom--and Joanne wanted to increase the storage space and the attic to make full use of the ceiling height.
"I want high ceilings, big windows, plenty of light," he said.
That's what I'm asking for, "she said.
To this end, she hired Ervain Azadillay from the duck&shed Building and design studio (located in Notting Hill) to build a home with a 12.5-foot ceiling. This family is not only a development project, but also a place where Joanne lives.
The ceiling is not high enough to add up to two spaces, so the building challenge is to create an attic that is sufficiently high for people to stand.
Ervain must play creative thinking in order to solve this problem.
"The steel structure is quite complex," he explained.
"We have to arrange the space so that it is displayed up and down without a shrug," he said.
Not only to build a simple platform so simple, but also to start these steel, so that it is in the appropriate height of the implementation function. ”
With this arrangement, Ervain can get two tall rooms in the space--which can add a lot of interesting elements.
The attic uses the retro bronze windows of the Retrouvius brand to overlook the fascinating living area.
The mirror-equipped gold furniture, silver small pieces of furniture and Serge Mouille retro lighting laid the whole style.
The use of mirrors plays an important role in increasing the atmosphere, space and light.
Put a mirror on both ends of the short corridor to make it look longer.
In the kitchen, the splash board with a mirror is like a window to another room.
In the entrance, the small lattice fitted with a mirror provides a storage space for Joanne to store cutlery and glassware.
The beautiful living room has a fascinating sense of space that can be put away when the kitchen is not in use.
The folding kitchen is not new.
But the unique feature of this folding kitchen is a garage-type lifting door.
"This involves some engineering knowledge," Ervain, explaining the reinforcement of the laminate door.
"It's a balancing principle, so it's easy to slide when you push the door," he said. ”
With its ingenious use of space and storage, Joanne gained an additional 16 square metres, a bedroom and an improved layout.
"In the end, you're selling the size of your house--or your property valuation is based on the size of your house," Ervain said.
"Basically, the realtor will walk into the room and calculate according to the floor size." ”
They will try to increase space and use high quality materials, thus giving the space a sense of luxury.
"The material is selected by you personally, so it helps create emotional bonds at home," says Ervain. ”
"You won't love the power on the wall.
These things are important, but they do not fasten your heartstrings. ”
It turns out that by making good design and adding extra area, standard apartments can be shaken to make you marvel.
In fact, you might as well have chosen to stay with Joanne.

Two brothers staged 500 million dollar real estate empire battle
40 years after the founding of his Italian family, the two brothers fought for the war in one of Victoria's largest real estate empires, worth more than $500 million.
Colin de Lutis, director and developer of former Carlton Football Club, lives in a mansion in the Rutis, where three of the doors are his brother Paul's residence. The latter sued the Supreme Court for the division of their real estate and operating assets.
Since 2014, Paul has been hoping to break away from the family business, but the two brothers had a heated debate over the division of assets in the Supreme Court.
The two brothers, together with their mothers, owned 38 real estate, worth more than 500 million dollars, which were accumulated since the family bought Smith Street in 1973.
There, the family created the Westco Jeans company and gradually developed it to 160 retail chains.
1999, the company sold at a price of 85 million dollars.
After that, the money was put into real estate. At present, the Rutis family's portfolio includes city offices, Brunswick and Sorrento development projects, Gold Coast and Le Hill Apartments, and suburban shopping malls.
According to an agreement with his late father, Colin, whom his brother Paul called the "main catalyst and dominant character" of the de Rutis family, has about two-thirds of the company's assets, while Paul accounts for about One-third.
The documents submitted to the Tribunal stated that, after conversion, Colin owned property worth 316 million of dollars, while Paul owned property worth 176 million dollars.
Finishing-off that the real estate and cash split proved to be the crux of the negotiations.
"Colin's proposed division of property has left him what I think is the best property," he wrote in a 2015 affidavit in the first court.
In Friday, the Supreme Court held its first hearing after several failed mediation sessions.
Now, the two brothers are still vying for control of the existing business, and Paul says Colin has kicked him out.
Colin denies it and accuses Paul of failing to manage some real estate.
In an early affidavit submitted by Colin, he expressed the hope of settling the dispute.
"My Italian tradition determines that the family is the most important option." My Italian lineage determines the family is the most important, "he wrote.
The costs of the case are rising, and there are hundreds of of pages of affidavits, e-mails, and top law firms such as Deloitte, pitcher, Charter Keck Cramer, Allan, etc. and the company report submitted by a senior lawyer hired by both parties.
Ms. de Rutis and her late husband, Luigi, were immigrants from Italy. They started running public food and deli stores since the late 1950s and bought a store in Brunswick in the early 1970s.
They used collateral to buy Colin Wood's property, where Colin opened the family's first jeans shop.
Colin said, "When I was in my senior year," where he founded Westco, "Paul was still very young (about 10 years old)." ”
Anna de Rutis says she and Luigi, who died in 2012, want to be able to pass on their belongings peacefully to their sons.
"Luigi often told me that he would never want his brothers to end up in court," she wrote.
The other two brothers, Mark and Luke, were no longer members of the De Rutis group, and Colin said that Mark had paid him 10 million dollars and paid 26 million dollars to Luke when he left the company.
Paul said that both Luke and Mark were "dissatisfied with the terms of their property split".
According to a biography published by Eddie McGuire, a television star, in 2015, although Colin was a board member of the former AFL club, he kept a low profile.
"Fairfax Media" contacted Colin and Paul, as well as their lawyers, in Friday.
However, only Colin replies via SMS. He said that because the case had been submitted to the court "I really can't say too much." ”
"My brother Paul chose to sue me and bring our family affairs to court, which is very, very sad," he wrote.
In 2016, Colin wrote in a court document that he had tried to meet his brother's demands.
"Our father does not want to see Paul and I end up in this dispute," he said, adding that he "remains hopeful about the settlement of the dispute." ”
In the Friday, the hope seemed dashed.
"Our problems will be resolved in the near future through the courts," Colin wrote.

Trump's new chief of staff plans to limit the president's media time
Other people have tried, but failed.
John· F. Kelly may really be able to do that.
If so, he is the first person.
The new White House chief of staff is planning to limit the flow of information to President Trump--including news media reports--to keep big bosses more stable, according to Politico, the US political news website.
Here's a quote from reporter Chosh Dausi:
"When the new White House Chief of Staff John F. When F. Kelly began his first day of work with senior officials, he pointed out that he was going to address one of the main issues of President Trump's arrival in the White House: bad news to the president.
Kelly told the officials that receiving good information would help the president make better decisions, so the information needed to be made available to him-both in writing and in the form of briefings.
Kelly's diagnosis looks like a model, but others have tried to tame it by watching Trump's media time, but they ended up failing.
President Trump's addiction to television has been long-and now the White House, his habit of watching TV is still deepening.
In February, former campaign advisor Sham Naberg told Politico: "If the candidate Trump is frustrated with unfair reporting, it will be helpful to let him know that he has received positive reports in credible channels."
Politico's Tala Palmeri wrote, "according to the experience of six former campaign officials, the habit of controlling Trump's Twitter focus is to ensure that the media messages he receives personally receive a certain amount of praise." ”
This is no problem at all.
But the idea that Trump's Twitter habits have been "controlled" is laughable.
Perhaps these campaign officials know something we don't know-that Trump's Twitter will even get more angry if it doesn't intervene.
We may never know Trump's not sending those tweets.
If his staff were able to save him, even if only a few times, their efforts were worth it.
But no one has ever been able to stop Trump from controversy.
Part of the problem is that in a White House made up of competing groups, people preach their worldview by submitting information that may be reliable or unreliable to trump, and to promote their careers.
politico--is all about the story--in May, the consultants ' penchant for providing dubious information to the President was reported.
This is an example of a reporter Chene Goudman described:
"The current and former Trump official said that Trump's reaction to the negative news clips, such as volcanic eruptions, especially the damaging information leaks, would be frantically trying to find out where they originated.
At the end of February, there was a hostile cyber-inciting molecule Charles F. An article on C. Johnson's website, gotnews.com, was copied to the president, accusing the deputy chief of staff Keti Vols as "the source of a lot of information leaks" at the White House, as Mr Trump did.
Even if Johnson had been permanently banned by Twitter for harassment, he had not provided any concrete evidence, and he had blown up a lot of false quality control, and then openly denied it.
Trump read the article and began to ask the officials about Walsh. ”
The then chief of staff, Reins Pribas, and White House secretary Robert Potter "tried to set up a system to manage and record the files that Trump received," said Goodman.
What's the result?
Kelly is going to do the same thing in three months.
He may prove himself to be more efficient than Pribas, but Trump is still the Trump of the impulse, and his assistants are still competing against each other for influence.
These timeless factors will make Kelly's task even harder.

The occupants negotiated the ditch and returned to "Regal Street"

The "moat" dug by the municipal authorities did not prevent the occupants from taking the horses, holding the baby and leading the caravan, and returning to their homes in May.
The sleek and sophisticated team found a gap in the line of defense, though there was a way to pass without roadblocks, but their vehicles were squeezed in through the gap.
Angry residents criticized the Soliher Committee (Solihull Council) for "poor performance in dealing with the problem".
A resident who declined to be named said: "They arrived there in the evening of Monday, before coming to Bentley Heath Street and throwing stones at passers-by."
The Committee should be ashamed of what they do because they are simply worthless in dealing with the problem.

Italy takes a tough stance on NGO immigration rescue ships
Italy's Non-governmental organization, which operates an immigration rescue ship in the Mediterranean, has warned that they will not be allowed to continue with the rescue if they do not sign new operational regulations.
"If NGOs don't sign new codes of conduct, it's hard to see what they are going to do," Interior Minister Marco Minnetti told the News of the Turin daily. ”
The day before Minnetti issued a warning, Italian officials had suspected that the crew of a German aid group, "youth bailout", had actually colluded with traffickers to help illegal immigrants to detain them.
The aid group only runs for one year and refuses to comment on the specific allegations of the Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.
"For us, saving lives is and will be the most important thing, so we regret not being able to operate in the search and rescue areas," the group said in a social media statement. ”
"After all the information has been collected, we can now only assess all allegations and situations." ”
Italian officials have been monitoring the iuventa of the youth rescue organization since October.
The crew was suspected of carrying traffickers who had come directly from the boat, and allowed smugglers to flee hastily and recycle the ship.
According to the prosecutor's documentation, at least one such meeting was allegedly taking place at sea 1.3 miles from the coast of Libya. The contents of the document were published by the Italian media.
Its crew was suspected of blatantly ignoring the Italian Coast Guard Authority, which oversaw the rescue operation in the area out of humanitarian zeal and not any other motive.
According to the code of conduct, Iuventa and other vessels clearly require an Italian police officer to oversee their activities on board the ship.
Currently, of the nine non-governmental organizations involved in the search and rescue operation, only three have agreed to comply with the code of conduct, namely, the Save the Children, the Pro-activa immigration assistance station in Malta and the Spanish Open Arms.
The latter said in Thursday that it considered the new provisions to be acceptable, although not necessary, since they did not bring any "significant changes and impediments" to their rescue operations.
The organizations that refused to sign were Nobel Prize-winning organizations without Borders (MSF).
Meanwhile, Minnetti says the number of immigrants arriving in Italy in recent weeks has plummeted, suggesting that efforts to strengthen the Libyan coast Guard and to unite local mayors have begun to bear fruit.
The minister said: "In recent days, we began to see the dawn at the end of the tunnel." “
He unveiled plans for a deep meeting this month to discuss economic development with the Libyan mayors, and to discuss with Chad, Niger and Mali How to reduce the number of migrants who want to leave these countries for Europe.

Michelle Carter (Michelle Carter) was sentenced for sending text messages to encourage Conrad Roy to commit suicide (Conrad Roy)
A Massachusetts woman was sentenced to 2.5 for inciting her boyfriend to commit suicide by texting and calling.
Michelle Carter, 20 years old, will be serving a 15-month sentence, and can be suspended after expiry. Plus a probation of 5 years.
Carter was sentenced in June to the murder of Conrad Roy (Conrad Roy) for wilful manslaughter, which committed suicide on July 13, 2014.
"My family is heartbroken," Roy's father said in a Thursday hearing.
My son is my best friend. ”
Carter was allowed to remain in liberty while awaiting appeal.
She faces up to 20 years in prison, but her lawyers believe both she and Mr. Roy are mentally ill.
In sentencing, Carter stood, wearing red trousers and a beige blouse, his hands clasped, eyes tearful, eyes downward.
"Her actions killed Conrad Roy," the prosecutor told the court.
"She ended his life in order to live better for herself."
She was not responsible, "the prosecutor said.
"She didn't have any remorse. ”
But Carter's lawyer said it was "a terrible consequence and she felt very regretful." ”
However, the judge of Lawrence monies (Lawrence Moniz) said he did not find her "age or maturity, or that her mental illness would have any significant impact on her behavior." ”
A prosecutor read a statement from Roy's mother, Lynn Roy, and said, "I have not had a day to grieve over the loss of my beloved son."
I hope he will be proud of me and what I have done. I am trying to stand with his sisters in all of my pain, and the pain will be with us forever, "the statement said.
Mr. Roy's sister, Camdyn Roy, testified that she was "in a trance" because she realized she would never be able to attend her brother's wedding or become the aunt of her children.
"It is a pain to lose a man who has been with me since I was born, and I will spend the rest of my life with this pain." "she said.
The case seems to have created a legal precedent, since the Massachusetts law does not provide for the instigation of others to commit suicide.
In 2014, Roy was found dead in a car with carbon monoxide poisoning; Carter was 17 years old.
Carter's message revealed that she had encouraged him to commit suicide after the case sparked nationwide attention.
"Hanging, jumping, stabbing yourself, there are many ways." "She was on vacation with his family," she said in a number of messages sent two weeks before his death.
At the time before he committed suicide, she wrote: "You need to do this, Conrad," "All you have to do is start the generator and then you will be free and happy." ”
Judge Monize said Carter passed Mr. Roy's death to gain attention and ordered her not to profit from the case through any media.
There is a legal disagreement in this case.
Amanda Knox, one of the few defenders of Carter's defense, was accused of murdering her British roommate in Italy in 2007 and was acquitted two years later, Amanda Knox.
"Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help, not jail," says Ms. Knox, 30, who wrote in a column in the Los Angeles Times. ”

Carmakers face shocks, Audi to retrofit up to 850,000 diesel vehicles
The day before Audi's announcement, BMW said it would provide software upgrades for more than 350,000 vehicles.
BMW's Chairman said BMW believed that "driving has more intelligent options than restrictions," meaning that major European cities, including the BMW headquarters location Munich, consider banning or restricting diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced in Tuesday that it would retrofit 3 million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions.
None of the companies claimed the move as a recall.
European carmakers are aggressively promoting the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to help meet carbon emissions regulations.
But the nitrogen oxides emitted by diesel engines are considered carcinogenic and may cause asthma.
The cost of installing equipment to offset diesel emissions is also increasing, making it difficult to maintain the price competitiveness of diesel vehicles.
As German carmakers face scrutiny, the government, led by Angela Merkel, the chancellor, has been accused of too much indulgence for the mighty car companies and has overlooked the signs of the problem.
The car companies are trying to avoid a repeat of the common mistake of disguising their use of so-called failure devices, adjusting emissions when they test cars to comply with regulations, and returning to normal driving conditions.
A number of senior executives have been charged in the US and other executives are being surveyed by countries on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former head of thermodynamics at the Audi engine Development department was arrested in Germany.
The former manager, Zachero Giovanni Pamio Italian, is not protected by extradition and may face trial in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi was involved in a German criminal investigation involving the public, and the German government accused Audi of installing a system to escape European emissions requirements, expanding the scope of the investigation previously confined to the United States.
Audi's investigation could have a big impact on the public: luxury carmakers have a disproportionate share of VW's profits.

Mexico is in danger, journalists are killed
All staff in the RIODOCE weekly meeting in Wednesday to review their reporting plans for the riots in the state of Tin-Romania, which were caused by criminal organizations, corrupt officials and endless drug wars.
But today, the shadow of tragedy hangs over them, and they come together to discuss security issues.
It is important that they be told to change their daily habits.
Two senior journalists discussed which were more secure: whether to take their children to the Office (where the office was hit by a grenade in 2009) or to leave them at home.
Security experts wrote three words on the blackboard in front of the room: enemies, neutrals and allies.
They let the reporters list names under each column--without evidence, observation and intuition.
There are drug traffickers, politicians, businessmen and journalists suspected of being on the government list, or cartels, which make Mexico's reporting work dangerous.
Violence never stops, the national corpses, and more and more journalists: according to the Committee on the Protection of journalists, at least 25 journalists have died since President Enrique Nieto in December 2012, and 589 journalists have been federally protected after being attacked and threatened; so far this year, there have been at least 7 Journalist died in 7 states.
The last one died was their editor and source of inspiration, as well as co-founder Havier Valdize Cadenas of Riodoce.
Valdez wrote a lot of books about drug violence, he wrote in one: "The biggest mistake is living in Mexico and becoming a journalist." ”
Everyone can feel deeply that he has left, although he is everywhere--a huge picture hanging on the front of the Riodoce office building, Valdez with the middle finger, the word "justice"; Allen Ivarra and Miriam La Mures, the more than 30-year-old journalist, wore a T-shirt that showed his smile, He wears glasses or his iconic Panama hat.
The seminar was held less than two months after his death, with journalists discussing their common traumas, nightmares, insomnia and paranoia.
Although a special federal prosecutor's Office was established in 2010 to deal with journalists ' cases, according to the Committee on Protection of Journalists, the office only prosecuted two persons.
Most of the thousands of criminal cases each year involved drug trafficking and organized crime, so few perpetrators of the killing of journalists could be brought to justice.
In "Riodoce", they insisted on reporting the violence in the state of tin, though they were heartbroken, though the land was riddled with holes.
Ibarra said there was no information about the killers and no justice was done, so it was not much use to hold security seminars.
"It's stupid to waste time attending such seminars," he said.
As long as we don't know why, you don't trust anyone. ”
On the morning of May 15, Valdez left the RIODOCE office in the capital city of Culiacan.
His red Toyota, which was only a few blocks away, was stopped by two men, who forced him off the bus and fired 12 shots, speculating that it was the name of the newspaper, "12 rivers."
The scoundrel drove away in his car and crashed it in the vicinity.
Valdez is 50 years old.
His wife and two adult children were left behind.
Culiacan rumors are rife.
But the topic of Valdez is actually nothing but silence.
Since Guzman was arrested last year and extradited to the United States in January, the state of Zion has become the bloodiest battleground in the country, with hostile forces fighting wildly.
One or several people have been shot and killed every day on the streets of the state of tin, and the cemetery is filled with two magnificent tombs of drug lords, which are commonplace.
The temporary forgetting of "calm" is a time when only one cartel controls the coastal State and its ports and drug routes to the United States.
Even so, even though Valdez is acutely aware of the dangers of the job, the 60-Year-old co-founder and director of Riodoce, Ismail Pohoqui, is guilty of not protecting his friends.
He believed that two mistakes had caused the tragedy.
First, a Damaso Lopez interview was published in February, which led to the Carter Group, which was fighting with several of the Boltzmann sons.
The report may have angered the sons, who were bought out by suspected gangs as soon as the newspapers were sent to the newsstand.
The second mistake was not forcing Valdez to leave Mexico for its own safety after another newspaper that reported the same story was confiscated.
Valdez is a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his death is of great significance to Mexico's violence against journalists.
His spirit endures, and his friends and colleagues believe that he is with us all the time.
2003 he was also "Noroeste" senior reporter, when he joined five colleagues founded the "Riodoce", sold 50 U.S. dollars of shares.
In the state of Pohoqui, "it is impossible to go to journalism without dealing with the drug problem," he said. ”
With the passage of time, the newspaper won a good reputation for its bold and honest reports, and sales and advertising increased.
Journalists like to be able to publish investigative reports without fear of censorship, and readers like newspapers to publish stories that others dare not report.
"Riodoce" was founded five years later won the Latin American National Maria Moscapo News Prize.
In the same year, the Association for the Protection of Journalists awarded Valdez International Press Freedom Award for his courage in pursuing the most authentic Mexican drug report.
He confessed he was scared too.
"I want to stay alive," he said, as he was awarded an award by the Society for the protection of journalists. ”
Later in October, he said in an interview with local TV Rompeviento TV that "drug trafficking is a way of life in the state of tin,
You have to take on the task of falling on your shoulders as a journalist-either, or dumb.
I don't want to be asked ' What have you done in the face of so much death ... Why aren't you right about what's going on? ’”
"Riodoce" All staff are very Miss Valdez, miss him like a dock workers curse endlessly, miss this never stint hug and advice friend, Miss this know how to survive teacher.
They are dependent on his habits.
He used to wear that hat.
I often go to the El Guayabo bar opposite the office and always sit on the same table.
Now, they ask: is his daily habits causing his downfall?
His death also made it necessary for them to think about how to do a good job and live well.
Pohoqui says, "They don't like the trouble you give their women and children, and they don't like the legal company you're affecting and the secret airport that's used to transport drugs."
These all crossed their bottom line. ”
The result is a high degree of self-censorship and self-protection, even in the safest of times.
Believe in your intuition.
If you smell the dangerous breath, hurry away.
"The problem is that breath is a feeling of being deceived ..." said Riodoce, editor of the Andres Villarille. And then something like Javier would happen. ”
He and others have said that the previous rules no longer apply to tin--just as no longer applies to Estado De Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Estado De Guerrero and other states, where the smuggling routes are lucrative and the institutions are tiny, government officials corrupt and foul.
The situation is constantly changing.
Mobile phones were suddenly not allowed in the room where RIODOCE employees attended safety training; a few days ago, spyware, allegedly sold only to the government, had been used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.
Outside, two policemen cool under the shade of the tree to avoid the high temperature of 104 degrees (40 degrees Celsius).
They were sent by the state government to protect the Riodoce office, located in a four-storey building in the middle-class block of Culiacan.
Some reporters joked about not knowing whether the police would belong to the governor's own 50%.
Journalists have been to the mountains for months, where drug cartels are under real control.
This week's "Riodoce" mainly reported three events.
One of the great ex-boxer Julio Seissar Chavez brothers killed in Tin State,
And the disclosure of government funding from the governor's home,
And the kidnapping of an expensive restaurant in Culiacan, which is only a block from the prosecutor's office.
The authorities did not release information about the abductions and abductions, so it was tricky to write down what the city knew: that the restaurant was a place where drug dealers and officials loved to go.
A journalist who learned from public records that the restaurant was registered in the name of a politician of the ruling Revolutionary Party (PRI), which dominated all political classes almost throughout the last century.
Recently, several of the PRI's governors have been accused of corruption in several highly regarded cases.
Villareal asked reporters to write a story about what happened at the site, including a son of Mexico's biggest drug lord, Guzman, who avoided a military attack.
If a few months ago, readers would look at Valdez's column to find the most powerful message about the kidnapping.
Villareal, a 46-year-old man, said "skinny," because he was thin, saying "we already knew what had happened before."
Now all of our sources of communication have been cut off.
Valdez's office is now being used to store signs and stickers protesting the killing of journalists, as employees become what they never wanted to be: activists on behalf of the media.
The next morning, reporter Miriam La Mures grabbed a sign and walked out of the room to the local prosecutors ' office to attend a parade related to another journalist.
Salvador Adame disappeared in the west of Michoacan, Estado De three days after Valdez was killed.
Authorities found a charred body and said it was his body, according to DNA tests.
Nationwide, journalists have become more outspoken, organising protests and painting "Save the Media" on sidewalks and buildings.
This day, director Pohoqui is not in Washington, he is trying to justice for the Valdez case, for international support.
The day after Valdez was killed, in a meeting with the Governor of the state of tin, Ramirez complained about the official spying on reporters and killed them because they had told the truth.
Since her anger has affected her objectivity, she has also asked to resign from the government office.
Valdez has repeatedly reiterated that Mexican journalists are "surrounded" by organised crime, complicity in government officials and an indifferent society.
In his last book, "Drug journalism," he wrote that journalists were not only being mutilated by drug cartels, but were also on the list of politicians and security forces in cahoots with organised crime.
The media watchdog group, Articulo 19, blamed police and public officials for more than half of the press attacks last year.
"In Mexico, they let you die just to shut you up," Ramirez said. ”
Apparently, these murders are chilling.
No one forgets that six years ago, Bo Maria Elizabeth Massias died in the northern edge of the tower of Maori.
Beside her body was a note allegedly signed by Zetaskater: "I came for my story." ”
Her skull was cut off, with a computer keyboard and headset beside it.
, after Miroslava Brech was killed in March, some newspapers opted to close, such as the El Norte newspaper on the northern border of Chihuahua, Estado De.
Others continue, and the directors of El Manana of Nuevo Laredo were killed in 2014, but they continue.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juarez used a front-page press to talk openly about the drug cartel, which was titled "What do you want from us?" ”
Some journalists have fled their hometowns, or even left the country.
It's a tough decision.
It is difficult to find jobs in exile, and they still need to be cautious and wary of danger in the streets.
Sometimes they are arrested, allegedly in 2015 when photographer Ruben Espinosa was killed in a Mexican city and four women after fleeing Veracruz three months later.
For those who remain behind the scenes, this is a routine step in the high-risk decision making process.
Ibarra, who once wanted to be a poet, admits he was terrified of reporting the drug trade.
He said, "Mexico is becoming hell, so I became a journalist." ”
A recent Friday midnight, the latest issue of the newspaper has been printed, "RIODOCE" editors sitting in the hallway outside the office drinking beer, suddenly, their mobile phone rang.
19 people have been confirmed dead after a series of shootout between gang-hostile forces and security forces near the beach resort city of Mazatlan.
The war is still escalating, as the series of cartel information found in the region indicates.
They put the news on the website of "Riodoce" on the roadside by mobile phone.
The headlines for the next day had to be changed.
Sirens sounded nearby-a shootout in the area.
Pohoqui glanced at the policemen standing there guarding them to see if they were alert.
If they have a little bit of fear, they don't show it.
The founder of the newspaper has been killed, and in his large portrait, his middle finger points to the whole of the riodoce, and the staff of the "Man of the land" follow his footsteps.
Pohoqui said: "How can you even want to close it?" On the same day that Javier was killed, the intern asked me to send her to the street to participate in the report. ”
China self-driving tour 2020 market scale or breakthrough trillion yuan
[Abstract] In the context of consumption escalation and the prevalence of free travel, self-driving is encouraged by national policies and more and more consumers love.
But at the same time, the potential to break through the trillion-scale self-driving tour market is also facing a double challenge.
In the context of consumer escalation and the prevalence of free travel, self-driving tours are encouraged by national policies and more popular among consumers.
But at the same time, the potential to break through a trillion-scale self-driving tour market is also facing a double challenge, on the one hand, the development of the driving tour industry and the market demand is not directly proportional to the self-driving tour club and travel agents, such as self driving tour organizers are facing a meager profit dilemma; On the other hand, the infrastructure and services facing the self-driving tour are still at an early stage.
The total number of domestic tourism 60%, market size is expected to break the trillion
2016 annual domestic tourism 44. 400 million people, self-driving tour occupy the total number of domestic tourism 60% or so, by 2020 self-driving tour market scale is expected to break through the trillion.
According to the statistics of the number of motorists travelling in China, the number of tourists traveling in the past five years has continued to increase, and the number of travellers has stabilized more than half of the domestic tourism population.
At the same time, regional and national levels have shown more concern and support in the emerging field of self-driving tourism, with the introduction of policies and regulations related to self-driving, caravan and camping trips from 2016 to 2017.
July 2017, the National Tourism Administration, the national sports government and other eight departments issued the "Auto Driving campaign Camp development Plan", the same month, the NDRC, the Ministry of Finance and other 14 departments issued a joint "promotion of rural tourism Development Upgrading action Plan (2017)", self-driving tour was highlighted.
The introduction of the policy, for domestic self-driving tour development provides opportunities and policy guidance.
Self-driving club profit meager, complete industry chain is the key
Although the domestic driving tour market has great potential, the national policy is actively guided, but the driving parade industry is still in the initial stage.
According to the "2016-2017 China self-driving tour annual Development Report" shows that domestic self-driving tour club, car Club, Chi You and so on to reach thousands of, but the tourist self-help arrangements for the proportion of self-driving travel is accounted for most of the participation in the car club, self-driving tour clubs and other institutions of all types of tourists accounted for only about 15%.
At the same time, independent research and development of self-driving tour products online travel companies and traditional travel agencies are also very few, many online tourism platform is only sold by some vendors to provide self-driving tour products, some self-driving tour club is also an important supplier.
From the organization self-driving tour activities, covering the "Eat, live, travel, tourism, shopping, entertainment," a number of aspects, a high degree of fragmentation, upstream supply chain heavy, the randomness of tourist consumption.
Beijing Line World Auto Club founder and CEO Li Guanjie that self-driving tour club in essence and travel agencies are similar, the early main profit model is based on offline activities, the core point is self-driving line products and tour leader services.
But now the driving tour in the field of the product homogeneity of the same quality, the team leader's service level is uneven, self-driving tour club faces the need for another transition.
It can be seen that the self-driving tour itself is not an independent industry, but the displacement characteristics of its own drive to form a trans-regional, industry ecological circle, the formation of a complete industrial chain is very important.
Experts point out that, in addition to basic tourism consumption, experience is a more important element of consumption.
Therefore, for self-driving travel industry development, should enhance experience characteristics, the development of "self-driving Tour +" theme as well as the IP of self-driving products.
Scenic road is not only the road, the car camp should not only meet accommodation
In the face of the rise of self driving tour, the basic supporting development of driving tour is also relatively elementary.
Li Guanjie pointed out that the tourism landscape is not just a road, but the need to transport and tourism elements are integrated in the inside, but the road repair and travel itself is responsible for the two departments, the transport sector to increase tourism elements, but also stay in the construction of toilets, advisory centers, publicity bar and other facilities, and the combination of tourism is not high.
Compared to the well-known self-driving tour route "America 66 Road", the construction experience is worth to draw lessons from.
Landscape design is no longer the most direct and quick path between the departure and destination, instead, it follows the design concept of "experience driving pleasure", which provides the best enjoyment of the scenic scenery along the road, which can link the point-shape and surface-shaped tourism landscape, preserving the historical and cultural values of ecotourism resources along the route, can also hold various thematic activities to enhance the participation of tourists and recreational experience, to create economic benefits for local tourism.
In addition to scenic road, the camp is also an important supporting facilities for self-driving tours.
But the Beijing News reporter knows about the self-driving tourists, the choice of accommodation in the camp is not many consumers.
They believe that many camps in favor of the basic construction, can only meet eating and living, the grade is not high, product single, can not meet the driving tour this contains a lot of elements of the demand.
People in the industry, who declined to be named, said a few years ago to do camp a lot of enterprises are to take the land, after the last supporting infrastructure construction and services are not to keep up, the operating situation is a lot of losses, and there is no late infusion of funds, it is difficult to do some corresponding ancillary products.
Consumer groups
According to the 2017 data released by China National Tourism Association, the driving group is concentrated at 21-40 years of age, especially the 31-40-Year-old, which has a certain economic base, and the demand for personalized tourism is higher, and more for parents.
From the accommodation survey, the driving group of tourists prefer non-standard accommodation.
From the self-driving tour type, the peripheral self-driving is the main type of self-driving tour, accounting for 84. 32%.
Outbound self-driving is a lot of people yearning, but the proportion is still small.
At the same time, with the promotion of consumer demand, the past like to drive the "tourist attractions" of tourists began to change the concept, no longer in the course of the journey "off the bus to take pictures, get on the bus to sleep", but more attention to travel experience and process.
Dinosaurs used camouflage to hide from their enemies.
At first glance, it's scary, but it looks like a statue.
The researchers released the first study of the incredible fossil fossils found by Canadian miners, pointing out that the fossils were well-preserved, so experts called them "the Mona Lisa of the Dinosaur World".
The fossil is well preserved and can even be judged to be reddish-brown in its scaly skin color. This suggests that it has had some "disturbing experiences".
The report in the journal Contemporary Biology describes it as "the most well-preserved armored dinosaur ever discovered, and one of the best dinosaur specimens in the world." ”
The fossil is a newly discovered type of nodule that lives in the middle of the Cretaceous period from 110 million to 112 million years ago.
The state of preservation was extremely good and shocked researchers, who described it as "truly breathtaking".
The herbivorous armored dinosaur fossils are the most well-preserved dinosaur fossils ever found, according to National Geographic magazine.
March 21, 2011, Sean Fink found the fossil at the Shawn Funk in Alberta, Prov., Canada, near Fort McMurray in the north.
At the time, he came across something that seemed quite different from the rocks around him, so he decided to look at it carefully.
The fossils he discovered were then sent to the Royal Thai Paleontology Museum in Canada.
It took the researchers 6 years to expose the beast inside a 2500-pound (1100-kilogram) clod.
After such a hard work, the final results are now published.
"If you qu your eyes, you'll almost believe it's sleeping," said Caleb Brown, the Royal Swiss Museum scientist and first author. The creature is on display at the gallery.
"It will become one of the most beautiful and well-preserved dinosaur specimens in the history of science-the Mona Lisa in the Dinosaur World." ”
The researchers looked at their skin and found that the herbivores, though clothed in armour, are like walking tanks, but are likely to be subject to a major threat from the carnivorous dinosaurs.
The heavy-armor dinosaur uses red and white camouflage to evade predators and uses a covert technique known as "anti-Shade", which is also used by many modern animals.
In this way, experts say, it is better able to blend in with the surroundings to avoid the enemy, suggesting it is prey to larger dinosaurs.
The 110 million-year-old creature, a member of the Dragon family, was first made headlines in May and is currently on display at the Royal Thai Paleontology Museum.
Mark Mitchell, a museum technician who is one of the team members, took 7,000 hours to uncover the beast's veil, and the researchers now study it and name it "Borealopelta Markmitchelli".
The samples were kept in perfect condition, allowing Dr Mitchell and the team of international scientists to record the scales and armor patterns and shapes on their bodies.
They found "anti-shade", a common defense in the animal kingdom, which means the creature's back is darker than its side.
Although "anti-shade" is common, the findings are surprising, as the dinosaurs are much larger than the existing animals that use the shadow-shading technique.
The dinosaurs, faced with the pressure of being hunted by carnivorous dinosaurs, evolved in a favorable direction, allowing them to hide in the contest as a means of survival.
However, most of the extant animals, such as deer, zebra or armadillo, are as small and vulnerable as prey, suggesting that the creature faces real pressure to survive.
"The massive heavy-armor dinosaurs suffered from wild predation showed how dangerous the Cretaceous predator dinosaurs were," Brown said.
Chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also indicates that the dinosaur has a reddish-brown skin color.
Scientists are continuing to study the life clues of the creature, including its preserved stomach contents to find the last food to eat.
They believe that dinosaurs fell into the river at the time of death and were then washed into the sea and then sank back down to the bottom.
At the time, the Alberta, Prov. climate was as warm as the climate of the southern Florida State today, and the rivers and seas might be deeper inland than they are now.
"The knot is truly stunning because it is completely covered by the preserved scaly skin and, so far, preserved in the dimension so that its original shape is preserved," Brown said. ”
"So the species now has almost the same shape as the Cretaceous.
You don't need to use too much imagination to rebuild it; If you look at it qu, you'll almost believe it's sleeping. ”
The Cretaceous period was a time when two-legged dinosaurs roamed the earth.
Although Tyrannosaurus rex was the King of dinosaurs, it appeared millions of years after the armored dinosaurs. Armored dinosaurs may have been killed by some of the ancestors of Tyrannosaurus rex.
They include the high Spike, a giant beast weighing 6 tonnes, 38 feet (11.5 meters) long.
A new study finds that scientists in the journal Contemporary Biology believe that the nodules were washed into the sea after the death and formed mummies in the soil.
March 21, 2011, Sean Fink dug up the creature at the Millennium Mine near Fort Mike, Alberta, Canada.
According to the museum, it is the world's most well-preserved armored dinosaur, from the nose to the buttocks of the area of skin and armor, etc. are complete.
The creature, on average, is about 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighs 3000 pounds (1300 kilograms).
It has two 20-inch-long, pointed horns protruding from the shoulder.
The researchers believe that the herbivorous armored dinosaurs were active in the western region of Canada and then washed into the sea by flood-breaking rivers.
However, the dinosaurs were buried at the bottom of the sea to keep their armored intact.
The fossil remains of this particular specimen are kept intact, keeping the remains of the skin still covered with rugged nail fragments on the dinosaur skull.
As Michael Greshko, Greskau, wrote in the National Geographic magazine, this preservation is as rare as a lottery.
The more I looked at it, the more incredible it was.
Remnants of the skin are still covered with mottled armor on the skull of dinosaurs.
Its right forefoot is positioned on its side, with five toes expanding upwards.
I can count the tablets. ”
The reporter learned that the natural or plant source of seaweed acid, the application of humic acid and amino acid synergist in urea production process can modify the traditional urea to increase the efficiency, the formation of urea, zinc humic acid urea, corn-urea nitrogen utilization rate than ordinary urea increased by 5%-10%.
Environment-friendly, the potential for crop yield is obvious, especially the large particle value-added urea is BB fertilizer high-quality raw materials.
The total number of security personnel is one-fold higher than that of the 2012 London Olympics.
To ensure the safety of the Rio Games, Brazil will launch the largest security linkage plan ever.
Earlier, the Brazilian government said a total of 85,000 people from the army and police would be fighting together, including 20,000 soldiers and 65,000 policemen.
Most of the soldiers will be responsible for defending the Olympic venues, and the 3,000 new soldiers will be responsible for security at international airports, subways and streets.
Police patrol other parts of the city, including subways, buses and streets.
It is reported that 6,000 soldiers have arrived in Rio for the Olympic security services.
Apart from being responsible for the four major arenas of the Rio Olympic Games, they are also responsible for patrolling the airport and the main roads connecting the airport and the Olympic venues.
The introduction of the service industry evaluation mechanism is not new, in order to make the evaluation mechanism effective, it is important to make regulation more efficient, not a mere formality.
How activists learn to answer the question: "Whose streets?" ”
August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrer in the heart of a bewildered uneasiness.
On the first day of his trip to New York, the Saint Louis sits in love and rents his bed and browses Facebook on his mobile phone.
She stumbled upon a post by a high school student.
"The police just killed a 18-year-old child and the child was lying on the street," it says.
She found it confusing that no one else posted the message on the feed. She closed Facebook and turned on Twitter.
A @TheePharoah user keeps pushing her to the dynamic times.
Saint Louis Region's rapper live Twitter live honourable Michael Browne's death event. Honourable Michael Browne, an unarmed 18-year-old black man, was beaten to death by a white policeman at Missouri State Ferguson.
He posted a picture of Brown's lifeless body lying on the street, his body lying on the street for four hours.
"Crazy," Ferrer thought.
But for her and her community, death is nothing new.
She put down her cell phone until the same night to turn on Twitter again and read about the crowds on Canfield Avenue.
Photos of police footage and people yelling, and a picture of someone claiming to be Brown's father, said: "Ferguson police have just killed my unarmed son!" ”
She saw a live feed message that a policeman stood with a barking dog in front of a group of protesters.
In another video, she said, another policeman raised his rifle and screamed: "I will kill all of you ... Animal. ”
"It's not normal," Ferrer recalls.
"This is not what we take for granted, it can be called a typical murder event." ”
At that moment I felt a shudder.
I was angry and I was crying. ”
She booked a return flight and went home the next day.
After landing 11 o'clock in the afternoon, she picked up her 6-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided to go to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened to Ferrer and Ferguson over the next three years was a new documentary on the August 11 at the cinema "Whose streets?" "The subject.
This is a story about survival and protest, love and loss, strength and tenacity from the perspective of people who live in this community and are filled with the need for answers from the streets.
Ferrer and her daughter (wearing a floral dress and a crown accessory) drove to Ferguson, and the two discussed the countless topics they had discussed before that morning-"about black experiences and black conditions".
"Do you remember when I taught you that blacks had to fight for their faith?" "she recalls.
"We're going to go to Ferguson now because the police killed a 18-year-old boy, which is wrong," he said.
I had to take her, "Ferrer said later.
"What happened today is everything in the past ... Climax.
She wants to know, see, and rise from the matter.
She needs not only to develop well in radicalism and organization, but also to understand the different dimensions of black experience and black conditions, and to understand what we must do to be free and liberated.
Even though I was fortunate enough to offer her a racist experience she had not personally experienced, she was no different from any other black girl.
If I protect her on this matter, I think I'm hurting her. ”
They arrived at Ferguson's first stop at a venue opposite the South Flori Mulberry Road police station. The site became a camp for militants who waited until police officers Darren Wilson eventually refused to prosecute.
Ferrer and her daughter contacted a local business owner who had bagged lunch.
They prepared a bag to pass the bag to the protesters.
Slowly, Ferrer began to form a new kind of activism.
"My radicalism changed completely after August 9," she said. "At the Missouri State State University Saint Louis, she was the president of the National Association of Nursing Students of the minority, focusing on food justice and health disparities in the black community."
"I have no organizational experience.
That's how it all came to be. ”
A few weeks later, Ferrer met with the film's joint director Sabach Foleyan in a night parade.
Foleyan said she and her photography director Lucas Albarrado Faller "Just want to record" what happened.
Ferrer has a question in mind: "Do you want to record or to find a story that you can use?" ”
The suspicion stems from the many cases in which people-usually whites-enter a community to derive benefits from their pain and tenacity.
As Foleyan explained in a recent interview, "We heard that the people who were born and bred in Ferguson did not focus on their voices, and we wanted to do it in a different way." ”
Foleyan has contacted Daimond Davis, the joint director. Daimond Davis is a regional artist known for its activism against dead prisoners.
His involvement led Ferrer to join the other six locals in "Whose streets?" "The project team has been around for years after the shooting of Brown.
"This documentary isn't about someone talking to us or talking to us, this is our speech." "Davis said.
"I'm mainly concerned about how these people are presented, because that's how I'm presented," he said. ”
Although the goal is not to focus on Ferrer's experience – but to show that the movement is "not about the Savior leader, but about community cohesion", Foleyan says – she is the most open to film participants.
result, "Who's the street?" "It's amazing to note the personal life of Ferrer, like falling in love and getting married."
"I feel naked," Ferrer laughs when she sees the finished product for the first time.
"But I understand that it takes a certain degree of vulnerability to do this work and to humanize the Negro." ”
In addition, Ferrer's story reaffirms and repositioned the role of Black queer women in the broader black life events movement.
Two of the three founders of the campaign – created #blacklivesmatter in social media after the black teen Trevonn Martin shootings in 2012 – were identified as cool.
"The black people of the leadership have generally supported this movement," Ferrer said, "because we are fighting on multiple fronts."
Black people have to bear all of this. ”
Foleyan agrees and mentions that "the sport really has the support of black women and many of the cool children of blacks." ”
Because of her identity, Ferrer was chosen as the core of the film. However, she insists that "this is not an affirmative action for the matter."
"She is the one who inspires this energy," she said.
"Although she is on the front line, it is not a coincidence. Because at these crossroads of life, as a black cool child sex, you have a lot of things to do.

We must love each other and support each other.
We have nothing more to lose than the shackles of our bodies. ”

Similarities: Artists use the DNA of Chelsea Manning (Chelsea Manning) to create portraits
There are many faces in the center of the Friedman Gallery in New York: White, Black and brown, with almost imperceptible similarities between each face, which are tied by strings hanging from the ceiling.
The 30 portraits were created by artist Heather Dewey Hagburg (dewey-hagborg) using the cheek swabs and hair crumbs sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent hair crumbs from the Fort Livinworth prison for revealing confidential diplomatic cables through WikiLeaks, a former intelligence analyst sentenced to 35 years in jail.
The exhibition opens on August 2 with the title "similarities".
This is the result of two years of correspondence between Dewey Hagburg and Manning, Dewey Hagburg, who combines his discipline with his own technology, computer science and art, while Manning is a prominent dissident who has been jailed and completed a transsexual operation in prison. Former U.S. President Barack Obama pardoned her remaining sentences three days before the end of his term.
The algorithm was analyzed from Manning's DNA and created 30 portraits of "likely appearances". Hitherdow Habborg made a scathing and somewhat heartless remark. His comments are both a matter of the polymorphism of DNA and the concept of identity itself.
Manning's birth name was Bradley Edward (Bradley Edward), who openly admitted to thinking of himself as a woman at puberty. Convicted in 2013, involving 20 counts, including 6 espionage offences, computer fraud and theft.
In prison, her image was suppressed, with only a single photograph, with a grainy black-and-white photo, looking visibly disturbed, sitting in the driver's seat, wearing a platinum-gold wig.
In 2015, Hitherdow Habborg a great success in her 2012 project, "Stranger's Face (Stranger Visions)".
In that work, she uses the medium court evidence from cigarette butts and chewing gum, extracts DNA from the detritus, and creates a 3D portrait that may resemble looks.
That was an e-mail she had just received from Paper magazine.
"They want to interview Cercy Manning in prison and need a portrait," Hitherdow Habborg told the press at the opening ceremony.
Cercy Manning could not visit or take pictures, so they contacted Chelsea to ask if she was interested in making a DNA portrait.
So the artist and her imprisoned muse became impossible pen pals, exchanging many letters with each other in two years ' time.
They even created a comic book, "repressed Avatar," drawn by Shoili Kanungo. The comic book envisioned the president's future privileges to Manning, and she was able to see the exhibit in prison.
And Obama asked to release her in the days after the book was published. It may have been a coincidence that Manning had spent his seventh year in the Kansas military prison.
In addition, the exhibition also has another layer of meaning. Because of contemporary America, the Trump government has repeatedly declared war on government leaks and transgender soldiers, while looking for new, Twitter-like ways to foment fragmentation, which is to bridge such divisions.
Asked about all this special timing, Hitherdow Habborg said, "Anything happens for a reason."
In the artist's statement written on the wall of the gallery, Manning's oversized signature is below (the "I" in the name is drawn with a heart), calling for an end to "partisan strife based on gender, sexuality and culture." ”
On the opposite wall is her mitochondrial DNA sequence, with pencil twist and twist to write Cs, Gs and as symbols.
By including 200 letters (or nucleotides, each artist's complex scientific dictionary), Hitherdow Habborg hopes that by depicting these strangely similar portraits, they can be expressed in at least the physical structure of everyone.
"I want people to get out of this mess, our genome doesn't care who we are, how the open genetic data is interpreted, how subjective it is," says Hitherdow Habborg, whose 2007-year video, "False Memory", is on display.
"DNA data can tell us a lot of different stories, so this is one of the 30 stories." ”
The last piece in the exhibition, in a room, comes from a page in the previous illustrated novella.
Shows the American soldier with a megaphone and a pompous, diamond-shaped manning.
"When they make your speech stop, they win," wrote The wall.
"So, don't shut up." ”
"The content comes directly from a letter she wrote to me," said the artist from Philadelphia.
"I am afraid again, I still want to say." ”
Manning had not seen the exhibit himself, as foreseen in the comics, but when she did so, she would have her own portrait mask of DNA, like a group of protesters cheering in the center of the pavilion.
It was also purposeful, as with all the items in the exhibition, to the height of the genetic information she had written in pencil (5.2 feet, Manning's height).
"In the past, I put them on the wall, but I hope they feel like a bunch of people," Dewey Hagburg said of the portrait.
"But I want them to feel like a group of protesters following Chelsea, just as people protested to release her." ”
Northwestern University professor and Oxford University employee wanted for homicide
A Northwestern University professor and an Oxford University employee were later wanted and are looking for suspects nationwide, police said, after a man was found fatally stabbed in a Chicago luxury apartment.

Lesseme has been an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Deputy Director of the campus relations Department Allen K Kaubech said in an e-mail statement that Lesseme has now been removed and has been barred from entering the northwestern campus.
Kaubech said, "Now this is a criminal case, the authorities are investigating, Northwestern University is actively cooperating with the investigation work." ”
Warren is a senior finance assistant at Oxford University.
"We have been in contact with the British police and are ready to assist US investigative agencies as needed," a spokesman for Somerville College, Oxford University, said in an e-mail statement. ”
The statement added that Warren's colleagues were deeply shocked and hoped he would surrender.

Russian Deputy prime Minister Mutko said, "We will complete the World Anti-Doping Agency roadmap in the near future."
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitali Mutko said the implementation of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) 's remaining standards for the restoration of Russian anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) rights would not take too long.
"The implementation of the road map standards has been at a certain stage, and Rusada has been given the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD (UK Anti-Doping Agency)."
The WADA road map has been updated in this regard, "Mutko said in Thursday.
The remarks were made by Deputy Prime Minister Mutko when commenting on the second part of the World Anti-Doping Agency's road map compliance provisions. This section sets out criteria for the restoration of RUSADA rights and was recently published on the organization's website.
According to Mutko, the standard does not contain anything that might cause Russian concern.
He added, "Everything has to be announced and everything will be implemented."
The results will be submitted to the IOC [IOC] and WADA in the near future. ”
One of the criteria mentioned in the list, however, is that the Russian anti-Doping Agency must publicly accept the findings of the WADA approved by Canadian lawyer Richard Mackeren on Russian state support for doping in national sports.
Speaking of this matter, Mutko said: "We are investigating, our anti-doping system has undoubtedly failed."
All measures have been implemented.
But there is no national plan behind it, and we will not admit that there is no such thing. ”
Mutko's words responded to Vitali Smirnov, the head of the Russian independent public anti-Doping Committee.
Smirnov, who received media Russian outlet Rsport earlier in the day, acknowledged the problems of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency in the past, but added: "We have said on various occasions that the report contains contentious positions and provisions."
No one plans to accept the report unconditionally, "Smirnov said.
After the November 2015 doping scandal, WADA suspended Rusada's right to conduct doping tests in Russia.
But in June this year, RUSADA was allowed to plan and coordinate inspections under the supervision of international experts and UKAD.
In a visit to the organization's headquarters in Moscow in July, WADA Director-General Olivia Nagri said Rusada was "moving in the right direction" in an effort to restore its rights.

The ultimate shopping experience, the Business Circle shopping development New era comes
More than 10 years ago, our country is still in the seller's market overall, people's choice is limited, the demand is also limited.
But after 10 years of development, the market has already achieved a change from the seller's market to the buyer, now the taste of consumers become more diao, they are no longer satisfied with the simple "hand-pay" shopping behavior.
Therefore, how to let consumers get an extreme shopping experience is the real estate developers of the next competition point.
Among the many factors that affect the consumer's shopping experience, the shopping center has the most important influence.
See how urban construction people around the world pay attention to the shopping experience.
There are no two identical leaves in the world, no more than two identical shopping malls, a famous shopping center must have its own characteristics.
For example, Turkey's world-famous Kanyon shopping Center, its unique wavy design inspiration from the Grand Canyon (Canyon), so named Homophonic Kanyon, walking in the Kanyon of the minister's 200-metre walk as if exposure to the Grand Canyon.
In addition to the canyon-style design, there is also a large oval-shaped venue in the center of the shopping center, which is unique in appearance and often hosts special performances.
Because of the open platform design, visitors can walk on each floor to see the "Canyon" in the activities carried out, and have the effect of changing the scene.
And at home, there is China's first forest-style stroll in the consumer field of the Nanjing Forest Moore Commercial Street will be shopping and ecology, fairy tale perfect combination.
7000 square meters of Green Square, 3000 square meters roof water platform, the project is composed of 9 single buildings, the building between the sky connecting corridor, the overall sinking of the courtyard design, take the geo-chinars tree for the architectural epidermis, roof water rooftop, creating a forest-like feeling.
Into the forest Moore, like accidentally fell into Alice's adventures in the Rabbit Hole, climbed along the trunk will be built around the building, grass, clear spring, will bring people into the forest full of vigor and vitality.
There are also in Chongqing, Longhu to create a Kerry waterfront shopping district, Planning hundred business, plans to introduce more than 50 international top monopoly flagship stores, more than 100 international top brands and more than 500 well-known brands at home and abroad, to create a service industry agglomeration, the theme of a vibrant business center.
Not only that, Li Ka Waterfront shopping district will also integrate the ecological architecture, with the direction of Tod public transportation, the collection of fashion shopping, life service, catering, entertainment, education, sports in one, in bringing to consumers the ultimate shopping experience while also leading them to enjoy Chongqing unique "waterfront culture", shopping and water entertainment, leisure perfect integration.
It can be found that at present, some of the housing companies have been insight into the new city business track, and the industry said that this consumer experience as the center, how to combine shopping and experience consumption patterns will also be the mainstream of urban development in the future.
Now the business district is not only the distribution center of goods, more is the integration of art and culture, creative theme of the complex, but also bearing people's responsibility for urban living.
Therefore, in order to satisfy consumers to eat and drink one-stop material needs at the same time, to maximize the transfer of cultural and artistic multi-level spiritual needs, play livable residential needs, is bound to be the commanding heights of the future development of the business circle.
In Chongqing, Guo Xing's northern shore Jiangshan, is located in Jiangbei, near the Guanyin Bridge, a gathering of world business essence, the international giant around the ring, first-class brand gathered, and international fashion close to the connection.
Here step by step flourishing, gathers the world essence;
East of the original Jin Yue has a better shopping environment, east of the former Jin Yue near the South Ping business district, exclusive access to the West and even the country's leading four-storey three-dimensional traffic system, improve the comfort of shopping.
In addition, Hui Gong Road and Wanda Plaza two pedestrian street landscaping, landscape on the floor of the upgrade, planted about 300 trees, rebuilt 40,000 square meters on the floor to promote the South Ping business district image;
And Long Lake one, near Chongqing's first low-density waterfront business district---Lai Ka waterfront shopping district, surrounded by nine parks, the low density of commercial neighborhoods and the high level of openness make people more willing to stay, stop, and enjoy the fun of shopping, rather than being pushed forward by the crowd behind them, and actually realizing a "walking shopping ”。
Today's commercial competition will only become more and more fierce, how in the homogenization of serious market to kill a way out, to win the hearts of consumers in the future "shopping mecca" reputation, it is worth all the real estate developers to seriously think.
Only by differentiation strategy is far from enough, only those who really are the consumer in mind, anxious consumers, want consumers to think, to provide consumers with the ultimate and simple shopping experience of the developers in the storm is coming in the market to smile proud.
Of course, in the end I think the most happy is the people of Chongqing, with such a good shopping experience and business Circle, put 10 years ago no one can imagine today's prosperity.

These purchases will bring in 812 million logistics orders.
Whether it is the day cat network to buy a platform or Alipay payment platform, all belong to Mr Ma's Ali group.
Ten years ago, no one would have thought that the November 11 single youth out of the "Singles Day" subculture will be incorporated by the electric business, become the phenomenon of the "double 11" shopping carnival.
November 11, 2009, Alibaba first Use "singles Festival Big Promotion" marketing gimmick: no one to fall in love with you, then "single dog" come online to buy it.
The result is surprising, the day Taobao Mall ("Cat" predecessor) turnover exceeded 52 million yuan, is the daily turnover of 10 times times.
Since then, "Double 11" has become Alibaba to create a shopping carnival, from the beginning of the domestic buyers to entertain themselves, to now the influx of global merchants, nine years later, the cat "double 11" billion turnover is already 3,200 times, so that "black Friday" is far behind.
Follow the cat "Double 11" promotional, there are many electric dealers, of which "Jing Dong" the strongest.
"Jing Dong" has its own shopping festival "6.18", but there is no "double 11" impact, this year from November 1 to 11th, "Jing-dong" cumulative sales reached 127.1 billion yuan.
and "Double 11", followed by a similar "double 12" Discount Carnival, Christmas and New Year shopping schedule.
Across the new year, waiting for Chinese consumers and Spring Festival before the purchase schedule, Valentine's Day shopping schedule, consumption, will not be a holiday.
The instantaneous massive consumption brings the environmental question, has caused the professional personage and the organization attention.

Is Liu Hua, director of pollution control at the East Asia division of Greenpeace, told Chinese and foreign dialogues that this year's "double 11" cat orders will produce 160,000 tons of packaged rubbish.

Express Company has been aware of the express industry caused by environmental pollution can not be belittled.
Including Suning, some of the electrical business Logistics Enterprises "Double 11" before the release of reusable plastic express box can be reused for shopping bags and garbage bags, such as recycling bags, but the trouble of the consumer acceptance is not high.
Mr Ma also called on the logistics industry to support "green packaging" and "Green logistics" in micro-blogging.
This micro-blog has harvested more than 68,000 "praise".
What kind of mobile payments do Germans want?
Zhang Dongfang: The move to pay off in Germany is not expected.
Micro-credit payment and Alipay but the battlefield moved to Europe, the competition has not changed, the seizure of positions have not changed-Chinese, this is also a globalization?
Where there is Alipay, there must be a micro-letter payment.
According to the agreement with Deutsche Electronic payment service provider Wirecard, the micro-letter payment was officially launched in Germany this November, and gradually in the European-wide business layout.
Two "villagers" of this foreign reunion occurred in Europe.
All along, Alipay and micro-credit payments are singing all the way through globalisation.
For the globalization of China's mobile payments, Eric Consulting "China's third party mobile payment industry research report 2017" summed up to two: first, through strategic investment, experience output, share and support foreign domestic mobile payment enterprises.
The second is to promote mobile payment service to foreign merchants through the behavior of Chinese tourists going abroad, and then to change the recognition and acceptance of China Mobile payment.
Indeed, the Chinese have the world.
China's rapid economic growth, combined with a large population base, is a tempting figure for Chinese tourists spending in Europe.
But this is doomed, this time in Germany, China Mobile to pay no expectations of the situation.
Micro-credit payment and Alipay just moved the battlefield to Europe, the competition has not changed, the looting of the position has not changed-or Chinese, this is also a globalization?
The more pioneering discussion is whether China's mobile payment can be opened in the European territory.
Take Germany for example.
The "new retail" that was enchanted.
Chen Shinlei, Yang Kaihan: When Amazon is squeezing into the world's top ten retailers to announce its foray into bookstores and grocery stores, the timing and motives are well worth pondering.
Amazon opened its first physical bookstore in Seattle in November 2015, and then opened two bookstores in Portland and Santiago.
At the beginning of 2017, Amazon opened its stores in New York and planned to have at least 8 stores by the end of the year.
Almost at the same time, Amazon announced that its unmanned supermarket (Amazon go) trial operation, customers to the shop does not need to queue, do not need to checkout, the door sweep code, take the desired goods to leave, the amount of shopping will automatically deducted from the customer's Amazon account.
As far as Amazon is concerned, it's a surprise that in recent years there have been a lot of moves on physical stores.
As early as in the 2007 letter to shareholders, CEO Jeff Bezos stressed that Amazon will not easily open physical stores, unless the following four conditions are met:
1. We must be convinced that this new opportunity will give shareholders a return on their investments;
2. We must be convinced that this new opportunity is of great significance to the entire company;
3. We must be convinced that this new opportunity is overlooked by the market;
4. We must be sure that we have enough resources in this market to make customer-oriented differentiation.
Bookstores and grocery stores are among the most crumbling categories of two physical retailing and the first to fall after Amazon's rise.
It is worth pondering whether the timing or the motives of Amazon's foray into the two physical markets as it squeezes into the world's top ten retailers.
Does Amazon's approach contradict the guarantees in the shareholder letter?
A similar sound was heard at the other end of the Earth. On the morning of October 13, 2016, the chairman of Alibaba's board of directors made a keynote speech at the 2016 cloud habitat meeting in Hangzhou.
He said: "Starting next year, Alibaba will not mention the" E-commerce "this argument.
The era of pure electricity business will soon be over, the next 10 years, 20 years will be no e-commerce, replaced by the ' new retail '.
Line online and logistics combined, will produce new retail. ”
For a time, the "new retail" three words like being enchanted, by the industry people frequently hang on the mouth.
But what does "new retailing" mean?
This concept is not novel if it is simply a combination of line and line.
After tracking 180 of the biggest electric dealers in 2016, emarketer estimated that total sales were about $200 billion trillion, with the largest 25 accounting for more than 159 billion dollars.
Of these 25, 18 are traditional retailers (such as Macy's, Nordstrom, Target, Gap, etc.) that have been operating online for the past five years.
And Alibaba Group 28.3 billion yuan to buy a stake in Suningyun business, also still vividly.
From a global perspective, retailers and electric dealers are moving from a single channel to a full channel retail system covering physical stores, dealers, mobile terminals and social media.
Is Mr Ma mentioning "new retailing" more of a summary than a prospect for the future?
If not, what is the difference between the whole channel concept and the "new retail"?
Perhaps the crux of the matter is not whether the line and the line will not merge, but how to merge.
Looking back on retail industry in the past 20, the rise of electric dealers, as early as the rise of discount retailers, are focused on price and convenience.
Relying on these two pain points, the electric dealers moved the highly standardized products, such as books and CDs, from offline to online.
With the development of online consumption habits and the continuous improvement of customer experience, the electric business has extended its tentacles to other categories, and began to improve efficiency.
In the words of Alibaba CEO Zhang Yong, "the use of Internet ideas and technology to comprehensively reform and upgrade the existing total of about 30 trillion social retailers, so that the increasing consumer demand of Chinese consumers can be effectively met, so that the entire production, circulation and service process because of the Internet, The wide application of large data becomes more efficient. ”
Therefore, the road of the electric business is a surface light assets, the actual heavy assets of the road.
"Light" refers to the fixed assets, staffing, management process, such as the burden of the traditional retail industry, "heavy" refers to the logistics, warehousing and other aspects of the need for huge investment.
The change of the mode of logistics ensures the high efficiency of the electric business.
Li Keqiang, the State Council, April 28 presided over a meeting of the State Council, which said that expanding domestic consumer demand is an important measure of steady growth and structural adjustment, according to Chinese government news.
The meeting determined that the relevant departments should grasp the concrete plan on the basis of scientific assessment.
To the domestic consumer demand of a large part of foreign consumer goods, in the end of June this year to carry out the pilot to reduce import tariffs, and gradually expand the scope of tax-lowering goods;
Combined with tax reform, improve the consumption tax policy of apparel, cosmetics and other consumer goods, and adjust the scope of tax, tax rate and collection link;
Add and restore port entry duty-free shops, reasonable expansion of duty-free varieties, increase a certain amount of duty-free shopping, to facilitate domestic consumers to buy foreign products in the territory;
We should further promote the customs clearance of overseas travellers and facilitate the tax rebate, and strictly implement the requirements for the voluntary declaration of imported goods.
To formulate the inspection and quarantine policy to support the import of Cross-border electricity dealers and to clean up unreasonable charges for import;
Accelerate the promotion of China's product branding project, support the development of physical stores, the realization of online offline interaction.
Standardize the market order, crackdown on fake and inferior, promote the fittest.
So that consumers can be near Shuxin, convenient shopping.

Help you prevent your company from becoming the next best step in the start-up business
Amy Erets once wanted to investigate employee happiness at her e-commerce start-up, but the survey didn't work.
The responses are often vague, unhelpful, or even worse, deceptive responses.
Even if she promises to use anonymity, some employees still distrust the process.
Ellett, who manages 75 people, Madison Reed, a San Francisco E-commerce-care company, said "the responses lacked consistency and objectivity".
So she called for help.
A number of new human resources start-ups have sprung up to help companies understand their employees ' feelings.
They build and empower software that is designed to measure employee participation, allowing companies to conduct quick polls for specific teams and population groups, provide anonymous and complaint hotlines to employees, and in some cases allow informants to bypass executive direct reporting to the board.
"Now you can track your health with tools such as Strava and Fitbit, but where is the company's Fitbit?" Jim Bannett, co-founder and chief executive officer of Glint, a redwood city start-up company, said. Glint software analysis tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement.
Ellett says in three years, she has gained more insights into her staff's thoughts and feelings with glint.
In addition to a specific team of quick surveys and polls, Glint also provides a company thermal map, which units have the most complaints and which managers approve grades low, at a glance – which allows her to gain insight into the cause.
Companies are beginning to realise they have to master the company's workplace culture to avoid becoming the next best step. Excellent step before the staff published a blog article describing the harassment environment, these speakers were punished by the company, and then fell into a scandal.
For startups like Glint, the company's oversight desire is a lucrative business opportunity.
By 2020, the value of the global governance, regulatory and compliance industries could be more than $118.7 billion trillion, according to Talk Payments, a financial technology analytics website.
Colorado State Denver's start-up, Convercent, is committed to helping companies prevent and detect bad behavior, and they see an increase in interest and activity during their reputation damage earlier this year.
Convercent has nearly 600 customers, including the likes of Yingying, Microsoft and Tesla.
Excellent step recently signed to become a customer.
Like Glint, Convercent allows companies to send customized "diagnostic" surveys, collect confidential responses in real time, and view hot maps of their problem areas.
Convercent also provides anonymous SMS hotline, allowing employees to report bad behavior.
If the chairman is implicated, the complaint will go directly to the board.
"The court of public opinion usurped the authority of the regulator," said Patrick Quenlan, founder and CEO of Convercent.
If a company is found to be poorly treated or immoral, even if the regulator does not intervene, the company could face the high consequences of consumer boycotts, staff turnover and involvement in litigation, Quinlan said.
Ruby Tuesday is a restaurant chain that spans more than 500 places and employs more than 25,000 employees, and has been using convercent for more than a year to ensure that employees understand work standards and procedures and provide easy access to the company's headquarters.
Before that, if an employee wants to report a problem, he or she must find the company's headquarters phone number or email, make a formal complaint, and expect the headquarters to take it seriously.
This is often a daunting and unsettling experience, says James Vitrano, a general counsel for Ruby Tuesday, who believes there is no good way to track employee complaints.
But now the company is using convercent to find and solve problems that previously unknown to executives in remote offices, cities or states-such as discrimination, harassment or unfair wage behaviour.
"I can understand the work experience more closely, 360 degrees," said Vitrano, who is responsible for the Ruby Tuesday risk management team.
"We are protecting our shareholders from employment lawsuits. ”
Quinlan said companies have been paying more attention to ethics, values and employee engagement since 2002, after the collapse of the Andorran accounting firm over ethical breaches of the Enron scandal.
But it wasn't until the "social media went into their own world" that companies realised they couldn't stop the viral spread of their material online.
"People see hope as a strategy before using technology to monitor ethics," he said.
Both Glint and Convercent provide their software as a service and charge the companies with recurrent costs for the use of their products.
This business model and business opportunities are supported by venture investors who have supported the two start-ups.
In February, Convercent raised 10 million of billions of dollars from companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, and its total assets rose to $47 million.
In November, Glint received 10 million dollars from Bessemer Venture, with a total capital of $60 million trillion.
Given the interconnectedness of corporate, cultural and venture capital, these investments are hardly surprising.
More and more studies have shown that today's employees have higher expectations of the workplace than ever before.
In a fiercely competitive market like Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are just bets.
Employees want to feel that they are accepted and valued, and that their time is spent on a company with a positive mission.
"When people are happy to join the company, feel their voice is heard, and the work they do is good, they will be more committed to the success of the company," said Nina Mccartney, vice president of global welfare and employee experience at LinkedIn. LinkedIn also uses the two software convercent and glint.
Investors are rewarded when their portfolio companies are doing well, and the company behaves well in the loyalty and professionalism of its employees.
It is not surprising that Third-party analytics tools will seek financial support if they are committed to increasing employee loyalty and engagement.
Workplace culture experts say it is important to master employee engagement data.
However, unless the company's administrators take action, the data is useless.
In fact, if a company asks employees for feedback, it can expect a change in the company.
If change does not go fast enough, or if there is no progress, it can lead to disappointment and leave employees out of the company.
"If you are looking for 4,000 suggestions, you need to be prepared for 4,000 conversations," said La Selle Larth, head of consulting at the business management firm, the Chief international company. "He has seen some companies rely too much on data acquisition errors.
"Because if you don't follow the whole process, the employee will think, ' Do you really hear me? '" he said.
Do you care?
If you don't care, why should I care? ’”
Ellett said Madison Reed is now conducting monthly employee surveys and has been able to take action on the same day that glint reported the problem.
After collecting feedback from employees about their frustration with decision-making speed and quality of communication, she can solve the problem by reorganizing the in-house team and increasing communication training.
Ruby Tuesday is gaining new insights into its staff, and in the long run wants to make a shift in the industry, which is known for its high brain drain rate, to better retain its employees.
"If you're not committed to creating a culture of transparency, you're going to lose talent," Vitrano said.
"If you lose the talent, you will lose the customer."
And when you lose a client, you lose the company. ”

NCAA cancels two times daily training to extend Bear's daytime training time
As time approached 11 o'clock, UCLA football players wandered around the team's new campus driving field.
Some players have taken off their sweatshirts and exposed their sweaty body after the first day of training camp.
For a large part of the team, the spare minutes are a break.
Players attending the summer course will return to their dorm for the final exam after three hours of practice, then return to the Wasserman Football center 6:30 the next day.
"The next three days are a run-in for these guys," says Bear coach Jim Mola, who is about to enter Tuesday in Monday.
The NCAA canceled two exercises a day (designed to reduce the burden on the players) but actually extended their daytime training-at least until the end of Friday.
That's why UCLA's first three sessions are scheduled to start 7:15 P.M. to accommodate the player's already congested timetable.
The bears trained almost one weeks before the end of last season, from two training sessions a day to more daily training, and Moira trained for the first time in Westwood's six seasons in summer school.
They plan to start 18 training sessions from August 20 and then start preparing for a formal race for the September Texas farmer.
Moira says he supports the NCAA rules, although it will add another item to the busy schedule of the players.
"In three or four days, we're going to give them a huge amount of training, very challenging," says Mo.
"They have just passed. They're honed, they're all great kids.
I think of Saturday, we will have more time, really good. ”
The University of California, Los Angeles, will stop training as soon as the camp is over. Given the clear view of the nearby parking lot and Luskin Center, this is not an easy task. The Luskin Center Hotel has been thrown black and blue by a soccer ball that passes through the fence behind the goal post.
The Bears will be staying at the hotel at the end of this week. But Moira admits that once these rooms are vacant during the season, problems may arise.
"We will take security measures," said Mora.
"This is a really worrying question. The idea that someone might rent a room and sit in a room and record a training scene is not far-fetched.
If you have a training tape, it's pretty good.
But we will take security measures there, and security measures will be taken in the No. 8th car park.
We will use the resources available to do our best.
I don't worry too much about it.
We have a plan in place. ”

The story of the Castle of England: the creation of a graphic novel
Recently, the compact Scottney Castle became the protagonist in the compact version of the music film and was once a refuge for Margaret Thatcher (Margaret Thatcher) during the 780 's.
But Scottney, who has seen 700 years of turbulent history in the cosy position of the Bay of Kent, is now a source of graphic fiction written by Jemi Rodes (Jamie Rhodes), a Yorkshire man with a special interest in historical documents and trailing heads.
"I can see the handwriting of the Ancients 300 years ago, and I find it really beautiful," he said with a yearning look.
"This is what kind of interpersonal fate to let this letter fall on my hands." ”
Across the Middle Ages until the time of Edward, the "Castle of England" reader recorded the families of the ISAAC, each of which was made up of different, futuristic artists such as Lenkiewicz, Briony Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer, and Isabel Greenberg made.
This is not the first book to be based on archives: He also wrote the teeth and other stories of the dead of the 2014, a book inspired by the literature of the British Library, a work he had been able to accomplish with uncontrollable passion for creation.
"I cannot restrain my writing impulses from the moment I see the thumb marks on one side of the letter," said the letter, written by a double agent who worked for Jacob in 18th century. ”
"That's his fingerprints!"
And the letters always smell like smoke, because at that time, you need to fire to have light.
For us, 300 years later, the scent feels like they're around us.
Oh, I like the file literature! ”
For those who have been touched by old paper, they can get the support of the National Trust and Art Council of England and live in the castle for nearly four months ("To tell the truth, I've been a little too long") seems so great, it's really unbelievable.
Rhodes spent days visiting Victoria's "new" castle, browsing through archives, studying many treasures and antiques from the manor, such as the Hyena's head hanging on the wall, and the bottles that had spent centuries in the moat.
He wandered on the land and ruins of old castles, with Vagabonds, gardeners, and sometimes chatting with illustrations artists for his book.
Then, in the evening, he would "drink some whiskey and write." ”
Scottney's Secret History is not clear, because the British National Trust is only fully entered after the death of Elizabeth Hessi, the last heir in 2006.
Ten years later, when Rhodes arrived, the staff began to deal with the files, describing them as "hundreds of years ago the nobles are going to go:" Oh, put it in the attic. ”
Diaries, letters from the age of the British Empire, maps of the country's borders: "You would think land disputes would be boring," Rhodes said, "but two families will be fighting over a white birch tree."
Let go, boys! ”
Some of the stories in the works take the castle as a starting point, and further study the history of the UK, including the labourer, a man who left the new castle to participate in the 1381 peasant uprising.
"The book, the Knight Family of Kent and Sussex (knightly families of Kent and Sussex)," Records a riot in the castle in 1380, "Rhodes said.
"The peasant uprising started in that area, and I thought it was a good place to start the uprising."
Maybe there's a connection between the two? ”
Other stories are deeply rooted in the history of the castle, such as the priest, which tells the story of the Darrell family's concealment of a Jesuit priest for seven years during the British Reformation.
or "smuggler" (the smuggler), the owner of the story was the 18th century smuggler Arthur Dudley, who was thought to have a funeral by a stone filled his coffin (a few years later, when his coffin was exposed to the ground, people found it).
"The Darrell Family" (The Darrells) is Rhodes favorite Scottney Castle family: "These gentlemen seem to be very rogue, always borrow money, and then spend money they can not afford to buy things."
Generation after generation of Darrell men to solve their debt problems by marrying rich old women, I think they should be a bunch of handsome lads who know how to pursue women. ”
As his mission in the castle ended, Rhodes began to look for other strange writing experiences.
He spent two weeks in the Finnish wilderness completing a graphic novel about "El?¤m?¤nm?¤ki", an early 20th century sanatorium, which was slowly discarded.
But Scottney has a special place for him.
"I am very sad to leave," he said.
"It's like: ' Oh, I have to face the real life of the cake." '”

Big energy companies are all "rich", so who are the most energy companies in the world taking advantage of the money?

US changes Green card rules
The media quoted President Donald Trump as saying the United States would launch a new immigration plan to revise the green card rules.
The scheme would reduce legal immigration to 50,000 people a year, and temporary work visas and family-oriented visa applications would be subject to stricter restrictions.
The new rules are proposed by Republicans and supported by the President.

Sex robots are on the rise, but we should be careful
Just when you think 2017 years is not going to be any weirder, the field of erotic Robotics has released a new technology development report.
Yes.
Now, sex robots are big things.
Recently, The Responsibility Robotics Foundation (FRR) published a report looking at the development of sex robots over the next 5-10 years.
"We need to get serious about the rise of sex robots," says Shffield Sharkey, emeritus professor and FRR co-founder of Robotics and Artificial intelligence at the University of Technology.
Customers can choose the robot's eye color, nipple shape and nail type.
"People laugh behind their backs, but the big companies do launch a lot of sex robots and we see more," Sharkey said in a new report. ”
Modern sex dolls have evolved from inflatable dolls into robots that have silicone skin, feel warm, and deliberately use artificial intelligence to set up human-like sexual responses.
Users can also "customize" their robots to suit their preferences, from eye color, nipple shape to nail type or color.
But what is even more disturbing is that many of the "personalities" of robots make "cloned wives" look very advanced.
Modern sex toys have evolved into a robot that has silicone skin.
For example, a Realbotix robot can be defined according to what the user deems attractive, such as shyness.
There is also a roxxxy Gold sex robot developed by True companion, which can pre-set personality traits, including a slightly shy "cool and cool" and "adventurous" "Wild Wendy".
"The Roxxxy Gold robot has the personality to match as much as you can," True Companion company's Web site relishes.
So she loves what you love, what you do evil.
She's like a normal person, and she has a little mood in those days!
She can be lazy, talkative, can also be ' sexually exuberant '! ”
The rise of the sex robot has caused a lot of unease-not just the substitution of the real human relationship-but the feminine features of being obsequious and the rape cues that twitch in the cool (read: Resist) Faraday are the most worrisome.
True Companion the Roxxxy on its website to a man's vibrating stick.
"If a woman has a vibrator, why can't a man have a Roxxxy?" the website said. ”
However, these sex robots are not a mere fetish, nor are they just a sex toy.
Their emergence and growing sophistication are a darker and deeper part of our culture: escaping from perfect gender equality and moving to sexual intercourse with the added option of surrendering.
Most men, of course, do not have sex robots, and although FRR points out that sex robots are becoming more popular, they are still on the verge of a consumer culture.
But what comes from the edge can make us see the course of our time.
A lot of people are not so weird and offensive, until the free market gives them the chance to become so.
It is no coincidence that these sophisticated sex robots appear in a world where women's rights are threatened, and that the White House has a president who brags about sexual violence against women.
The most frightening part of the TV drama "The Maid's story" is not the lifelike picture, not the hanging corpse, nor the eyes that have been dug up, but the imagination that is too real.
The Base Republic is a leap, but now it seems not far away.
The goal behind these sex droids is to make the most of the technology possible to create the body that resembles the real woman (though it is the proportion of pornographic stars).
The creators of these robots want them to have human touch and imitate real human actions.
But frankly speaking, their "personality" does not represent the real women.
They can't break up, they can't leave.
They have no recourse and no follow-up stories, no independence at all, no possibility of breaking the illusion of outright servitude.
In other words, they are sex slaves.
Or in the popular parlance of the 2017: the maid.

Trump's Great feat?
Let Mitt Romney (Mitt Romney) become a microcosm of common sense
Political differences have led to a polarization of American voters, which, from a microscopic standpoint, has undermined American family harmony. This is already a flattering time for the Trump age.
Around Christmas and Thanksgiving, America's big newspapers are filled with comments about how to deal with the fear of the Trump family.
It is often thought that we are doing our best to pierce our "filtration bubble".
Less of a comment is Trump's ability to unite his family.
I mention this because my cousin, a left-wing poet who lives in Chicago, has a long feud with the Republicans in our family, and he's coming to visit me in New York this week.
She reminded me that uniting against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.
With Trump working at the White House, everyone she knows, even the Republican relatives who have had decades of political wrangling, are suddenly and strangely on the same line.
If it's all at the table, it's a good thing. But what struck me is that, from a broader perspective, this raises significant risks.
Although the left has always been egged on by Trump, the warping effect of his presidency pushes us all to the right.
When we talk about "normalization" and Trump, we're talking about the possibility that his antics might stop one day.
There is, however, a more worrisome long-term scenario in which Trump's "normalization" of relations with right-wing Republicans, who previously opposed the president's standards, now suddenly appears to be a symbol of rationality.
I find myself nostalgic for the recent madness of the Mitt Romney version: Putting a dog on a car, 14% of the income tax (but at least we know his tax return), and the guilt of these two acts seems to be too slight compared to Trump.
After the Trump era, the next Republican candidate needs only to be intellectually qualified to make immeasurable improvements.
When my cousin lived in town, we took our kids to the merry-go-round of New York Park, the biggest merry-go-round that was run by Central Park Management in New York, and if you don't need coffee, this three-dollar ticket is the most expensive thing you have in the city.
The sound of a horse is thundering, and the central cylinder is designed for fiberglass, and all the clowns and animals look at their shoulders in horror and sinister, and jingle music is strangely ringing.
Too many vulgar cities are disappointing: the landscape from high-rise buildings has become old-fashioned, the skyline has become too familiar to offer too much stimulation, and the city's reality does not support its dreams.
35 years later, I have not completely forgotten that day, I found this "Swiss Cottage" is actually not a Swiss cottage, but a theme bar "Old Swiss Cottage" (Ye Olde Swiss Cottage), I do not remember, but in the north of London, near a junction.
However, Central Park's merry-go-round is still a magical experience for two 2-year-olds, a 11-year-old, and four 40-year-olds who can participate in events that everyone has enjoyed.
If I could evaluate the merry-go-round, I would give it a full mark, but luckily no one asked.
But this week in a department store, I was asked to score a five-star rating on my deal "experience" before I brushed my credit card.
The same is true in the coffee shop in the corner of my street, where you can also choose to score 15% tips to buy things on the counter.
The effect is not only to slow down the speed at which it should be neutral, but also to put pressure on waiters to add personal factors to unwanted situations.
The poor woman in the department store smiled with regret, and I was exhausted, and the credit card trading experience gave her a five-star rating.
Oscar Pistorius transferred from prison to hospital for chest pains

In the early hours of Valentine's Day in 2013, he shot Steenkamp through the toilet compartment door in his Pretoria home to his death.
Pistorius claimed to have mistaken his girlfriend for an intruder who hid in a compartment at night.

The state attorney's office said it would appeal to the South African Supreme Court and that the appeal could be heard this year.
If the prosecutor wins, Pistorius will face a prison sentence of up to 15.
South Africa does not have the death penalty.

Does thin meat, dairy products and chocolate contribute to the alleviation of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)?
Thin meat and chocolate may sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.
But a new study shows exactly the opposite: diets rich in meat proteins and dairy products can help alleviate the symptoms associated with inflammatory bowel disease.
The incurable disease affects the lives of about 1.3 million Americans and 300,000 Britons, leading to stomach cramps and bloating, recurrent or hemorrhagic diarrhea, weight loss and extreme tiredness.
Researchers at the University of Washington often advise patients to avoid eating meat and dairy products to relieve symptoms, but researchers have found that the key amino acid-tryptophan in protein helps boost immune cell growth, which enhances gut tolerance.
Dr. Marco Colonna, chief researcher, explained that immune cells patrol the gut to make sure that harmful microorganisms hidden in food do not sneak into the body.
Cells that cause inflammation maintain a balance between the cells that enhance tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive and vulnerable tissues.
Inflammatory bowel disease may occur when the equilibrium state is too biased towards inflammation.
In the experiment, a cell that promotes immunity appears in mice that carry special bacteria.
Bacteria require tryptophan, one of the constituent parts of the protein, to form the appearance of the cell.
Professor Colonna said: "We have established a link between a bacterial population (Roy Acidophilus, a normal part of the intestinal microflora) and the development of a cell population that promotes tolerance."
The more tryptophan the mice consumed in their diets, the more immune cells they had.
He suggested that if humans were to use the same method, the combination of Lactobacillus scalloped and tryptophan-rich diets could form a more tolerant, less inflammatory intestinal environment.
The postdoctoral researcher Louisa Cervantes Baragan (Luisa Cervantes-barraganwas) studied an immune cell that enhances tolerance, when she found that a group of mice had such cells, but another group of the same strains was kept separate.
She suspects that the difference is related to the community of mice's gut microbes, the bacteria, viruses and fungi that usually live in the gastrointestinal tract.
DNA sequencing of the cholesterol in mice showed that 6 species of bacteria existed in mice with immune cells, but not in mice without immune cells.
Mice were reared in sterile environments, so they lacked intestinal microbes and could not appear in the immune cells, and the presence of scalloped lactobacillus produced immune cells.
To understand how bacteria affect the immune system, the researchers cultured lactobacillus in the liquid and then transferred a small amount of bacteria-free fluids to immature immune cells isolated from the white mice.
The immune cell develops into a tolerant cell.
When the active ingredient is purified from the liquid, it can be proved that the active ingredient is a by-product of tryptophan metabolism, called indole-lactic acid.
When the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in mice feeds, the number of such cells increased by about 50%, but when tryptophan levels halved, the number of cells decreased by half.
Cervantes-barragan, Dr. Cervantes Baragan, explains that people, like mice, have the same tolerance-enhancing cells, and most of us have scalloped in our gastrointestinal tract.
It is not known whether humans can induce cell development in vivo, like mice in the lab, from scalloped lactobacillus, but in patients with inflammatory bowel disease, tryptophan-related genetic defects are found.
"The development of these cells may be the result of what we want, because these cells can control the inflammatory response in the gut," she said.
It may be inaccurate to say that the presence of high levels of tryptophan in Lactobacillus scalloped may lead to an increase in the number of strains.
Jose Mourinho addressed that Manchester United signed the "genius" Nemania Matic
In late Wednesday, after the first appearance of the Sampdoria rivalry, Jose Mourinho decided that Manchester United had signed a "gifted" midfielder, Nemania Matic.
Matic, who came from Chelsea, signed up to 40 million pounds and won the Pogba and Andreas Pereira in Tuesday after the last pre-season in Dublin against Real Madrid's European Super Cup.
However, in the Bruce preseason Asian Tour, the Matic race was badly off, with only 45 minutes to go, and Mourinho admits he needs to improve before the Premier League season begins.
"He needs time, but he has the experience, wisdom and genius of thinking-he thinks about football," Mourinho said.
"We will help him prepare as soon as possible." ”
Jose Mourinho began arranging his starting line-up at the start of the season. Like Matic, the new signing players Victor Lindlov and Romelou Lucacu also started the competition at Aviva Stadium.
The Independent reported this week that Mourinho still hopes to bring in three more signings, but insists that the club is "doing well" and that he has four preferred signings in mind and that the club has introduced three of them.
"The club has introduced three of the players and I am very grateful." "he added.
"I would be happier if the club could bring in all four players, but they have made a lot of effort for me," he said. ”
The global frigate climax in China if not build this type of warship will fall behind?
With the recent world's major naval powers have announced the construction of new frigates, as if the frigate had a night with the major powers of the Navy focus, first Japan in the 2018 defense budget to determine the procurement of two new frigates, so that the Japanese Dex frigate program has finally made a substantial breakthrough, After the United States Lockheed Martin recently announced the United States FFG frigate program of the latest plan, then China's new frigate to go?
With the launch of the latest 054A frigate in the late 2017, the 054A frigate has already built as many as 29 ships, has been nearing the total of the 053H series frigates, and since the launch of the first 054A in 2006, 054A has been in the process of construction for 12 years, Even in the world, the construction of such a large number of high-performance generic frigates, in addition to China, only the United States in the last century 7, 80 's "Perry" class frigate can be compared.
The reason why so many 054A is built is also very simple, it is affordable, easy to use, supplemented by years of naval arrears.
The 054A frigate has been favored by the Chinese navy for many years by virtue of its high cost performance and good fighting power. Its 4000 tons of displacement, carrying a 76 mm main gun, 32 units Sea red flag-16 and fish-8 anti-submarine missile co-launch System, 8 Eagle Strike 83 and a straight-9 helicopter, Although it was built in 2006, design time is a very early ship, but its combat effectiveness even if put to today is not too bad, look at the world's frigates can also reach the level.
But this is, after all, a type of ship designed in early 21st century, weapon configuration on one side, its power systems and electronic radar equipment compared with the current world mainstream frigate has a big gap, like Europe's similar frigates have been equipped with full power propulsion, small multi-function phased array radar, large size helicopter deck, It's time to develop the new model number.
So how to develop a new type of frigate in China is directly related to its future position and the strategic policy of our Chinese navy.
The future development of China's navy is bound to be a blue water navy, and the future is bound to be to the ocean, with China's vital interests closely related to the rapid deployment, show the presence of force, if necessary to have a strong combat power to ensure that China's vital interests in the region are not damaged, So it appears that the new Hu Weijiang will be towards large-scale, ocean-going development.
Then look at the new type of frigate in the future of China's naval sequence positioning problem, the future of the Chinese navy should be similar to the United States Navy, except for the necessary offshore defense vessels, other major ships will be based on the circumstances need to form a carrier combat group or amphibious attack ship strike group.
And the role of the new frigate in the future aircraft carrier Combat group should be used as the main anti-submarine and in the near-area vent positioning, in the amphibious assault ship strike group should be used as frigate boat class, then according to such demand, the new frigate must have strong anti-submarine capability and good intermediate-range venting capacity.
Based on the above positioning, you can boldly imagine the future of the domestic frigate general appearance.
First of all, the displacement relative to the current 054A frigate will have a substantial increase in the estimated displacement of the new frigate will reach about 5000-6000 tons; The power system will use an integrated electric propulsion system consisting of a QC280-improved GT and two diesel engines, The maximum speed is expected to reach about 30 knots, endurance will also increase significantly, as for the weapon configuration 76 mm main cannon and 1130 near the cannon should be retained, but will add a red Flag 10 launch System, the main gun should be followed by a 32-48 unit red Flag 16 improved type and fish-8 common frame of the vertical system, The rear of the hull should be fitted with a large vertical system of 8-16 units for launching Eagle Strike 18 and new cruise missiles; The hangar and the Stop platform will also increase to two 10 ton helicopter parking and storage; As far as the electronic radar system is concerned, Gao Pi should be equipped with a small four-way fixed phased array radar based on 346A development, which can be used in a multifunctional rotating phased array radar similar to a European frigate.
As a result, the overall level of the new frigate will be the world's best, even compared to the United States FFG Bu more.
Of course, the above concept is only the author of domestic new type of frigate conjecture, specific how we can only wait until the launch of a new frigate when the water can be a probe, let us look together.

Edition, People's Daily, published a commentary on January 17, "Awards and loans: The joy and worry of youth struggling", according to the data shown in November 2017, the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences National Finance and Development Laboratory, the National Balance Sheet Research Center issued the "third-quarter China deleveraging Process report" pointed out that The residential sector's leverage continued to rise, from 47.4% in the two quarter of 2017 to 48.6% in the three quarter, up 1.3%, and 2017 in three in the first quarter.
The proportion of the resident sector in the total real economy has increased, and the leverage rate has risen faster.
The study shows that Chinese households ' liabilities in financial institutions are mainly consumer loans, accounting for about 2/3 of the household's liabilities, or about twice times that of operating loans.
Among them, in the consumer loans, housing loans mainly in the medium and long term loans accounted for about 80%, but from an incremental perspective, short-term consumer loan growth rate faster than medium and long-term loans.
In addition, China's household debt rate only counts the amount of credit the family sector obtains from financial institutions, while Chinese households also have many private loans, including borrowing from relatives and friends, with large hidden debts.
To see such data, people can not help but a little stunned, according to the Suning Institute of Finance Statistics show that 1996 Chinese residents leverage only 3%, 2008 is only 18%, but since 2008, the ratio began to show rapid growth, a short period of six years doubled to 36.4%. By the third quarter of 2017, residents ' leverage had reached 48.6% per cent.
We compare a data, last May, HSBC issued a survey across 9 countries, respondents close to tens of thousands of people.
The report was targeted at "the Millennial generation" of 9 countries (born between 1980 and 2000).
The report notes that China's 80-and-younger young people have a 70% per cent home ownership rate, well ahead of the second Mexico (46%) and twice times the US target (35%).
The data tell us the most likely problem is that the biggest potential "grey rhino" at this stage will not be able to afford to buy a house.
Second, why is the housing debt crisis the most serious problem?
As we have analyzed before, although we have been talking about the high price of Chinese housing, but compared to other countries in the world, China's home ownership rate is actually quite high, so so much so that prices can not afford to buy a house, I am afraid to ask a lot of friends now the question is that you can still afford the loan?
We look at the real estate market around the world, China's real estate market because of the late start, in addition to what we said before Hainan, there has not been a big real estate crisis, but the 2008 world financial tsunami was the origin of the U.S. real estate crisis.
The US housing crisis is blamed on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the two houses.
At that time in the golden age of the United States, real estate companies in order to expand the sale of the house to a very low down payment to the United States low-income groups, the U.S. economy to the good times, the real estate market is also a thriving, but not long, as the U.S. economy has been stagnant, causing the income of So a lot of household consumer spending began to fall.
But the current state of the United States was the financial assets and real estate assets that were part of American household assets, almost all household assets in America's low-income groups are real estate, and most of the top 20% of high-income groups are financial assets, thus creating a higher debt ratio in real estate in America's poorer households.
A serious fact is that these people are in the good times to buy the house, so the money to pay the mortgage is also based on their better income, when the income has slipped, the pressure of the mortgage not only did not reduce even because some of the subprime program has become more floating, As a result, the housing problems of these American families have gradually evolved into a real estate crisis.
So some people can't afford to pay their mortgage because they are too low. So banks began to reclaim property, and when banks recovered their property from delinquent homebuyers, they sold at very low prices, leading to a fall in house prices in the region, which led to further declines in house prices, creating a vicious circle, When house prices fell to a certain extent, more and more buyers found that their houses were even lower than their own loans, so more people stopped paying the mortgage and caused more bad debts.
So, a huge vicious circle is formed:
"The economy is in recession--income is falling--some people can't afford a mortgage--a house where banks sell their bills at a low price--house prices fall--more people stop paying mortgages – banks sell – prices fall again ..."
And the problem is more than that, because house prices continue to fall, people stop repaying the house to the bank after you do not have the debt, if the bank auction house to get the money you do not owe the bank of the loan, then you still need to return the money, simply say you use a down payment of 600,000, Loan 2.4 million bought a house that was worth 3 million at the time, when house prices fall to the house is only worth 2 million, you no longer repay the house to the bank, the bank auction house, you not only lost your own down payment 600,000, but also owed the bank 400,000 of the debt, you still have to pay.
Thus, in such a vicious circle of one after another, the U.S. economy gradually collapsed, and eventually triggered the 2008-year financial crisis in the United States.
So, at this stage, China's domestic debt rate reached a high level of 46.8% is a very need to be vigilant, the data is still below the level of developed countries, but the issue has begun to appear, the country from the beginning of last year repeatedly stressed the issue of deleveraging, which is a very prescient judgment, If the family debt rate is allowed to continue to climb, it will inevitably cause huge risks, so we must prevent the emergence of financial risks.
So after the house is used to live, not to fry the positioning of the country to accelerate the establishment of multi-body supply, multi-channel security, rent and purchase of multiple measures to further resolve the potential risks.
For our individual families, we must give up the speculative thinking of real estate, the time to buy a house, to avoid their own family into a huge burden, only a reasonable assessment of their income and debt level is a healthy family wealth development path.

White House props cost thousands of
Last month the White House decided to transport a Marine Corps helicopter to the South Lawn to highlight the great glory of American manufacturing, costing as much as $24,000, according to a military record published by Time magazine.
Green and white Sikorsky vh-3d (also known as the Marine Corps on the president's ride) was an important exhibit on the July 17 White House highlight of the U.S. construction project.
President Donald Trump, vice President Maik Pens and senior White House officials toured manufacturing products from all 50 states.
The exhibits are Connecticut State-made helicopters, a Maine State yacht, a Wisconsin fire engine and a Mississippi State forklift truck.
According to the records of the first flying team (HMX-1), the Army's Marine Corps helicopter, which operates the helicopter, the White House Military office has asked the helicopter to be present in daily order (Frago), which is only 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn to attend the "special" event.
The day before the event, Commander HMX-1 in an e-mail message sent to the Superior Marine Corps flying Deputy Commander, "I just want to make sure you know, because this event is highly valued." ”
The information indicates that the helicopter will arrive at the South Lawn at about 7 o'clock in the morning on July 17 to attend the 3 o'clock in the afternoon event, the night after the 6 o'clock to 9 points to clear the lawn before leaving.
The information also indicates that in the event of a delay from the White House, inbound will need a second crew because of the time limit on duty.
The original crew was standing by the helicopter during the event while the security forces were on standby while the plane was on the ground.
The records in Time magazine did not make it clear whether the final need for a second group of crew members.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using government property for political purposes.
The records indicate that HMX-1 had asked whether the event violated the bill.
"One of the questions we asked was whether it violated the Hatch Act and was told it was not violated," the commander wrote. ”
"It sounds as if you're locked up," the deputy commander replied.
The White House defined the "Made in America" activity as an official activity and was therefore not subject to the Hatch Act.
But even official activity is politically tinged.
During the campaign, the president launched the Senate issue at the time: health-care reform and touted regulation of government regulations.
The use of a Marine Corps or Air Force aircraft for political propaganda purposes is no novelty.
Successive presidents have been asked to travel by these planes.
But it is not uncommon to commandeer them for photographic purposes only.
Trump was concerned in February, when in Melbourne, Florida State, the presidential plane glided slowly to the background of his first election rally, and his Twitter account was flooded with complaints about the former president's use of the presidential plane.
White House Deputy Press secretary Linsay Walters said "The White House is thrilled by the US-made exhibition, which showcases products from all 50 states, which are made by American workers using American materials." ”
HMX-1 crews often conduct flight training near Washington Land District and the South Lawn to practice the accurate placement of the President of the United States in the White House.
In the early July, when Trump attended the G-20 summit in Germany, HMX-1 practiced 58 landings at the White House.
An official said the US-made flight was included in the training requirements for this month's crews.
Helicopters also had an additional 11-hour "non-presidential Support mission" on the same day.
The White House said the taxpayer did not pay for any other props in the event.
A spokesman for the Sikorsky said the company was not involved in arranging a South Lawn helicopter show.
HMX-1 has not kept a budget record of the president's flight, so it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event.
But according to the MoD's 2017 financial year, Vh-3d's Defense Department can claim a cost of 24,380 dollars per flight hour.
The unit recorded a 30-minute flight from the base of the Virginia State Marine Corps Airfield.
The White House says the cost of operating the helicopter is far below the cost.
"It is very misleading to estimate taxpayer fees based on reimbursable fees," Walters said.
These estimated costs include staff costs, maintenance costs and many other sunk costs, including in the annual appropriation.
A 2015 RAND study showed that the Ministry of Defence's reimbursable expenses did not include personnel costs, but did include oil, maintenance and contracting costs.
At the time, a former White House press spokesman, Shawn Sch Parker, defended the operation using the helicopter,
"The idea is to show the American-made stuff this week,
And I know that both Sikorsky and Connecticut State are proud to have contributed to our national security, and I suspect that even if there were no thousands of, hundreds of people would have to work on that.
And I feel like most Americans, we're all proud of this helicopter and other military equipment, and that's what countless Americans have been doing so tirelessly.
So it is certainly not inappropriate to highlight this point. ”
It is not clear to us whether Trump interacted with the helicopter while touring the South Lawn, but he did get into the driver's seat of the fire engine.
Inside the White House, Trump spoke to the Sikorsky company's representative, making jokes about his own company's aircraft and media.
He said, "I know a lot about Sikorsky airplanes." I have three. ”

According to the market Star reported that from 2005 to 2011, our province's GDP from the middle of a parallel "bottom" rose to the second seat.
However, the economic growth in our province still has some difficulties, such as low investment efficiency and lack of core competitiveness of industrial economy. To this end, the provincial Economic Information Center, the latest issue of the "Economic Blue page" proposed to improve the quality and efficiency of economic growth.
Based on some representative indicators of our province's economy in 2005 and 2011, it is compared with the whole country and the central region.
In the industrial economic efficiency, in 2011, in our province occupies a considerable proportion of industrial energy, raw materials and other high-energy industries, by market volatility and overcapacity "double pressure", at the same time, home appliances, automobiles and other leading industries lack of innovation, resulting in meager profits.
However, the large amount of investment has not brought the corresponding economic benefits, which leads to the high quality and low benefit of economic growth in our province.
In this respect, experts suggest that effective measures should be taken to encourage enterprise innovation, and scientific and technological achievements of universities and scientific research institutes should be "transferred" to enterprises in time.
For industrial economic efficiency is not high, experts say, but also to actively promote industrial mergers and acquisitions, optimize industrial distribution, extend the industrial chain.

The British General Union (GMB) is concerned about the investment in the McVitie Glasgow plant
The union wants the biscuit maker Macquarie's management to ensure a long-term commitment to production at the Lars plant.
The Scottish branch of the British Federation of Trade Unions said the company remained silent about the future of Torcros's investment in Tollcross.
The factory has more than 500 employees, producing oatmeal biscuits (hobnobs), strong tea biscuits (Rich teas) and other products.
Pladis, owner of Pradi, said the company had invested more than 5 million of pounds in the factory over the past few years.
He added that employees and union representatives "will be the first to know" if there is a change in factory operations.
In a letter to the director of the company, the Scottish branch of the British Federation of Trade Unions called on Macquarie to "solve the problem that the funds have not been carried over to the modernization of the production line." ”
"We are not able to get a clear picture of Torcros (Tollcross) 's future business needs and investment plans from the general manager of the plant, which is a cause of deep concern to our members," said Drew Duffy, a senior organizer at the British Federation of Trade Unions.
