Civil rights groups issue travel warnings against Missouri
As a result of discriminatory policies and racist attacks in Missouri, the American Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) has issued travel warnings to people of color who are preparing to travel to Missouri.
"The NAACP Missouri Travel Advisory, which came into effect on August 28, 2017, calls for all African-American travelers, tourists and Missouri people to pay special attention and exercise extreme caution when travelling in Missouri as a result of a recent series of suspicious racial incidents in the state of Missouri," the group's statement declared.
The NAACP noted that a recently passed Missouri law made it harder for people to win discrimination lawsuits, and that state law enforcement was partly targeting minorities, phenomena that prompted the group to issue travel warnings.
Violations of civil rights are happening to people.
They were stopped for questioning, beaten or killed because of the color of their skin, "Rod Chappell, president of the NAACP in Missouri, told the Kansas City Star.
"We have received a number of complaints, an unprecedented number."
It was the first such warning issued by the group in the United States against a state.
The group cited racial slurs against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, a 28-year-old black Tennessee man.
Sanders, who died in suspicious circumstances earlier this year, ran out of fuel during a trip to Missouri and was detained by Missouri police without charge of a crime.
The consultation also noted that a recent report by the Missouri Attorney General's Office showed that "black drivers in the state are 75 percent more likely to be stopped and checked than white people."
"The consultation was designed to raise awareness and warn their families, friends and colleagues about what might happen in Missouri," Chappell said.
"People need to be prepared, whether it's carrying bail to Missouri or letting relatives know they're traveling in the state," he said.
Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest data from the FBI's Hate Crime Reporting Program; the state ranked 16th in the country based on the number of crimes.
The travel warning is also a response to a new Missouri law that would make it harder to prosecute businesses for housing or employment discrimination.
The move comes after U.S. states passed immigration enforcement laws requiring local law enforcement to detain immigration violators, and the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) said the move would increase the number of race lawsuits and issued travel advice for Texas and Arizona.
Travel warnings are usually issued by the U.S. government against other countries, but recently, advisory groups have taken this approach in response to certain laws and trends in the United States.
After a "golden age" in which the box office soared in 2015, the overall film market in 2016 entered a period of calm, and whether it could break through last year's total box office record of RMB44.069 billion became a suspense.
According to figures released by the National Bureau of Statistics, the price of new and second-hand homes in Beijing cooled in October, rising by only 0.6% and 1.1%.

The BBC says Beijing is the most exciting city: making foreigners feel like "living in a new era"
Beijing may have a long history of 3,000 years, but it is also rapidly becoming today's modern city of glamour, according to British media.
With a surprisingly fast internet, sophisticated technology such as face-recognition software, a huge investment in artificial intelligence and unrivalled international energy, the Chinese capital is one of the most exciting cities for exploratory foreigners.
"If I can succeed there, I can succeed anywhere in the future," said German expatriate Clemens Cersei, citing the lyrics of singer Frank Sinatra's tribute to New York City, according to the BBC's website on January 16.
"If Sinatra lived to this day, he would probably sing about cities like Beijing," said Serhi, who works as creative director at Voyager Archive magazine, adding that living in the city would make you feel like "living in a new era" and always keeping up with the trend.
Writing on the personal blog 4 Corners 7 Seas, Simon Norton, who is based in England but recently lives in Beijing, said: "People in general have a feeling of being at the centre of something grand, which is hard to say, but it keeps many foreigners there for a long time. They want to see what it will become and want to see it with their own eyes."
The city's high-quality, high-speed internet and technology-friendly environment make daily life easier than ever before, the report said.
"Beijing is rapidly transforming into a cashless society, with the internet integrating the functions of traditional wallets into smartphones, making it easier for everyone to make a lot of transactions," said Andy Pe ñ a Fuerte, who is from Manila and currently serves as deputy editor-in-chief at the Beijing Children's website.
But smartphones are just the beginning of Beijing's technological ambitions, and facial recognition software has become so popular that many mobile apps use the technology to make bank transfers and payments, get people into apartments and offices, and even use it to verify the identity of online car drivers, the report said.
Beijing also recently announced plans to spend RMB13.8 billion on an artificial intelligence technology park, where more than 400 companies will be located, focusing on the development of artificial intelligence technologies ranging from biometric to self-driving cars.
Food is also at the heart of many of China's major festivals over the years. Participation in these celebrations is highly regarded by foreigners, and the Spring Festival is one of the most important social and economic festivals and one of the easiest for foreigners to take part in.
"I suggest helping Chinese friends prepare for the New Year, cleaning their apartments and posting red couplets with New Year's greetings on their homes is just as important. On New Year's Eve, all family members gather for a big meal and then stay up until midnight to greet the New Year with loud fireworks. For foreigners, spending the night with friends and family is a real opportunity to blend in," he said.
The number of foreigners in Beijing is large and growing, but language barriers in China and the ease of communication among expatriates can easily be an excuse for not being fully integrated into local culture, the report said.
"Some foreigners have been living in China for years, but have little experience of their host country, and if your initial attempt to reach out to the Chinese is not a success, it's easy to feel that it's easier to get along with other foreigners," he said.
"In these so-called" Foreigners Bubble "(" Foreigners Bubble" means foreigners mingle only among foreigners, without contact with locals and local cultures), foreigners huddle in their own communities, eat in Western restaurants, and only foreigners are among their friends.
The easiest way to overcome this is to learn a little bit of Mandarin-which is easier than one might think.
"An hour or two a week of private Chinese lessons or an entry-level radio drama should suit everyone's busy schedule," he said.
Even a few classic short sentences can help with shopping, ordering a meal in a restaurant, or chatting in a taxi.
The report says stubborn air pollution is also a fact of everyday life, but the government has struggled to contain some problems in recent years.
Residents stressed the importance of outdoor activities in warmer months when pollution is often lighter, using blue sky days as an opportunity to roam the historic alleyways or explore the popular Ritan Park.
"Beijing is the Chinese city where you can find the most things below the surface, and you can find great artistic and musical activities, indulgent nightlife, historical wonders, ultra-modern business districts and ancient Hutong areas," Norton said.
According to the report, the impact of ageing on human capital growth is increasingly evident, especially in the north-east, where the annual contribution of ageing to human capital growth is-1.28%.
Pan Gongsheng pointed out that the current risk of cross-border capital flows can be controlled, and the underlying factors supporting the balance of payments remain long-term.
BEIJING, Dec 17 (Xinhua) -- The 2016 International Summit Forum on the Identification, Restoration and Protection of Ancient Chinese Calligraphy and Painting opened on December 17 at Renmin University of China.
In April, the European Commission accused Google of forcing mobile phone manufacturers to pre-install software such as Google Search and Chrome browsers, otherwise it would not be allowed to use other Google apps.
The European Commission considers this to be detrimental to the interests of consumers and an impediment to competition.
EU regulators initially asked Google to respond by July 27.
If convicted, Google faces a fine of up to 10% of its global revenue, about US $7.4 billion.
Google was not immediately available for comment.
Google is also facing an EU investigation for favoring its own shopping service in its search results.
Zhang Yining's stay in the ocean is real, it can be said that it is no accident that he achieved the "jump" from the national youth to the national Olympic Games, and the extent of his leap of growth is still surprising.
A picture to see: Bitcoin's legal status around the world
Absrtact: In addition to the natural price correction caused by speculative properties, this round of digital currency collapse is also related to the "old enemy"-regulatory risk.
Viewed from a visual map, the Eastern countries are more conservative about bitcoin than the West, and the countries that dominate the world are still waiting to see the legitimacy of the digital currency, representing the "Black Swan risk" that remains high.
This article is from Wall Street (Micro-Message ID: Wallstreetcn), editor Wang Mu. For more information, please visit wallstreetcn.com, or download Wall Street to see APP. *
Bitcoin prices fell below the US $10,000 psychological integer level on Tuesday, the biggest one-day drop in three years, as regulatory storms in major bitcoin markets such as China, South Korea and the European Union have sprung up and the global digital currency, led by Bitcoin, has been bloodied this week.
In addition to the natural price correction triggered by speculative properties, this round of digital currency collapse has also been linked to the "old enemy"-regulatory risk.
At this important juncture, the visualization of the big data site, Howe Much.net, has produced a map showing the legitimacy and degree of regulation of Bitcoin in countries around the world.
As shown in the chart below, green represents the legal market for bitcoin; orange represents the neutral market, although it has not yet publicly legalized bitcoin status, but there are no major restrictions on its use; pale pink represents the restricted market, where local governments try to use digital currencies through red line policies or regulation; dark pink represents the country where bitcoin is defined as illegal; and grey is the country that has not yet commented.
(Pictured above from the HowMuch.Net Visualization Team on January 15)
The paper points out that the traditional oriental attitude towards bitcoin is more conservative than that of the West, as can be seen from the color-block distribution of the non-green in the picture.
Russia is currently the largest country to define bitcoin as illegal, China is one of the biggest restricted markets for bitcoin, and India is one of the largest countries that has yet to comment on bitcoin and has yet to put in place a relevant policy.
North America and Western Europe are the regions with the highest acceptance of bitcoin, that is, the distribution of green blocks is more concentrated.
The countries of the Middle East and Latin America have seen a marked divergence in their views of Bitcoin, with a more mixed distribution of color blocks in the above-mentioned regions.
Among them, Iraq, Iran, Turkey, Brazil are legal bitcoin markets, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Bolivia and others have some restrictions on their trading and use, and more Latin American countries have yet to speak out about Bitcoin.
Taken together, the data show that of the 246 countries surveyed globally, 99 (or 40%) do not impose restrictions on the trading and use of bitcoin, i.e., green and orange areas.
Seven countries (or 3%) are restricted markets (pale pink), 10 countries (or 4%) define bitcoin as illegal (dark pink), and 130 countries (or 53%) do not yet have more access to digital currency information (grey).
This suggests that countries that make up the bulk of the world (53%, more than half) are still waiting to see the legitimacy of the bitcoin-led digital currency within their borders, and that the "black swan risk" of bitcoin remains high, as some of these countries may end up making legislative decisions to limit the digital currency.
The article argues that global regulators have not yet fully understood the emerging category of digital currencies and may be the main reason why most countries have yet to make a statement.
While bitcoin's "popularity" has grown exponentially since last year and does not represent interest for all countries, there may be concerns in some countries that the local legal currency is under threat as a result, or more so that the digital currency is being used by criminal organizations.
Wall Street has written a detailed summary of international regulatory news on bitcoin since last week, including China's crackdown on over-the-counter exchanges' centralized service online platforms and mobile App, South Korea's ongoing consideration of closing digital currency exchanges, and the EU's belief that bitcoin has not been widely accepted and warned investors of the risk of "losing money."
The year 2018 will be the year of the global central bank's digital currency from any point of view of regulation, acceptance / criticism, and adoption, as mentioned by Wall Street editor-in-chief: The year 2018 will be the year of the global central bank's digital currency.
Big powers such as Russia have criticized Bitcoin's legitimacy as a way to make way for an official digital currency.
Xinhua News Agency, Madrid, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Barcelona's new aid Coutinho made his first appearance in a Barcelona shirt at the Nou Camp on Tuesday.
Coutinho passed Barcelona's medical that morning and signed with Barcelona president Bartomeu on a contract that is due to expire in the summer of 2023.
He then appeared as a Barcelona player in front of nearly 7,000 fans at the Nou Camp.
According to Spanish media, Coutinho's total transfer fee, which amounts to 160 million euros (about RMB7.77), is the first in the history of the Barcelona club and the Spanish capital.
With Coutinho still injured, he will have to rest for the next 20 days to make his debut in a Barcelona shirt.
What else is sacred?
Now Trump's White House is taking aim at the Statue of Liberty
The most sure sign of regime change was when they began to attack the statue.
Americans agree with this as much as anyone, so Saddam Hussein, of Paradise Square in Baghdad, was meticulously pulled down in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the key think tanks of the Trump administration, must have known what would happen to his symbolic axe to the Statue of Liberty during a heated debate with CNN's Jim Acosta over the president's proposal to severely restrict legal immigration.
To be fair, Miller did not attack the statue itself.
If he did, a group of cruise ship owners and liberal followers would surely eat him alive.
But he did attack the significance of the statue, especially when Emma Lazarus's famous poem was carved on the pedestal in 1903 (the monument was built 17 years later).
As Miller chided Acosta for saying, "I don't want to talk about all the facts of history here, but the Statue of Liberty is a symbol of America's freedom to light up the world ...
The poem you are referring to, which was later added, is not part of the original Statue of Liberty.
In fact, Miller was right, but as he himself put it, it wasn't really about history.
This involves the modern echo of Lazarus's exclamation, the only country that seems to invite not only any old immigrants, but also the poorest of the poor: "Your exhaustion, your poverty, or your huddled masses yearning to breathe freely, / Suffering people refuse your crowded beaches."
There is no "suffering people refuse" at the moment when our screens become more eye-catching.
Miller, who has not worked in literary commentary, made it clear that these people would not be welcome in the United States in the Trump era.
This conflict over the meaning of statues is part of a broader political and cultural war: it is in fact a conflict with the American spirit.
Lazarus, and her friends, who held events after her death to inscribe her verse on the pedestal, are well aware of the highly political nature of the behaviour they are taking part in.
The purpose of the sculpture is to express the connection between French and American republicanism through the ancient classical metaphor of the female incarnation of the Statue of Liberty.
Lazarus changed the meaning: in her poem, the image of a woman is no longer abstract, she wants to make a sound.
She gave herself a very different name: the mother of exile.
The combination of the poem and the painting was a successful feminist coup and a devastating blow to American nativism.
Just as Lazarus has changed the meaning of the statue, the right-wingers have been trying to change it back to its original meaning.
The great speaker, Rush Limbaugh, a baptist on Trump's arrival, argued in 2010 that liberalism was not an invitation to anyone, and that he was now an early neo-conservative who brought the flame of American wisdom to the world of folly: "The Statue of Liberty is brave enough to go forward.
She meant to carry the torch of freedom from the United States to other parts of the world.
The torch is not the way to light up the United States.
What is unusual is that Limbo is actually moved by something.
The significance of the statue depends entirely on the angle of cognition.
Lazarus's imaginative approach is to be able to see it, and when tired, poor but hopeful people will be able to see it on the deck of the ship after a long and often terrifying journey.
On the face of it, this involves looking at the world from the perspective of those who seek asylum and have the opportunity to improve their lives.
Her statue conveys to them the message of hope and welcome that they need to hear.
That, of course, is not the point that Miller and Trump had wanted to admit.
Their torches were not intended to light the road, but to ignite the hatred of their only source of strength.
In 2006, he joined Universal Records in a unique musical style, becoming the first Chinese to sign a contract with Universal's UK headquarters.
World Championships 2017: Neil Black speaks highly of Scotland players in the British national team
Eilidh Doyle recalled that there were only two Scots in the British national team at the time.
Neil Black, executive director of the British Athletics Association, said a team of 16 strong Scots in the World Championships team would make a significant contribution to the national team.
The number of Scottish field athletes selected for the 2017 London Athletics World Championships, which opened on Friday, was the highest in history.
Black believes that "Scotland is making extraordinary progress" and that British track and field athletes have to learn from it.
"We accept and try to understand this, and we will stick to it until we succeed," Black said.
"I spoke to people at the Scottish Institute of Sport, who thought it had something to do with what they were doing," he said.
Scottish track and field athletes think it has something to do with what they do.
The British Athletics Association believes it has something to do with their actions.
Even street people think so.
No matter what the situation is, it's extremely brilliant. '
A number of Scottish track and field athletes are medal contenders, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart, who will compete against Mo Farah in the 5,000 m, while Eilidh Doyle has been chosen by the team as captain.
'Ed was a bit modest.
Her captain's speech was unbelievable, "Black said.
"Many track and field athletes, whether or not they are Scots, or wherever they live or train, walk out of the door with pride and energy.
Ed's natural passion and true feelings are very good. "
The Commonwealth silver medallist, who will compete in the 400m hurdles in his 5th World Championships, said it was "inconceivable" that there were 16 Scots in the British national team.
Previously, the number of Scottish track and field athletes taking part in the World Series was up to seven, that is, the number of entries in 1983 and 2015.
Muir, a leading runner, has set five British and two European records in the past year.
She will compete in the 1,500 m and 5,000 m events.
Chris O 'Hare, who competed in the 1500m event, is another Scotland player to watch, having previously scored well in the season, winning both the British national qualifiers and the Olympic anniversary.
Doyle recalled her participation in the first world championship, when the only other Scot on the team was Lee McConnell.
The captain said she was deeply proud that so many of her compatriots would not only join the team but, in some cases, challenge the medals and compete for the finals.
"What's special about being captain of the national team is that it's voted for by the rest of the national team, so it's a great honour for me to know that your team-mates voted for you for the most extraordinary achievement," she added.
"Of course, I am very proud of all the Scottish players.
It just shows how far we've come.
And they are the old track and field athletes here, the track and field athletes who are about to make their way to the podium.
How was my captain's speech?
Well, I think it's great.
I have just referred to the fact that, in this case, we are very lucky because we hold the World Championships at home.
That is why it is really important that we build on our home support, as well as our return to the Olympic Stadium.
I'm going to get a second chance to play and the atmosphere there is going to be fantastic, "he said.

Blocking critics on Facebook: Don't run for office if you can't stand the censure of voters
The father of our country knows the style of bad media.
Americans love Washington, but it wasn't long before major newspapers began to lash out at him for everything from domestic policy to political principles.
He was annoyed by the criticism and there was no doubt about it.
But he did not silence the critics.
Because as early as 1783, Washington said, "Freedom of speech is denied-we will be slaughtered like lambs in silence and ignorance."
That reminds me of Maryland Governor Larry Hogan, who needs to learn from Washington.
Hogan's staff blocked and deleted posts from at least 450 people as they posted their views on his face book's official home page.
The American Civil Liberties Union filed a lawsuit against him earlier this week.
The governor's staff described the lawsuit as hasty, and online reports were filled with a backlash: "Who cares?"
A lot of people say, "It's just a face book."
But, this is important.
This is particularly important because it is facing people like Hogan.
It was a Republican who served as governor in a state with a democratic majority, and he was surprisingly popular.
Of the 50 governors in the country, he received the second highest praise.
Hogan is not a reactionary edgy.
He is smoothly in charge of Maryland and strictly follows the rules.
He is also very good at using Facebook as the main way to connect with voters, playfully showing off his bald head after chemotherapy for the first time on his home page.
So it's completely unnecessary and ultimately dangerous to block people from commenting on the governor's home page, which is a public forum and an official management platform for employees who are paid by the public.
In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan's spokeswoman, Amelia Shah, defended the governor's actions, saying she thought blocking their comments was simply an attempt to get them to exercise restraint.
But they are too hasty to describe it as a monster or a cynic sweeping the web.
The Washington Post spoke face-to-face with people who had been blocked by Hogan.
They are just ordinary people talking to their elected leaders: they are teachers, small business owners, and pastors, and they are not wild animals.
They have said that their comments have depth, respect, and are not obscene.
The priest quoted the Bible in his post, calling on Hogan to remember his Catholic faith.
Lakshmi Salma Ramani, a barrister in Bowie, Md., was not cynical, but she asked questions about hate crimes.
'I politely commented that I was disappointed that he did not respond to hate crimes and other recent news events,' she wrote in the Washington Post's News Story Review section.
I also don't like a bunch of people commenting on the same topic because they are directly ignored by some people who think they are so-called followers, not citizens who are worried about their country, "he said.
What the governor's staff described as a "dense bombardment of junk information" may seem to others to be "assertive."
The Facebook era makes it easy to modify a message, simply by blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment.
And it is far cleaner than it was in the past, when the same effect was achieved by sending staff out to collect and burn critical newspapers or to arrest or silence protesters.
But that is really what is happening right now, just on the digital level.
Hogan is not the first public official to be blamed for silencing others on Facebook and other social media.
President Trump is being sued by Twitter users for blocking them on Twitter.
There was a landmark ruling in Virginia last week on such issues.
According to U.S. District Judge James C. Kataris of Alexandria, the chairman of the Loudoun County Board of Supervisors violated the First Amendment by blocking voters from her Facebook home page.
Kentucky Governor Matt Bevan (R) was also patronized by the American Civil Liberties Union for his use of Facebook and Twitter.
It shouldn't be so hard.
In the Washington era, affordable postage and the Internet had a similar impact.
The number of newspapers quadrupled between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letters were written to criticise his leadership.
And even then, there was an anonymous torrent against him in Washington.
People use pseudonyms such as Ulrikra, Valerius, Bellisario, and Bojus to write letters to newspapers harshly criticizing Washington's decision-making.
According to historical documents collected by the George Washington newspaper's online project, his office has been inundated with petitions criticizing his attitude on the Treaty of Friendship, Trade and Navigation between His Majesty the King of England and the United States of America, signed with the United Kingdom.
But he did not silence them.
Freedom of speech, freedom of dissent and freedom of speech are the foundation of this country.
And real leaders need to accept that.
A glimmer of wind and grass in the real estate market is affecting people's sensitive nerves.
Restrictions are a hard bar for many urban real estate regulation policies.
In May 2017, Jinan introduced regulations for undergraduates to pay social security for half a year in a row, and to enjoy the same policy for local resident residents to purchase their homes;
In June, Wuhan issued a policy stipulating that college students will be able to settle down within three years of graduation with their diplomas and employment permits.
Subsequently, the policy added, the official said, "college students can buy a house at a price less than 20% of the market price ";
In July, Chengdu issued regulations, foreign university undergraduate degree and above the young talent, with a diploma can apply to settle in Chengdu.
In addition, Kunshan, Shanghai and other cities or regions have also introduced a "talent introduction" policy to reduce the threshold for people to buy a home.
Zhang thinks, this is actually the big cities for the population, especially the talent competition, the retention of the population, especially the talent, the city is competitive, this is the most important significance of these real estate policies.
Some even argue that this means that the time has come for the "restricted purchase" of the property market to be cancelled.

Ronan Lafferty looks forward to enjoying home at the Renaissance Club
The East Lothian Renaissance Club hosts the 25th Scottish Evergreen Open, and former European champion Ronan Lafferty will enjoy the feeling of returning home for the next three days.
The Northern Ireland man, who led Archfield Lynx next door to the final last year but lost to Paul Ills, now works for the new venue, representing the club's founder and chief executive, Jerry Salvati, as an ambassador for the event.
"I have witnessed the establishment of the Renaissance Club and we will witness its glory through this competition," Lafferty said.
The athletes will see the best face and the best form of the stadium.
Jerry set up the place beyond compare.
He is a keen supporter of the competition and is very proud of his achievements here.
This is the best stage to show this stadium.
England man Ils is looking forward to defending his title for the first time, although he has won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour in a 32-year career.
"It's really special," said the Shaosport athlete.
I didn't defend the Estremadura Open because in the second year of my win, the match was called off.
It feels amazing to come to this place.
It's wonderful to play golf here.
Last year's memories came to mind, and for me and my wife, Sharon, last year's win had a special meaning for us.
It was really a special memory that we will always remember.
Returning to the home race was Gary Orr, who turned 50 earlier this year and then played on the European Evergreen Tour.
This time he played in Scotland for the first time since the Scottish Open in 2013.
Mr Orr, of Helensburgh, said: "It will always make more sense to go home and play in the country.
You want to do well, but you can feel the extra pressure.
I really enjoy being able to play again, I've been playing golf.
I'm very pleased with the situation. '
Joining the in-court trio were former Masters winner Ian Woosnam and Evergreen tournament winners Paul Brodhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNeuti.
A total of six Scottish athletes on the field, Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance, are two of them, while the other four are Andrew O 'DeConn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Lomu and Ross Drummond.

Zou Shoumin, director of the Environmental Supervision Bureau of the Ministry of Environmental Protection of China, said in Beijing on Tuesday that in August, 57 cases of continuous daily punishment were carried out nationwide, and the new revised Environmental Protection Law, which was implemented earlier this year, clearly added to China's environmental law enforcement efforts.
At present, environmental protection authorities in various parts of China may investigate and punish environmental violations by means of continuous punishment on a daily basis, seizure, cut-off of production and transfer of administrative detention, and cooperate with the judicial authorities to punish environmental crimes.
In August, a total of 335 cases of seizure and seizure were carried out in various parts of China, 177 cases of limited production and cut-off were carried out, 189 cases of administrative detention were transferred and 166 cases of suspected environmental pollution crimes were transferred, Zou said.
Among them, Henan carries out 7 consecutive penalties on a daily basis, at present, China is from the end of the control to the whole process of embedding, full-scale environmental pollution control.
Despite the downward pressure on the economy, China's Ministry of Environmental Protection has previously made it clear that China should properly handle the positioning of environmental protection in economic development and enhance "green stability". The more the economy grows, the less it will be able to relax environmental protection and play the role of environmental protection in the optimization of the economy.
Without the highest, only higher, Guizhou Maotai share price in the innovative high road can not stop at all.
On January 9, the share price of A-share "Wang" Guizhou Maotai hit a new all-time high, closing at RMB782.52, with a total market value of RMB983 billion, just one step away from the trillion-dollar market value.
The guide price of RMB1499 was RMB200 higher than the previous retail price of RMB1299.
On December 28, 2017, Guizhou Moutai issued a notice saying that, as a result of the study, the price of Maotai wine products has been raised appropriately since 2018, with an average increase of about 18 percent.
The move spurred a surge in Guizhou Moutai's share price, which was up RMB95, or more than 14 percent, in the eight trading days since the announcement of the price increase, according to the Beijing Morning Post.
According to statistics, Guizhou Province's gross domestic product in the 1-3 quarter of 2017 was RMB950 billion, and Maotai's market capitalization left Guizhou Province's GDP far behind in the first three quarters of last year.
Driven by Moutai, liquor-listed companies have opened up the pace of price-raising control, sitting to enjoy the dividends brought by the upgrading of consumption.
Shares of most liquor-listed companies have continued to rise sharply since 2017, with shares of wells, Wuliangye, Shanxi Fenghuang, Guizhou Maotai and others more than doubling.

Russian media say Putin will have a new home-made car: 15% cheaper than Mercedes-Benz
MOSCOW, January 18 (Reuters)-Russian Minister of Industry and Trade Vladimir Manturov said the unit price of President Vladimir Putin's "motorcade" started at 600-7 million roubles, Russian media said.
The budget target is to keep prices 15% lower than Mercedes-Benz S-class cars.
Between late February and early March, the president's main research and development unit, the Russian National Institute of Automotive Engineering (NAMI), will deliver 16 vehicles to the Federal Security Service.
The "motorcade" project, which has a budget of 12.4 billion roubles, calls for the use of a unified modular platform to build three types of cars -- extended sedans, tri-vans and minibuses -- for the country's top people, the report said.
The news of the president's first home-made extended car since the Soviet Union came about five years ago, according to the research and development unit's plan to install an 800-horsepower engine and armor, weighing six tons.
It is reported that the German Porsche's engineering team has been involved in the development of the power plant.
Another Tass news agency reported on January 16 that Manturov told reporters that the "motorcade" series of cars will be available for retail from 2019, with all types of models available.
"From next year, all interested people will be able to order, whether it's bulletproof or luxury, without any sales restrictions," the minister said.
Russia's Ministry of Industry and Trade plans to increase the annual output of the "fleet" series to more than 1,000 vehicles after 2020.
"We are now producing 18 vehicles at full capacity, producing more than 70 this year, 200 next year and 300 or more the following year," Manturov said.

Poverty and Death in Jinzhou, Indonesia
Badmina Djay doesn't use the stove when she's cooking.
She doesn't even use a pot.
Her log cabin is located in Enarotari, the capital of Paniai County in Indonesia's Papua province, and the housewife usually just puts a sweet potato-which locals call "nota"-directly into the fire.
Half an hour later, the charred sweet potato was eagerly picked up by a pair of unwashed hands and gobbled up.
Dai Jie sat on the mud-she had no furniture, and this was where she did her daily household chores, such as washing clothes, and the water was so muddy that it came from the nearby marshes.
There is a bucket in a room without a roof, and this is the outdoor toilet.
She was the youngest of her husband's four wives, so she was not assigned to the field to take care of her.
Polygamy is common here.
Of course it's dangerous to work at a party: most of the men in the village don't have a job, and a lot of them are drunk, plus there are a lot of soldiers here.
"No one dared to walk around the village after 5pm," she said.
It was a rare glimpse into everyday life in the highlands of Papua, once a Dutch colony that was incorporated into Indonesia after the 1969 referendum, but that referendum was also controversial, when only 1,026 elders were forced to vote by a show of hands in front of the occupying forces.
The current campaign for independence and opposition to Dutch rule quickly took aim at the Jakarta government, which has imposed high-handed rule on the region, isolating foreign journalists and activists.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into the provinces of Papua and West Papua, while Papua New Guinea had independent control of the eastern part of the island.
Enarotari is remote and uninhabited; it takes a 90-minute flight from the provincial capital, Chayapra, to Nabil, and a five-hour rental car ride, all the way through the stomach.
There is no public transport here.
In this town of about 19,000 people, the wooden house is surrounded by bamboo fences, and the wrinkled iron roof is a variety of rust-colored coverings.
Few Indonesians come in, not to mention journalists, and there are few foreigners.
Before the arrival of the Christian evangelist, the Mee Pago Papuans believed in a god called Uga Tamee.
There are other changes here, too.
"We can't get used to these clothes," she said, referring to her brightly colored hand-woven turban, dark shirt and bright half-skirt.
"We used to cover our bodies with leaves."
Papua is the poorest province in Indonesia, where 28% of the population lives below the poverty line and is the region with the highest infant mortality rate and the lowest literacy rate in Asia.
But this is also the Golden State of Indonesia.
Paniai County is located in the Highlands, about the same size as New Jersey, with 153,000 people, and the world's largest and most profitable gold mine, Grasberg, is just 60 miles from here, owned by Phoenix-based Philips McMoran Copper Gold Co.
In 2015 alone, Philips mined about US $3.1 billion worth of gold and copper mines here.
In addition, Papua is rich in timber resources, with an estimated value of US $78 billion.
But these rich resources are also the source of the Papuans' tragedy, and Indonesia's powerful military forces have been able to suppress them all the time.
According to a 2005 New York Times survey, Philips paid nearly US $20 million to local military personnel and troops between 1998 and 2004, up to US $150,000 for an official alone.
The Papuans' growing desire for independence threatened the golden lord, and they were subjected to cruel treatment.
More than half a million Papuans have been killed since 1969, and thousands have been raped, tortured and imprisoned by the Indonesian army, according to activists.
According to the Asian Commission on Human Rights, the mass killings in the Barbuda tribal highlands in the 1970s had escalated into genocide.
Last year alone, Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful protesters.
A 2016 report by the Catholic Diocese of Brisbane, "We Will Lose Everything," included evidence of the evils of the previous year, such as extrajudicial executions, torture-another report said rape and electricity were particularly common-and a brutal crackdown on peaceful demonstrations.
"Violence is happening every day, so it is difficult to calculate the number of victims," said Andrias Halsano, an Indonesian researcher at Human Rights Watch.
Barbuda's resources attracted large numbers of immigrants from outside Indonesia, and oppression began.
Eighty-three% of the province's 3.5 million people are Christians, but the demographic structure has changed since the arrival of Muslim economic migrants from the densely populated islands of Java, Kalimantan, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
The Java snack stand sells fried chicken and vegetables mixed with gardo, served with peanut butter.
The locals fought hard.
Apos Yew, a 24-year-old Paniai native who moved to the provincial capital of Chayapra to find work, explained that "those immigrants started selling chicken and vegetables in the traditional market at a lower price than the local Papuans.
This has left the local Papuans -- the Mama-ma women -- without their markets, "he said.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, often referred to as Jokowi, vowed to address inequality and abuse of power in Papua during his 2014 campaign.
The one-time carpenter's path to the presidential palace in Jakarta has been supported by 27 of all 29 districts-including Paniai.
But Papua has not changed anything, and today, the locals feel betrayed.
"We were heartbroken, and in 2014 we voted for Zokovi in the hope that he would live up to our wishes and restore fairness," Yu said.
In fact, just two months after Jokowi took office in October, Paniai suffered one of the worst nightmares.
On December 7, 2014, 11 children in Enarotari were singing Christmas carols in front of a bonfire outside when two Indonesian soldiers rushed over on a motorcycle.
The frightened children told them to turn on the headlights.
One of the soldiers, unhappy with their tone, then returned with four soldiers, according to the local priest, Yvette Tebbe.
The victims and witnesses said the drunken soldiers chased the group of children with their guns.
Then one of the soldiers fired a gun at the group of children.
16-year-old Julianus Yimmer was in a coma after being badly beaten.
A few hours later, a fire broke out in a nearby government agency, the Electoral Commission building, and the incident escalated the next day.
About 1,000 young Papua men, women and children gathered at a football field in front of the local police station and the military command centre to demand justice.
With ceremonial hunting bows, they danced the waita of the Baba Mee Pago tribe-running around in circles and imitating birdsong.
Some of the protesters began throwing stones at regular military posts.
According to an official document seen by Time magazine, as the mood continued to intensify, the soldiers received orders via internal radio: "If the crowd resisted more than three times, shoot immediately," but the document was not released to local media.
Jeremiah Kayamu, 56, the leader of the Kego Koto neighbourhood in Enarotali, sensed the imminent danger and called on the crowd to calm down and plead for them to return home.
But no one was in the mood to listen to him.
He stood on the porch of his brightly coloured log cabin and told Time magazine that "when I turned my head back, my left wrist was suddenly shot."
Khayamu still doesn't know who fired the gun, but he said the bullet came from among the assembled soldiers.
He added, "It was crowded at the time, and they fired a lot of shots."
He witnessed the shooting and saw Olfjus Yul shot three times in the body, according to the cousin of the local man, Olfjus Ur.
Uhanes sadly told Time magazine, "I ran over to check his body to see if it was him.
I found him dead ... I kissed him. '
Papua Police Chief Inspector Ujay Mende told reporters that his subordinates were only "protecting" the police station because it had been attacked.
"When someone threatens to kill us, we have to defend ourselves," said Phugio Sulistio, a Papua police spokesman and police chief in 2015.
It is a matter of life and death.
Five young protesters were killed and many more injured, according to Human Rights Watch.
The next day the news of the killing spread only slowly in Jakarta.
Three weeks later, Zokovi gave an impassioned speech in Chayapra, expressing deep sympathy for the families of the victims and vowing to address the abuse of power left over from Papua's history.
"I hope this case will be resolved as soon as possible so that this will not happen again in the future," he said.
In October 2016, Security Minister Villando said he would set up a non-judicial mechanism to address the historical legacy of human rights violations.
But the excuse for getting rid of it almost immediately rang out.
"Most of the violations took place a long time ago," he said.
Some were in the 1990s and early 2000.
The point is that we are committed to addressing these violations, but it needs to be a process, "he said.
Then on June 5 in Jakarta, Villando, in a conversation with Time magazine, said he had no plans to set up a complaint mechanism in Papua.
Instead, he said, "everything will be settled in accordance with the law."
The United Nations has filed a complaint against Villando for "crimes against human rights" over the deaths of more than 1,000 people in East Timor's bloody independence vote in 1999, but he says 11 human rights violations in the Papua region have been resolved, including the Paniai incident.
The families of the victims of the Paniai incident scoffed at these remarks.
"I've been interviewed four times in the last three years, but things haven't progressed at all," Uhannes said.
Years later he said, "I'm tired."
He still lives in fear.
He said, "I'm scared.
I'm afraid of being arrested by the army, and I'm afraid of being shot. '
His brother, Yukabus, also believed that the people of Paniai were afraid to talk about the incident.
He said he was beaten by the military after helping to bury the four victims.
"After the body was buried, the military came to me," he said.
The shooting didn't stop.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police shot villagers in Deyai County, a neighboring county of Paniai.
A construction company manager refused to help transport a comatose man to hospital after clashes broke out between the two sides, killing one person and injuring 17 others, including children.
Man Ravinus Dowu, 24, drowned while fishing by a nearby river and died on his way to the hospital.
Angry villagers protested in front of the company's on-site office.
Police said the villagers threw stones at the officers, so they fired warning shots.
But the anti-riot mobile unit (Indonesian paramilitary police) began shooting at the crowd and one person was killed.
"We were all panicked at the time and now we're scared they're going to retaliate," Doming Valley Buddy, 29, told TIME, who was living near the hospital when he witnessed the wounded being rushed to the hospital.
"I stayed at home for two days."
The Djayi parliament has called for the police to be brought to justice and for riot control mobile units to be withdrawn from the area.
Paniai has always been a place of right and wrong for the Indonesian government.
The lack of effective development breeds discontent among the peoples of the Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal tribes, which are scattered in the lush central highlands of Paniai.
Many have joined the Free Papua Movement (OPM), a rebel army that claims to protect the rights of the Papuans by dispersing attacks and raids on Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the top leaders of the Free Papua Movement were born in Paniai, including Tadyus Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
As a result, in recent years, thousands of Paniai have been arrested and deliberately detained by the military under the guise of "safeguarding national sovereignty".
Some people never showed up again.
In the eyes of the Papuans, Paniai is a "forgotten place of tragedy."
Poverty breeds discontent.
Enarotari is selling so little rice that locals can't afford to buy it at all.
Bread is simply out of reach.
People here grow everything they can eat: mainly sweet potatoes and some fruit and leafy vegetables.
Farming is a woman's job, and every woman can take care of four or five sweet potato fields.
They usually leave most of the harvest for writers and sell the rest on the local market.
Ten sweet potatoes are worth only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Over time, economic inequality has opened up among the local Papuans and new immigrants, whose numbers have increased significantly since the opening of the new route to Nabil airport.
The small amount of work available usually falls into the hands of better-educated and wealthier immigrants.
Papuans rarely have the capital or the necessary skills to run competitive companies.
"Young people don't want to stay in this village ... because there are no jobs and no money here," said John Gobai, president of the Paniai Tribal Council.
Papua is isolated.
In addition, restrictions on international media coverage remain tight.
Earlier this year, French journalists Frank Escoudi and Basel Longchamp were expelled from Papua because they "did not cooperate with the relevant agencies," even if they had been given a rare authorization to shoot.
According to Felim Kaine, deputy director of Asia at Human Rights Watch, Zokovi's election vow to lift reporting restrictions to promote transparency and development has not been fulfilled.
"If foreign journalists try to cover Papua and West Papua, Indonesia's most eastern disgruntled provinces, they are at a new risk: denial of visas and blacklisting," he said in a statement.
The lack of media oversight means that international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely confined to Papua's neighbours.
In March, six Pacific countries-Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands, Solomon Islands-asked the United Nations Human Rights Council to investigate "all kinds of widespread human rights violations" in Papua, including the Paniyah shooting.
These countries have also supported the Free Papua Movement.
Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesman Almanata Nasir, who did not care about the group's allegations, told reporters in Jakarta that "democracy is still in place in Indonesia and the media is free, so the evidence of human rights violations is hard to hide."
Locals want more attention from foreign governments.
On May 4, when Dutch human rights ambassador Case Van Barr led a delegation of officials to Chayapra, the local people broke their silence and begged, "We want freedom," according to a person familiar with the matter, who also attended the meeting but asked for anonymity.
Indonesia is due to hold its next presidential election in 2019, but Papua says they are unlikely to vote for Zokovi again.
"Zokovi's intentions were good, but he was surrounded by people who were involved in the Paniai shooting," said Gobai, president of the Tribal Council.
He wanted Zokovi to know that the Paniai people not only lived under the threat of a greedy army, but had nothing, that there was little education in the region, and that public health services were scarce.
Gobai said the Paniai people, like other Papuans, believed that their vote for Zokovi was a debt that he had to pay.
"They don't need money, they need justice," he said.
Even under threat and intimidation, the families of the victims of the Paniai shooting made their last symbolic protest: burying the body of a victim opposite the military police post.
They know that justice may never come, but at least they won't let the culprits forget their crimes.
Yuchabus bowed his head and said, "My family has been killed.
What else can we do?
On February 10, 2017, the CSRC approved the initial application of Guangdong Shang Pin Homestead Home Co., Ltd., and issued the SSE Small and Medium Board Listing Pass, more than 20 days after the start of the IPO.
Industry insiders believe that, with the sale of the condominium and the heel of the Opie home, the custom home area, which is already in the air, will be changed from product competition to capital competition.

BEIJING, Sept 9 (Reuters)-Samsung Electronics Inc on Tuesday released its first set of self-driving car components, developed with Harman International, as well as information entertainment solutions, an important step in the company's push into the automotive electronics market, according to Reuters.
Samsung Electronics bought Haman International about a year ago.
At this week's Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas, Samsung released car cameras with collision warnings, lane offset warnings, and cruise control features that were developed in partnership with Haman.
Samsung plans to start shipping the camera system this year, which is built on technologies such as automatic machine learning and expansion of reality.
Samsung has also shown a "digital cockpit" that makes the vehicle more personal, even if the driver is not the owner, because the system allows users to download the driver's data from mobile devices and clouds.

Fire engulfs Dubai's "Torch" Ferris Tower again
A fire broke out in one of the world's tallest residential buildings in Dubai on Friday, forcing hundreds of residents to flee the 337-metre, 79-storey super-tall building.
It was the second fire to sweep high-rise buildings in just two years, and happened to be in the tower known as the Torch.
The building has been evacuated, no injuries have been reported and no cause of the fire has been found.
"We were sleeping and then we were woken up by a fire alarm and people started screaming.
We ran down the stairs and it took about 10 minutes to run down the 50th floor, "a resident named George told Reuters.
The fire brigade extinguished the blaze at around 4:00 local time (0000 Greenwich Mean Time) and is cooling the building, Dubai's civil defense authorities said.
The government says it is working to provide shelter for those affected.
The accident is likely to rekindle concerns around the world about the safety of high-rise buildings using external wall materials.
An investigation by the management of the Torch skyscraper following its fire in 2015 found that most of the damaged objects were cladding panels for decoration and insulation.
British police have said they believe problems with the insulation and cladding system at the Grenfell Tower in London may have contributed to the rapid spread of the fire in June, which killed about 80 people.
The Williams team also hinted that Massa could return, even though he has announced his retirement.
On January 9, just one month before the opening of the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea, the atmosphere of the Winter Olympics in South Korea grew stronger as the relay of the Olympic flame from the south to the north was preheated and preparations were under way.
South Korean public opinion expects the long-lost inter-Korean talks to bring an "egg" to the one-month countdown to the Pyeongchang Winter Games.
The Olympic flame arrived in South Korea on November 1 last year.
The surge of the flame is directly reflected in ticket sales for the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics.
Just over two months ago, ticket sales for the Pyeongchang Winter Games hovered at 32%, and for the Winter Paralympic Games at 4.3%. The low rate of ticket sales was once a source of concern for the popularity of the Pyeongchang Winter Games.
But as Lee Hee-fan, chairman of the Pyeongchang Winter Games Organizing Committee, recently predicted to reporters, "As the Olympic flame passes through South Korea, the heat of the Winter Games is rising, and it is believed that ticket sales will soon improve."
As of January 3, ticket sales for the Pyeongchang Winter Games had reached 64 percent, according to South Korean media, and the sales rate for the Winter Paralympic Games had exceeded 50 percent.
In an effort to encourage foreigners to visit South Korea, South Korea's Ministry of Justice also announced on Tuesday that it would extend its stay in South Korea for up to 120 days for foreigners visiting the Pyeongchang Winter Games.
More than one in five U.S. travelers take prohibited items on board, survey finds
A survey of aircraft passengers found that more than 20% of passengers had deliberately or unintentionally carried illegal items through the U.S. Transportation Security Administration checkpoint, with at least 6% of passengers unintentionally carrying prohibited knives or other bladed objects on board.
Less than 1% of passengers claimed that they only found out afterwards that they were travelling by mistake with guns, ammunition or explosives.
The survey of more than 1,000 people, conducted by charter services firm Stratos Jet Charters Inc., also found that young travelers were more likely to blatantly ignore the rules.
Of the respondents who admitted to trying to deliberately carry TSA prohibited items on board, 19.7 percent were millennials, compared with less than 15 percent of the X-generation population.
The most common items that deliberately slip through TSA security personnel are food and drink.
More than 3% admitted to deliberately carrying bladed items through security, while 2.2% of female respondents and 3.7% of male respondents also said they had deliberately taken prohibited drugs on board.
The company said the survey was carried out by travelers across the country to find out the number of people who accidentally and intentionally carried embargoed items through the plane's security check-in.
Not surprisingly, the people most likely to carry embargoes through security-intentionally or unintentionally-are the ones who fly most frequently.
However, the company points out that the TSA guidelines are a bit complex and difficult to understand.
People are usually not sure what and how much liquid they can carry.
So it is no surprise that the TSA seized the most illegal liquids.
At one point, it was thought that the TSA might have used books as an embargo.
Domestic flights are allowed to carry liquids, but international flights are not allowed.
EPA chief Robert Plutt changes his mind on Obama-era emissions cuts
A day after being sued by 15 states, EPA chief Scott Plutt reversed his earlier decision to delay the implementation of Obama-era regulations to reduce emissions of smog air pollutants.
Plutt proposed the change because the EPA was able to respond more quickly to the needs of state agencies that regulate the environment than previous governments.
He did not mention the legal challenge brought by the Federal Court of Appeal against his former position.
The controversy centers on setting the October 1 deadline for states to begin meeting the 2015 ground-level ozone standards.
In June, Plutt announced that he would delay compliance for a year in order to give the EPA more time to study the program and avoid "interfering with local decision-making or hampering economic growth."
Prior to his appointment by President Donald Trump, Plutt was Oklahoma's attorney general and had long opposed the strictness of environmental regulations.
Since arriving in Washington, Plutt has repeatedly moved to block or delay regulations opposed by the chemical and fossil fuel industries.
Wednesday's abrupt reversal is the latest legal hurdle on Plutt's regulatory return agenda.
Last month, a federal appeals court in Washington ruled that the head of the EPA had exceeded his authority in an attempt to delay the implementation of the Obama administration's rules requiring oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leaks.
In a statement released Wednesday night, Pruitt offered a sharp turn in his approach to ozone standards, saying he would strengthen the EPA's commitment to work with states to adopt complex procedures to reach new standards.
"Under the previous administration, the EPA generally did not meet the specified deadline and then waited for activist groups and others to sue before agreeing to set a specified timetable through an agreement," said Mr Pruitt, who has launched more than a dozen prosecutions against the EPA in his previous work.
"We don't believe in regulation through litigation, and we take the deadline seriously," he said.
We also take the regulations and the authorities seriously.
Nonetheless, the EPA statement said Pruitt may once again use his "extension authorization and all other legally available authorizations" to ensure that the provisions are in line with "good policy and the best information available."
Republicans in Congress are pushing for a broad overhaul of the ozone layer.
The House bill, which was approved last month, aims to delay implementation of the 2015 rule by at least eight years.
The measure has not yet been voted on in the Senate.
New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman led a coalition of states to sue the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency this week, saying it intends to maintain legal pressure.
"The reversal of the EPA-after we filed the lawsuit-is a significant victory for the health and safety of 6.7 million New Yorkers, with more than 115 million American communities directly affected by smoke emissions," Schneiderman said.
California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington State, as well as the District of Columbia, joined New York State in the case.
Ground-level ozone is formed by the reaction of common pollutants emitted by cars, power plants, refineries, chemical plants and other sources under sunlight in the atmosphere.
The resulting smoke can cause serious breathing problems for sensitive people, causing thousands of premature deaths each year.
Public health advocates and environmentalists, of course, cheered Plutt's surprising shift.
Lori Ann Byrd, of the Center for Biological Diversity, said: "It is disturbing that this common-sense measure is under enormous pressure from the head of the department that protects the air we need to breathe."
"We have to fight to the end with the Trump administration's ideological campaign to cater to polluters and special interest groups," he said.

Since the second half of 2009, sales of flowers and trees in Xiaoshan have remained relatively high, especially this spring, when sales of seedlings in Xiaoshan reached an all-time high, with a huge increase in sales and prices. According to statistics, sales of seedlings in Xiaoshan District increased by 48% between January and June this year compared with the same period last year, with the biggest increase in nearly 20 years.
Shi Haiyong, deputy director of Xiaoshan District Forestry Bureau, said that along with the good sales situation, Xiaoshan flower and wood production has also made a relatively rapid development.
In the past two years, the planting area of Xiaoshan flowers and trees has expanded by 30,000 mu, with a total area of 180,000 mu. At the same time, Xiaoshan seedling farmers have been actively developing outside the area, setting up flower and wood bases in various parts of the country to reach 80,000 mu, an increase of 30,000 mu compared to 2008.
At the same time, the planting area has been expanded, the quality of seedlings has been improved, the value of nursery beds has been raised, large-scale, high-quality seedlings have been retained more, and some seedlings have been reluctant to sell.
Shi Haiyong also warned that in the face of the current boom in production and marketing, producers should be calm, objective analysis, not only to see that the social demand for flowers and trees will be long-term, increasing, but also to recognize that the market will be more competitive.
BEIJING, July 13 (Reuters)-The U.S. company Somaltus filed a lawsuit in the East Texas District Court accusing Apple of violating a battery technology patent it filed in 2010.
The company has previously used the same patents to sue Asus, Lenovo, Samsung, Sony and Toshiba.
Both the iPhone 6s and similar Apple devices violated the U.S. patent 7,657,386, known as the Integrated Battery Service System, the lawsuit said.
The plaintiff would like to receive cash compensation or a patent fee for the infringing equipment after the judgment has been announced.
Judging by the indictment, the plaintiffs appear to believe that the iPhone's fast-charging feature infringes on the company's patents.
The fast-charging iPhone will quickly charge up to 80% of the electricity, followed by a trickle charge.
Somaltus is actually a so-called "patent hooligan" because the company does not offer obvious products and services, and it is difficult to find information online.
However, they have successfully reached an out-of-court settlement with automakers such as Ford and Nissan over the patent.
The meeting held that accelerating the development of information technology, promoting the integration of resources, making efficient use of them, and raising the level of digitization and intelligence of industries are of great significance to the promotion of "Made in China 2025" and mass entrepreneurship, mass innovation, the cultivation of new kinetic energy and the improvement of the quality of life of the masses.
Taiwan's hot-blooded youth film "Six Caf é", starring Dong Zi-jian, is the film of the festival's media awards competition, while another Chinese-language film, "Sunderland," starring him, is also shortlisted for the main competition unit to compete for the Golden Viscount Award.
The 23-year-old, dressed in a camouflage T-shirt, black sweatpants and youthful sunshine, sat directly on the floor because there were not enough chairs in the interview room and said, "Come on, it's good to talk about it."
It was previously revealed that the railway department expanded the 12306 website, introduced a new service during the Spring Festival ticket purchase period, and nearly 60% of tickets no longer need to use the verification code.
Trump has pressed Mexico to pay for border wall construction, according to leaked phone records
The Washington Post leaked records of calls between U.S. President Donald Trump and the leaders of Mexico and Australia.
On January 27, in a call to Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto, Trump urged him to stop publicly saying he would not pay for the proposed border wall.
The President of the United States reportedly expressed his displeasure at his public attack on the wall, with Patron allegedly telling him: "You don't tell the media."
During his presidential campaign, Trump promised to build the wall on the southern border of the United States and solemnly announced that Mexico would pay for the project.
A transcript of his call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has also been released, which shows a tense exchange between them.
Mr Trump told Mr Turnbull that it was "ridiculous", "nasty" and "stupid" for the US to take on the deal to repatriate refugees to Australia, and that he had advised the US to ban refugee resettlement, while now insisting on a deal brokered by the Obama administration would make him look like a "fool."
Trump hung up after telling Turnbull that "this is the most unpleasant call of the day."

Moore Beach massacre: Activists recreate racist lynchings and deliver justice
A 1948 Ford Mercury car rumbles through a crowd of bystanders in the small town of Monroe, Georgia, toward the tiny Moore Beach Bridge.
The vehicle, carrying four black passengers and a white driver, blocked the car's path before it reached the bridge as a group of white men with guns approached.
The leader of the mob, a middle-aged man in a pinstriped suit, took a deep puff of cigars and glanced into the windshield.
The passengers in the car were filled with fear.
"We want-Roger!" the man shouted.
"Get him out of the car!"
A young black man was dragged from the front passenger seat and screamed through the silence.
Fortunately, the terrible scene on July 22 was just a repeat.
But when "Roger" had a noose around his neck, almost all the onlookers gave a real gasp.
Since 2005, civil rights activists have returned to the Moore Beach Bridge to recreate scenes from the night two black couples-Roger and Dorothy Malcom, as well as George and Mel Dorsey-were lynched by the Ku Klux Klan in 1946.
No one has ever been charged with murder.
"Although we know who they are, even though we have seen them in the community, it is incredible that none of them have been arrested over the years," said Tyrone Brooks, who helped organize the repeat.
"This is a stain on history, a burden on our souls."
Brooks, 71, is a former Georgia congressman and lifelong activist.
For him, a repeat is a compelling call to action, an annual reminder to the people of the Monroe community that injustice has never been corrected.
"We want to sue, we want to close the case, we want to heal, we want to reconcile, but we have to get justice first," he said.
"Unless we get justice, we don't get healing and reconciliation."
On July 27, 1946, the coroner covered the body of a Moore Beach lynch victim with a sheet.
According to FBI files obtained by NBC News, more than 50 men from Monroe and surrounding counties are suspected of being involved in lynchings.
But none of them have been prosecuted.
While suspects have been at large for decades, civil rights activists say the dual motive for lynching is well known throughout the town: politics and sex.
In April 1946, a Supreme Court ruling allowed black citizens of Georgia to vote in the primaries for the first time later that summer.
Around the same time, according to the FBI, black tenant farmer Roger Malcolm assassinated white landowner Barnett Hurst in a struggle-looking like it was for a woman.
Brooks said the rumour in the town was that Hurst slept with Malcolm's wife, Dorothy, and that her baby was not her husband's.
On July 25, 1946, Roy Harrison, a prominent white landowner, paid US $600 to bail Malcolm out of prison, the FBI said.
Dorothy and her cousins, Mike Murray and George Dorsey, accompanied him to prison.
But as they returned from prison and made their way to the Moore Beach Bridge, a mob of lynching thugs surrounded the car.
"It turned out that it was Harrison who organized and ordered the murder to be carried out," an FBI report concluded.
"It is clear that there is a conspiracy between state and local law enforcement, who are not only involved in the murder, destroying the evidence, but also concealing the identity of the witness."
Brooks is very brief and to the point.
"This is a tragic case of voting rights," he said.
"They were killed, and it was the killer who sent a message to the black people in this community: 'If you sign up and vote, you're going to have the same outcome.'"
For nearly a decade, Cassandra Green has been in charge of the annual replay of the Moore Beach Bridge lynchings.
Her presentation was vivid and gripping, with a deeply racist background that many hoped would no longer exist in the United States.
It's hard to see, it's harder not to see, but Green says that's the point.
"We don't want to talk about lynchings because they make us face the ugly side of everyone," she said.
'But if you don't listen to me, or you don't hear me tell my own story, I can't have a relationship with you.'
This year's show began in June, with nearly 30 actors-more than a dozen white and the rest black-huddled in a room on the first day to hear Green release a rehearsed overview of the show.
Wade Marbaugh serves as Green's co-director.
For years, he played the role of the Ku Klux Klan, but he said it was never easy.
"I feel dirty because I'm not such a person," Malabo said.
"But I think it's important to keep this history alive because we don't want to go back to that time."
In the room, actors Darios Bradshaw and Nick Lacona, who play Roger Malcolm and Barnett Hearst, rehearse their lines.
The play begins with Malcolm yelling and pushing Hurst away, angry that he had slept with his wife, Dorothy.
"I said, get out of my place!"
Lascola shot back.
Then they began to fight.
Then everyone (at least all the black actors) burst into laughter.
Green laughs the most.
"What's the matter?!" asked Lascola.
He was alarmed and confused.
Did I go too far?
"No," Green said with a smile.
"I just don't think white people will say'ah 'when they fight back."
"Yes," quipped another black actor.
"You have to be tough."
In this way, the energy in the room changed; the feeling of affection drove away the discomfort.
Everyone tried to do so, not only to perform the play, but also to remember the four victims.
The scene starts again.
This time, when Lascona said the word "ah", the tone was sharp and powerful.
No one laughed.
The replay came to a strong and swift end.
Screams, gunshots, and then there was silence.
A woman in funeral black stood by the actor's body and sang Billie Halliday's words of mourning, "Strange Fruit."
Her voice weighed over the other words.
A hundred yards away, about forty spectators wiped away sweat and tears.
Black and white make up almost half of the audience.
A couple came to see the show from Ithaca, New York, and there were a lot of people living near the road.
Brooks took them to Malcolm and Dorothy's graveyard to worship, nearly eight hours away, and everyone was enduring Georgia's unsavoury heat.
Until then, the murderer was still a mystery, but now, standing on the same land where lynchings took place, the air was filled with anxiety.
When the final notes of the song disappeared, Green asked people to come near to examine the bodies played by the actors.
The children bent down and looked at the fake blood and bodies and whispered to each other.
"They're not really dead," a little boy muttered, as if to remind himself.
A few minutes later, Green thanked the crowd and the show was over.
The actor shook off the lynch rope and wiped away the tears.
Bradshaw hugs Malbaugh, the suit man who plays the leader of the Ku Klux Klan.
Nick Lascana hugs two of his colleagues, sobbing in their arms; the emotion in the performance eventually infects him.
"It doesn't matter," one of the women whispered.
'We know you don't have that in your heart.
You do it for a reason.
After that, the audience sat down to dinner with the actor.
At the same table, a white couple from Atlanta had an intimate chat with a black couple they had just met to talk about a repeat.
Denise Duplinsky found it hard to find words to describe how she felt after watching.
"It's hard to imagine those terrible words and actions ... actually being spoken and made by people like you, because they look like you," she said.
"For me, it really makes me think the lynching is still going on," she added, "and now this kind of thing is just called police shooting."
In the room, Tyrone Brooks sat at the table watching, tasting and reflecting on civil rights.
He said he had started planning for next year's show.
"Replay is an inspiring way, because it describes the horrors we have experienced, but it is also very educational," he said.
"If you don't learn from it, this kind of thing could happen again.
Those who do not study and do not know their own history are doomed to repeat it.
For the market-oriented reform of natural gas, the importance of "independent pipeline network" reform is self-evident, but the resistance and controversy are also great.
The reporter learned from Hebei Kailuan Group that at 11.25 am on July 7, there was an explosion in the emulsification workshop of Kailuan Group Chemical Co., Ltd. in Tangshan City, Hebei Province, and 13 workers were trapped at the scene.
So far, one of the 13 people trapped has been rescued and rushed to hospital, while the remaining 12 are in intensive search and rescue.
It is understood that the scene has been cordoned off, the local public security, fire, medical and other departments are on-site rescue.
According to witnesses, there was a loud noise at the time of the incident, and a mushroom cloud shot up in the air.
According to the Kailuan Group personnel who organized the search and rescue at the scene, Tangshan Kailuan (Group) Chemical Co. Ltd. is located in the north of Zhao Gaozhuang, the ancient smelter district of Tangshan City, Hebei Province. It is a designated production enterprise for civil blasting equipment approved by the state. It was built in 1958, formerly known as Kailuan Mineral Bureau 6 O 2 factory.

US media: Scientists at China Air Force Engineering University study laser satellites for the removal of space debris
Chinese scientists have come up with a bold and innovative proposal to use large lasers to clean up messy Earth orbits and destroy old satellites and their sky waste, US media said on Monday.
Researchers at China Air Force Engineering University have written a paper entitled "Space-based Laser Removal of Small-Scale Space Debris Variable Orbital Model Study," which describes how space debris can be irradiated into smaller, less harmful pieces by using space-based platform lasers, according to Newsweek's website on January 15.
Space waste has been a concern for international space agencies for years, and NASA has considered a variety of options to track, detect and remove man-made debris, the report said.
The way to remove large-scale space debris includes giant nets used to clean up and collect waste, as well as magnets that can be used to suck them out of orbit. Chinese scientists conducted laser simulation studies and concluded that this would be an effective way to clean up the Earth's orbit.
"[Simulation research] provides the necessary theoretical basis for the application of space debris removal technology in space-based platforms," the paper's summary said.
A 2014 study by U.S. defense giant Lockheed Martin found that there are about 200 threats a day for satellites in orbit.
High-speed debris moving along Earth's orbit is seen as a serious threat to future space missions and has been described as a "deadly chain of threats" by experts at the European Space Agency, where high-speed debris has continued to grow over the past year.
Space is largely empty, but the space next to the Earth is becoming more crowded, and every satellite we send into space will eventually become another piece of debris orbiting the Earth, which will accumulate over time, according to the website of the American Journal of Popular Mechanics.
The more debris, the more likely a still-functioning satellite is to be hit by debris, thereby damaging or destroying an investment worth millions of dollars.
All space agencies have plans to get rid of space debris in the future, the report said.
NASA is considering using jet gas to reduce the speed of debris and get it out of orbit, Europe is considering launching a satellite carrying a large net to capture debris and bring it back to Earth, and Japan's idea is to capture debris with an electric chain.
For now, China has also come up with a solution to space junk, using a large laser to smash floating space junk into smaller, less harmful pieces.
According to a paper published in the German journal Optics by a group of researchers at the Chinese Air Force Engineering University, the installation of such a laser on a satellite would be effective enough to clean up space, at least according to the simulation results.
The only way to prove effectiveness is to test it, and there are no plans for such a mission, but perhaps sooner or later someone will install a laser on a satellite and send it into space, the report said.
Once done, we can finally begin to eliminate the problem of space junk once and for all.

Pearson Group to cut 3,000 more jobs, slash dividend to revive business
British education group Pearson said on Friday it would cut 3,000 more jobs and cut its interim dividend by 72% as it embarked on another restructuring project to deal with business pressures.
Chief executive John Fallon said most of the job cuts would take place in the second half of 2018 and the first half of 2019, after the previous restructuring had cut 4,000 jobs.
In May, the group announced plans to cut another 300 million pounds (US $394 million) in its third cost-cutting project to revive businesses hit by the rapid growth of digital learning.
Last month, the company agreed to sell its stake in Penguin Random House to partner Bertelsmann and published a report that its underlying sales rose 1% to £2.05 billion in the first half, but said the outlook for the year was unchanged.
A few days ago, the China Tian Association issued a serious notice, severely beat the phenomenon of running, and was prepared to impose a life-long ban on violators.
NATO soldiers killed by suicide bombing in convoy Kabul
A military convoy has been hit by a suicide bomber in the Afghan capital, Kabul, killing a NATO soldier and injuring several others, according to official sources.
The NATO statement said five soldiers and an interpreter were injured.
According to unconfirmed local reports, three civilians were also killed in the incident in the Karabag area of the city.
It was the latest violent attack in Afghanistan-more than 30 people were killed in Tuesday's bombing of the Herat mosque.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
A joint patrol of Afghan and NATO coalition forces was hit by an "individual carrying an improvised explosive device" on Thursday night, according to a NATO statement.
All of the injured are in stable condition and are being treated at the U.S. military hospital at Bagram Air Force Base, the statement said.
According to press reports, the growing presence of the Taliban and the so-called Islamic State (IS) group in the Karabakh region has raised serious concerns among NATO forces stationed near Bagram.
According to the United Nations, at least 1,662 civilians were killed in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, compared with about 20 percent in the capital.
At least 30 people were killed in a suicide car bomb attack in the Shiite-dominated area of Kabul at the end of July.
The Taliban claimed that they had carried out the attack.
On May 31, a massive explosion in central Kabul killed more than 150 people, the deadliest militant attack in the country since the U.S.-led multinational force overthrew the Taliban in 2001.
The violence highlights the perilous security situation in the country at a time when US President Donald Trump is weighing whether to send more troops to Afghanistan to support its troops and police.
The suicide bombings in Kabul in recent weeks have also triggered a crisis of public confidence in the government and its policies, particularly the reputation of President Ashraf Ghani, according to reporters.
U.S. National Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) lawsuit to overturn resolution, delay smoke regulations
When Obama was in office, he made rules requiring states to curb smog-causing emissions, and 15 states sued the U.S. National Environmental Protection Agency, a day after the EPA overturned the rule.
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency on Wednesday announced its decision to continue the so-called "ozone-compliant zone of 2015" and promised that the agency would work with the states.
"We are confident in our dialogue with our national partners and are committed to responding to them," EPA Director Scott Pruitt said in a statement.
Pruitt announced in June that the EPA plans to delay the implementation of ozone-compliant zone standards until October 2018, with a one-year delay-according to which existing smoke pollution in some areas is measured to determine which areas should reduce emissions that cause smoke pollution to meet air quality standards.
Fifteen major Democratic states, as well as the District of Columbia, filed a lawsuit against it on Tuesday, declaring it illegal.
As part of the broader agenda, the administration of President Donald Trump has been working to revive various environmental regulations introduced by former President Barack Obama to spur economic growth.
But these efforts have sparked opposition from Democrats and conservative groups, who fear that more emissions will affect public health.
Breathing ozone-containing air "reduces lung function and increases respiratory symptoms," such as asthma, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said on its website.

McGee Garcia and Vassily Lomachenko meet for the first time to explore a possible future showdown
The most high-profile under 147-pound boxing match will be held soon, with Vasily Lomachenko and McGee Garcia, currently in a state of potential conflict, meeting for the first time on Thursday.
They were in separate rooms at ESPN's office in Los Angeles, where unbeaten World Boxing Council lightweight champion Garcia took the lead down the hallway to greet World Boxing Organization super-featherweight champion Lomachenko.
At the Showtime boxing match on Saturday, the judges unanimously decided that Garcia had beaten four-division world champion Adrian Brolner to victory, and that both fighters had become the top five players on the same heavyweight list.
Garcia held out his right hand and said, "How are you, champion?
Good luck.
Lomachenko saved his status with a victory over Miguel Maryaga at ESPN on Saturday night at 7 p.m.
When the two of them were photographed, Lomachenko's agent, Egis Klimas, pointed out that the potential matchup between the two players depended on the "perfect size."
"I used to be lightweight," Garcia said.
"I raised the level to fight Brona (140 pounds), but I didn't weigh that much," he said.
I'm a little under the weight of 140 pounds.
I want to go back to lightweight.
And he has to be lightweight (135 pounds), and then we can fight.
That's what fans want, too.
Then we will satisfy them.
Lomachenko agreed.
"The boxing world needs this fight."
Klimas asked if he should be charged a fee, and part of his strategy was for Lomachenko to make his debut against a 135-pound player later this year, thinking that a date would be set for next summer with Garcia (37-0, 30 knockout), who is also interested in fighting Jorge Linares-Luke Campbell against the winner of the fight after the Forum lightweight title fight on September 23.
"With all the fans asking the question, the fight could be on a pay-per-view basis," said Garcia, who later said he was open to playing on the network that offers the best financial solutions.
"We are the main characters.
It is impossible for others to generate such a great deal of attention.
As long as they're ready ... "
Garcia praised Lomachenko as "an outstanding player" and could be watching his boxing match live on Saturday.
But Lomachenko balked at Garcia's praise, saying he thought the three-division champion from Riverside looked "slow ... sorry, McGee ... you're going to be eliminated."
The point, Garcia said, is to show the strength of the fist, and then boxing.
They all said they could feel the momentum of their boxing match.
"This is a battle that has to be fought," he said.
Attention and heat are beyond the reach of any other boxing match.
I'd love to play, "Garcia said.
Lomachenko said: "I've been waiting for the top fighters, and this time it's McGee's turn.
It's going to be a great fight, "he said.

The announcement by officials of the China Development and Reform Commission on the early completion of the 11th Five-Year Plan emission reduction targets has given the steel industry, which is constrained by limited electricity production, a strong expectation of a return to production.
Although the steel mills have not received a clear notification from the local government that the energy-saving and emission reduction work is over, the industry estimates that around December 15, 2010, steel mills that were previously limited will be able to resume production, and steel prices may begin to bear pressure.
There has been no notice of the end of the limit, but in fact the pressure has been much less than in September and October, a private steel company in Hebei province told reporters.
Some parts of Hebei have repeatedly issued limited power production documents, and at one time adopted the method of forced sluice to restrict the production of enterprises.
Reporters learned from local enterprises that at present, most of the steel mills in Hebei Province have resumed work, limited production pressure relief.
Zhang Tiishan, an analyst at my steel network, predicts that the terminal demand for construction steel will gradually weaken from strength to strength, as the north is already in the middle of winter.
In addition to the gradual end of energy saving and emission reduction, by December 15, most of the steel plants will basically resume production, the products will arrive in the local market before New Year's Day.
The increase in the supply of resources will put some pressure on the price of steel, which is currently on the rise.

People from enterprises and scientific research institutions of the two countries exchanged views and reached a positive consensus on the cooperation between the two countries in the field of renewable resources under the new situation.
It is reported that the representatives of China are mainly China Renewable Resources Development Co., Ltd., China International Technology Transfer Co-operation Network, which is composed of the Global Energy Environment Exchange Organization and the Bologna Regional Enterprise Federation of Italy.
The representative said that Italy had a wide range of environmental technologies and solutions in the area of renewable resources, proposed pilot projects with China in the areas of industrial waste disposal, waste oil treatment and waste incineration equipment, and looked forward to extending the experience of environmental cooperation with China to the rest of the world.
Latest results of age assessment test for asylum seekers in Sweden released
Swedish asylum seekers were tested using the latest method to medically assess their age, with the latest results showing that more than 80% of subjects were judged to be over 18, but not all believed in their accuracy.
The Swedish National Centre for Forensic Medicine (R? ttsmedicinalverket) began the test earlier this year.
After being accused of failing to accurately assess the age of some of the refugees who claimed to be minors, the Swedish Migration Board (Migrationsverket) designed the tests with a view to carrying out a more accurate age assessment during the asylum process.
So far, the Swedish Migration Board has sent 6,880 testers, and the Centre for Forensic Medicine has now released the results of a total of 2,481 testers for the period from mid-March to 31 July 2017.
Eighty% (2002) were judged to be 18 years of age or older, but in another 25 cases, the Swedish National Centre for Forensic Medicine determined that the subjects were "likely to be 18 years of age or older".
In 432 tests, the result was that the person "may be under 18 years of age."
The test is only for people of questionable age.
The results are consistent with those of previous months, according to John Gleason of the Center for Forensic Medicine.
"These figures are not very different from those of previous months, and they are very consistent," he told The Local.
The high proportion of cases judged to be over the age of 18 does not necessarily mean that the asylum-seekers lied about their age.
In May, the center released the results of 581 tests and said 442 "indicated that the subjects were 18 years of age or older."
News newspaper Svenska Dagbladet surveyed 581 of the results and found that 243 of them had publicly said they would be 18 years old this year.
An X-ray examination of wisdom teeth, an MRI scan of the joints, and then an analysis of the results by dentists and radiologists, have also been questioned in some areas.
One of the skeptics is Claude Marcus, an endocrinologist at Caroline College, whose work involves assessing people's biological maturity to determine whether they go through puberty earlier or later than their normal age.
He told the news newspaper Metro: "I have reason to think so, and I don't think the measurement used should be like this.
It is not accurate to determine the biological age in this way.
If we cannot guarantee accuracy, we should not pretend that we can do it.
Yet Gleason, of the Center for Forensic Medicine, defended the accuracy of these tests: "In general, the risk of uncertainty in determining a child as an adult is small."
The biggest risk is that the person is just under the age of 18, which accounts for about 10%.
West Virginia governor announces party change
On Thursday night, Jim Justice, the Democratic governor of West Virginia, announced at President Trump's rally that he would change the party.
"Like it or not, the Democratic Party has left me," the governor said.
"Today, after a lot of prayer and a lot of thought, I'm going to tell you ... today I'm going to tell you as a West Virginian that I can no longer help you as a Democratic governor," he said.
The rally burst into cheers.
"So, tomorrow, I'm going to change the party membership to the Republican Party," Justis added.
"As a coach, I'm going to tell you that it's time to start another game."
Trump earlier promised a major announcement at a rally in West Virginia.
Mr Trump won 42% of the vote in West Virginia, and Mr Justis did not support Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
According to Forbes, Justin was named the state's only billionaire in 2016.
Forbes pointed out that he inherited his father's coal industry and owned coal mines in all five states.

On Thursday, the president of the International Association of Athletics Federations, Sebastian Coe, praised Russia for apologizing for the doping scandal and said the apology was "candid," but reiterated that it was not the time for Russia to rejoin the sport.
Speaking at the IAAF conference on the eve of the World Athletics Championships, Russian Athletics Federation President Dmitry Chirac said his country was right to be banned from the sport and he was determined to fight doping.
He said he regretted that "all the athletes who won gold and silver medals in the competition were stripped of their medals."
Despite his comments, the IAAF General Assembly voted in favour of maintaining the ban after the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) report referred to the discovery of evidence of Russian state-sponsored doping, which was imposed in November 2015.
"I think today's response was a very frank, very frank introduction," IAAF president Coe told reporters.
"The entire council and the IAAF General Assembly are delighted ... the Russian Federation acknowledges that it has gone through a period of great anxiety and is doing everything possible to ensure that Russia is able to re-enter the race."
Coe said he was also "pleased" that Russia had accepted the criteria for re-entry.
"I think it's been a very constructive day and think we've made some progress, but the IAAF General Assembly supports the recommendations of the ad hoc panel and now is not the time to resume Russia's eligibility," Coe said.
"We need to do everything we can to normalize this situation over the next few months.
Our guiding principle has always been the desire to separate innocent athletes from the contaminated system, "he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes, who meet the strict standards of the IAAF, will compete as neutrals at the World Athletics Championships in London on Friday.
The head of the IAAF team, Runn Anderson, said on Monday that Russia had not yet met a number of criteria for the resumption of the competition.
He told reporters after a speech to the IAAF Council in London that drug testing was still inadequate and that the banned coach was still coaching.

What is the impact of football's financial rules on Neymar's move to Paris?
Rules designed to prevent unfettered spending by big European football clubs do not prevent Neymar from moving from Barcelona in Spain to Paris Saint-Germain Football Club (PSG) in France for a record price.
The result has been a further downgrade of the Paris Saint-Germain Football Club by the European Football Association (UEFA), the governing body of European football, which has the power to ban teams from the much-watched Champions League.
The Financial Fair Play Rules (FFP), introduced by UEFA in 2011, means Paris Saint-Germain Football Club will eventually have to prove that Neymar's transfer is funded without causing a huge loss.
FC Barcelona have already paid 222 million euros (US $262 million) just to pay for the Brazilian player's decommissioning, and Neymar's salary will be tens of millions of dollars a year.
Here are some of the financial implications of Neymar's move to France.
Given that the team is funded by the well-heeled Qatari ruling family, Paris Saint-Germain Football Club can certainly sign Neymar in cash and include him in other star-studded battle teams.
Clubs can spend a lot of money on players, but they have to use a legitimate source of income to make up for the huge sums spent so that they can break even in football-related businesses.
The Financial Fair Play Rules was conceived by Michel Platini after he was elected president of Uefa in 2007.
The former French player believes that for clubs that are in debt in pursuit of success, if the bank or everyone withdraws their support money, they are actually cheating and putting the club at risk of destruction.
In 2011, the focus of the Rules shifted from the issue of the club's debt to the monitoring of the club's loss situation.
The change means that the business model used by Roman Abramovich when he bought Chelsea FC in 2003, to buy a club with potential and then spend huge sums to improve the team and build it into a global brand, is now in a more demanding position.
The club could lose 30 million euros in the three-year "rule" assessment period to 2018.
Although Abramovich was derided by the then-president in 2015, UEFA successor Aleksander Ceferin remains committed to stopping excessive spending.
"Of course the Rules have not lapsed and we will certainly strengthen future regulations," Uefa's Andrew Traverso, who is in charge of matters related to the Rules, told the Associated Press last week.
While the Paris Saint-Germain Football Club will pay off Neymar's buyout clause in a lump sum, it can also allocate the amount for accounting purposes over the duration of the contract.
Neymar has signed a five-year deal, so the transfer fee could be shown in the annual accounts for the next five years at a cost of €44.4m.
The first wave of "rules" sanctions, imposed in 2014, put the Paris Saint-Germain Football Club, as well as the Abu Dhabi-owned Manchester City Club, under the harshest sanctions.
Paris Saint-Germain Football Club was fined 60 million euros (US $82 million at the exchange rate at the time), later reduced to 20 million euros, and called for the team to reduce the number of players to 21 in the 2014-15 Champions League, rather than the normal 25 players.
Uefa is eyeing clubs that are trying to raise revenue by linking up with club owners and defrauding financial regulators.
While Qatari companies can sponsor Paris Saint-Germain Football Club, Uefa will not treat it as a legitimate income if the amount of sponsorship is deemed to exceed the standard market price.
That was what happened in 2014, when Uefa ruled that the amount of money the Qatar Tourism Board had sponsored the Paris Saint-Germain Football Club had been overstated.
It has been reported that part of Neymar's income at Paris Saint-Germain Football Club could come from payments made by the Qatar World Cup organising committee in 2022.
But both Paris Saint-Germain Football Club and the organising committee have denied Neymar will be an ambassador for the World Cup, and it would be easy for Uefa's regulators to make such a move.
The recent sanctions against Paris Saint-Germain Football Club mean Uefa will be more wary of any attempt to circumvent the rules.
Uefa did not have prior discussions with Paris Saint-Germain Football Club about Neymar's transfer, people familiar with the matter said on Thursday.
All of these individuals contacted the Associated Press in an unnamed capacity because they were not authorized to discuss the status of Paris Saint-Germain Football Club.
The last time the accounts were published, Paris Saint-Germain Football Club reported operating revenue of 542.4 million euros in 2015-16, making a profit of more than 10 million euros.
The accounts for the last fiscal year have not yet been published.
Paris Saint-Germain Football Club expects Neymar's arrival to be a boon for sponsorships, franchises and the sale of jerseys.
The club expects revenue to increase by at least 30% after the signing of Neymar.
It was clear that the Spanish league was furious to see the most famous of the players leave, trying to block Neymar's move and claiming that the Paris Saint-Germain Football Club was in breach of the rules.
Javier Tebas, president of the Spanish league, told Spanish newspaper AS that "this is a clear example of a'financial doping 'and that the club and the country are the same," referring to Qatar, which has the ultimate ownership of Paris Saint-Germain Football Club.
Arsene Wenger, the head coach of the Arsenal team (all of which are American sports tycoons), has reservations about the attitude of the state-funded club as well as the Spanish league.
"This is a consequence of ownership and it has completely changed the whole ecology of football over the past 15 years," Wenger said on Thursday.
"Once the country has a club, then anything will happen," he said.
This will make it very difficult to comply with the Rules, because there are many different ways or interests for a country to require big-name players to represent a country. "
Rokid, a smart interactive robot developer, gets new investment in Temasek
In recent years, start-ups in the field of artificial intelligence have continued to suffer from a capital boom.
The artificial intelligence Rokid recently completed a new round of financing, led by Temasek, Credit Suisse, CDIB (the investment arm of Taiwan's China Development Finance Holdings), and old shareholder IDG Capital, among others.
It is reported that this round of financing of about US $100 million, Credit Suisse and CDIB in the domestic artificial intelligence sector for the first time in the financing transactions.
Rokid is an intelligent interactive robot developer, dedicated to robotics research, products can control the home intelligent devices, can continue to learn and grow independently, and also has the functions of recognition, understanding, feedback and so on.
This round of financing will be mainly used for research and development, the introduction of talent, strategic promotion and the investment layout of the industrial chain.
Previously, Rokid received IDG, Linear Capital, Mfund, Yuan Jing Capital US $8.3 million in angel-round investments in August 2014. In October 2015, the company received a further US $10 million A-round investment from Walden International, followed by angel investors. On November 1, 2016, Rokid completed the B-round financing from Shang Capital, IDG, Mfund, Yuan Capital, Walden International and other institutions.
At the time, Rokid said the company had been valued at US $450 million after the B-round financing.
In May 2017, Rokid released the consumer-grade smart voice robot "Ruki Moonstone," which combines artificial intelligence with a home scene for US $1,399.
The robot, which uses speech synthesis, natural language understanding, speech recognition technology and microphone array technology, has chat conversations, play music, and smart home functions.

From February 28 this year, iCloud services in mainland China will be transferred to cloud-based Guizhou, according to Apple.
Apple said that "the collaboration with Guizhou on Cloud will allow us to continue to improve the speed and reliability of iCloud services, while also meeting the new rules that China's cloud services have to be operated by local companies."
During the outage, the data previously stored in iCloud will also be stored in iCloud and will not be lost.
If the deactivated user wishes to use the iCloud service after February 28, new terms and conditions will need to be accepted first to ensure that the account is reactivated and moved to Guizhou on the cloud.
At the same time, Apple stressed in its statement that "Apple has a strong data privacy and security protection mechanism and will not create a backdoor in any of our systems."
The main data center in the new area of iCloud will also be Apple's first data center project in China, which, when completed, will be used to store data from Apple users in China.
When built and put into use, Chinese users upload and download data without having to travel back and forth over long distances between China and the United States to increase speed and reduce delays.

The 3-D animated film "Bean Fu" premiered in Wuhan on the 25th, "Bean Fu" director Zou Yi, "Bean Fu" animation director Meng wisdom, film soundtrack producer and Emmy winner Tom Disher all appeared to share the behind-the-scenes story of the film's creation.
The story of Liu An, the king of Huai Nan in the Han Dynasty, is derived from the traditional allusion of "Liu An made tofu, made by mistake", which tells the story of the protagonist, "Bean Fu", transformed from a bean into a human form, overcoming many difficulties and sticking to the dream of immortals. The film is deeply rooted in the local culture of Hubei Province.
Wudang Mountain in Shiyan City, Hubei Province, is one of the world's cultural heritage sites announced by the United Nations. It is also the birthplace of Taoist culture and martial arts.
Director Zou Yu revealed that in the early stage of the film creation, he and the main creative team went to Wudang Mountain to pick up the wind.
He said that the story of "Bean Fu" took place in the West Han Dynasty, under the background of Liu'an, the king of Huainan, and the film's protagonist, "Bean Fu", was a bean that had accidentally turned into a human form when Liu'an was making Dan.
In addition to Wudang Mountain, which is the birthplace of Taoist culture, Hubei also has a deep connection with China's long-standing traditional musical instrument, the clock.

Nostalgia is popular in the market -- "Hara Summer Camp" and "Detective Shuangxiong"
Retelling the story is an attempt to remember the actors "80s scenery years and the garbage days of the 90s (before and after David Wayne and Michael Thwaite made sketch comedy" The Nation "for MTV); as well as nostalgia itself, nostalgia for 2001; a year before so many stars, such as Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Luther, had yet to wind up in the water.
As a cultural work of art, it is an imitation and embodiment of the permanent memories of our Facebook era.
But as a series, it feels like time is running out.
"The First Day of the Camp" reverberates strongly, but not just because of its absurd humor (the plot is an original story about a talking vegetable can, voiced by H. Jon Benjamin).
The double use of the Core Laugh Terrier-the middle-aged actor's role as a troublemaker-makes it a funny part of not being able to go back to the past.
In "Ten Years Later," when adults actually play adults, the mood is less ingrained and the mimicry more diffuse, including improvisation of 90s follow-up films such as "The Hand That Push the Cradle."
At one point, a character gets stuck in an Apple notebook, some straight-line skates and "something else in 1991."
Many of the core stories are the same.
Mr. Sweetie (Mr. Swarter) has now become a novelist, but he still hasn't forgotten Katie (Margaret Morrow).
Victor (Ken Marino) is still a man.
There is another sinister plot in the play involving Ronald Reagan (also played by Mr. Souvat), instigated by George H.W. Bush (Michael Ian Black, impressive).
As always, the best part of this series is to cut in.
It was particularly interesting to see the ever-young Mr. Luther, who showed off Matt Dillon's soul patch in the film Singles, and Andy in the former "Campus Giant" now feels like a giant.
It was a moment of random madness that might have powered the film, like the recursive "Seven Years of Life" series, until it came to what I thought was a logical conclusion: "Hara Summer Camp: Twenty Years Later," and its final act was to get the gang to see the movie premiere of "Hara Summer Camp."
At the same time, Amazon's "Detective Shuangxiong" tells a different story of nostalgia: the Cold War revivalist "The American Bourne Dream," the film "The City of Extreme Cold," and even the East-West wrestling imagery of "GLOW: The Gorgeous Women's Wrestling League."
The comedy, written by Brian Gatewood and Alexandra Tanaka, was pushed onto the television screen by director Rhys Thomas: a dystopian comedy set in Romania in the 1980s, about two Bucharest officials fighting for the truth, atheism and Marxist-Leninist line.
The main characters-the hardcore Grigor and the idealistic Essef-are played by Florin Pierce Jr. and Korneliu Ullich, respectively, whose dialogue is voiced in English by Channing Tatum (who is also an executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
This is a brilliant idea.
But this is not just an idea.
There are some good visual gimmicks (the police watch chess on TV to pass the time, because Americans like to play football).
And there are a host of celebrity voiceover actors-among them Jenny Slatt, Nick Auverman, Mahershala Hashbaz Ali and Kolo Sevigny-who have created a wonderful sound extravaganza.
But "Detective Shuangxiong" is so committed to creating a raucous, lifelike propaganda comedy in which there is a killer wearing a Reagan mask-and it usually plays the same role.
The six-episode long TV is a bit of a drag, and the comedic effect is not released fast or frequently enough.
The "Detective Shuangxiong" film, edited more rigorously, presents a better demagogic satire when Gregoire and Esseff repeatedly visit the U.S. Embassy, where there are always two fat men gobbling down a pile of hamburgers in the lobby of the embassy.
For an imaginary communist audience, the message means that Western culture can turn anything into material for revelry.
There is nothing wrong with the creator of this Romanian fictional story, and we will even tell it in our own modern history and their history.
Reporters recently learned that the northeast region of steel, rail transit, ships, machinery manufacturing and other industry benefits generally decline, even a loss.
Some experts believe that under the current situation, the new round of revitalization of the northeast industry is not only related to the national economic recovery, but will also have an impact on the long-term development of China's manufacturing industry and international competitiveness, so there is an urgent need to adjust the transition.
The traditional industry is losing money in the raw materials industry and the heavy machinery and equipment manufacturing industry. It is the first performance of the northeast industry in the current economic downturn.
In the past in the economic downturn, mainly low-end, primary products have been hit by the characteristics, but in this economic fluctuations, the northeast traditional industrial high-end, low-end industrial products are affected.
In previous years, Ansteel Group (Weibo) began to adjust its product structure, focusing on the development of high-end panels such as container boards, rail, ship boards and civil household appliances. However, sales of these varieties have declined significantly this year, especially as sales of ship boards have fallen by 50% compared with the same period last year.
'Metallurgy is the third pillar industry in Liaoning Province,' said Hao Qingshun, director of the metallurgical department of the Liaoning Industrial Information Commission. 'The annual production capacity of 60 million tons of iron and steel is the third largest in the country.

Yang Yang, who had just had surgery on his right ear a few days ago, appeared for the first time after recovering from his injuries. He interpreted his role as "anger is not in color", always giving in silence for the white light, hiding all feelings in the bottom of his heart.
"It's a new challenge for my performance," Yang said of the need to mobilize a whole body of emotion to convey the character's forlorn sadness to the audience. "I'm really on the verge of suffocating an internal injury in the course of my performance."
Liu, for his part, revealed that he was "in tears" at the time of the film, and at one point he broke down in tears.
TOKYO (Reuters)-The Japanese delegation is aiming for 30 gold medals at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics and is in the top three of the gold medal table, the Japanese Olympic Committee said recently.
Last October, the head of Japan's Olympic Committee said he expected Japan's athletes to win 2.5 times more gold medals at the Tokyo Olympics than at the Rio Olympics.
At the 2016 Rio Olympics, the Japanese delegation ranked 6th in the gold medal table with 12 gold medals.

The conference material was a little thinner than before, and a few sheets of paper summed up the theme and agenda of the meeting.
"Save for the people, when thrifty must be thrifty. Returning to the present simple, real meeting environment, we understand and welcome it," said Wang Cheng, a representative of the Guang'an People's Congress, who was willing to see and participate in the high-efficiency, pragmatic and formalistic meeting.

Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England will announce at a later date that interest rates will remain unchanged, after weak economic growth and loose inflation have dashed hopes of a hike.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will continue to be "weak" as it controls interest rates while tightening household incomes.
Policymakers at the bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted 6-2 to keep interest rates at 0.25%, while a handful of members this month called for higher rates, even as weak economic growth has dampened the boost.
In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank of England reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 and 2018 to 1.7% and 1.6%, respectively, and issued a warning that the household income squeeze would continue, while inflation would soar to nearly 3% in the autumn.
But it says it will need to raise interest rates over the next few years to curb inflation from Brexit, while borrowing costs may need to rise more sharply than expected in the financial markets.
A year ago, a large-scale economic promotion policy was implemented under the influence of Brexit, and members also voted to withdraw it.
The Bank of England will announce a halt to its regular funding plan to provide cheap money to banks starting in February next year, although the bank says it now needs an additional £15 billion on a £115 billion basis.
In the minutes of the interest rate decision-making meeting, the Bank of England said: "In the MPC's core forecast, gross domestic product remains weak in the near term, as the squeeze on real household incomes will continue to dampen consumption."
With regard to interest rates, the bank has repeatedly reiterated the need for a "certain monetary policy tightening" to crack down on inflation, and for a "greater degree" than the market had expected.
The market is now expected to grow for the first time in the third quarter of next year and for the second time in 2020.
But the bank stressed that any increase would be "slow" and "restrained."
The bank's growth forecasts for this year and next are on a downward trend, compared with 1.9% and 1.7% in May.
The bank maintained its forecast for growth of 1.8% in 2018.
The pound fell against the dollar, followed by the euro.
The pound fell 0.5% to 1.31 against the dollar and 0.4% to 1.11 against the euro.
The unchanged decision comes after rising expectations were dashed by recent gloomy growth figures, with GDP rising to 0.3% in the second quarter, compared with 0.2% in the first three months.
The bank said growth was likely to remain at 0.3% in the third quarter, although it would rise slightly by the end of the year.
Ordinary households have been hit by soaring inflation and meagre wage growth, and the Bank of England's recent inflation report does not bring them good news because it says austerity will get worse before it gets better.
Monetary policy "cannot prevent" a blow to income over the next few years, but wages are expected to recover "on a large scale" by the end of the three-year forecast, he said.
At the same time, the economy will be stimulated by a sharp increase in demand for British goods as a result of the fall in the value of the pound, offsetting some of the effects of low consumption.
The decision comes a year after a shocking EU referendum sent the pound tumbling, with interest rates cut to 0.25% in August.
The Bank of England estimates it could take four years to have a full impact on prices and the British economy.
In the run-up to the bank's latest rate ruling, calls for an increase in interest rates were heard as inflation added to the already stressed average household, while three policymakers called for an increase to 0.5% in July.
Inflation fell to 2.6% last month from 2.9% in June, although the Bank of England said it was expected to rise again in the coming months.
The bank said the excess, relative to its 2% target, was the bottom line for the weak pound.
"Given the recent fall in swap rates, the mortgage market looks set to become more competitive again, as lenders clamour for more business and look forward to a positive end to the year," said Andrew Montereke, director of Coreco Mortage Brokers.
Such a market looks particularly favourable for those who may be nearing the end of an existing deal, as remortgages (many of which are fee-free and have low interest rates) are becoming more and more popular.

Britain's National Health Service (NHS) 's controversial HIV drugs give the green light
Patients will be able to access "transformative" HIV prevention treatment starting in September after the dust settled in the High Court over the provision of drug funding to the NHS.
NHS England has announced that pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), a drug that can be taken before sex, has been shown to reduce the risk of infection in high-risk groups by about 86%, and the health service will now provide the drug to an estimated 10,000 people through a three-year preliminary trial.
It agreed to fund the trial after the Court of Appeal upheld the High Court ruling last year, which said the NHS had the right to pay for PrEP despite NHS claims that local authorities should fund the drug.
The move announced on Thursday was described by Simon Stevens, chief executive of NHS England, as a "major new intervention," while the National AIDS Trust (NAT) described it as a "critical moment."
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to be registered, and more will be added in October before being fully implemented across England in April 2018.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is an HIV drug taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
Tests showed that PrEP significantly reduced the spread of HIV among people at risk of infection.
Taking PrEP before sex means that there are enough specific drugs in the body to prevent HIV infection.
The drug can be taken every day or two hours before sexual intercourse.
Those eligible for treatment include gay, bisexual men, transgender people, and HIV-positive people who have not been successfully treated.
The clinic will identify participants who are eligible and agree to the trial, including men, women, transgender people and those whose sexual partners are not known to receive antiretroviral treatment for HIV infection.
People who live in England and register as general practitioners can also sign up at their local sexual health clinics.
The scheme will cost £10 m, while the NHS England branch has signed a contract to procure the drugs this week after international competitive procurement.
The trial aims to assess the full potential of PrEP by collecting clinical evidence on how it is located, absorbed and implemented on a large sample basis.
Mr Stevens said: "This major new intervention should serve as a broad and increasingly successful complement and reinforcement to the prevention of HIV.
This is another milestone in more than 30 years of action worthy of progress in addressing the major human health challenges, "he said.
Deborah King, chief executive of the UK AIDS Trust, said: "This is a critical moment in the fight against AIDS.
If it does target people in need and at risk, pre-exposure prophylaxis offers the possibility of changing the AIDS epidemic in the UK.
Starting in September, people at high risk of HIV will be given an approved new tool through the NHS-funded trial in England, which is truly self-contained and does not require consultation with sexual partners, which will lead to improvements in the lives of a large number of people.
We have both hands in favour of this announcement. "
Ian Green, chief executive of the Terrence Higgins Trust, said: "The priority now is to make sure that trials are pushed away quickly across the country and that none of those infected with HIV can fall.
Now that we have bought the PrEP trial drug, we are ready to protect more than 10,000 people at high risk of HIV, "he said.
Sharon Hodgson, the shadow public health minister, said: "After months of delays and government procrastination, the start of the PrEP trial is welcome and should come early.
Evidence shows how the drug can change as part of our approach to preventing HIV and stopping the spread of this deadly infection.
This experiment will give us a further and full understanding of the advantages of PrEP.
It is now important that this trial be rolled out across the country as soon as possible in order to protect people exposed to HIV and help us to further end the spread of HIV in society. "

High-quality living: the use of loft and ingenious design to build a small apartment in the Earl's Palace into a spacious home
Joanne Ray, a former banker, was so keen to renovate her house that in 2014 she moved from her big house in Knightsbridge to a small apartment in the Earl's Palace.
The apartment is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne-style terrace-and Joanne's failure to pack her bags to put it up for sale is a powerful testament to the new design.
"Before that, my ex-boyfriend and I lived in a bigger house in Knightsbridge," Joanne said.
"I was looking for the right house to quote.
I saw the apartment in the count's house, and its ceiling was high.
I'd like to make an offer on the same day. "
After turning himself in, the 1,000-square-foot apartment has now completed a thorough overhaul.
The apartment was originally a single room with a complex layout-it needed to go through the kitchen to get to the bedroom-and Joanne wanted to add storage space and loft at the time to make the most of the ample ceiling height.
"I want high ceilings, big windows, plenty of light.
That's what I want, "she said.
To that end, she hired Erfan Azadi, from the DuckShed Architecture and Design Studio (in Notting Hill), to use the 12.5-foot ceiling to create a home that is not only a development project, but also a place where Joanne lives.
The ceiling is not high enough to add two up-and-down spaces, so the architectural challenge is to create a loft high enough to stand.
Erfan had to be creative in order to solve the problem.
"The steel structure is quite complex," he explained.
"We have to arrange space for it to be displayed up and down, and we don't have to shrug our shoulders.
It's not just about building a simple platform, it's about starting the steel so that it's at the right height to function, "he said.
Through this arrangement, Erfan is able to get two full-height rooms in the space-which can add a lot of interesting elements.
The penthouse features retro copper windows from the Retrouvius brand, overlooking the charming living area.
Gold furniture with mirrors, silver pieces of furniture and Serge Mouille retro lighting laid out the overall style.
The use of mirrors plays an important role in increasing the atmosphere, space and light.
Put a mirror on both ends of the short corridor to make it look longer.
In the kitchen, a splashboard with a mirror is like a window to another room.
At the entrance, a small lattice with a mirror provides storage space for Joanne to store cutlery and glassware.
The beautiful living room has a fascinating sense of space that can be put away when the kitchen is not in use.
The folding kitchen is not new.
But what is unique about this folding kitchen is a garage-style lift door.
"There is some knowledge of the engineering field," Erfan explained of the reinforced veneer MDF door.
"This is based on the principle of balance, so when you push the door, it's easy to slide."
Thanks to the clever use of space and storage, Joanne gained an extra 16 square metres, an extra bedroom and an improved layout.
"In the end, what you're selling is the size of the house-or your property valuation is based on the size of the house," Erfan said.
"Basically, the real estate agent would walk into the room and calculate it based on the floor size," he said.
They will try to increase the space and use high-quality materials at the same time, bringing a sense of luxury to the space.
"The material is all your own choice, so it helps to create emotional bonds at home," says Mr Elfan.
'You don't fall in love with the power on the wall.
These things are important, but they don't tug at your heartstrings.
It turns out that with good design and the addition of extra space, standard apartments can turn out to be amazing.
In fact, you might choose to live in the same way as Joanne.

Two brothers put on US $500 million real estate empire battle
Forty years after the founding of its Italian family, the two brothers fought for one of Victoria's largest real estate empires, worth more than US $500 million.
Colin De Lutis, a former Carlton Football Club director and developer who took him to the Supreme Court over the division of their real estate and business assets, lives in a mansion in the Tukala district, and the distance between the three doors is the home of his brother, Paul.
Paul has been hoping to break away from the family business since 2014, but the two brothers have sparred in the Supreme Court over the division of the assets.
The brothers and their mother owned a total of 38 properties worth more than US $500 million, which had been accumulated since the family bought Smith Street in Collingwood in 1973.
There, the family founded Westco Jean and gradually expanded it to the size of 160 retail chains.
In 1999, the company sold for US $85 million.
That money was then put into real estate, and the De Routis family's portfolio of assets now includes city office buildings, Brunswick and Sorrento development projects, Gold Coast and Buller Hill apartments, and suburban shopping centres.
Under an agreement with his late father, Colin, known by his brother Paul as the "main promoter and dominant figure" of the De Routis family, owns about two-thirds of the company's assets, while Paul accounts for about one-third.
Documents filed with the court stated that, after conversion, the property owned by Colin was worth US $316 million, while the property owned by Paul was worth US $176 million.
Paul came to believe that the division of real estate and cash proved to be the crux of the negotiations.
"Colin's proposal for the division of property left him what I thought was the best property," he wrote in a first court affidavit in 2015.
On Friday, the Supreme Court held its first hearing after several failed mediations.
Now, the brothers are still fighting for control of the existing business, and Paul says Colin has kicked him out.
Colin, on the other hand, denied it and accused Paul of poor management of some real estate.
In Colin's earlier affidavit, he expressed his desire to resolve the dispute.
"My Italian tradition determines that the family is the most important option. My Italian ancestry determines that the family is the most important," he wrote.
The cost of the case continues to rise, and there are hundreds of pages of affidavit, e-mail, and corporate reports submitted by companies such as Deloitte, Pitcher Partners, Charter Keck Cramer, Allan Myers, QC, and senior lawyers hired by both parties.
Ms. de Routis and her late husband, Luigi, both Italian immigrants, have been running popular food and deli since the late 1950s and bought a shop in Brunswick in the early 1970s.
They used collateral to buy the Collingwood property, where Colin opened the family's first jeans shop.
Colin said, "I was in my senior year," and he started Westco there, "at the time, Paul was still very young (about 10 years old)."
Anna de Routis said she and Luigi, who died in 2012, wanted to be able to pass on the property peacefully to their son
"Luigi used to tell me that he never wanted his brothers to end up in court," she wrote.
The other two brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer members of the De Routis Group, and Colin said Mark paid him US $10 million when he left the company and US $26 million to Luke.
Both Luke and Mark "expressed dissatisfaction with the terms of their property division," Paul said.
According to a biography published in 2015 by TV star Eddie McGuire, Colin has kept a low profile despite being a board member of the former AFL club.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul, as well as their lawyers, on Friday.
But only Colin, who responded by text message, said that because the case had been brought to court "I really can't say too much."
"It is very, very sad that my brother Paul chose to sue me and bring our family affairs to court," he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote in a court document that he had tried to meet the demands of his brother.
"Our father didn't want to see Paul and I end up in a dispute like this," he said, adding that he was "still hopeful about the settlement of the dispute."
On Friday, that hope appeared to have been dashed.
"Our problems will be resolved through the courts in the near future," Colin wrote.

Trump's new chief of staff plans to limit the president's media time
Others have tried, but failed.
John F. Kelly may really be able to do it.
If that is the case, then he is the first person.
The new White House chief of staff plans to limit the flow of information to President Trump -- including news media reports -- with a view to ensuring that big bosses are smoother, according to Politico, a US political news website.
Here is a quote from journalist Josh Dawsey:
"When the new White House chief of staff, John F. Kelly, began his first day of work to gather with senior officials, he pointed out that he was going to address one of President Trump's main issues in the White House: bad information flowing into the president's hands," he said.
Kelly told the officials that receiving good information would help the president make better decisions, so the information would have to go through his hands-both in writing and in the form of a briefing.
Kelly's diagnosis looked like a model, but others had tried to tame it by monitoring Trump's media time, but it all ended in failure.
President Trump has a long history of television addiction-and now in the White House, his habit of watching television is still deepening.
In February, Sam Nahlberg, a former campaign adviser, told Politico: "If candidate Trump is frustrated by unfair reporting, it would be helpful to let him know that he has received positive coverage in credible channels as well.
Politico's Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that "based on the experience of six former campaign officials, the focus of the habit of controlling Trump's tweets is to ensure that a certain amount of praise has always been included in the media messages he receives personally."
This is no problem at all.
But the idea that Trump's Twitter habit was once "controlled" is ludicrous.
Perhaps these campaign officials knew something we didn't know-that Trump's tweets would have been even more incendiary if it hadn't been for their intervention.
We may never know about those tweets that Trump didn't send.
If his staff were able to save him from the fire, even if only a few times, their efforts would be worth it.
But no one has been able to stop Trump from causing controversy.
Part of the problem is that in a White House made up of competing groups, people promote their worldview by handing Trump information that may or may not be reliable, fancy ways to advance their cause.
Politico -- all about the story -- reported in May on advisers' penchant for providing dubious information to the president strategically.
This is an example described by journalist Shane Goodman:
"Current and former Trump officials claim that Trump's response to negative news snippets such as volcanic eruptions, especially those with damaging information leaks, will be frantically trying to find out where it came from," he said.
In late February, someone maliciously copied an article on GotNews.com, the website of online agitator Charles C. Johnson, to the president, accusing Deputy Chief of Staff Katie Walsh of being the White House's "source of a lot of information leaks," as Trump did at the time.
Even if Johnson had been permanently banned from Twitter for harassment, he had not provided any concrete evidence, and he had blown up a large number of false allegations, which he later publicly denied.
Trump read the article and then began to ask officials about Walsh. "
Goodman added that then-Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and White House Secretary Rob Porter had "tried to set up a system to manage and record the documents that Trump received."
What about the result?
Kelly is going to do the same thing in three months.
Perhaps he can prove himself to be a more efficient manager than Priebus, but Trump is still the impulsive Trump, and his aides are still competing with each other for influence.
These timeless factors will make Kelly's task even more difficult.
Tours and Towns: How to Drunken Tourists
The potential of a small town in Zhejiang Province has been gradually awakened.
These towns are now an important destination for visitors to Zhejiang Province to appreciate Zhejiang's mountains and rivers, to read Zhejiang's culture and to feel Zhejiang's homesickness.

Some of the richest owners in the West Midland region are once again at loggerheads with determined householders who are negotiating a government-dug ditch for the return of land outside their homes.
Rovers parked their 20 trailers in a vacant lot outside the bustling Solihull Street, which has been dubbed "Regal Street."
Caravans holding horses, carrying babies and leading caravans returned after being driven away in May, and the "moat" dug up by the city authorities did not stop them from entering.
The sleek and sophisticated team found a gap in the defensive line and, although there was no roadblock to get through, their vehicles pushed through it.
Angry residents have lashed out at Solihull Council, saying it has "behaved badly" in dealing with the issue.
One resident, who did not wish to be named, said: "They were there on Monday night, before coming to Bentley Heath Street and throwing stones at passers-by.
The committee should be ashamed of what they have done, because they are simply useless in dealing with the problem.
The caravans came here in May and were then driven away, and now they are back.
There was a lot of coming last night and it's probably going to be a lot more today. '
She added: "Birmingham City Council knows how to deal with it by enforcing a long-term ban to protect its parks.
I live on Streetsbrook Road, and I'm not willing to keep paying council tax if the council can't stop something like this.
One local resident, who did not want to be named, said: "This is ridiculous, we have just seen the last batch of householders go, just to facilitate the destruction of another.
The number has increased again this time, and some people have even seen horses grazing on the park lawn.
A Solihull Council spokeswoman said: "We are aware of unauthorized camping in a vacant lot on Strzbrook Road and we are now working with Solihull Police and taking the necessary legal action to get them to move away as soon as possible.
To support our collection of evidence, it is important to ask as many local residents as possible to report any anti-social or criminal behaviour to the police by calling 101.
This will help us to provide an overview of the situation when we present the case to the Court for review. "

Italy takes a tough line on non-governmental organization migrant rescue boats
Italy has issued a warning to non-governmental organizations operating migrant rescue boats in the Mediterranean that they will not be allowed to continue their rescue efforts unless they sign new operational regulations.
"If non-governmental organizations do not sign new codes of conduct, it is difficult to see how they will follow," Interior Minister Marco Minniti told the Turin Daily News.
Minniti's warning comes a day after Italian officials seized the crew of a German aid group, Youth Rescue, on suspicion of actually colluding with human traffickers to assist illegal immigrants.
The aid group has only been operating for a year and declined to comment on the subject of specific allegations by Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Caltosio.
"For us, saving lives is now and will be the most important thing in the future, so we regret not being able to operate in the search and rescue zone at this time," the group said in a social media statement.
"After collecting all the information, we can only assess all the allegations and the situation at the moment," he said.
Italian officials have been monitoring the youth rescue group's ship, the Iuventa, since October.
Its crew was suspected of carrying migrants who had been transported directly by boat by traffickers, and allowed smugglers to flee in haste and re-use the ship.
At least one such meeting allegedly took place at sea 1.3 miles off the coast of Libya, according to the prosecutor's document, which was published by Italian media.
Its crew is suspected of blatant disregard for the authority of the Italian Coast Guard, which oversees rescue operations in the area on humanitarian grounds rather than any other motive.
According to the code of conduct, ships such as Iuventa clearly require an Italian police officer to monitor their activities on board.
Currently, only three of the nine non-governmental organizations involved in search and rescue operations have agreed to abide by the code of conduct: Save the Children, the Maltese-based Migrant Maritime Assistance Station and Pro-Activa Open Arms in Spain.
The latter said on Thursday that it believed the new rules, while unnecessary, were acceptable because they would not bring any "significant changes and obstacles" to its rescue operations.
Among the organizations that refused to sign was the Nobel Prize-winning group Doctors Without Borders (MSF).
At the same time, Minniti said the sharp drop in the number of migrants arriving in Italy in recent weeks was a sign that efforts to strengthen the Libyan coast guard and unite local mayors are beginning to bear fruit.
"In recent days, we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel," the minister said.
He unveiled plans for in-depth talks this month: discussions with Libyan mayors on economic development activities, and with Chad, Niger and Mali on how to reduce the number of migrants who want to leave the countries for Europe.
Lian Ping, chief financial scientist at the Bank of Communications, said industrial value-added growth was expected to accelerate to 6.6% in December as a result of the end-of-season upturn in industrial value-added in the first three quarters of 2017.
Fixed asset investment is expected to grow by 7.2% in December, the same as last month, down from last year.
Industrial production, though expected to be weaker than in October, was roughly the same as in November.
In December, China's manufacturing investment is running low, but infrastructure investment has improved slightly, so fixed asset investment is expected to be flat in November.

New Measures of "University Solution" in Beijing: Tens of thousands of teachers and students in the North Chemical Industry will be admitted to the new campus in Changping
The opening ceremony of the new campus of Beijing Chemical University was held on February 2 in Changping District, Beijing, and the 1800-acre green campus was officially put into use.
Reporters learned from the ceremony that, in order to strengthen the core functions of the capital and manage the "disease of the big cities", in recent years, in the context of the coordinated development of Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei and the dredging of non-capital functions, Beijing has accelerated the development of the central city colleges and universities to the suburbs, and some colleges and universities are moving in batches to new suburban campuses such as Shunyi, Daxing and Fangshan.
The new campus of North Chemical Industry is located in Nankou Town, Changping, covering an area of 1800 mu, 40 km from the city, which is one of the key projects in Beijing to solve the non-capital functions.
The new campus is divided into three phases. At present, the first phase of construction has been completed. The second phase of construction is expected to be fully launched by the end of this year. When completed, the project will meet the needs of nearly 20,000 undergraduates, graduate students and faculty members for study and life.
Looking back at this year's film market, we found that the original text of the film and the two fans of the stars have become an important part of the film's expected audience.
At 1710 hours today, the 119 Command Center of Shaoyang City was alerted to a fire in the storage of tetrahydrofuran at the Hongzhi Chemical Plant in Longshitang, Shuangqing District, the city.
Shaoyang City Fire Brigade immediately dispatched 5 squadrons of 20 fire engines carrying heavy anti-chemical clothing, anti-chemical washing vehicles and other equipment to the scene.
After preliminary investigation, the fire was caused by a small storage tank containing chemicals such as tetrahydrofuran, which produced heavy smoke at the site.
At the time of the press release, the fire officers and soldiers were in intensive rescue, the city health, safety supervision, environmental protection, public security, transportation and other departments have rushed to the scene, no casualties have been found.
Michelle Carter sentenced for sending text messages encouraging Conrad Roy to commit suicide
A Massachusetts woman has been sentenced to two and a half years for encouraging her boyfriend to commit suicide via text messages and phone calls.
Michelle Carter, 20, will serve a 15-month sentence, which can be converted into a suspended sentence, plus a five-year suspended sentence.
Carter was convicted in June of the unintentional and unpremeditated murder of Conrad Roy, who committed suicide on July 13, 2014.
"My family is heartbroken," Roy's father said at the hearing on Thursday.
My son is my best friend.
While waiting for an appeal, Carter was allowed to keep his personal freedom.
She faces up to 20 years in prison, but her lawyers believe that both she and Mr. Roy are mentally ill.
In sentencing, Carter stood, wearing red trousers and a beige smock, his hands clasped, his eyes tearful, his eyes down.
"Her actions killed Conrad Roy," the prosecutor told the court.
'She ended his life in order to live better.
She didn't take responsibility, "the prosecutor said.
"She has no sense of remorse."
But Carter's lawyer said it was "a terrible consequence, and she felt very sorry."
However, Judge Lawrence Moniz said he did not find that her "age or maturity, or even her mental illness, would have any significant impact on her behaviour."
A prosecutor read a statement from Roy's mother, Lynn Roy, who said: 'I don't have a day not to mourn the loss of my beloved son.
I hope he is proud of me and what I have done, and I am trying to stand with his sisters in all my pain, which will be with us forever, "the statement said.
Mr Roy's sister, Camdyn Roy, testified that she was "in a trance" because she realized she would never be able to attend her brother's wedding or become his child's aunt.
"It is a pain to lose someone who has been with me since I was born, and it will be with me for the rest of my life," she said.
The case seems to set a legal precedent because Massachusetts law does not make it a crime to encourage others to commit suicide.
In 2014, Roy was found dead of carbon monoxide poisoning in his car; this year, Carter was 17.
The case drew national attention after Carter's text messages revealed she egged him on to commit suicide.
"There are a lot of ways to hang, jump, stab yourself," she said in several text messages sent two weeks before his death, when he was on holiday with his family.
During the period before his suicide, she wrote, "You need to do this, Conrad," and "all you have to do is start the generator and then get free and happy."
Judge Moniz said Carter drew attention through Mr. Roy's death and ordered her not to profit from the case through any media.
There are differences of opinion in this case.
One of the few to defend Carter, Amanda Knox, who was charged with the murder of her British roommate in Italy in 2007, was acquitted two years later.
"Michelle Carter deserves sympathy and help, not imprisonment," Ms. Knox, 30, said in a column published by the Los Angeles Times.

Reporters learned from the Lhasa Pure Land Basketball Club on Tuesday that the Lhasa Pure Land Basketball Team recently won the 4th place in the National Youth Basketball League Finals in Beijing.
The Lhasa Pure Land Basketball Youth Team is made up of 11 local players. The head coach is the assistant coach of the Lhasa Pure Land Men's Basketball Team.
Tibet's "basketball boy" before heading to Beijing for the finals.
Liang Junchao, general manager of the Lhasa Pure Land Basketball Club in Lhasa, told reporters that compared with last year, the team's achievements have improved, the players' self-confidence and confidence in the game have improved significantly, and the exchanges between the players and other teams have been more comprehensive, as well as more on-court and off-court exchanges and more relaxed.
After the game, captain Jiang Zou said he hoped to gain experience by participating in the game and do his best for the cause of basketball in Tibet.
It is understood that in the game in Beijing, the players overcame factors such as low altitude drunk oxygen to show the image of Tibet.
Although track and field in the Olympic Games is a big gold medal, track and field won the world, but the track and field will be better than the gold medal is in the wind.
Car makers face shock as Audi will retrofit up to 850,000 diesel cars
Audi's announcement comes a day after BMW said it would provide software upgrades for more than 350,000 vehicles.
BMW's chairman said it believed "there are more intelligent options for driving than restrictions," meaning that major European cities-including Munich, where BMW is headquartered-are considering banning or limiting diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it would retrofit three million Mercedes cars in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions.
None of the companies claimed the move as a recall.
European carmakers are aggressively promoting the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to help meet carbon dioxide emissions regulations.
But nitrogen oxides from diesel engines are thought to be carcinogenic and can cause asthma.
The cost of installing equipment to offset emissions from diesel cars is also increasing, making it difficult to maintain the price competitiveness of diesel cars.
As German carmakers face scrutiny, Chancellor Angela Merkel's government has also been accused of being too laissez-faire for these powerful car companies and ignoring signs of the problem.
The car companies are trying to avoid a repeat of Volkswagen's mistake of covering up its use of so-called defeat devices, adjusting emissions during car tests to comply with regulations and returning to normal under normal driving conditions.
Multiple Volkswagen executives have been charged in the United States, while others are being investigated by countries on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former head of thermodynamics at the Audi engine research and development department was arrested in Germany.
Former manager Zachero Giovanni Palmio, who is Italian, is not protected from extradition and could face trial in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi was embroiled in a German criminal investigation involving Volkswagen, with the German government accusing Audi of installing systems to evade European emissions requirements, widening the scope of an investigation that had previously been limited to the United States.
Audi's investigation could have a major impact on Volkswagen: luxury carmakers take a disproportionate share of Volkswagen's profits.
It is not uncommon for a film to take a year or two or even a few years from preparation to release.
Animated film "Big Fish Begonia" has announced that it will be released on July 8, 12 years from the preparation to the release of the film!
"Big Fish Begonia" original author Liang Jun, 21 years old from Tsinghua University thermal power major, together with close friend Zhang Chun founded the other side of the sky, in 2008 to create a million dollars of venture capital, launched the animated film debut "Big Fish Begonia."
The film has won many awards at home and abroad in the creative sample stage, and has been included and praised as "one of the most outstanding works of art" by the Pompidou Centre for Contemporary Art in France.
With six years to go from creativity to production, the film has been dubbed a "god pit" by millions of fans who are looking forward to it.
"Big Fish Begonia" tells a fantasy story that belongs to the Chinese people, and with the release of the trailer, it brings a whole new look to the audience.
"I've only done this for 12 years, and now that it's gone from a dream to a reality, I'm nervous and excited," Liang said.
"The team is going to be driven mad by the idea of using one-fifths of someone else's budget to make exactly the same picture as everyone else," Zhang said.
Dongguan, a "world factory" that once relied on processing and mass production, is turning its attention to the high-level talent who can lead the city to reposition itself.
Recently, the Dongguan city government held a high-level talent activity week, the first financial reporter saw that a number of strong local enterprises have participated in the talent talks.
In the orange background wall against the extra bright billboards, they each marked the price of a lot of money.
As a result, the China Television Production Industry Association has decided to join the national television production industry and sign a self-discipline convention.
Provence lavender threatened by climate change
Lavender has become a symbol of the city of Provence in southern France, but now there is bad news that it is being threatened by climate change.
Lavender is declining due to persistent drought and the presence of virus-carrying insects, causing headaches for scientists and farmers who are trying to find a solution.
Eric Chase, an expert at the Institute for Agricultural Research (CRIEPPAM) in Provence, said: "Lavender in Provence is facing a huge threat as the plant has been affected by climate change in recent years, with a significant reduction in spring rainfall and a drizzle in the fall.
This can affect the life cycle of lavender.
There is also a smaller individual cicada, a leaf cicada that can spread tiny bacteria, which can be found in large numbers in very dry weather.
The point is that the number is huge.
In addition to attracting vacationers, lavender oil is also sought after by the perfume and cosmetics industry.
"Contrary to plants that can grow many large flowers and have long ears of grain, we have problems with smaller individuals, stunted, missing or weak," Eric Chase said.
So we have less essential oil.
Solutions under study include the adoption of better irrigation techniques and the mitigation of evaporation of soil moisture, the spraying of protective mixtures of clay and water on plants, and the development of more drought-tolerant varieties.
Compared with the sci-fi elements in the film, the two stars said they were more attracted to the story in the film.
On the afternoon of September 5, a reporter for the Huaxi Metropolitan News, a series of interviews with prominent figures in the cross-talk world, as well as two cross-talk performing artists, were surprisingly almost unanimous in their silence.
One is a Berlin film emperor, one is a rising young actor, "psychological crime" is also Liao Fan and Li Yi Feng's first partner.
Mexico is in danger and journalists have been killed
The entire staff of the Riodoce weekly usually meet on Wednesday to review their plans for coverage of the Sinaloa riots, which have been caused by criminal organizations, corrupt officials and an endless war on drugs.
But today, the shadow of tragedy hangs over them, and they come together to discuss security.
It is important that they are told to change their daily habits.
Two senior journalists discussed what makes them feel safer: whether to bring their children to the office, which was hit by a grenade in 2009, or to leave them at home.
Security experts wrote three words on the blackboard at the front of the room: enemies, neutrals, and allies.
They asked these journalists to list their names under each column-without the need for evidence, observation, and intuition.
There are suspected drug dealers, politicians, businessmen and journalists on the government's list, or cartels, and these villains are putting Mexican coverage at risk.
The violence has never ceased, and there are a growing number of journalists across the country: according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists, at least 25 journalists have died since President Enrique Pe ñ a Nieto took office in December 2012; 589 journalists have been federally protected following attacks and threats; and so far this year, at least seven journalists have died in seven states.
The last person to die was their editor and inspiration, as well as Javier Valdez Cardenas, the co-founder of "Riodoce."
Valdez, who has written many books on drug violence, wrote in one of them: "The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist."
There was a deep sense that he had left, though he was everywhere-a huge picture hung on the facade of the "Riodoce" office building, Valdez with his middle finger up and the word "justice "; Aaron Iwala and Miriam Ramirez, two journalists in their 30s, wore T-shirts that showed him smiling, wearing glasses or his trademark Panamanian straw hat.
The seminar took place less than two months after his death; journalists rushed to discuss their shared trauma, nightmares, insomnia and paranoia.
Although a special federal prosecutor's office was created in 2010 to handle journalists' cases, according to the records of the Committee for the Protection of Journalists, the office prosecuted only two people.
Most of the thousands of crimes each year involve drug trafficking and organized crime, so it is rare to bring to justice those responsible for the killing of journalists.
In "Riodoce," they insisted on reporting the violence in Sinaloa, although they were heartbroken, even though the land was riddled with holes.
'Without information about the killer, without justice, it doesn't make much sense to hold a security seminar,' he said.
"It would be foolish to waste time attending a seminar like this," he said.
You don't trust anyone as long as we don't know why. '
On the morning of May 15, Valdez left the "Riodoce" office in Culiacan, the capital.
His red Toyota Carolla was stopped by two men just a few blocks away; they forced him to get out of the car and fired 12 shots, presumably because of the newspaper's name, which translates as "Twelve Rivers."
The scoundrel drove away in his car and crashed it nearby.
Valdez is 50 years old.
Leave behind his wife and two grown-up children.
There was a lot of gossip about Culiacan.
But on the subject of Valdez, there was virtually nothing but silence.
Since Guzman was arrested last year and extradited to the United States in January, the state of Sinaloa has become the bloodiest battleground in the country, with rival forces fighting furiously.
One or more people are shot every day on the streets of Sinaloa, and the cemetery is full of the drug lord's ornate two-story mausoleum, which has become commonplace.
Forget for a moment the state of "calm" is when only one cartel controls the coastal state and its ports and drug trafficking routes to the United States.
Even so, even if Valdez was well aware of the dangers of the job, Ismail Bohoqui, 60, co-founder and director of Riodoce, was guilty of failing to protect his friends.
He believed that two mistakes had caused the tragedy.
First, an interview with Damaso Lopez was published in February, and he led a cartel that fought against several of Guzman's sons.
The report may have angered the sons; the newspaper was bought out by suspected gang members as soon as it arrived at the newsstand.
The second mistake was not to force Valdez to leave Mexico for his own safety after another newspaper reporting the same story was confiscated.
Valdez is a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his death is of great significance to the violence against journalists in Mexico.
His spirit lives on, and his friends and colleagues believe that he has always been with us.
He was also a senior reporter for "Noroeste" in 2003, when he co-founded "Riodoce" with five colleagues and sold a US $50 stake.
In the state of Sinaloa, "it is impossible for journalism not to deal with the drug problem," he said.
As time went by, the paper gained a good reputation for bold and honest reporting and increased sales and advertising.
Reporters like to be able to publish critical investigative reports without worrying about censorship, and readers like newspapers to publish stories that others do not dare to report.
Five years after its founding, "Riodoce" won the Latin American country's Maria Moskapo Journalism Award.
In the same year, the Association for the Protection of Journalists awarded Valdez the International Press Freedom Award for his courage in pursuing the most authentic Mexican drug coverage.
He confessed that he was afraid, too.
At the time the Society for the Protection of Journalists awarded the award, he said, "I want to live on."
Later in late October, he said in an interview with local television station Rompeviento TV that "drug trafficking is a way of life in Sinaloa,
You have to take on the task that falls on your shoulders as a journalist -- either so, or as a deaf-mute.
I don't want to be asked, 'What did you do in the face of so many deaths ... why didn't you respond to what was happening?'
The entire staff of "Riodoce" are nostalgic for Valdez, for cursing like a dockworker, for the friend who never grudgingly hugs and advises, and for the teacher who knows how to live.
They depend on his habits.
He used to wear that hat.
Always go to the El Guayabo bar opposite the office and always sit at the same table.
Now, they would ask: Was it his daily habits that caused his fall?
His death also forced them to think about how to do a good job and live a good life.
"They don't like the fact that you're causing trouble to their women and children, or the fact that you're influencing their legitimate companies and the secret airports used to transport drugs," Bohoqui said.
It's all over their bottom line. '
The result is to maintain a high level of self-censorship and self-protection, even at the safest time.
Trust your instincts.
If you smell danger, stay away.
The problem, says Riodoce editor Andr é s Villarreal, is that "the breath is a feeling that it's going to be deceived ... and then something like that happens to Javier."
He and others say that the previous rules no longer apply to Sinaloa-just as they no longer apply to Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states, where smuggling routes are lucrative, while institutions are weak, government officials corrupt and smoky.
The situation is constantly changing.
In the room where "Riodoce" employees attended security training, mobile phones were suddenly not allowed; a few days earlier, spyware allegedly sold only to the government had been used in Mexico to spy on journalists and activists.
Outside, two police officers took shelter from 104 degrees (40 degrees Celsius) of heat in the shade of a tree.
They were sent by the state government to protect the "Riodoce" offices, which are located in a four-story building in the middle-class block of Culiacan.
Some reporters half-jokingly quipped that they did not know if the police would be 50% of what the governor himself had said.
Reporters have been going to the mountains for months, where drug cartels are under de facto control.
This week's "Riodoce" focuses on three major events.
Among them was the killing of the brother of Julio Cesar Chavez, the great former boxer in Sinaloa.
And the disclosure of government funds in the governor's hometown,
And the kidnapping at an expensive restaurant in Culiacan, just a block from the prosecutor's office.
Officials do not release information about the abductees or the kidnapping process, so it is prudent to write down what the city knows: the restaurant is a favorite place for drug dealers and officials.
A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered in the name of a politician of the ruling Revolutionary Institutional Party (PRI), which dominated the political class almost throughout the last century.
Recently, several PRI governors have been accused of corruption in several high-profile cases.
Villarreal asked reporters to write about what had happened at the site of the incident, including an incident in which a son of Mexico's top drug lord, Guzman, had escaped a military attack.
If only a few months ago, readers would have looked at Valdez's column for the most powerful information about the kidnapping.
"In the past, we already knew what was going on," said Villarreal, 46, who is known as "skinny" because of his thin figure.
Now all of our sources of information have been cut off.
Valdez's office is now being used to store signs and stickers to protest the killing of journalists, as employees become what they never wanted to be: activists representing the media.
The next morning, journalist Miriam Ramirez grabbed a sign and walked out of the room, heading to the local prosecutor's office for a march related to another reporter.
Salvador Adame disappeared in the western state of Michoacan three days after being killed in Valdez.
Officials found a charred body and said it was his body, according to a DNA test.
Across the country, journalists have become more outspoken, organizing protests and putting the words "save the media" on sidewalks and buildings.
On this day, director Bohoqui, who is not in Washington, is working to bring justice to the Valdez case and win international support.
The day after Valdez was killed, in a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa state, Ramirez accused officials of spying on journalists and killing them because they had told the truth.
Given that her anger has affected her objectivity, she has also asked to resign from her post covering government affairs.
Valdez has repeatedly reiterated that Mexican journalists are "surrounded" by organized crime, co-ordinated government officials and an indifferent society.
In his last book, "Drug Journalism," he wrote that journalists were not only maimed by drug cartels, but also on the list of politicians and security forces associated with organized crime.
Articulo 19, the media watchdog group, blamed police and public officials for more than half of last year's attacks.
"In Mexico, they let you die just to shut you up," Ramirez said.
It is clear that these murders are chilling.
No one has forgotten that six years ago, blogger Maria Elizabeth Mathias died on the northern border of Tamaulipas.
Next to her body was a note allegedly signed by the Zetas cartel: "I'm here for my report."
Her head was cut off with a computer keyboard and headset next to it.
Some newspapers, such as the El Norte newspaper on the northern border of the state of Chihuahua, chose to close after the killing of Miroslav Brach in March.
Others are continuing, and the directors of "El Manana of Nuevo Laredo" were killed in 2014, but they continue to do so.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juarez spoke openly about drug cartels with a front-page story entitled "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists have fled their homes, or even left the country.
It was a difficult choice.
It is difficult to find jobs in exile, and they still need to be careful and alert to danger in the streets.
Sometimes they will be arrested, and in 2015 photographer Reuben Espinosa is said to have been killed along with four women in a Mexican city three months after fleeing Veracruz.
For those who stay behind the scenes and continue to work, this is the day-to-day dance of high-risk decision-making.
Iwala, who had wanted to be a poet, admitted that reporting on the drug trade frightened him.
"Mexico is turning into hell, so I became a journalist," he said.
In the middle of the night on a recent Friday, the latest issue of the newspaper had gone to press, and the editors of "Riodoce" were sitting on the aisle outside the office drinking beer when, suddenly, their phones rang.
Nineteen people have been confirmed dead in a series of gunfights between rival gangs and security forces near the beach resort city of Masatland.
The fighting is still escalating, as indicated by a series of cartel messages found in the region.
They were on the side of the road to upload the news to the "Riodoce" website via their mobile phone.
The headlines had to be changed the next day.
The siren sounded nearby-there was another gunfight in the area for a life-and-death duel.
Bohoqui glanced at the police officers who were standing there to see if they were alert.
If they have a little bit of fear, then they don't show it.
The founder of the newspaper has been killed, and in his large portrait, his middle finger points to where the entire state of Sinaloa needs to look, with the entire staff of "Riodoce" following in his footsteps.
"How could you even want to shut it down? On the same day that Javier was killed, the intern asked me to send her to the street to participate in the coverage," Bohoqui said.
China's Self-Driving Tourism 2020 Market Size or Breakthrough of Billion Dollars
[Abstract] In the context of rising consumption and the prevalence of free travel, self-driving travel is encouraged by national policies and enjoyed by a growing number of consumers.
But at the same time, the self-driving market, which is expected to surpass the trillion-dollar scale, faces a double challenge.
In the context of rising consumption and the prevalence of free travel, self-driving travel is encouraged by national policies, as well as a growing number of consumers.
But at the same time, the self-driving travel market, which is expected to surpass the trillion-dollar scale, faces a double challenge. On the one hand, the development of the self-driving travel industry is not proportional to market demand, and self-driving travel organizers, such as self-driving travel clubs and travel agencies, face a meagre profit dilemma. On the other hand, the infrastructure and services that self-driving travel faces are still in the early stages.
60% of the total number of domestic visitors, the size of the market is expected to exceed 100 billion
With 4.44 billion domestic trips in 2016, self-driving travel accounts for about 60% of the total number of domestic trips, and the self-driving travel market is expected to exceed trillions by 2020.
According to the statistics of the China Travel Vessel Association on the number of self-driving trips, there has been a steady increase in the number of self-driving trips in the past five years, and the proportion of people traveling in China has remained stable at more than half of the total number of people traveling in the country.
At the same time, more attention and support has been shown at the regional and national levels to the emerging field of self-driving travel, with policies and regulations related to self-driving cars, hostels and camping tours being introduced intensively from 2016 to 2017.
In July 2017, eight departments, including the National Tourism Administration and the State General Administration of Sport, jointly issued the Automobile Self-Driving Movement Camp Development Plan; in the same month, 14 departments, including the National Development and Reform Commission and the Ministry of Finance, jointly issued the Action Plan for the Promotion of Quality Upgrading of Rural Tourism Development (2017), the self-driving tour was highlighted.
The introduction of the policy provides opportunities and policy guidance for the development of self-driving tourism in China.
Self-driving travel club profit is meagre, complete industrial chain is the key
Although the domestic self-driving travel market has great potential and the national policy has been actively guided, the self-driving travel industry is still at an early stage.
According to the China Self-Driving Tour Annual Development Report 2016-2017, there are thousands of self-driving clubs, car clubs, caravans and so on in the country, but the proportion of self-driving trips arranged by tourists accounts for the majority, with only about 15% of visitors taking part in various organisations such as self-driving clubs, self-driving clubs and so on.
At the same time, there are only a few online travel companies and traditional travel agencies that develop their own self-driving travel products. Many online travel platforms sell only self-driving travel products provided by some suppliers, and some self-driving travel clubs are also important suppliers.
In terms of organizing self-driving tours, there are many aspects of "eating, living, walking, swimming, buying and entertaining", such as high fragmentation, heavy upstream supply chain and high randomness of tourist consumption.
Li Guanjie, founder and CEO of the Beijing World Automobile Club, believes that self-driving travel clubs are essentially similar to travel agencies, and that early major profit-making models were dominated by off-line activities, with self-driving travel line products and tour leader services at the core.
But now in the field of self-driving tour line product homogeneity is serious, tour leader service level is uneven, the self-driving tour club is facing the need to transform again.
It can be seen that self-driving travel itself is not an independent industry, but with the displacement characteristics of its self-driving travel to form a cross-regional, industry ecological circle, the formation of a complete industrial chain is very important.
Experts point out that, in addition to basic tourism consumption, experience is a more important element of consumption.
Therefore, for the development of self-driving travel industry, we should enhance the characteristics of experience, develop the theme of "self-driving travel +" and the IP of self-driving travel products.
Scenic roads are not only roads, but car camps should not only be accommodating
In the face of the rise of self-driving travel, the basic development of self-driving travel is also relatively junior.
Li pointed out that the tourist scenic road is not just a road, but the elements of transportation and tourism need to be integrated into it, but the road repair and tourism itself are the two departments responsible, the transport sector added tourism elements, but also stay in the construction of facilities such as toilets, consultation centres, billboards, and so on, and the integration of tourism is not very high.
Compared with the well-known self-driving route "Route 66 in the United States", the construction experience is worth learning from.
The scenic road design is no longer the most direct and fast route from the point of departure to the destination, but follows the concept of "experience driving fun" to provide self-driving tourists with the best enjoyment of the beautiful scenery along the road. The scenic road links the point-to-point, face-to-face tourism landscape, preserving the historical and cultural value of the eco-tourism resources along the route, as well as organizing thematic activities to enhance the participation and recreation experience of tourists and create economic benefits for the local tourism industry.
In addition to the scenic route, the camp is also an important supporting facility for self-driving tours.
But among the self-driving tourists known to reporters in Beijing, there are few consumers who choose to stay in the camp.
In their view, many camps tend to be infrastructure-oriented and can only meet the needs of a large number of elements, such as food and shelter, low-grade, single-product, and self-driving.
Industry insiders, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said that many of the companies that did camp in previous years were not keeping up with the construction of infrastructure and services at the end of the year, and that many of them were losing money without a late injection of funds, making it difficult to do some matching products.
Consumer groups
In terms of age, the self-driving group is concentrated in the 21-40 age group, especially in the 31-40 age group, which has a certain economic base and has a higher demand for personalized tourism and is mostly parent-child visitors, according to data released by the China Travel and Transportation Association in 2017.
According to the accommodation survey, the self-driving people prefer non-standard accommodation.
In terms of self-driving type, peripheral self-driving is the main type of self-driving, accounting for 84.32%.
Outbound self-driving is the aspiration of many people, but the proportion is still small.
At the same time, as consumer demand has risen, tourists who used to enjoy self-driving "tourist attractions" have begun to change their minds. Instead of "getting out of the car and taking pictures and getting into bed" during self-driving tours, they are paying more attention to the experience and process of travel.
Dinosaurs used camouflage to avoid enemies
At first glance, it looks terrible, but it looks like a statue.
The researchers released the first study of a rhinoceros-sized, uncanny fossil found by Canadian miners, noting that the fossil was well preserved, so experts called it the "Mona Lisa of the Dinosaur World."
The fossil was so well preserved that it was even able to determine the color of its squamous skin to be reddish-brown, suggesting that it had had some "troubling experiences."
The report in the journal Current Biology describes it as "the most well-preserved lanceolate dinosaur ever found and one of the best dinosaur specimens in the world."
The fossil is a newly discovered species of sarcoidosaurus that lived in the mid-Cretaceous period between 110 million and 112 million years ago.
It was so well preserved that it shocked the researchers, who described it as "truly breathtaking."
The herbivorous lanceolate dinosaur fossil is the most well-preserved fossil of its kind ever found, according to the National Geographic.
On March 21, 2011, Shawn Funk discovered the fossil while digging at the Suncor Millennium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada.
At that time, he came across something that did not seem to be the same as the rocks around him, so he decided to take a closer look.
After that, the fossils he found were sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology in Canada.
It took six years for the researchers to show the beast inside the 2,500-pound (1,100-kilogram) mound.
After such hard work, the final result has now been announced.
"If you look at it, you almost believe it's sleeping," said Caleb Brown, a scientist and first author of the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature is on display
"It will be one of the most beautiful and well-preserved dinosaur specimens in the history of science-the Mona Lisa in the dinosaur world."
By studying its skin, the researchers found that the herbivorous creature, dressed in armor like a walking tank, was at risk of a major threat from carnivorous dinosaurs.
The heavily-manicured dinosaur used red-and-white camouflage to avoid predators and used a covert technique known as "anti-shading," which is also used by many modern animals.
In this way, experts say, it is better able to blend in with its surroundings, thus avoiding the enemy, suggesting it is preyed on by larger dinosaurs.
The 110 million-year-old creature, part of the Nodular Dragon family, made headlines for the first time in May and is currently on display at the Royal Tyrrell Paleontological Museum.
After Mark Mitchell, a museum technician who was part of the team, spent 7,000 hours meticulously unveiling the behemoth, the researchers now study it and name it "Borealopelta markmitchelli."
The samples are so well preserved that Dr Mitchell, as well as the international team of scientists, can record the patterns and shapes of the scales and armor on his body.
They found "anti-shading," a common form of defense in the animal kingdom, which means the creature's back is darker than the color on its side.
Although "anti-shading" is common, the findings are surprising because the dinosaur is much larger than the existing animals that use anti-shading.
The dinosaur was under pressure to be hunted by a meat-eating dinosaur, which evolved in a favorable direction, allowing it to hide in opposition as a means of survival.
However, most of the existing anti-shading animals, such as deer, zebra or armadillo, are as small and vulnerable as prey, suggesting that the creature is under real pressure to survive.
"The frenzied predation of large heavy armour dinosaurs shows how dangerous the Cretaceous carnivorous dinosaurs were," Brown said.
Chemical analysis of the organic compound in its scales also showed that the dinosaur's skin was reddish-brown.
Scientists are continuing to study the creature's life clues, including its retained stomach contents, to find out what food to eat at the end.
They believe that the dinosaurs fell into the river at the time of their death, were then washed into the sea and eventually sank to the bottom of the sea in a back-to-back way.
At the time, Alberta's climate was as warm as it is today in southern Florida, and rivers and oceans could be further inland than they are now.
"This nodular dragon is really amazing because it is completely covered with preserved squamous skin and, to this day, is preserved in dimensional space so that its original shape can be preserved," Brown said.
As a result, the creature is now in almost the same shape as it was during the Cretaceous period.
You don't have to use too much imagination to rebuild it; if you look at it, you almost believe it is sleeping.
The Cretaceous period was a time when large bipedal dinosaurs roamed the Earth.
Although Tyrannosaurus rex was the king of dinosaurs, it did not appear until millions of years after the lanceolate dinosaurs, which may have been killed by some of Tyrannosaurus rex's ancestors.
They include the High Spinosaurus, a 6-ton, 38-foot (11.5-meter) behemoth.
New research has found that scientists, who appear in the journal Current Biology, believe that nodular dragons were washed into the sea after they died and then formed mummies in the soil.
On March 21, 2011, Sean Fink excavated the creature at the Millennium Mine near Fort McMurray, Alberta, Canada.
According to the museum, it is the most well-preserved lanceolate dinosaur in the world, complete with skin and armor in areas from the nose to the buttocks.
On average, the creature is about 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighs 3,000 pounds (1,300 kilograms).
It has two 20-inch-long pointed horns protruding from the shoulder.
The researchers believe the herbivorous lanceolate dinosaur was active in what is now western Canada before being washed into the sea by floodwaters.
However, the dinosaur was buried at the bottom of the sea so that its armor could be preserved in its entirety.
The fossilized remains of this particular sample are so well preserved that the remaining skin is still covered with uneven pieces of armor on the dinosaur's skull.
As Michael Greshko wrote in the journal National Geographic, this level of preservation is as rare as winning the lottery.
The more I look at it, the more I find it incredible.
The remains of the skin fossils are still covered in mottled armor on the dinosaur's skull.
Its right forehand is on its side, and its five toes spread upward.
I can count it out. "
Reporters have learned that adding natural or plant-derived alginate, humic acid and amino acid synergistic vectors to urea production process can improve the efficiency of traditional urea. The utilization rate of urea alginate, urea zinc humic acid and urea nitrogen is 5-10 percentage points higher than that of common urea.
Environment-friendly, crop yield potential is obvious, especially large particle value-added urea is BB fertilizer high-quality raw material.
The total number of security personnel is double that of the 2012 London Olympics.
In order to ensure the safety of the Rio Olympics, Brazil will launch the largest-ever security linkage program.
Previously, the Brazilian government said a total of 85,000 people from the army and police would fight together, including 20,000 troops and 65,000 police officers.
Most of the military will be responsible for defending Olympic venues, while 3,000 additional troops will be responsible for the security of international airports, subway stations and streets.
Police patrol other parts of the city, including subways, buses and streets.
It is reported that 6,000 troops have arrived in Rio to provide security for the Olympic Games.
They are also responsible for patrolling the airport as well as the main roads linking the airport and the Olympic venues, in addition to the four major competition areas for the Rio Olympics.
The introduction of evaluation mechanisms in the service sector is no longer new, and in order for evaluation mechanisms to be effective, it is important to make regulation more effective and less formal.
How do activists learn to answer the question: "Whose street?"
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrer was in a state of panic.
On the first day of his trip to New York City, the St. Louis native sat on a rented bed in Epiphany and browsed Facebook on his mobile phone.
She came across a post from a high school student.
It read: "Police have just killed an 18-year-old and the child is still lying in the street."
She was baffled to find that no one else had posted the message on the feed. She turned off Facebook and turned on Twitter.
One @ ThePharoah user kept pushing her to the Dynamic Times.
The St. Louis-area rapper's live tweet broadcast the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old black man who was killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri.
He posted a picture of Brown's lifeless body lying on the street, his body lying in the street for four hours.
"It's crazy," Ferrell thought.
But death is nothing new for her and her community.
She put her phone down and didn't open the tweet again until that night, reading a tweet about the gathering of people on Canfield Avenue.
There were police videos and pictures of people shouting, as well as a picture of a man claiming to be Brown's father, which read: "Ferguson police just killed my unarmed son!"
She saw a message from the scene as a police officer stood in front of a group of protesters with a barking dog.
In another video, she said, another officer raises his rifle and screams, "I'm going to kill all of you ... the beast."
"It's not normal," Ferrell recalled.
"It's not something we're used to, it can be called a typical murder."
At that moment, I felt a shiver.
I was angry and I cried. '
She booked a return flight and went home the next day.
After landing at 11pm, she picked up her 6-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided to head to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson over the next three years was the subject of a new documentary, Whose Streets?, which was released in theaters on August 11.
This is a story about survival and protest, love and loss, strength and tenacity from the point of view of the people who live in this community and fill the streets demanding answers.
Ferrell was driving to Ferguson with her daughter (wearing a floral dress and a crown accessory) when the pair rediscussed the topic they had discussed countless times before that morning-"about the black experience and the state of the black people."
"Do you remember when I taught you that black people had to fight for their beliefs?" she recalls.
"We're going to Ferguson now because the police killed an 18-year-old boy, and that's not right," he said.
I had to take her, "Ferrell said later.
"What happened today is the culmination of everything that has happened in the past ...
She wanted to know, see, and rise from it.
Not only does she need to develop well in activism and organization, but she also needs to understand the different dimensions of the black experience and the black situation and what we have to do to be free and free.
Even if I had the privilege of providing her with a racist experience she had not personally experienced, she was no different from other black girls.
If I protect her in this matter, I feel like I'm hurting her. '
They arrived at Ferguson's first stop at a venue opposite the South Florissant Road police station, which became their camp after the militants waited until the result of police officer Darren Wilson's eventual non-prosecution.
Ferrell and her daughter got in touch with a local business owner who made a bag lunch.
They prepared the bags and were responsible for passing them on to the protesters.
Slowly, Ferrell began to form a new type of activism.
"My activism changed completely after August 9," she said, when she was an undergraduate at Missouri State University in St. Louis, where she was president of the Association of Minority Nurses, focusing on food justice and health disparities in the black community.
"I have no organizational experience.
That's what this is all about. '
A few weeks later, Ferrer met with the film's co-director, Sabah Freyan, during a night parade.
Freyan said she and her photography director, Lucas Alvarado Farr, "just wanted to record" what happened.
A question came to Ferrell's mind: "Do you want to record or do you want to find a story that you can take advantage of?"
This suspicion stems from a number of cases in which people-often white-enter a community to benefit from their pain and tenacity.
As Freyan explained in a recent interview, "We heard that people born in Ferguson didn't concentrate their voices, and we wanted to do it in a different way."
Freyan has been in touch with co-director Damon Davis, a regional artist known for his activism against dead prisoners.
His involvement led Ferrer, along with six other locals, to join the "Whose Streets?" project team, which remained in place for several years after Brown was shot.
"This documentary is not about someone speaking for us or talking to us, that's what we're talking about," Davis said.
"I mainly focus on how these characters are presented, because that's how I'm presented as well," he said.
While the goal is not to focus on Ferrell's experience-it's to show that the movement is "not about savior leaders, it's about community cohesion," says Freyan-she turns out to be the most open-minded of the film's participants.
As a result, "Whose Streets?" amazingly chronicled Ferrer's personal life, such as falling in love and stepping into marriage.
"I feel naked," Ferrell laughed when he saw the finished product for the first time.
"But I understand that there has to be a certain degree of vulnerability to do this work and humanize black people," he said.
In addition, Ferrer's story reaffirms and relocates the role of black cool women in the broader movement of black life events.
Two of the movement's three founders-who created # BlackLivesMatter on social media in the wake of the 2012 shooting of black teenager Trevone Martin-were identified as cool.
"Black cool women in the leadership generally support the movement," Ferrer said. "That's because we're fighting on multiple fronts.
Black cool women have to take it all.
Freyan agreed and mentioned that "the movement really has the support of black women and a lot of black cool women."
Ferrer was chosen to be at the heart of the film because of her identity, however, she insisted that "this is not an affirmative action for things."
"She was the one who inspired that energy," she said.
"Although she's on the front line, it's not a coincidence, because in these intersections of life, as a black cool woman, you have a lot to do.
You can feel her energy through the screen.
Meanwhile, in Ferguson, news cameras have long since disappeared, but tense racial relations between the community and the police remain.
Ferrer was sentenced to more than two-and-a-half years of probation for trying to block the motorway during a parade.
She describes the socio-political atmosphere in the area she calls home: "a mess."
Still, since she took to the streets of Ferguson three years ago, she has stuck to the hymn she has struggled to remember.
"We have a duty to fight for freedom.
We have a responsibility to win.
We must love each other and support each other.
We have nothing to lose but the shackles of our bodies.
In fact, online translation services were already available on the Internet a decade ago, and a long time ago there was a lot of talk about "machines are about to replace humans."
The similarities: Artists create portraits using the DNA of Chelsea Manning
There are multiple faces in the center of the pavilion at the Friedman Museum of Art in New York: white, black and brown, with almost imperceptible similarities between each face, which is tied by a line dangling from the ceiling.
The 30 portraits were created by artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg using a cheek swab and hair crumbs sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent hair scraps from Leavenworth Prison, where the former intelligence analyst was sentenced to 35 years in prison for leaking classified diplomatic cables through the WikiLeaks website.
The exhibition, which opens on August 2, is titled "Similar."
It was the result of two years of correspondence between Dewey Hagberg and Manning, who combined his discipline with his own in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a prominent dissident who served time in prison and completed gender reassignment surgery, and former President Barack Obama, who pardoned the remainder of her sentence three days before the end of his term.
Through an algorithm analysis of Manning's DNA and the creation of 30 portraits of "likely appearances," Heather Dewey Harbaugh made an acerbic and slightly callous comment about both the versatility of DNA and the concept of identity itself.
Manning, who was born under the name Bradley Edward, had publicly admitted to thinking of herself as a woman during adolescence, and was convicted in 2013 on 20 charges, including six counts of espionage law violations, computer fraud and theft.
In prison, her image was suppressed, with only one photo, a granular black-and-white selfie, looking visibly upset, sitting in the driver's seat, wearing a platinum blonde wig.
In 2015, Heather Dewey Harborg had a huge success with her 2012 project, Stranger's Face.
In that work, she uses DNA from cigarette butts and gum medium court evidence, extracted from debris, to create 3-D portraits of people who may be similar in appearance.
It was an e-mail she had just received from Paper magazine.
"They want to interview Chelsea Manning in prison and need a portrait photo," Heather Dewey Harborg told the media at the opening of the exhibition.
Chelsea Manning was unable to visit or take photos at the time, so they contacted Chelsea and asked if she was interested in making a DNA portrait.
So the artist and her imprisoned muse became impossible pen pals, exchanging many letters with each other over the course of two years.
They even created a comic book, "The Suppressed Head," by Shoili Kanungo, which envisions that the president will grant Manning privileges in the future, and that she will be able to see an exhibition in prison.
It may be a coincidence that Obama called for her release just days after the book was published, when Manning spent her 7th year in a Kansas military prison.
There's another layer of depth to the show, too, because contemporary America, where the Trump administration has repeatedly declared war on government leaks and transgender servicemen, while looking for new ways that can be hyped up on Twitter to nakedly incite division, is precisely what the show is meant to bridge.
When asked about the special timing of all this, Heather Dewey Harbaugh said, "There's a reason for anything to happen."
In the artist's statement written on the gallery wall, Manning's oversized signature is below (" i "in the name is painted with a heart), calling for an end to" partisanship based on gender, sexual orientation and culture. "
On the opposite wall is her mitochondrial DNA sequence, written in pencil twist with Cs, Gs, and As symbols.
By containing 200 letters (or nucleotides, the complex scientific dictionaries of each artist), Heather Dewey Haberg hopes to convey that, at least physically, everyone is.
"I hope people get out of this dilemma, our genomes don't care who we are, how publicly available genetic data is interpreted, how subjective it is," said Heather Dewey Haberg, whose 2007 video work, "False Memory," is also on display.
"DNA data can tell us a lot of different stories, so that's 30 of them."
The last work in the exhibition, in a room, comes from a page in a novel in the previous illustration.
Shows the soldiers in the United States holding a megaphone under the pompous, King Kong-shaped Manning.
"When they stop your speech, they win," wrote the wall.
"So, don't shut up."
"The content comes directly from a letter she wrote to me," said the artist from Philadelphia.
"I'm just scared again, and I'm still going to say it."
Manning has yet to see the exhibition in person, as foreseen in the comics, but when she does, she will be greeted by her own DNA portrait mask, like a group of protesters getting cheers in the center of the pavilion.
It was also purposeful, and, like all the objects in the exhibition, reached the height of the genetic single-fold information she had written in pencil (5.2 feet, Manning's height).
"In the past, I hung them on the wall, but I wanted them to feel like a bunch of people," Dewey Hagberg said of the portrait.
"But I want them to feel like a group of protesters following Chelsea, just as people protested at the time to release her."
Northwestern University professor and Oxford University employee wanted for homicide
Police said a man was found fatally stabbed inside a luxury apartment in Chicago, and a Northwestern University professor and an Oxford University employee were subsequently wanted and are now looking for suspects across the country.
On Monday, Wyndham Lessem, 42, and Andrew Warren, 56, were issued a first-degree bail-free murder warrant in connection with the death of Trenton H. James Cornell Duranello, Cook County court records show.
Cornell Duranello, 26, died from multiple stab wounds, according to the documents.
A community alert issued by the Chicago Police Department said the body was found on July 27.
After receiving the call, the police arrived at the Grand Plaza apartment and found a number of lacerations in the victim's body.
Cornell Duranello died on the spot and detectives are investigating the killing, while police are actively searching for two suspects, police said.
Lessem has been an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Allen K. Kobach, deputy director of the Campus Relations Branch, said in an emailed statement that Lessem has now been removed from his job and has been barred from the Northwestern University campus.
"Now this is a criminal case, the authorities are investigating and Northwestern University is actively cooperating with the investigation," Mr Kobach said.
Warren is a senior financial assistant at Oxford University.
In an emailed statement, a spokesman for Somerville College, Oxford University, said: "We have been in contact with the British police and stand ready to assist US investigative agencies as needed."
The statement added that Warren's colleagues were deeply shocked and wanted him to turn himself in.
Anthony Guglielmi, the chief liaison officer of the Chicago Police Department, said he strongly encouraged the suspect to turn himself in to the authorities.
Mr Guglielmi said that "the police already have a general idea of their whereabouts and we are trying to locate the possible location."
Mr Guglielmi said local, regional and national authorities were doing their utmost to assist in the search of the suspects.
Mr Guglielmi said police had received a call from the manager of the Grand Plaza apartment, who had just received a secret tip that something had happened to apartment 1008.
Police said the situation was terrible at the time.
Guglielmi said it was still unclear whether the incident also took place on July 27.
According to the security camera, he said, it was confirmed that Lessem and Warren were in the building at the time.
"We believe that Professor Lessem has something to do with the victims," Guglielmi said.
"The police are currently studying the victim's timeline and background and are investigating various motives, including a possible domestic incident," Grand Plaza's management team said in a statement to residents.
"We will complete the World Anti-Doping Agency roadmap in the near future," Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mutko said
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said it would not take too long to implement the remaining standards of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) for the restoration of the rights of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA).
"The implementation of the road map standards has reached a certain stage, and RUSADA has been granted the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD (UK Anti-Doping Agency).
The WADA roadmap has been updated in this regard, "Mutko said on Thursday.
Deputy Prime Minister Mutko made the remarks when commenting on the second part of the World Anti-Doping Agency's road map, "Compliance," which sets out the criteria for the restoration of RUSADA rights and was recently posted on the organization's website.
According to Mutko, the standard does not contain anything that could cause concern for Russia.
"Everything has to be announced and everything will be done," he added.
And the results will be presented to the IOC and WADA in the near future.
One of the criteria mentioned in the list, however, is that the Russian Anti-Doping Agency must publicly accept the findings of a WADA-approved investigation by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren into Russian state support for the use of stimulants in national sport.
Speaking of the matter, Mutko said: "We are investigating and there is no doubt that our anti-doping system has failed.
All measures have been implemented.
But there's no national plan behind it, and we're not going to acknowledge something that doesn't exist, "he said.
Mutko's remarks echoed those of Vitaly Smirnov, the head of Russia's Independent Public Anti-Doping Commission.
Smirnov acknowledged past problems with the Russian Anti-Doping Agency during a visit to the media Russian Outlet RSport earlier in the day, but added: "We have said on various occasions that the report contains controversial positions and regulations.
No one plans to accept the report unconditionally, "Smirnov said.
In the wake of the doping scandal in November 2015, WADA suspended RUSADA's right to carry out doping tests in Russia.
But in June, RUSADA was allowed to plan and coordinate testing this year under the supervision of international experts and UKAD.
During a visit to the group's headquarters in Moscow in July, WADA Director General Olivia Negri said RUSADA was "moving in the right direction" in an effort to restore its rights.
For computers, whether it's a chess game or a national chess game, beating the human race was out of the question a few decades ago.
The president of the Croatian Football Association, Davo Suk, said in an interview that participation in the China Cup is very meaningful for Croatian football and that the prize money for the China Cup is very high.
There is no need to find a replacement! These 8000 kinds of products have zero tariff.
At a regular press conference held by the Ministry of Commerce on January 11, a spokesman for the Ministry of Commerce said that up to now, there are 15 free-trade agreements in force in China, involving 23 countries and regions, covering more than 8,000 tariff-free imports.
At the same time, imported cosmetics, Icelandic salmon, Chilean red wine, ASEAN tropical fruit ... you don't need to buy these products at a big price.
At present, China has signed 16 free trade agreements with 24 countries and regions, and 15 have entered into force, covering more than 8,000 tariff-free imports.
In the case of agricultural products, with the implementation of the FTA, consumers will be able to taste high-quality and low-cost agricultural products from different places of origin throughout the year.
For example, the import tariff on tropical fruits such as durian, lychee and dragon fruit in ASEAN has been reduced from 15% to 30% to zero.
The import tariff on Icelandic salmon has been reduced from 10% to 12% to zero;
For red wine in Georgia and Chile, import duties are reduced from 14 to 30% to zero;
There are also New Zealand beef and milk powder and other characteristics of agricultural products, such as a substantial reduction in taxes.
In the case of industrial products, for example, import duties on some cosmetics in Switzerland have been reduced to zero;
Some watch import duties have been reduced by 50% and will be reduced to zero in a few years.
In South Korea, import tariffs on refrigerators, rice cookers, massages, beauty machines and other products have been reduced by 40% and will be reduced to zero in a few years.
There are also consumer electronic products, such as a large reduction in taxes.
At the same time, the zero-tariff products under the FTZ also include the intermediate products and raw materials needed for the manufacture of many domestic terminal consumer goods, which have also contributed to the structural upgrading of domestic consumer goods to a certain extent.
A spokesman for the Ministry of Commerce said that nearly one-third of China's total imports can enjoy preferential tariff treatment under the FTA, most of which are terminal consumer goods, bringing tangible benefits to consumers.
Further reduction of import tariffs on consumer goods
Since December 1, 2017, China has adjusted import duties on some consumer goods to further reduce import duties on consumer goods, covering a wide range of consumer goods such as food, health products, medicines, daily necessities, clothing, shoes and hats, household equipment, cultural entertainment and daily miscellaneous goods, involving a total of 187 8-digit tariff codes.
The average tax rate on these consumer goods will be reduced from 17.3% to 7.7%, almost "cut off"!
As of January 1, 2018, our country has also made some adjustments to other import and export tariffs.
The import duty on some cosmetics, such as lip balm, eye shadow and perfume, has been reduced from 10% to 5%.
A reduction in tariffs means that consumers do not have to buy on their behalf, much less go abroad to buy their favorite foreign products.

EXPORT: Year-end U.S. mall rules for big shopping returns to be cautious
China New Network on December 29
As soon as Christmas is over, there is a wave of returns, according to the US-based World Daily.
More than half of the goods sold last Christmas were refunded, ABC reported.
In addition, a number of readers have been tricked into buying online, consumers need to pay more attention when shopping on informal websites.
In general, large shopping companies have formal and reasonable return procedures, but if you buy gifts or electricity from small stores, you must be careful.
Ms. Hou, of Roland Gunn, bought a coat for more than RMB60 (U.S. dollars) at an online store selling printed coats on December 1 local time, but it has not been sent to date.
She sent an email to the customer service, and there was no reply.
Another netizen, traveling to the United States last year, bought a mobile phone from a third-party seller, and sent it to find that it was a box of rubber mud.
When you know you have been cheated, apply for a refund from the website and get a full refund.
But there are also customers who believe that the website refund service is not 100% perfect.
Mr. Wang, a Chinese-American resident of Northern California, said he had twice purchased an emergency delivery service for a site, one for four yuan, but both times it was not delivered on time.
An application for a refund has since been made and no reply has been received.
Large shopping malls or shopping malls have a better return policy.
Most of Macy's products are fully refunded within 180 days.
However, the goods must remain "original" and must have purchase documents such as receipts or bank purchase records.
If there is no voucher, customers can also get store points, which can be used to buy other goods.
Target typically has a 90-day return period for general merchandise and a 15-day return period for electronic items.
But the return period for electronic and recreational goods purchased between November 1 and December 25, 2017 was extended to 30 days.
It should be noted that the 30-day refund period starts on December 25, which is to be returned by January 25, 2018.
Extreme shopping experience and the advent of a new era of shopping development in the business world
More than a decade ago, our country is still in the seller's market in general, people's choice is limited, the demand is also limited.
But after a decade of development, the market has been transformed from a seller's market to a buyer's market, and today's consumer tastes have become more sophisticated, and they are no longer content with simple "hand-in-hand" shopping.
So how to give consumers an extreme shopping experience is the next point of competition for real estate developers.
Among the many factors that affect the consumer shopping experience, the shopping center in the business circle is the most important.
See how the city builders pay attention to the shopping experience.
There are no two exactly the same leaves in the world, not to mention two exactly the same shopping centers, a well-known shopping center must have its own characteristics.
For example, the world-famous Kanye shopping centre in Turkey, with its unique wavy architectural design inspired by the Grand Canyon, is known as the homophonic Kanye, walking in the 200-meter walk of the minister in Kanye as if he were in the Grand Canyon.
In addition to the canyon-style design, there is a large, inward-facing oval venue in the centre of the shopping centre, which is unique in shape and often features performances.
Because of the open platform design, visitors can walk on each floor to look at the activities carried out in the "canyon" and have the effect of changing the scene.
At home, the Nanjing Forest Moore Commercial Street, known as China's first forest-style ramble, combines shopping with ecology and fairy tales.
7000 m2 green space square, 3000 m2 roof water platform, the project consists of nine monolithic buildings, the air link between the buildings, the overall subsidence courtyard design, the topography of the French sycamore trees for the construction of the epidermis, roof water platform, to create a forest-like feeling.
Walking into the forest moor is like accidentally falling into the rabbit hole of Alice in Wonderland, climbing along the trunk of a tree to frame the building, the meadow, the clear spring, and bring people into a forest full of life and vitality.
There are also more than 50 international top-selling flagship stores, more than 100 international top brands and more than 500 well-known domestic and foreign brands built in Chongqing and Longhu to create a service industry agglomeration, the theme of the business center with distinctive features, and plans to bring in more than 50 international top-selling flagship stores, more than 100 international top brands and more than 500 well-known domestic and foreign brands in the future.
Not only that, but it also integrates ecology into architecture, guided by TOD public transport. It combines fashion shopping, life service, catering, entertainment, education and sports. It also leads consumers to enjoy the unique "waterfront culture" of Chongqing, which combines shopping with water entertainment and leisure.
On the whole, it can be found that some housing companies have now learned the trajectory of this new urban business, and industry insiders say that this consumer-focused model of how to combine shopping with experience will also be the mainstay of urban development in the future.
Today's business circle is not only a collection of goods, but also a combination of arts and culture and creative themes. It also bears the responsibility of people to live in the city.
Therefore, while satisfying the one-stop-shop material needs of consumers, maximizing the transmission of cultural and artistic multi-level spiritual needs, and giving full play to the habitable housing needs, is bound to be the high point of the future development of the business community.
In Chongqing, Guoxing's north shore Jiangshan, located in the north of the river, near the Guanyin Bridge, brings together the best of the world's business, international giants around the world, first-class brands, and close links with international fashion.
It is a bustling place that gathers the essence of the world.
Dongyuan Kam Yue has a better shopping environment, Dongyuan Kam Yue near the Nanping business circle, enjoy the west and even the country's leading four-storey three-dimensional transportation system, improve the shopping comfort.
In addition, the two pedestrian streets of Huidong Road and Wanda Square have been landscaped, the landscape floor has been upgraded, about 300 trees have been planted, 40,000 m2 have been reconstructed, and the image of Nanping business circle has been enhanced.
Longhu Yu Lake 1, near Chongqing's first low-density waterfront business circle, is surrounded by nine parks, low density and high degree of openness, making people more willing to stop, stop and slowly enjoy the fun of shopping, rather than being rushed forward by the people behind them, the real realization of "walking shopping."
Today's commercial competition will only become more and more fierce, how to kill a blood road in the market with serious homogeneity, and win the reputation of "shopping mecca" in the hearts of future consumers, it is worth all real estate developers to think seriously.
Differentiation strategies alone are not enough. Only developers who really put consumers in their hearts, anxious consumers, and eager consumers, who want to provide consumers with the ultimate and minimalist shopping experience, can laugh at the storm-hit market.
Of course, at the end of the day, I think it was the people of Chongqing who had such a good shopping experience and business circle that no one could have imagined today's prosperity 10 years ago.
Festival of Things: Consumerism revelry conceals real environmental prices
US $168.2 billion, this is November 11, 2017, within 24 hours of the "Sky Cat Double Eleven Global Carnival," the amount spent by Skycat users.
Specifically, after the start of "Double 11", just three minutes of cat turnover exceeded RMB10 billion, 6.05 seconds more than RMB20 billion, and nine hours more than RMB100 billion.
On this day, the total number of payments made by consumers around the world through PayPal reached 1.48 billion, up 41% from last year.
These consumption will bring 812 million logistics orders.
Whether it is Skycat buying platform or PayPal payment platform, all belong to Ma Yun's Ali Group.
Ten years ago, no one would have imagined that the "Singles Day" subculture, created on November 11 by single young people out of self-deprecation, would be compiled by electric merchants into what is now a phenomenon-class "double-11" shopping carnival.
On November 11, 2009, Alibaba used the "Singles Day promotion" marketing stunt for the first time: No one is in love with you, so "single dogs" come online to buy it.
The results came as a surprise, with Taobao (the forerunner of "Skycat ") trading at more than RMB52 million, 10 times the amount of daily transactions at the time.
Since then, "Double 11" has become Alibaba-built shopping carnival, from the beginning of domestic buyer sellers amuse themselves, to the current influx of businesses around the world, nine years on, the sky cat "double 11" 100 billion transactions have been more than 3,200 times that of that year, making "Black Friday" out of reach.
Following the wind of the cat "double eleven" promotion, there are a number of electric merchants, of which "Jingdong" is the most powerful.
"Jingdong" has its own shopping festival, "6.18," but there is no "double 11" impact, from November 1 to 11 this year, "Jingdong" cumulative sales of RMB127.1 billion.
And "double 11", followed by a similar "double 12" discount revelry, Christmas New Year shopping season.
Over the New Year, Chinese consumers are waiting for the pre-Spring Festival shopping season, Valentine's Day shopping, consumption, will not have a holiday.
The environmental problems caused by the massive consumption of transient time have attracted the attention of professionals and institutions.
According to Xinhua Daily Telegraph, according to the usual standard conservative estimate of 0.2 kg per package in the industry, at least 300,000 tonnes of waste were generated during the "double 11" period this year.
Liu Hua, director of the pollution prevention and control program at Greenpeace East Asia, told the Chinese-foreign dialogue that this year's "double 11" orders alone will produce 160,000 tons of packaging waste.
The National Post Office issued a report in 2016, noting that the 2015 "Double 11" period (November 11-16) had about 780 million pieces of express mail, using more than 3 billion woven bags, 99.22 billion packing cases, 16,985 million metres of tape, and that the length of the tape could circle the Earth's equator 425 times.
This year, the National Post Office expects the "double 11" express business volume to be more than 1.5 billion.
Wang Shi, manager of a garbage incineration center in Beijing, told Xinhua that every day after "double 11", more than 2,000 tons of waste entered the site, and more than the capacity of the incineration station to deal with it.
Express companies have become aware of the environmental pollution caused by the express delivery industry.
Some e-commerce logistics companies, including Suning, have introduced recyclable plastic courier boxes, which can be reused as recycling bags for shopping bags and garbage bags, but the acceptance of troubled consumers is not high.
Ma also called on the logistics industry to support "green packaging" and "green logistics" in Weibo.
The tweet gained more than 68,000 "praise."
What kind of mobile payment do the Germans want?
Zhang Dongfang: The mobile payment war in Germany is not expected.
Micro-credit payment and payment treasure but moved the battlefield to Europe, the competition has not changed, the position has not changed -- the Chinese, this is also global?
Where there is a treasure to pay, there must be a micro-letter to pay.
Under an agreement with Wirecard, the German e-payment service, micro-payments officially landed in Germany in November and are gradually being laid out across Europe.
This foreign reunion between the two "townsfolk" took place in Europe.
PayPal and micro-credit payments have long been singing along the path of globalization.
For China's global approach to mobile payments, Arie consults with China's Third Party Mobile Payments Industry Research Report 2017, which concludes in two ways: through strategic investment, experience output, equity and support for local mobile payment companies abroad.
Second, through the consumption behavior of Chinese tourists abroad, the promotion of mobile payment services to foreign businesses, thus changing the recognition and acceptance of Chinese mobile payment in foreign countries.
It is true that the Chinese have the world.
With China's rapid economic growth and a large population base, the cost of Chinese tourists in Europe is an attractive figure.
But it is also doomed, this time in Germany, the China Mobile payment war is not expected.
Micro-credit payments and payouts are simply moving the battlefield to Europe, where competitors have not changed, and where the loot has not changed -- or the Chinese, which is also global?
More ground-breaking is the question of whether China's mobile payments will be able to expand its territory in Europe.
Take Germany, for example.
Magical "New Retail"
Chen Xin Lei, Yang Kaihan: Amazon announced its foray into bookstores and grocery stores as it squeezed into the world's top 10 retailers, and both timing and motivation are well worth the fun.
In November 2015, Amazon opened its first physical bookstore in Seattle, followed by two bookstores in Portland and San Diego.
At the start of 2017, Amazon opened stores in New York and plans to have at least eight stores by the end of the year.
Almost at the same time, Amazon announced that its no-one supermarket (Amazon Go) was trying to operate, that customers would not have to queue up or check out, enter the door sweep code, take the desired item and leave, and that the amount of shopping would automatically be deducted from the customer's Amazon account.
In the case of Amazon, it has been a great surprise that in recent years there has been a lot of action on the physical store.
Because as early as 2007, in an open letter to shareholders, CEO Jeff Bezos stressed that Amazon would not open brick-and-mortar stores easily unless the following four conditions were met at the same time:
1. We must be sure that this new opportunity will give shareholders a return on their investment.
We must be sure that this new opportunity is of great significance to the company as a whole.
We must make sure that this new opportunity is ignored by the market.
We must make sure that in this market, we have enough resources to make customer-oriented differentiation.
Bookstores and grocery stores, two of the most faltering categories in brick-and-mortar retail, were the first rivals to fall after the rise of Amazon.
As Amazon squeezes into the world's top 10 retailers, it is worth playing with both timing and motivation to announce its foray into the two physical markets.
Does Amazon's approach run counter to the guarantees in the shareholder letter?
A similar sound was heard at the other end of the globe, where Alibaba Board Chairman Ma Yun delivered a keynote speech on the morning of October 13, 2016, at the Hangzhou Cloud Congress.
"Starting next year, Alibaba will not mention the word'e-commerce '," he said.
The era of pure electricity merchants will soon come to an end, and there will be no e-commerce in the next decade or two, replaced by'new retail '.
The combination of offline and logistics will lead to new retail sales, "he said.
For a moment, "new retail" three words as if by magic, by the industry people often hang in the mouth.
But what exactly does "new retail" mean?
If it is just a combination of the line and the line, then the concept is not new.
After tracking 180 of the largest electricity providers in 2016, eMarketer estimated total sales of about US $200 billion, while the top 25 accounted for more than US $15.9 billion.
Of the 25, 18 are traditional retailers that have only started operating online in the past five years (such as Macy's, Nordstrom, Target, Gap, etc.).
And Alibaba Group RMB28.3 billion into the shares of Su Ning Yun business, but also in the past.
Globally, retailers and electricians are moving from a single channel to a full-channel retail system that covers brick-and-mortar stores, electricians, mobile-end and social media.
Is Ma Yun-ti's "new retail" more a summing-up than a vision of the future?
If not, what is the difference between a full-channel concept and a "new retail"?
Perhaps the crux of the problem is not whether the line and the line will merge, but how.
Looking back at the retail sector over the past 20 years, the rise of electricity companies, like the rise of discount retailers in the early years, has focused on price and convenience.
Relying on these two pain points, the electrician moved highly standardized products, such as books and CDs, down the line.
With the development of online consumption habits and the continuous improvement of customer experience, the electric quotient extended its tentacles to other categories, and began to improve efficiency.
In the words of Alibaba CEO Zhang Yong, "Using the ideas and technologies of the Internet to comprehensively reform and upgrade the current total of about 30 trillion social retailers makes it possible for Chinese consumers' escalating consumer demand to be effectively met, making the whole process of commodity production, circulation and service more efficient because of the extensive use of the Internet and big data."
Therefore, the electric quotient's road, is a surface light assets, the actual heavy assets of the road.
"Light" means that the burden of fixed assets, staffing, management processes and so on is not as large as the traditional retail industry; "heavy" refers to the need for huge input in logistics, warehousing and so on.
The change of the logistics mode ensures the high efficiency of the electric quotient.
According to the Chinese government network, Premier Li Keqiang of the State Council chaired the executive meeting of the State Council on April 28, which concluded that expanding domestic consumption demand is an important measure for steady growth and restructuring.
It was determined that the relevant departments should come up with concrete plans on the basis of scientific evaluation.
Some of the foreign daily consumer goods with high demand for domestic consumers will be piloted by the end of June this year to reduce import tariffs and gradually expand the scope of tax-reducing commodities.
Combining with the tax reform, we will improve the consumption tax policy of consumer goods such as clothing and cosmetics, and adjust the tax range, tax rate and collection link in an integrated manner.
The establishment and restoration of port entry duty-free shops, the reasonable expansion of duty-free varieties, the increase of a certain amount of duty-free shopping, to facilitate domestic consumers to buy foreign products in China;
We will further promote the convenience of customs clearance and tax rebate for overseas passengers, and strictly implement the voluntary declaration and tax payment requirements for imported goods in accordance with the law.
To formulate the inspection and quarantine policy to support the import of cross-border electricity traders, and to clean up the unreasonable charges for the import links;
Accelerate the promotion of Chinese product brand, support the development of brick-and-mortar stores, and realize on-line interaction.
Standardize the market order, crack down on fake and shoddy, and promote the survival of the fittest.
Let the consumer can be comfortable nearby, convenient shopping.

On January 18, Alibaba held a Summit Dialogue on Poverty Alleviation for Electric Traders in Chongqing, announcing that by exploring a new model of "Internet + Poverty Alleviation", Alibaba would help push precision out of poverty and rejuvenate the countryside.
This is after the introduction of rural strategy, the launch of rural Taobao project, on-line rural poverty alleviation platform, the establishment of Alibaba Poverty Alleviation Fund, Ali to the fight against poverty again "code."
The fight against poverty is one of the most important national strategies in China today.
Total poverty alleviation has never been achieved in China in the past few thousand years.
"E-commerce poverty alleviation is a new round of pro-poor development of innovative measures, is the realization of precision poverty alleviation, precision poverty eradication of the important grasp.
The central government attaches great importance to and points out that it can give full play to the role of the Internet in helping to lift people out of poverty, promote accurate poverty alleviation, and get agricultural products out of the countryside through the Internet. "
As a result, Ali has proposed a rural strategy as early as 2014, along with big data cloud computing and globalization, and is listed as Ali's three core strategies for the next 20 years.
In the same year, Ali launched a rural Taobao (village Taobao) project to recruit "village sophomore" in the countryside, leading farmers to get rich through electricity merchants.
In 2017, Ali worked with the business sector to create a pro-poor channel for agriculture and agriculture, with a total of 13 provinces and 120 poverty-stricken counties at the national level.
The village of Taobao, spawned by the Ali platform, already has 2,118.
Of these, nearly 400 appeared in poverty-stricken counties in the province and 33 in poverty-stricken counties in 13 countries.
In 2017, sales of Taobao Village across the country reached RMB120 billion on Alibaba's China retail platform.
Zhang Yong said that in the face of the national strategy to fight poverty, Ali has been thinking about how to use the technology, big data, cloud computing and other innovative capabilities of Ali's economy to make a new way out of poverty.
Among them, the village Taobao is the main carrier platform for Ali electric merchants to lift themselves out of poverty, and went through a direct-to-direct Internet anti-poverty new link.
In the planting link, the village Taobao and the ant gold clothing jointly carry out agricultural tools and micro-loan support.
In 2017, of the 832 poverty-stricken counties at the national level, Ant Gold Service served 795, providing them with convenient payment, credit and other services.
The rookie deals with warehousing and logistics, the cat is responsible for sales, and Ali Yun's big data feed guides agricultural production to further improve the supply standards, quality and market competitiveness of agricultural products.
The development of electricity business out of poverty requires not only products, sales channels, industrial planning, but also talent.
Through the introduction of e-commerce courses at Taobao University, Ali taught farmers standardized, qualitative and large-scale planting methods, and achieved a combination of "pro-poor and pro-mental" to enable farmers to lift themselves out of poverty on a sustainable basis.
These courses already cover about 92% of the poverty-stricken counties at the national level.
And the "public welfare mentality, business means" of the way out of poverty, can also guarantee Ali in the poverty alleviation to achieve "real poverty alleviation."
Ma Yun, chairman of Alibaba's board of directors, has said that poverty eradication should be divided into three stages: poverty alleviation, poverty eradication and enrichment.
Poverty alleviation is to teach people to fish, poverty alleviation is to teach people to fish, to get rich is to build a "fish pond" for farmers, so that farmers can have fish to feed.
Electric business-driven industry to help the poor, is to build fish pond.
In the industry poverty alleviation, Ali and Shaanxi Luochuan cooperation to create the Luochuan apple industry poverty alleviation model, has been used by the relevant departments as an example to replicate and spread throughout the country.
Ali's anti-poverty work has also been recognized at the decision-making level.
Alibaba as the representative of the electric business enterprises have been sent, through the online channel, to ensure that farmers increase production and income.
Some village sophomore and ant gold service employees have also been invited to the United Nations and Africa to share the experience of e-commerce in getting out of poverty.
At present, the China office of the United Nations World Food Programme has been with the village Taobao, in Anhui and other places to carry out the electricity business industry to help the poor.
The Third Congress of New Economic Think Tank, co-organized by the Ali Institute and the China Vision think tank, was held on January 16. Zhang Li, Director of the Institute of Electronic Commerce of the Ministry of Commerce, attended the meeting and delivered a speech.
She believes that our globalization actually ignores the most important issues, namely, the body and use of globalization, as well as the stage of globalization.
In this way, many people believe that globalization has stalled, and that many developed and developing countries, in the new phase, have a different attitude towards globalization and a different approach to the model.
The second concept is the question of the medium-term phase of globalization, and what are the constraints on the medium-term phase of globalization?
Restricted by the foundation of the economic environment, it is precisely because of the change in the economic base that globalization has taken place.
Zhang believes that the global economic adjustment is largely over at the end of 2017 and will enter a new period of growth after 2018, and that the next round of growth must be driven by raw products.
Beijing's first fresh supermarket, 7FRESH, recently opened, with plans to lay more than 1,000 stores across the country over the next three to five years.
Add to that Ali's box of fresh horses, Yonghui's superspecies, Su Sheng in Suning, Pocket Fish in the United States, and so on, and the "new retail stores" are starting to pile up and "whack" each other on innovative models and even prices.
Fresh supermarket competition to upgrade, has become a phenomenon-level topic in the new retail sector, where is the new retail in the end?
"We will quickly enter the country in 2018, and there will be a lot of shops in Beijing, Shanghai and Hangzhou before the Spring Festival," he said.
Box Ma Shengsheng CEO Hou Yi on the 10th at the second new retail summit revealed the 2018 "new play."
"Starting in 2018, Box Horse is not just a fresh electricity dealer, but a life-class electrician who meets the immediate needs of consumers," he said.
Under the core mode line is the drainage, the experience, the line is the real sale. "
Unlike the traditional big market, the supermarket, the box horse fresh in the eyes of many consumers is a fun and delicious "net red shop", and even an intermediary has played out the concept of "box room".
On-line e-commerce platform and off-line retailers have advantages and disadvantages, but consumers are in a variety of channels, so both sides are trying the full-channel model.
The industry believes there will be an increasing number of "box-horse" stores in 2018, against the backdrop of a consumer upgrade.
And the box horse continues to explore more consumer areas from its original freshness, heralding more innovation in the retail market in the new year.
"For example, the online combination of the business model, has attracted the attention of consumers, all over the opening of the fresh supermarket is a good call."
"But no matter how much these relationships are said, no matter how flashy they are, it turns out that if you bring a good experience to the consumer, I'm willing to pay for it when I have a good experience," he said.
In the new retail environment, consumer habits have changed and demand for purchases has changed, according to Yuan Bin, co-CEO of Datong Feifei.
The original pure line, the line is split, the line to beat the line, the line to counter-attack the line, is now hand-in-hand, because the consumer has no line under the line of distinction.
Capital competition into the bureau, so that the current fresh supermarket as the representative of the new retail powder flavor.
According to the analysis, the new retail competition in the first-tier cities is still far from the Red Sea, and there are still a large number of second-tier cities to be excavated, and there is still a lot of opportunity and space in the market.
Different types of industries for the layout of new retail, will bring the development of new retail into a pluralistic state of development.
CCTV Financial Channel, in conjunction with the Institute of Financial Strategy of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, combed out a dry goods, which is the heavy annual report on the development of China's electricity business.
In the past year, what kind of report card has been produced by the Chinese electrician?
What are the trends in the global electricity industry?
Let's find out one by one.
Total sales record-breaking growth rate back on track
Since 2006, China's online retail sales can be said to have been showing super-fast growth, it is estimated that at that time the Internet shopping is very fresh, do not go out to buy things, too cool!
But starting in 2013, online retail growth began to fall below 50%, falling below 40% for the first time in 2015, to 26.2% in 2016.
But things are different this year, with online retail sales accelerating again, with growth picking up to 34.2% in January-September.
It was significantly higher than the rate of growth in 2015 and 2016.

Second, the French netizens, who love to chop their hands, buy US $1,925 per person, and they buy the most goods online, clothing, is a country that loves fashion.
Favorite online shopping, must be young people?
Helps you avoid the company becoming the next best start-up
Amy Elrett once wanted to investigate the well-being of employees at her e-commerce start-up, but the survey didn't work.
The responses are often vague, unhelpful and, even worse, deceptive.
Even if she promises to be anonymous, some employees still don't trust the process.
"There is a lack of consistency and objectivity in the response," said Madison Reed, a San Francisco-based e-commerce hair care company that manages 75 people.
So she called for help.
A number of new human resources start-ups have sprung up to help the company understand how employees feel.
They build and authorize software specifically designed to measure employee participation, which allows companies to quickly poll specific teams and population groups, provide anonymous and complaint hotlines for employees, and, in some cases, allow whistleblowers to bypass executives to report directly to the board.
"Now, you can track your health with tools like Strava and Fitbit, but where is the company's Fitbit?" says Jim Barnett, co-founder and chief executive of Redwood City startup Glint, which is used by companies to measure employee engagement.
In three years, she said, she used Glint to gain more insight into what employees think and feel.
In addition to the team-specific quick surveys and polls, Glint also provides a hot map of the company, which units complain the most, and which managers approve low scores at a glance-which gives her an in-depth understanding of why.
Companies are beginning to realize that they have to master the company's workplace culture so as not to be the next best step, after a former employee published a blog post describing the harassment environment in which the speakers were punished by the company and then fell into a scandal.
For start-ups such as Glint, the company's desire for oversight is a lucrative business opportunity.
The value of the global governance, regulatory and compliance industries is likely to exceed US $118.7 billion by 2020, according to financial technology analytics website Let's Talk Payments.
Convergent, a start-up in Denver, Colo., dedicated to helping companies prevent and detect bad behavior, saw an increase in interest and activity earlier this year during a period of damage to its reputation.
Convergent has nearly 600 customers, including Ai Pei-ying, Microsoft and Tesla.
You recently signed up to become a client.
Like Glint, Convergent allows companies to send customised "diagnostics" surveys, collect confidential responses in real time, and view heat maps of their problem areas.
Convergent also offers anonymous text-messaging hotlines for employees to report bad behavior.
If the chairman is involved, the complaint will go directly to the board.
Patrick Quinlan, founder and chief executive of Convergent, said: "The court of public opinion has usurped the powers of the regulator.
If a company is found to treat its employees badly or behave unethically towards them, even if regulators don't step in, the company could face high consequences of consumer resistance, staff turnover and involvement in litigation, Mr Quinlan said.
Ruby Tuesday, a catering chain that spans more than 500 locations and employs more than 25,000 people, has been using Convergent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of work guidelines and procedures and provide easy access to the company's headquarters.
Before that, if employees want to report problems, they must find the company's headquarters phone number or email, file a formal complaint, and hope that the headquarters will take it seriously.
It's often a daunting and unsettling experience, says James Vetrano, general counsel for Ruby Tuesday, who doesn't think there's a good way to track employee complaints.
But now that the company uses Convergent, it can more quickly identify and address issues previously unknown to executives in distant offices, cities or states-such as discrimination, harassment or unfair pay practices.
"I can get a closer, 360-degree overview of the work experience," says Vitrano, who runs the Ruby Tuesday risk management team.
"We are protecting our shareholders from employment litigation."
Mr Quinlan said companies had been paying more attention to ethics, values and employee professionalism since 2002, following the collapse of Andorra's accounting firm in the wake of the Enron scandal.
But it wasn't until "social media went into their own world" that companies realized they couldn't stop their exploding material from going viral online.
"Before using technology to monitor ethics, people see hope as a strategy," he said.
Both Glint and Convergent provide their software as a service and charge companies a recurring fee for the use of their products.
This business model and business opportunities are supported by venture investors, who have already provided support for the two start-ups.
In February, Convergent raised US $10 million from companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, and its total capital rose to US $47 million.
In November, Glint received US $10 million from Bessemer Ventures Partners, with a total of US $60 million.
Given the interrelationship between companies, culture and venture capital, these investments are hardly surprising.
A growing body of research has shown that today's employees have higher expectations of the workplace than before.
In a competitive market like Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are just bets.
Employees want to feel that they are accepted, valued, and that their time is spent in a company with a positive mission.
"When people are happy to join the company and feel that their voices are being listened to, and the work they do is beneficial, they are more committed to making the company successful," said Nina McCartney, vice president of global welfare and employee experience at LinkedIn, which uses both Convergent and Glint.
Investors return when their portfolio companies do well; the company does well when employees are loyal and dedicated.
If the third-party analysis tool promises to increase staff loyalty and professionalism, it is not surprising that they will seek financial support.
Workplace culture experts say it is important to have data on employee engagement.
However, unless the company's administrators take action, the data will be of no use.
In fact, if a company asks for feedback from its employees, it can be expected that the company is making changes.
If change is not moving fast enough, or if there is no progress at all, it can lead to disappointment and lead to employees leaving the company.
"If you're looking for 4,000 pieces of advice, then you need to be ready for 4,000 conversations," said Russell Rath, head of consulting at business management firm Cote International, who has seen some companies rely too heavily on data collection errors.
"Because if you don't follow up all the way, the staff will think, 'Do you really hear what I'm saying?
Do you care?
If you don't care, why should I care?
Mr Erette said Madison Reed, who now conducts monthly staff surveys, had been able to take action on the day of the Glint report.
After collecting feedback from employees that they were frustrated by the speed of decision-making and the quality of communication, she was able to solve the problem by reorganizing the company's internal team and increasing communication training.
Ruby Tuesday is gaining new insights into its workforce and, in the long run, wants to be able to make a shift in an industry known for its high rate of brain drain and better retain its staff.
"If you're not committed to creating a culture of transparency, you're going to lose talent," Vetrano said.
"If you lose talent, you will lose customers.
And when you lose a client, you lose the company.

NCAA cancels twice-a-day workouts, lengthens Bears' day-to-day workouts
It was close to 11 p.m. when UCLA football team members wandered around the team's new campus practice range for a chat.
Some players have taken off their jerseys to reveal the sweaty body of the camp's first day of hard work.
For a large part of the team, this spare few minutes is a break.
Players taking the summer course will return to the dorm to prepare for the final exam after three hours of practice and then return to the Wasserman Football Center for the meeting at 6:30 a.m. the next morning.
"The next three days are a bit of a grind for these guys," Bears coach Jim Mora said on Monday as he was about to enter Tuesday.
The NCAA canceled two practice sessions a day (designed to ease the burden on players), but actually extended their daytime training hours-at least until the end of Friday.
That's why UCLA's first three training sessions are scheduled to begin at 7:15 p.m. to accommodate a schedule that players have already crowded out.
From canceling twice-a-day workouts to more one-day workouts, the Bears began training almost a week before last season, and Mora trained at summer school for the first time in six seasons in Westwood.
They plan to start 18 training sessions on August 20, before starting pre-game preparations for the first-ever Texas farm worker game in September.
Mora said he supported the NCAA's rule adjustment, though that would add another item to the player's busy schedule.
"In three or four days, we're going to give them a huge amount of training, which is very challenging," Mora said.
"They've just passed, too. They're honing, they're all great kids.
I think about Saturday and we're going to have more time, which is really great. '
As soon as the training camp is over, UCLA will stop training, which is not an easy task given the clear vision of the adjacent parking lot and the Lushkin Center, which has been pelted with football hurled through the back of the goalposts to protect the net.
The Bears players will be staying at the hotel starting this weekend, but Mora admits there could be problems once the rooms are vacant during the season.
"We're going to take security measures," Mora said.
"This is a real concern, and the idea that someone might rent a room and sit in it and record a training scene is not far-fetched," he said.
If you have a training video, it's pretty good.
But we're going to take security measures there, and we're going to take security measures in Car Park 8.
We will make the best use of the resources available.
I don't worry too much about that.
We have a plan in place.

The Wall Street Journal reported in the morning that AT&T had canceled plans to sell Huawei's new flagship smartphone in the United States.
Huawei had planned to announce the partnership at CES this week, and AT&T cancelled it at the last minute.
In response to the news, Huawei said on January 9 that it would release new products and specific listing information to the U.S. market on January 9 local time.
Huawei says it has proved its strength over the past five years by launching high-end products in the global and US markets.
Huawei will release "the best phone you've ever heard of" at the CES show in Las Vegas on the afternoon of January 9, according to a previous report by IT Home, and the phone's ability to renew can support two days of use.
It is widely believed that Huawei's upcoming flagship phone, the Huawei Mate 10 Pro, will carry the Android Oreo system.
Yangcheng Evening News reporter Wang Li, led by Fan Bingbing, Guo Tao, Dapeng, Zhang Jia translation of the film "I am not Pan Jinlian" will be released nationwide on September 30.
Yesterday, the film held a seminar on the theme of "The Sorrow of Comedy" in Beijing, attended by three guests, Feng Xiaogang, Ning Hao and Dapeng.
The composition of the circle alternately, the director is the wayward "I am not Pan Jinlian" special place, is the composition of the circle alternately, especially with the mask lens of the round picture is very fresh.
Feng Xiaogang explained: "This subject is very similar to Zhang Yimou's" Qiu Ju Litigation ", it is very easy to think of together, I would like to do it in a way that we have not used. In fact, there is no special idea, it is fun, want to do something out of the ordinary."
Feng said he took his work as a debut, learned how to make a round picture with the photographer, and even spent hundreds of millions of dollars to get the photographer to take a ten-minute film.
Facebook will introduce fact-checking features to crack down on fake news
Facebook, the world's largest online social network, is trying to crack down on so-called fake news after it announced on Thursday that it would send more potential hoax articles to third-party testing agencies and display the results below the original post.
Facebook will start using updated machines to learn to detect possible hoaxes and send them to fact-checkers, and may display fact-checking results below the original post, the company said in a statement on its website.
Facebook has been criticized as one of the main transmission points of so-called fake news, and many believe it influenced the 2016 U.S. presidential election.
The issue has also become a major political topic in Europe, with voters suffering from a deluge of false stories ahead of France's presidential election in May, and Germany taking the lead in passing support for a penalty plan ahead of the September election and being fined if the social media network fails to remove hate posts in time.
In a separate statement in Germany on Thursday, Facebook said it was launching a new fact-checking function test in the United States, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
"In addition to seeing which stories are being questioned by third-party fact checkers, people want more context to help them make informed decisions about what they read and share," Sarah Sue, product manager for Facebook News Feedback, said in a blog post.
She added that Facebook would continue to test its "related articles" feature and make other changes to its news feeds to reduce fake news.
Create a Drawing Novel: The Story of the Castle of England
Recently, the tiny Scotney Castle starred in the compressed version of the music film, and at one point became a haven for Lady Margaret Thatcher during the 1970s and 1980s.
But Scotney, who has witnessed 700 years of turbulent history in the comfort of the Belle River Canyon in Kent, is now the inspiration for graphic novels written by Jamie Rhodes (a Yorkshireman with a special interest in historical documents and a mop head).
"I can see the handwriting of the ancients 300 years ago, and I find it so beautiful," he said wistfully.
"What kind of interpersonal relationship it is to let this letter fall into my hands."
Across the Middle Ages until the Edwardian era, "An English Castle" readings chronicled the families living in Scotney, each of which was written by different, future British artists such as Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer, and Isabel Greenberg.
This is not Roz's first book with archives as its raw material: he also wrote "The Tooth and Other Stories of the Dead in 2014," a book inspired by the literature of the British Library, a work he completed with an uncontrollable passion for creation.
"I couldn't resist the urge to write when I saw the thumb mark left on the side of the letter, written by an 18th-century double agent who worked for the Jacobites," he said.
'That's his fingerprint!
And the letters smell like smoke all the time, because at that time, you need to start a fire to be bright.
For us 300 years later, the smell made it feel like they were with us, too.
Oh, I like the archives!
For those touched by the old paper, being able to get the support of the National Trust and the Arts Council of England and live in the castle for almost four months (" To be honest, I've been around a bit longer ") seems so great that I can't believe it's true.
Roz spent days visiting Victoria's "new" castles, sifting through archives, studying many of the manor's treasures and antiques, such as hyenas hanging on the walls, and bottles that had spent centuries in the moat.
He strolled through the land and ruins of the old castle, chatting with the vagabond, the gardener, and sometimes the illustrator for his book.
Then in the evening, he would "drink some whisky and write."
Scotney's secret history is not yet clear, as the National Trust only fully entered after the death of its last heir, Elizabeth Hersey, in 2006.
Ten years later, when Roz arrived, the staff began to process the files, which he described as "hundreds of years ago the aristocrats were going:" Oh, put it in the attic. "
Diaries, letters from the days of the British Empire, map the boundaries of nations: "You'd think land disputes would be boring," Roz said. "But there would be two families fighting for a birch tree.
Let go, boys!
Some of the stories in the work take the castle as a starting point for a broader study of British history, including The Labourer, which follows a man who left the new castle to take part in the peasant uprising of 1381.
"The story in the book," The Knights of Kent and Sussex, "chronicles a riot that took place in the castle in 1380," Roz said.
"The peasant uprising began in that area, and I think it is a good place to start it.
Perhaps there is a connection between the two?
Other stories are deeply rooted in the history of the castle, such as The Priest, which tells the story of the Darrell family who hid a Jesuit priest for seven years during the Reformation.
Or "The Smuggler," the story of the 18th-century smuggler Arthur Darrell, who is thought to have given himself a funeral by filling his coffin with stones (his coffin came to light years later).
The Darrell family is Roz's favourite Scotney Castle family: "These gentlemen seem to be scoundrels, constantly borrowing money and spending money on things they can't afford to buy.
Generations of Darrell men have solved their debt problems by marrying rich old women, and I think they should be a bunch of handsome lads who know how to pursue women. '
As his mission in the castle came to an end, Roz began to look for other exotic writing experiences.
He spent two weeks in the wilds of Finland completing a drawing novel about "El? m? nm? ki," a nursing home in the early 20th century that was slowly abandoned.
But Scotney has a special place for him.
"I am very sad to leave," he said.
"It's like, 'Oh, I'm going to have to face the real life of the channel cake.'"

Big energy companies are all "rich and powerful," so which of the world's many energy companies take the most advantage of the money?
ExxonMobil, the US oil and gas producer, topped the list of the top 50 listed energy companies in 2011 with a market capitalisation of $406.3 billion, followed by PetroChina and Royal Dutch Shell.
In the PFC list, PetroChina won twice in 2007 and 2009, with ExxonMobil taking the top spot for the rest of the year.
In the top 50 list in 2011, three companies from the mainland were shortlisted, in addition to PetroChina, which ranked second, and Sinopec, which ranked 9th, and PetroChina, which ranked 15th.
However, despite the fact that oil prices are far higher than they were four years ago, the CEO of PFC Energy points out that there are a number of reasons for the low total market capitalization, including mainly the decline in gas prices in North America and the low level of activity in the global stock market.
According to the Xinhua news agency, the heavy pollution of Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei and surrounding areas from the 16th began to intensify on the 19th, Hebei Shijiazhuang, Xinji, Handan 3 city AQI appeared "explosion watch."
U.S. changes green card rules
The media, citing President Donald Trump's speech, said the United States would launch a new immigration program to change green card rules.
The plan aims to reduce legal immigration to 50,000 a year, with more stringent restrictions on temporary work visas and family-oriented visa applications.
The new rules were proposed by the Republican Party and supported by the president.
The draft law will be discussed in the two courts.
"This law will reduce poverty, raise wages and save taxpayers billions of dollars by changing the way the United States issues green cards to citizens of other countries," the US media quoted Trump as saying.
The law will replace the current programme to reduce chain migration.
This new application process is beneficial to applicants who speak English, have financial support and have skills that are conducive to economic development, "he said.
On May 29, the first China Fireworks Safety and Environmental Protection Expo will be held in Liuyang.
The event will focus on the theme of "Technology, Safety and Environmental Protection" for a period of two days. At that time, the state-of-the-art firecracker machinery, the most safe and environmentally friendly raw materials and new products in the fireworks industry will be gathered in Liuyang.
This Expo will invite a large number of experts, entrepreneurs, fireworks industry academic exchanges, sharing fireworks safety and environmental protection of the latest technological achievements.
Among them, the mechanized production equipment of fireworks and firecrackers and the display of safety and environmental protection products will be carried out in Daoyao Town. The main exhibitors include the production of drug-related machinery and equipment, low sensitivity, low explosive energy and other safe and environmentally friendly personal discharge products, such as sulfur-free and micro-smoke.
At the same time, the display of fireworks and firecrackers safety and environmental protection products co-sponsored by Liuyang 16 firecrackers enterprises is divided into two stages: product selection and product display. The outstanding new products will be put on display in Liuyang City on the night of May 29.
And referring to the upcoming 2017, Zhao Lei admitted: "After the end of the tour next year, I want to clean myself up, then settle down and write more new works."
In order to optimize the environment of the scenic area and build a beautiful South Yue, recently, the South Yue District Tobacco Bureau (Branch) "636" voluntary service brigade launched the "Mountaineering Forest, Care Home" environmental protection activities.
The activities not only received the support of all the cadres and staff of the District Tobacco Bureau, but also attracted retired senior cadres and family members to participate in environmental protection practices. The three generations of the elderly and young people worked together to protect the forest, clean up the garbage, and devote themselves to the construction of the "beautiful South Yue".
This volunteer activity aims to protect the landscape resources of South Yue and promote the concept of "caring for others, caring for society and caring for nature". It also enables the next generation to learn from childhood and inherit the virtues of voluntary service.
It is reported that since its establishment in early April this year, the "636" Volunteer Corps has developed a total of 16 members. It has launched a series of volunteer activities, such as visiting disabled retail customers, helping tobacco farmers to care for tobacco leaves and Ya'an earthquake-loving donations, and has become a volunteer force dedicated to delivering positive energy.

Sex robots are on the rise, but we should be careful
Just when you don't think 2017 will be any weirder, the field of sex robots has released a new technology development report.
Yes.
Sex robots are a big deal now.
Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) released a report looking at the development of sex robots over the next five to 10 years.
According to Noel Sharkey, emeritus professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of FRR, we need to start taking the rise of sex robots seriously.
Customers can choose the robot's eye color, nipple shape and fingernail type.
"People laugh behind their backs, but companies do launch a lot of sex robots, and we're going to see more of them," Sharkey said in the release of the new report.
Modern sex dolls have evolved from inflatable dolls to robots that have silicone skin, feel warm, and deliberately use artificial intelligence to set up a human-like sexual response.
Users can also "customize" their robots to suit their preferences, with options ranging from eye color, nipple shape to nail type or color.
But what is even more disturbing is that many robots with a "personality" will make "replicating a wife" look sophisticated.
Modern sex toys have evolved into robots with silicone skin.
For example, the RealBotix robot is able to come from definitions, such as shyness, based on characteristics that users find attractive.
There is also the Roxxy Gold sex robot, developed by True Companys, that presupposes personality traits, including the slightly shyly "cold-blooded Farah" and the "risk-averse" Wild Wendy.
"The Roxxy Gold robot has the personality to match you as much as possible," the company's website says.
So she loves what you love and hates what you hate.
She was in the same mood as a normal person in those days!
She can be lazy, she can be talkative, she can be sexually active!
The rise of sex robots brings with it a lot of unease-not just the replacement of real human relationships-but the servile femininity and the hint of rape twitching on the cold (read: resist) Farah is the most worrisome.
True Computer compares Roxxxy to a man's vibrator on its website.
"If a woman has a vibrator, why can't a man have a Roxxxy?" the website says.
However, these sex robots are not a mere fetish, nor are they just a sex toy.
Their presence and growing maturity point directly to the darker, deeper parts of our culture: fleeing from perfect gender equality to sex with subservience as an additional option.
Of course, most men don't have sex robots, and while FRR points out that sex robots are becoming more popular, they are still on the edge of consumer culture.
But what seeps through the edges allows us to see the course of our time.
A lot of people aren't weird or aggressive until the free market gives them a chance to do so.
It is no coincidence that these fine sex robots have emerged at a time when the rights of women across the globe are under threat, and that there is also a president in the White House who boasts about sexual violence against women.
The most chilling part of the TV drama "The Story of the Woman" lies not in the realistic picture, not in the hanging corpse, nor in the gouged eyes, but in the over-real imagination.
The Republic of Gilead was a jump, but now it looks like it's not far away.
The goal behind these sex robots is to do everything possible to create the body most similar to that of a real woman (albeit in proportion to a porn star).
The creators of these robots want them to have a human touch and imitate real human movements.
But to put it bluntly, their "personality" does not represent real women.
They can't break up, they can't run away.
They have no recourse agencies, no follow-up stories, no independence at all, and no possibility of breaking the illusion of total servitude.
In other words, they are sex slaves.
Or according to the popular phrase of 2017: make a woman.
"The Great Wall" tells the story of an elite Chinese army fighting for life and death against the monster Gobblers on the world-famous Great Wall in ancient times in order to defend the human race.
The final issue of the 4th season of "Run the Brothers" has been recorded, and Deng Chao, the captain of the "Run the Men" team, was interviewed by the Shenyang Evening News on May 30, a microcosm of reporters from "Run the Man" to "The Funny Scoundrel" in "The Scoundrel Angel," to "The Decadent Man" Chen Mou, Deng Chao's impression of the audience as "The Centurion," is constantly changing.
"On the show, I'm not going to do the same thing, keep updating," Mr Deng said.
The great merit of Trump?
Make Mitt Romney a microcosm of common sense
It is no surprise to the Trump era that political differences have polarized American voters and, from a microcosmic point of view, undermined the harmony of the American family.
Around Christmas and Thanksgiving, major newspapers in the United States were flooded with comments columns about how to deal with the fear of voting for Trump's relatives.
It is generally believed that we are doing everything we can to puncture our "filter bubble."
Less vociferous is the power of Trump to bring his family together.
I mention this because my cousin, a left-wing poet who lives in Chicago, has long been at odds with the Republicans in our family and is coming to visit me in New York this week.
She reminded me that being united against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.
As a result of working with Trump in the White House, all the people she knows, even Republican relatives who have been engaged in political squabbles for decades, are now suddenly and strangely on the same front.
It's certainly a good thing if it's all at the table, but what strikes me is that, from a broader perspective, it poses a significant risk.
While left-wing figures have long been encouraged by Trump, the warping effect of his presidency has pushed us all to the right.
When we talk about "normalization" and Trump, we are referring to the possibility of concern that his outlandish behavior might one day stop.
There is, however, a more worrisome long-term scenario in which Trump wants to "normalize" relations with right-wing Republicans, who have previously opposed Mr. President's standards and now suddenly look like a symbol of reason.
I find myself recently somewhat nostalgic for Mitt Romney's version of madness: putting the dog in the car, 14% of income tax (but at least we know his tax returns), and the crime of both moves does seem too minor in comparison to Trump.
After the Trump era has passed, the next Republican candidate only needs to be sensibly qualified for immeasurable improvement.
When my cousin lived in town, we took our kids to the carousel in New York Park, the largest carousel run by New York's Central Park Administration, and if you don't need coffee, these three-dollar tickets are your most expensive in the city.
The sound of the Trojan horse was thunderous, the central column was designed for fibreglass, all the clowns and animals turned their heads, looking horribly and sinister at their shoulders, and the jingling music was strangely ringing.
Too many vulgar cities are disappointing: the landscape overlooks from high-rise buildings becomes old-fashioned, the skyline becomes too familiar to provide much excitement, and the reality of the city does not sustain the dream.
Thirty-five years later, I haven't completely forgotten that day when I found out that this "Swiss cottage" was not really a Swiss cottage, but an old Swiss cottage in the theme bar, Ye Olde Swiss Cottage, which I can't remember, but near a crossing in north London.
However, the Central Park merry-go-round remains a magical experience, with everyone having fun at events where two 2-year-olds, an 11-year-old, and four girls in their 40s can all take part.
If I could evaluate the merry-go-round, I would give it full marks, but fortunately no one asked.
But this week at a department store, before brushing my credit card, I was asked to rate my trading "experience" by one to five stars.

Does lean meat, dairy products and chocolate help alleviate inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)?
Thin meat and chocolate may sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.
But a new study suggests the opposite: a diet rich in meat protein and dairy products can help relieve symptoms in patients with inflammatory bowel disease.
The incurable disease affects the lives of about 1.3 million Americans and about 300,000 Britons, leading to stomach cramps and abdominal distension, recurrent or hemorrhagic diarrhea, weight loss and extreme tiredness.
Researchers at the University of Washington typically advise patients to avoid eating meat and dairy products to relieve symptoms, but the researchers found that the protein's key amino acid, tryptophan, helps boost the growth of immune cells that increase gut tolerance.
Lead researcher Dr Marco Colonna explained that immune cells patrol the gut to ensure that harmful microbes hidden in food do not slip into the body.
There is a balance between the cells that cause inflammation and those that promote tolerance, protecting the body from damage to sensitive and vulnerable tissues.
When the equilibrium is too biased towards inflammation, inflammatory bowel disease may occur.
In the experiment, an immune-boosting cell was found in mice carrying special bacteria.
Bacteria need tryptophan, one of the components of the protein, to form the appearance of the cells.
Professor Corona said: "We have established a link between a bacterial population (Roe's Lactobacillus, which is a normal part of the gut microbiome) and the development of a cell population that promotes tolerance.
The more tryptophan the mice consumed in their diet, the more immune cells they had.
He suggested that if humans used the same method, the combination of Lactobacillus lucidum and a diet rich in tryptophan could create a more tolerant, less inflamed gut environment.
Luisa Cervantes-Barraganwas, a postdoctoral researcher, studied an immune cell that could increase tolerance when she found that one group of mice had such cells, but another group of the same strains were kept separately.
She suspects the difference is related to the gut microbiome of mice, a community of bacteria, viruses, and fungi that normally live in the gastrointestinal tract.
DNA sequencing of cholesterol in mice showed that six species of bacteria were found in mice with immune cells, but not in mice without immune cells.
The mice were raised in a sterile environment, so they lacked intestinal microbes and could not develop such immune cells, and the presence of Lactobacillus lucidum produced immune cells.
To understand how bacteria affect the immune system, the researchers cultured Lactobacillus lucidum in the liquid and then transferred a small amount of the bacteria-free liquid to immature immune cells isolated from mice.
The immune cells develop into resistant cells.
When the active ingredient is purified from the liquid, it can be proved that the active ingredient is a byproduct of tryptophan metabolism, known as indole-3-lactic acid.
When the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the mice's feed, the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent, but when tryptophan levels were halved, the number of cells was reduced by half.
Dr Cervantes-Barragan explains that people, like mice, have the same cells that enhance tolerance, and most of us have Lactobacillus in our gastrointestinal tract.
Whether humans can induce cell development with tryptophan by-products from Lactobacillus lucidum, like mice in the experiment, is not known, but genetic defects associated with tryptophan have been found in patients with inflammatory bowel disease.
She said: "The development of these cells may be exactly what we want because they can control the inflammatory response on the surface of the gut.
It can be inaccurately said that the presence of high levels of tryptophan in Lactobacillus lucidum may lead to an increase in the number of the bacteria.
Jose Mourinho believes Manchester United have signed 'Genius' Nemanja Matic
On Wednesday night, after Nemanja Matic made his debut against Sampdoria, Mourinho decided that Manchester United had signed a "talented" midfielder.
Martial, who is from Chelsea and signed for up to £40 million, won the favour of Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira by opening 2-1 in the league's final pre-season match before the European Super Cup against Real Madrid in Dublin on Tuesday.
However, in Bruce's pre-season tour of Asia, Martial was badly out of form and completed just 45 minutes, with Mourinho admitting that improvements were needed before the start of the Premier League season.
"He needs time, but he has experience, wisdom and a genius way of thinking-he thinks about football," Mourinho said.
"We will help him get ready as soon as possible."
Mourinho began arranging his starting line-up at the start of the season and, like Martial, new signings Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku have also started at the Aviva Stadium.
The Independent reported this week that Mourinho still wants to bring in three more signings but insists the club is "doing a good job" and that he has four first-choice signings in mind, three of which the club has already brought in.
"I am very grateful to the club for bringing in three of them," he added.
"I would have been happier if the club had been able to bring in all four players, but they have done a lot for me," he said.
Will China lag behind if it does not build this type of warship?
With the recent announcement of plans by the world's major naval powers for the construction of new frigates, as if overnight frigates had become the focus of the naval attention of the major powers, first Japan's decision to purchase two new frigates in its 2018 defense budget led to a substantial breakthrough in Japan's DEX frigate program, and then Lockheed Martin's recent announcement of the latest plan for the U.S. FFG frigate program, where is China's new frigate?
With the launch of the latest Type 054A frigate at the end of 2017, signalling that the 054A frigate has built as many as 29, has come close to the sum of the 053H series of frigates, while the construction of 054A has been going on for 12 years since the first 054A was launched in 2006, and even around the world, the construction of such a large number of high-performance general purpose frigates, with the exception of China, can only be compared to the US frigates built in the 1970s and 1980s.
And the reason why so much 054A was built was simple: it was affordable, easy to use, and supplemented by years of naval arrears.
054A frigate has been favored by the Chinese navy for many years because of its high cost-effectiveness and good combat capability. Its 4000-ton discharge capacity includes a 76-millimeter main gun, a 32-unit sea red flag-16 and a fish-8 anti-submarine missile, eight eagle strikes 83 and a straight-9 helicopter, although it was built in 2006 and was designed to be a very early type of ship, but its combat capability is not too high in the world.
But this is, after all, a type of ship designed at the beginning of the 21st century, with weapons deployed to one side, with power systems and electronic radar equipment already far apart from the current world's mainstream frigates, such as the European frigates already equipped with full-power propulsion, small multi-functional phased array radar, and large-size helicopter decks, and the time has come to develop a new type of ship.
So how China's new frigate should be developed is directly related to its future positioning and the strategic direction of our Chinese navy.
The future development of the Chinese navy is bound to become a blue-water navy, and the future is bound to be toward the ocean, with rapid deployment in areas where China's vital interests are at stake, a show of force, and, if necessary, a strong fighting force to ensure that China's vital interests in the region are not damaged, so it seems that the new Hu Wei River is bound to move towards large-scale and ocean-going development.
Looking at the positioning of the new frigate in the future Chinese naval sequence, the future Chinese navy should be similar to that of the U.S. Navy. Apart from the necessary offshore defense ships, other major ships will form carrier combat groups or amphibious strike groups as the case may be.
The role of the new type of frigate in the future carrier battle group should be the main anti-submarine force and the location of the mid-to-near area, in the amphibious attack ship strike group should be the frigate class, so the new type of frigate must have a strong anti-submarine capability and a good mid-range area air-release capability according to the demand.
Based on the above-mentioned positioning, it can be bold to imagine the future of the domestic frigate.
First of all, there will be a substantial increase in the volume of discharge relative to the current Type 054A frigate, which is estimated to be about 5,000-6,000 tons; the power system will adopt an integrated electric propulsion system consisting of a QC280 modified gas turbine and two diesel engines, with a maximum speed of about 30 knots and a substantial increase in the capacity of the new frigate; As for the weapon configuration 76 mm main gun and 1130 near anti-aircraft gun should be retained, but a red flag 10 launch system will be added, the main gun should be followed by a 32-48 unit red flag 16 modified and fish-8 common pendant system, the rear of the ship should be equipped with an 8-16 unit large pendulum system for launching Eagle Strike 18 and a new type of cruise missile; the hangar and downtime platform will also be increased to reach two 10-ton high-level helicopters and a low-speed radar system should be installed on the rear of the ship, and a low-speed radar system should be equipped with a high-speed control system.
As a result, the overall level of the new frigate will reach the current world-class level, even when compared with the FFG in the United States.
Of course, the above-mentioned concept is only the author of the domestic new frigate conjecture, how we can only wait until the launch of the new frigate, let us look forward to it.

In recent years, our city has encouraged enterprises to take an active part in the construction of national, industry and regional group standards, and has awarded RMB300,000 to enterprises that mainly or participate in the formulation of Zhejiang manufacturing group standards, and RMB500,000 to enterprises that have passed Zhejiang manufacturing brand certification, which is the highest amount of this award in the province, which has inspired enterprises to participate in the enthusiasm for the subject matter.
A few days ago, Wang Li Group production workshop, the head of the group system, Gao Jian, together with employees, is packing a safety door box for anti-theft, as part of the Zhejiang manufacturing group standard to meet the standard work samples, ready to be sent to Shaoxing quality testing center.
Just two days ago, Wang Li had passed the on-the-spot audit of the "Zhejiang Manufacturing" Certification Expert Group.
Mr Gao said the professional team, made up of industry technical experts and quality certification bodies, praised the group's achievements in core areas such as quality excellence, independent innovation and agreed that it was fully compliant, and that Wang would be one of the first companies to pass the standard as long as the product passed the test.
Wang Li Group is just a microcosm of the transformation and upgrading of the industry.
Our city and the simultaneous development of Zhejiang manufacturing group standards and standards of the work is also the step-yang, group-rise group.
Since the establishment of Zhejiang manufacturing team standards set by our city's anti-theft safety door industry last year, Xingyue, Xindo and other enterprises are also actively applying for docking work.

China's household debt rate is closer to that of the United States than it can afford to buy a home.
Recently, there has been a lot of discussion about the recent changes in real estate policy. Is the real estate policy going to be loosened? Will the diversification of the supply of land policy lead to a decline in house prices?
But at a time when we are worried about real estate prices, about macroeconomic regulation, and about the future of the real estate market, the People's Daily is writing again. Last time we talked about the regulation of real estate in the People's Daily Review, but now the People's Daily is writing about a more serious topic than buying a house, which is, even if you can afford to buy a house, can you afford to pay a debt?
Today, we're going to talk about a more serious problem than buying a house: paying off a loan.
China's growing housing debt crisis
In November 2017, according to data from the National Finance and Development Laboratory of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences and the National Center for Balance Sheet Research, the third-quarter China deleveraging process report, published in the overseas edition of the People's Daily on January 17, noted that leverage in the residential sector continued to rise, rising from 47.4% in the second quarter of 2017 to 48.6% in the third quarter, up 1.3 percentage points and 3.8 percentage points in the first three quarters of 2017.
The debt-to-debt ratio of the residential sector in the real economy as a whole has increased, and the leverage rate has risen at a faster rate.
Studies show that Chinese households' liabilities in financial institutions are dominated by consumer loans, accounting for about two-thirds of residents' liabilities, about twice as much as operating loans.
Among them, in consumer loans, housing loans account for about 80% of medium-and long-term loans, but in incremental terms, short-term consumer loans are growing faster than medium-and long-term loans.
On top of that, China's household debt ratio only counts the total amount of credit the family sector receives from financial institutions, while Chinese households still have a lot of private borrowing, including borrowing money from relatives and friends, with large-scale hidden debt.
According to statistics from the Suning Institute of Finance, China's resident leverage ratio was only 3% in 1996 and 18% in 2008, but it has grown rapidly since 2008, doubling to 36.4% in just six years and reaching 48.6% in the third quarter of 2017.
In May last year, HSBC released a survey of nearly tens of thousands of people across nine countries.
The report is aimed at "millennials" young people from nine countries (born between 1980 and 2000).
According to the report, China's housing ownership rate for young people after 80 and 90 is as high as 70%, well ahead of second-place Mexico (46%) and twice that of the United States (35%).
These figures tell us one of the most likely problems is that the biggest potential "grey rhinoceros" for Chinese residents at this stage is expected to be out of debt, compared with not being able to afford a home.
Second, why is the housing debt crisis the most serious problem?
As we have analysed before, although we have been saying that China has high house prices, but compared to other countries in the world, China's housing ownership rate is actually quite high, so not so much as high house prices can't afford to buy a house, I'm afraid the question to ask a lot of friends now is do you still have to pay for a loan?
We look at the real estate market all over the world. Because of its late start, China's real estate market has not had a major real estate crisis, except in Hainan, as we said before, but just a decade ago, the origin of the 2008 global financial tsunami was the real estate crisis in the United States.
The reason for the housing crisis in the United States has been blamed on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
In the golden age of the United States, real estate companies sold their homes to low-income Americans in order to expand sales, and at a time when the U.S. economy was doing well, the housing market was booming. However, as growth stagnated in the U.S. economy, leading to a decline in home buyers' incomes, a large amount of household spending began to fall.
At that time, however, the status quo in the United States was part of the financial and real estate assets of American households. Almost all of the household assets of low-income groups in the United States were real estate, while most of the assets of the top 20% of high-income groups were financial assets, resulting in higher debt ratios for the poorer households in the United States.
It is a serious fact that these people bought houses when the economy was better, so the money they paid for the mortgage was also calculated on their better income. When incomes fell, the pressure on the mortgage not only did not decrease, but even as some subprime plans became more volatile, so the real estate problems of these American families gradually became a real estate crisis.
As a result, some people are unable to afford a mortgage because their income is too low, so banks begin to take back their property, and when they take it back from delinquent home buyers, they sell it at a very low price, leading to a gradual decline in house prices in the region. This process has led to a further decline in house prices, creating a vicious circle in which more and more home buyers find that their home value is even lower than their own loans.
As a result, a huge vicious circle was formed:
"The economy is down -- incomes are down -- some people can't afford a mortgage -- banks are selling their defaulters' homes at low prices -- house prices are down -- more people stop paying their mortgages -- banks are selling again -- house prices are down again ..."
The problem is more than that, because house prices continue to fall, people stop paying the house to the bank and then you don't have any debt. If the bank auctions the house and you don't get the money you owe the bank, then you still need to pay back the money. Simply put, if you use the down payment of 600,000, the loan of 2.4 million to buy a house that was worth 3 million at the time, when the house is only worth 2 million, you don't pay back the house to the bank, and then you don't have to pay back the debt to the bank.
Thus, in one vicious cycle after another, the economy of the United States gradually collapsed, culminating in the 2008 financial crisis in the United States.
So, at this stage, China's household debt ratio has reached a high of 46.8%. This figure is still below the level of developed countries, but the problem is beginning to emerge, and the state has repeatedly emphasized deleveraging since last year. It is a very prescient judgment that the household debt ratio, if allowed to continue to rise, is bound to cause huge risks, so it is important to guard against financial risks.
So after the house is used to live, not to stir-fry the location, the state has accelerated the establishment of multi-agent supply, multi-channel security, rent-and-purchase and other measures to further defuse the potential risks.
For our individual families, we must abandon the speculative thinking of real estate, do our best when buying a house, and avoid falling into a huge burden on our own families. Only a reasonable assessment of our income and debt levels is a healthy path to the development of family wealth.

The British inventor put a chip in his body and waved his hand into the car
A British inventor who installed a chip for himself opened the front door of his home with a wave of his hand, entered the office and even started the car, becoming the first person in the country.
Steven Notham, 33, implanted a tiny chip between his thumb and forefinger and is now offering the service to companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives, which his company, Bio Teq, has achieved through technology.
He has joined forces with Dr Jeff Watson, a senior consultant anesthesiologist at the Royal Hampshire Hospital in Winchester, Hampshire, to ensure that the implant process meets medical standards.
The technology is similar to a cat-and-dog chip implant and takes only 30 seconds.
Mr Notham's company will also change the locks of rooms and vehicles to be compatible with the chip, which costs £300 per lock.

President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and senior White House officials toured manufacturing products from all 50 states.
The exhibits include a Connecticut-made helicopter, a Maine yacht, a Wisconsin fire engine and a Mississippi forklift.
According to records from the Force Marine Corps Helicopter First Flight Team (HMX-1), which operates the helicopter, the White House Military Office asked the helicopter to appear on a daily order (FRAGO), just 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn for the "special" event.
The day before the event, the HMX-1 commander said in an e-mail to his superior Marine Corps flight deputy commander, "I just want to make sure you know, because this event is highly valued."
The information indicates that the helicopter will arrive on the South Lawn at about 7am on July 17 for the 3pm event and will not leave until the lawn is cleared from 6pm to 9pm on the same day.
The message also said that in the event of a delay in departure from the White House, the return flight would require a second crew because of the time limit on duty.
The original crew was on standby at the side of the helicopter during the event, while the security forces were on standby nearby when the plane was on the ground.
In the records obtained by Time magazine, it was not clear whether a second crew would eventually be needed.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using government property for political purposes.
The records state that HMX-1 had asked whether the activity was in violation of the Act.
"One of the questions we asked was whether it was a violation of the Hatch Act and was told there was no violation," the commander wrote.
"Sounds like you're locked up," replied the deputy commander.
The White House defines the "Made in America" campaign as an official event and is therefore not subject to the Hatch Act.
But even official events are political.
At the event, the president pushed the issue of the Senate at the time: health care reform, and touted regulation of government regulations.
The use of Marine Corps One or Air Force One aircraft for political propaganda purposes is nothing new.
Successive presidents have been asked to travel on these planes.
However, it is not common to expropriate them only for the purpose of taking photographs.
Trump came under scrutiny in February, when, in Melbourne, Fla., the presidential jet skidded slowly, eventually stopping at the backdrop of his first campaign rally, and his Twitter account was flooded with complaints about the former president's use of the presidential plane.
"The White House is thrilled by the" Made in America "exhibition, which shows products from all 50 states made by American workers using American materials," said Lindsay Walters, a White House deputy press spokesman.
HMX-1 crews regularly conduct flight training near the Washington area and on the South Lawn, practicing the precise placement of the U.S. president in the White House.
In early July, while Trump was in Germany for the G-20 summit, HMX-1 practiced 58 landings at the White House.
The U.S. manufacturing flight was included in the crew training requirements this month, an official said.
Helicopter units also flew an extra 11 hours on the day of the "non-presidential support mission."
The White House said taxpayers did not bear the cost of any other props at the event.
A Sikorsky spokesman said the company was not involved in arranging the South Lawn helicopter display.
HMX-1 does not keep a budget record of the president's flight, so it is very difficult to determine the exact cost of the event.
But the Department of Defense's reimbursable cost for VH-3D is US $24,380 per flight hour, according to the Department of Defense's hourly costs for fiscal year 2017.
Troops recorded a 30-minute flight from the base of the Marine Corps Airport in Quantico, Virginia.
The White House said the cost of operating the helicopter was much lower than the cost.
"It is very misleading to estimate the cost to the taxpayer based on reimbursable fees," Walters said.
These estimates include personnel costs, maintenance costs and many other sunk costs included in the annual appropriation.
A 2015 RAND study showed that the Department of Defense reimbursable costs did not include personnel costs, but did include oil, maintenance and contractual costs.
At the time, former White House press spokesman Sean Spike defended the use of the helicopter at the event,
"The idea is to show what is made in the United States this week," he said.
And I know Sikorsky and Connecticut are proud of it, both of them contributing to our national security, and I guess there are hundreds, if not thousands, of people whose jobs depend on it.
And I feel that, like most Americans, we are proud of this helicopter and other military equipment, the result of the hard work of countless Americans.
So this is certainly not an anachronism. "
We don't know if Trump interacted with the helicopter during a tour of the South Lawn at the event, but he did get into the driver's seat of the fire engine.
Inside the White House, Trump addressed Sikorsky's company representatives, joking with the media about the company's aircraft, which he owns.
"I know Sikorsky very well," he said. "I have three."

According to the Market Star, from 2005 to 2011, the GDP of our province rose from the middle to the bottom of the table in one fell swoop.
However, the economic growth of our province still suffers from low investment efficiency and the lack of core competitiveness of the industrial economy. To this end, the latest issue of the Economic Blue Page of the Provincial Economic Information Center recommends improving the quality and efficiency of economic growth.
On the basis of some representative indicators of the economy of our province in 2005 and 2011, it is compared with the whole country and the central region.
In terms of industrial economic benefits, in 2011, a considerable proportion of high energy-consuming industries, such as industrial energy and raw materials, were affected by market fluctuations and "double pressure" on overcapacity. At the same time, the lack of innovation in leading industries, such as home appliances and automobiles, led to meagre profits.
But the large amount of investment does not bring the corresponding economic benefit, it is the important reason that leads to the economic growth quality and the benefit of our province is not high.
In this regard, experts suggest that effective measures should be taken to encourage innovation, and the scientific and technological achievements of universities and research institutes should be transferred to enterprises in a timely manner.
For the industrial economic benefits are not high, experts say, we should also actively promote industrial merger and reorganization, optimize the industrial layout, and extend the industrial chain.

The UK General Trade Union (GMB) is concerned about investment in McVitie's Glasgow plant
The union wants biscuit maker McVeigh's management to pledge a long-term commitment to production at the Lasco plant.
The Scottish branch of the General Union said it had been silent about the future of investment in the Tollcross plant.
The factory, which employs more than 500 people, makes products such as oatmeal biscuits (Hobnobs), thick tea biscuits (Rich tea) and so on.
Pladis, owner of McVeigh, said it had invested more than £5 m in the plant over the past few years.
He added that if there was a change in factory operations, employees and union representatives "would be the first to know."
In a letter to the director of the company, the Scottish branch of the British General Union called on McVeigh to "address the issue of the non-transfer of funds to the modernization of the production line."
Drew Duffy, senior organiser of the UK General Union, said: "Our members are deeply concerned that we have not been able to get a clear picture of Tollcross's future business needs and investment plans from the general manager of the plant.
Generations of families are working here, and the high concentration of labour in the local community and in the Greater Glasgow area is an important pillar of high unemployment and social deprivation of decent employment in the region.
So from the point of view of employment, pay and economic prosperity, against the backdrop of Brexit, rising cost of living and a prolonged decline in manufacturing, there is an urgent need for McVeigh to expand his production network in the east of Glasgow. "
A spokesman for Pladis said: "The director of Tollcross has just received a letter from the Scottish branch of the UK General Union yesterday and the company will respond immediately as we value continuing contact with our employees and union representatives.
Two months ago, we had a regular meeting at Tollcross with staff and representatives of the British General Union to discuss a number of issues in public.
We had discussions with our employees and then, like all other companies operating in an environment of intense competition and economic uncertainty, we reviewed the ongoing operating model that we applied to businesses and factories in order to remain competitive.
She added: "We have invested more than £5 m in the Tollcross plant in recent years, particularly in production lines and operational improvements.
We are fully aware of Tollcross's historic position as a production base, and if there is any change in our operations at the plant, employees and union representatives will be the first to know. "
Nima Zhiren, deputy director of the Sports Bureau of the Tibet Autonomous Region, said at the base camp of the northern slope of Mount Everest on May 11 that in the future, the clean-up of domestic waste on the northern slope of Mount Everest will move from the past public welfare actions to the normal behavior led by the Chinese government and with the participation of all sectors of the international community.
On May 10, environmental volunteers loaded classified garbage into trucks.
In the past ten years, with the rapid increase of mountain explorers and tourists on Mount Everest, the environmental protection problem at the site of the mountain is becoming more and more prominent.
In the spring of 1997, the Tibet Autonomous Region Mountaineering Association launched its first clean-up campaign on the northern slope of Mount Everest to clean up a batch of household waste such as oxygen cylinders left over from the 1960s and 1970s. The video was also broadcast at the World Climate Congress in Tokyo that year and attracted worldwide attention.
After 1997, the public welfare team swept the northern slope of Mount Everest, but most of the participants were non-professionals, according to Nima.
Paris Saint-Germain warned Barcelona three years ago to sign Neymar?
Serie A may regret throwing an olive branch at Marko Vlatti
Paris Saint-Germain will not give up signing Neymar after making a £189 m offer in an attempt to get it to exercise the waiver clause, but have they warned Barcelona three years ago to launch an attack on the world record raider?
The sensational approach has opened the summer transfer window and the French club are poised to break the world transfer record for more than twice the previous transfer record, with Paul Pogba returning to Manchester United last season for a whopping £89 m.
Once the transfer is complete, Neymar will jump to become the highest-priced player in the world, as well as the highest-paid professional athlete in the world-with Paris Saint-Germain offering an after-tax salary of more than £500, 000 a week.
Barcelona were angered by Neymar's attack and the way out, with sources familiar with the Catalan team's board insisting the club had been doing everything in their power to take care of him since his arrival from Santos in 2013.
But has the president of Paris Saint-Germain made such a prediction about the football world three years ago?
When City expressed interest in signing Bryce Mattei in 2014, Nasser Alhlefey issued a stern warning to any club that wanted to sign Paris Saint-Germain's best player.
"I'm not worried because they know that if they come into contact with any of our players, we're going to be at odds with them and we're going to contact their players as well," Alhreffi said.
"We respect all clubs.
But if they're trying to sign our players, they're going to have to eat their own way, "he said.
The Spanish club appeared to have crossed the line earlier this summer, with Barcelona throwing an olive branch at Paris Saint-Germain midfielder Marko Vlatti.
Paris Saint-Germain have made it clear that they will not allow the Italian international to leave anyway, and Barcelona are likely to be affected by the loss of the talented Neymar in the line-up.

LONDON, January 9 (Xinhua) -- The British Sports Council announced its goal for next month's Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea, to win at least five medals, the "most ambitious" goal in the history of the British delegation's participation in the Winter Olympics.
The British Sports Council is responsible for the allocation of funds for various Olympic projects and, of course, for the licensing of individual projects.
According to calculations, British athletes are expected to hit medals from single-board skiing, curling, steel-frame snowmobiles and short-track speed skating.
In the past Winter Olympics cycle, the British Sports Council has allocated a total of 32 million pounds (RMB280 million) in training for the Winter Olympics, doubling the peso cycle.
Most of that money comes from the national lottery, and the rest comes from the state finances.
Britain's hopes of winning gold rested mainly on two men, Alice Christie, a three-gold medallist at last year's world short-track speed skating championships, and Liz Arnaud, the previous women's steel-frame snowboarder champion.
In the 2014 Sochi Winter Games, the British delegation achieved a record of 1 gold, 1 silver and 2 copper, the best they have achieved since the first Winter Olympics in 1924.
