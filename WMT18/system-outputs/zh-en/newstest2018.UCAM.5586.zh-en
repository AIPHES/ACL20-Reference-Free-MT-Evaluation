Last week, the temporary suspension of the vintage drama "Beauty's Private Cuisine" unexpectedly sparked a heated discussion about the domestic drama's ratings shake-up.
Civil rights groups issue travel warning against Missouri
Because of Missouri's discriminatory policies and racist attacks, the American Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) issued a travel warning to people of color preparing to travel to Missouri.
"The NAACP Missouri Travel Advisory, which took effect on August 28, 2017, calls for all African-American travelers, tourists and Missourians to pay special attention and exercise extreme caution when traveling in Missouri due to a recent series of suspicious racial incidents in Missouri, and hereby informs," the group's statement declares.
NAACP noted that a recently passed Missouri law made it harder for people to win discrimination lawsuits and that state law enforcement also targeted minorities in part, phenomena that prompted the group to issue travel warnings.
Civil rights violations are happening to people.
They were stopped for questioning because of their skin color, beaten or killed,"Missouri NAACP President Rod Chappelle told The Kansas City Star.
"We have received many complaints in an unprecedented number."
It was the first such warning issued by the group in the United States against a state.
The group cited racial slurs against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, a 28-year-old black Tennessee male.
Sanders, who died in suspicious circumstances earlier this year, ran out of fuel while traveling in Missouri and was detained by Missouri police without charge of a crime.
The advisory also noted that a recent report from the Missouri attorney general's office showed that "black drivers in the state are 75 percent more likely than whites to be stopped for a checkup."
"The consultation was to raise awareness and warn their families, friends and colleagues about what might happen in Missouri," Chappelle said.
"People need to be prepared, whether it's carrying bail to Missouri or letting relatives know they're traveling within the state," he said.
Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest data from the FBI's Hate Crime Reporting Program; the state ranked 16th nationally based on the number of crimes committed.
The travel warning is also a response to a new Missouri law that would make it harder to sue businesses for housing or employment discrimination.
Previously, U.S. states passed immigration enforcement laws requiring local law enforcement to detain immigration violators, a move the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) said would increase the number of racial lawsuits and issued travel advisories against Texas and Arizona.
Travel warnings are usually issued by the U.S. government against other countries, but more recently, advisory groups have taken this approach in response to certain laws and trends within the United States.
After a "golden age" in which the box office soared in 2015, the overall film market entered a period of calm in 2016, and whether it could break through last year's total box office score of 44.069 billion yuan all became a suspense.

BBC calls Beijing the most exciting city: Making foreigners feel "living in a new era"
Beijing may have a long history of three thousand years, but it is also fast becoming today's modern city of glamour, according to a January 18 report in Anglo Media.
The Chinese capital, with its astonishingly fast internet, cutting-edge technology such as face recognition software, huge investment in artificial intelligence and unrivalled international energy, is one of the most exciting cities for adventurous foreigners.
"If I can succeed there, I can succeed anywhere later," said German expat Clemens Sechy, according to the BBC website on January 16, quoting the lyrics of singer Frank Sinatra singing the praises of New York City.
"If Sinatra lived to this day, he would probably sing about a city like Beijing," said Cechi, who works as creative director at Voyager Archive magazine."Living in the city would make you feel like" living in a new era,"always keeping up with the trend.
Simon Norton, who is based in England but recently lived in Beijing, posted on the personal blog site 4 Corners 7 Seas: "People generally have a feeling of being at the centre of something grand, which is hard to tell, but it keeps a lot of foreigners there for a long time. They want to see what it becomes and want to see it first hand."
The city's high-quality, high-speed internet and tech-friendly environment make daily life easier than ever, the report said.
"Beijing is rapidly transforming into a cashless society where the internet integrates the functions of traditional wallets into smartphones, making it easier for everyone to make many transactions," said Andy Peñafuelt, who is from Manila and currently works as deputy editor-in-chief at the "Beijing Children" website.
But smartphones are just the beginning of Beijing's technological ambitions, facial recognition software has become so popular that many cellphone apps use the technology to make bank transfers and payments, get people into apartments and offices, and even use it to verify the identity of drivers of internet trolls, the report said.
Beijing also recently announced plans to spend 13.8 billion yuan to build an artificial intelligence technology park that will house more than 400 companies focused on developing a variety of artificial intelligence technologies, from biometrics to self-driving cars.
Food is also at the heart of many major festivals in China throughout the calendar year, and participation in these celebrations is highly regarded by foreigners. The Spring Festival is the most important social and economic festival and one of the easiest for foreigners to participate in.
"I suggest helping Chinese friends prepare for the New Year, cleaning apartments and posting red spring couplings with New Year's wishes on their homes are just as important," says Cechi."On New Year's Eve, all family members gather together for a big meal, then stay until midnight and greet the New Year with loud fireworks. For foreigners, spending the night with friends and family is really a chance to blend in."
The number of foreigners in Beijing is large and growing, but the language barrier in China and the ease of communication among expatriates can easily be an excuse for not fully integrating into local culture, the report said.
"Some foreigners have been living in China for years, but have little experience of their host country, and if your initial attempts to reach Chinese people aren't successful, it's easy to feel that you're still easier to get along with other foreigners," Mr. Sechi said.
"In these so-called" foreigners bubble "(" foreigners bubble "refers to foreigners mixing only among foreigners, without contact with locals and local cultures - translators), foreigners hug in their own communities, eat in Western restaurants, and only foreigners among their friends.
The easiest way to overcome this is to learn a little Mandarin - which is simpler than one might think.
"Taking one or two hours a week of private Chinese lessons or learning entry-level radio plays should suit everyone's hectic schedule," says Cechi.
Even learning a few classic short sentences can help with shopping, booking meals in restaurants or chatting in taxis.
Persistent air pollution is also a fact of everyday life, the report said, though government efforts in recent years have curbed some problems.
Residents stressed the importance of going outdoors during warmer months, when pollution is often lighter, using those blue skies as an opportunity to wander the historic alleys or explore the popular Japan Tribune Park.
"Beijing is the Chinese city where the most things can be found below the surface, and you can find great art and music events, crisp nightlife, historical wonders, ultra-modern business districts and ancient hutongs," Norton said.
According to the report, the impact of ageing on human capital growth is becoming increasingly evident, particularly in the north-east, where the average annual contribution of ageing to human capital growth is -1.28 per cent.
Pan pointed out that the risk of cross-border capital flows is controllable, and the fundamental factors underpinning the balance of international payments are still long-term.
Beijing, Dec 17 (reporter Gao Kai) The world is dazzled by heritage - The 2016 International Summit Forum for the Identification, Restoration and Protection of Ancient Chinese Books and Paintings opened at Renmin University of China on December 17.
In April, the European Commission accused Google of forcing handset makers to pre-install software such as Google Search and Chrome browsers that would otherwise not allow it to use other Google applications.
The European Commission sees the move as detrimental to consumers and an impediment to competition.
EU regulators initially asked Google to respond by July 27.
Google faces a fine of up to 10 per cent of its global revenue, or about $7.4 billion, if it is found guilty of antitrust charges.
Google was not immediately available for comment.
Google is also facing an EU investigation for favouring its own shopping service in search results.

A graphic read: Bitcoin's legal status around the world
Absrtact: In addition to the natural price correction triggered by speculative attributes, this round of digital currency fiasco also has to do with the "old enemy" - regulatory risk.
From the visual map, Eastern countries are more conservative about Bitcoin than the West, and the countries that dominate the globe are still watching for digital currency legitimacy, representing a "black swan risk" that remains large.
* This article is from Wall Street View (Willstreetcn), editor Wang Mu. For more information, go to wallstreetcn.com or download the Wall Street View APP. *
Bitcoin prices fell below the $10,000 psychological integer level on Tuesday and hit their biggest one-day drop in three years as regulatory storms mounted in major Bitcoin markets such as China, South Korea and the European Union, and the global digital currency, led by Bitcoin, has been brutally bloodied since this week.
In addition to the natural price correction triggered by speculative attributes, the sharp fall in the digital currency has also been linked to regulatory risk, which has long been an "old enemy."
At this important juncture, the visualization big data site HowMuch.net has produced a map showing Bitcoin's legitimacy and level of regulation in countries around the globe.
Green represents the legal market for Bitcoin, as shown in the figure below; orange represents the neutral market, and while it has not yet publicly legalized Bitcoin status, there are no major restrictions on its use; pale pink represents the restricted market, where local governments try to approach the use of digital currencies through red-line policies or regulations; dark pink represents the country where Bitcoin is defined as illegal; and grey is the country that has not yet commented.
(Pictured above from HowMuch. Net Visualization Team mapped on January 15)
The paper points out that, as can be seen from the distribution of green chunks in the figure Central Africa, the countries of the East in the traditional sense have a more conservative approach to bitcoin than the West.
Russia is the largest country that currently defines Bitcoin as illegal, China is one of Bitcoin's biggest restricted markets, and India is one of the largest countries that has yet to comment on Bitcoin and have no relevant policies in place.
North America and Western Europe are the regions with the highest acceptance of bitcoin, with more concentrated distribution of green blocks.
The perception of Bitcoin is sharply divided among countries in the Middle East and Latin America, where the distribution of color blocks is more mixed.
Of these, Iraq, Iran, Turkey, Brazil are all legitimate bitcoin markets, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Bolivia and others have some degree of restrictions on their trading and use, and more Latin American countries have yet to make a sound about bitcoin.
Combining the above data, a total of 99 (or 40 per cent) of the 246 countries counted globally do not impose restrictions on the trading and use of Bitcoin, known as green and orange areas.
Seven countries (or 3 per cent) are restricted markets (pale pink), 10 countries (or 4 per cent) define bitcoin as illegal (dark pink), and 130 countries (or 53 per cent) do not yet have more treatment for digital currency information (grey).
This suggests that countries that make up the bulk of the world (53 per cent, more than half) are still watching to see the legitimacy of the bitcoin led digital currency within their borders, and also represents the "black swan risk" of bitcoin remaining high, as some of them may end up with legislative decisions to restrict the digital currency.
The article argues that global regulators have not yet fully understood the emerging category of digital currencies and may be the main reason most countries have yet to take a stand.
While Bitcoin's "popularity" has grown exponentially since last year and does not represent interest to all countries, there may be some who are concerned that local French coins are being threatened as a result, or more concerned that the digital currency is being exploited by criminal organizations.
The Wall Street Journal has written a detailed summary of international regulatory news against Bitcoin since last week, including China's move to crack down on online platforms and mobile apps for centralized services on over-the-counter exchanges, South Korea's ongoing consideration of shutting down digital currency exchanges, the EU's belief that Bitcoin has not been widely accepted and warning investors of the risk of "losing blood."
The Wall Street Journal Editor-in-Chief's pick, Read Highlights | 2018: Global Central Bank Mama Opening the Year of Digital Currency?, has mentioned that 2018 will be the Year of Digital Currency for the world's central banks from any regulatory, acceptance / criticism, adoption point of view.
Big countries such as Russia have criticized bitcoin's status as legitimate, in fact, to make way for the official issuance of digital currencies.
Madrid, Jan 8 (Reuters) - Barcelona new midfielder Philippe Coutinho made his first appearance in a Barca shirt at the Nou Camp on Sunday.
Coutinho passed Barca's medical that morning and signed Barca president Bartomeu on a contract that will expire in the summer of 2023.
He then made his debut as a Barca player in front of nearly 7,000 fans at the Nou Camp.
According to Spanish media, Coutinho's total transfer fee, or 160 million euros (1 euro or Rmb7.77), is the first price in the history of Barca and La Liga.
With Coutinho still out with a hamstring injury, he will need to rest for almost 20 days before he can make his debut in a Barca shirt.

Now Trump's White House is taking aim at Statue of Liberty
The most sure sign of regime change was when they began attacking the statues.
Americans agree with this as much as anyone, so Saddam Hussein in Baghdad's Paradise Square was plotted down in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the Trump administration's key think tanks, must have known what would happen when he cut a symbolic axe to the Statue of Liberty during a heated argument with CNN's Jim Acosta over the president's proposal to severely restrict legal immigration.
To be fair, Miller did not attack the statue itself.
If he did, then a group of cruise ship owners and liberal followers would surely devour him alive and well.
But he did attack the significance of the statue, especially when Emma Lazarus's famous poem was inscribed on the pedestal in 1903 (the monument was built 17 years later).
As Miller chastised Acosta: "I don't want to talk about the full facts of history here, but the Statue of Liberty is like a symbol of American freedom illuminating the world...
The poem you're referring to, which was added later, is not part of the original Statue of Liberty."
In fact, Miller is right, but as he himself says, it's not really about history.
This involves a modern echo of Lazarus's earth-shaking words, the only country that seems to invite not only any old immigrant, but also the poorest of the poor: "Your exhaustion, your poverty, or your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, / The suffering reject your crowded beaches."
There is no "suffering people refuse" at a moment when our screens become more piercing.
Miller, who has not worked in literary commentary, made it clear that these people would not be welcome in America in the Trump era.
This conflict over the meaning of statues is part of a broader political and cultural war: It's actually in conflict with the American spirit.
Lazarus, and her friends who held events after her death to etch her verse on the pedestal, are well aware that the behavior they are engaging in is highly political.
The sculpture aims to express the connection between French and American republicanism through the ancient classical metaphor of the female incarnation of the Statue of Liberty.
Lazarus changed the meaning: In her poem, the female image is no longer abstract, she wants to sound.
She gave herself a very different name: The mother of exile.
The poem's combination with the painting is a successful feminist coup and a devastating blow to American nativism.
Just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, the alt-right has always wanted to change it back to its original meaning.
The great speaker, Rush Limbaugh, was a baptismith on Trump's arrival, arguing in 2010 that liberalism was not an invitation to anyone, and that he was now an early neoconservative, bringing the flame of American wisdom to a world of folly: "The Goddess of Liberty is brave and unforgiving."
She was meant to carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
The torch is not the way to illuminate America."
Unusually, Limbo was actually struck by something.
The significance of the statue depends entirely on the cognitive angle.
Lazarus's imaginative approach is to be able to see it. When tired, poor but hopeful people can see it on the deck of a ship after a long and often terrible journey.
On the face of it, it's about the perspective of the world for people who seek asylum and have the opportunity to improve their lives.
Her statues convey to them and need the hope and welcome they hear.
That, of course, is not a view that Miller and Trump have ever wanted to acknowledge.
They torch not to light the road, but to ignite the hatred of their only source of strength.

World Championship 2017: Neil Black highly praises Scotland squad in England squad
Eilidh Doyle recalls the time when there were only two Scots in the British national team.
British Athletics executive director Neil Black said the team of 16 strong Scots in the World Championships group would make a "huge contribution to the national team."
The number of Scottish field athletes selected for the 2017 London Athletics World Championships, which opened on Friday, is the highest on record.
Black believes "Scotland is making extraordinary developments" from which British Athletics must learn.
"We accept and try to understand that, and we will stick to it until we succeed," Blake said.
"I talk to people at the Scottish Academy of Sport. They think it has something to do with what they do.
Scottish Athletics believe it has something to do with what they do.
British Athletics believes it has something to do with what they do.
Even people on the street think so.
Whatever the case, it's extremely brilliant.""
A number of Scottish Athletics players are medal contenders, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart, who will compete in the 5,000m against Mo Farah, while Eilidh Doyle was selected by the panel as captain.
'Eilidh's a little bit humble.
Her captain's speech was unbelievable,"Blake said.
"Many track and field athletes, whether they are Scots or not, or wherever they live or train, walk out of the door with pride and energy.
Eilidh's natural passion and true feelings are very good."
The Commonwealth silver medallist, who will compete in the 400m hurdles in his fifth World Championships, said it was "incredible" that there were 16 Scots in the British national team.
Previously, the highest number of Scottish track and field athletes at the world championships was seven, the number of entries achieved in 1983 and 2015.
Muir, the runner-up, has set five British and two European records in the past year.
She will compete in the 1500m and 500m events.
Chris O'Hale, who competed in the 1500m event, was another Scottish player to look out for before making a strong start to the season with victories in the British national pair of qualifiers and the Olympic Anniversary Games respectively.
Doyle recalled her participation in the first world championships, when the only other Scot in the team was Lee McConnell, who was the only other Scot in the team.
The captain said she was deeply proud that so many of her compatriots would not only join the team but, in some cases, challenge for medals and compete to reach the final.
"What's special about being captain of the national team is that it's voted for by the rest of the national team, so it's a great honor to know that your teammates voted for you for something very unusual, anyway," she added.
"Of course, I'm very proud of all the Scotland players," he said.
It just shows how far we've come.
And they're both established track and field athletes here, track and field athletes who are about to make their way to the podium for Rongdon.
What about my captain's speech?
Well, I think it's terrific.
I have just referred to the fact that, in this case, we were very lucky because we had the World Championships at home.
So it's really important that we build on the home support and get stronger by coming back to the Olympic Stadium.
I'm going to get a second chance to compete and the atmosphere there will be fantastic.""

Shielding critics on Facebook: Don't run for office if you can't stand voter censure
The father of our country knows the bad press.
Americans love Washington, but soon after, major newspapers began slamming him for everything from domestic policy to political principles.
He was annoyed by the criticism, no doubt about it.
But he did not silence those critics.
Because back in 1783, Washington said,"Freedom of speech is denied - we will be slaughtered like lambs in silence and ignorance."
That brings me to Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, who needs to learn from Washington.
Hogan's staff shielded and deleted the posts of at least 450 people as they posted their views on his official Facebook page.
The American Civil Liberties Union filed a lawsuit against him over the matter earlier this week.
The governor's staff dismissed the lawsuit as sloppy, with online reports rife with backlash: "Who cares?"
A lot of people say "it's just Facebook."
But, it's important.
This is especially important because it's against someone like Hogan.
It was a Republican who served as governor in a state with a Democratic majority, and he was surprisingly popular.
Among the nation's 50 governors, he came in second place in terms of acclaim.
Hogan is not a reactionary edgy molecule.
He ran Maryland smoothly and strictly followed the rules.
He was also very adept at using Facebook as the main way to connect with voters, jokingly showing off his bald head after chemotherapy for the first time on his home page.
So it's totally unnecessary, and ultimately dangerous, to shield people from comments on the governor's home page, a public forum that is the official management platform for employees who are paid by the public.
In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan's spokeswoman, Amelia Shas, defended the governor's actions, saying she thought shielding their comments was simply an attempt to get them to exercise a little restraint.
But they too rashly describe it as a torrent or a cynic sweeping the web.
The Washington Post has spoken face-to-face with people shielded by Hogan.
They are just ordinary people talking to their elected leaders: They are teachers, small business owners and priests, and they are not monsters.
They poured out their comments with depth, respect, and no obscenity.
The pastor quoted the Bible in his post, calling on Hogan to remember his Catholic faith.
Lakshmi Salma Ramani, a barrister in Bowie, Maryland, was not cynical, but she asked questions about hate crimes.
'I politely commented that I was disappointed that he did not respond to hate crimes and other recent news events,' she wrote in the Washington Post's News Story Review section.
I also don't like a bunch of people commenting on the same topic, because these people will be ignored directly by some people, thinking that they are what is called a crowd mentality, rather than treating them as a bunch of citizens who are worried about their country."
What the governor's clerk called an "intensive junk information bombing" may appear to others to be "an insistence on propositions."
The Facebook age makes it easy to modify a message, just by shielding a critic or deleting a negative comment.
And it is far cleaner than in the past, when the same effect required sending staff out to collect and burn newspapers with critical statements or to arrest or silence protesters.
But that's really what's happening right now, just on a digital level.
Hogan is not the first public official to be blamed for silencing others on Facebook and other social media.
President Trump is just being sued by Twitter users for blocking them on Twitter.
There was a landmark ruling in Virginia last week on such issues.
The chairman of the Lauden County Board of Supervisors violated the First Amendment by shielding voters from her Facebook page, according to U.S. District Judge James C. Katzaris of Alexandria.
Kentucky Governor Matt Bevin (R) was also patronized by the American Civil Liberties Union for his use of Facebook and Twitter.
It shouldn't be so hard.
In the Washington era, affordable postage and the internet had a similar influence.
The number of newspapers quadrupled between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letters were written sharply criticizing his leadership.
And even then, Washington had the eponymous torrent of torrents directed at him.
Using pseudonyms such as Yurikla, Valerius, Belizarius, Bogus and others, people wrote to the newspaper to harshly criticize Washington's decision-making.
According to historical documents collected by the George Washington Newspaper Online Project, his office was inundated with petitions, all criticizing his attitude on the Treaty of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation between His Majesty the King of England and the United States of America, signed with Britain.
But he did not silence them.
Freedom of speech, freedom of dissent and freedom of speech are the very foundations of this country.
And real leaders need to accept that.
In the real estate market, the wind and the grass are all pulling people's sensitive nerves.
Limited purchase is a hard lever of many urban real estate regulation policies.
In May 2017, Jinan issued regulations, undergraduates pay social security for half a year in a row, can enjoy the same home purchase policy for local resident residents;
In June, Wuhan issued a policy requiring college students to leave their homes within three years of graduation on the basis of their graduation and employment certificates.
Then the policy added, the official said,"college students can buy a house for less than 20% of the market price";
In July, Chengdu issued regulations that young people with bachelor's degrees or above from overseas universities can apply for residence in Chengdu on the basis of their graduation certificates.
In addition, Kunshan, Shanghai and other cities or regions have also put in place "talent introduction" policies to reduce the threshold for home buyers.
Zhang believes that this is actually the competition of the big cities for the population, especially the talent, to retain the population, especially the talent, the city is competitive, which is the most important meaning of these real estate policies.
It has even been suggested that this means the time has come for the property market to "limit purchases" to be cancelled.

Ronan Lafferty looks to enjoy home feeling at Renaissance club
East Lothian Renaissance Club hosts the 25th Scottish Evergreen Open and former European champion Ronan Lafferty will enjoy the feeling of going home over the next three days.
The Northern Irishman, who led the next-door Archerfield Lynx to the final last year but eventually lost to Paul Ilse, now works for the new venue, representing the club's founder and chief executive, Jerry Salvati, as ambassador for the event.
Lafferty said: "I witnessed the Renaissance Club being formed and we will also witness its glory through this tournament.
Athletes will see the best face and best form of the pitch.
Jerry started the place unmatched.
He is an avid supporter of the competition and is very proud of what he has achieved here.
It's the best stage to show this pitch.""
Englishman Ilse is looking forward to defending the title for the first time, despite having won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour in a 32-year career.
The Shausport athlete said: 'It's really very special.
I didn't defend the Extremadura Open because in the second year of my win, the tournament was cancelled.
It feels amazing to come to this place,
It's fantastic to play golf here.
Last year's memories came to mind, and for me and my wife, Sharon, last year's win had a special meaning for us.
That's really a special memory that we'll always remember.""
Returning to race on home soil is Gary Orr, who just turned 50 earlier this year before also taking part in the European evergreen Tour.
This time it was his first Scottish event since the 2013 Scottish Golf Open.
Mr Orr, of Helensburgh, said: "There will always be more meaning to the home country game,
You want to do well; but you can feel that extra pressure.
To be able to play again I'm really enjoying it and I've been playing golf.
I'm very satisfied with the current situation.""
Joining the on-field trio were former Masters winner Ian Woosnan and evergreen pageant winners Paul Brodhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNeuty.
A total of six Scottish players on the field, Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are two of them, with the other four being Andrew O'Donnell, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmire and Ross Draymond.

In August, 57 cases of continuous daily punishment were carried out nationwide, and the new revised Environmental Protection Law implemented at the beginning of this year clearly added to China's environmental law enforcement efforts, said zou Zhummin, head of the Environmental Inspectorate of the Ministry of Environmental Protection of China, in Beijing.
At present, environmental protection authorities in all parts of China may investigate and punish environmental violations by means of punishment such as continuous punishment on a daily basis, seizure, restriction of production and suspension of production, and transfer to administrative detention, and cooperate with judicial organs in punishing environmental crimes.
In August, 335 cases of seizure and seizure were carried out in various parts of China, 177 cases of restriction of production and suspension of production were carried out, 189 cases of administrative detention were transferred and 166 cases of suspected environmental pollution crimes were transferred, Mr. zou said.
Henan has imposed seven consecutive daily penalties, and at present, China is moving from terminal control to full embedding to improve environmental pollution control in an all-round way.
Despite the downward pressure on the economy, the Ministry of Environmental Protection has previously made it clear that China should correctly handle the positioning of environmental protection in economic development and enhance the "green force," and that the more the economy grows at a slower pace, the less it can relax environmental protection and play a good role in optimizing the economy.

Poverty and Death in Indonesia's Golden Continent
Badtina Dejay doesn't use a stove when she's cooking.
She rarely even uses a pot.
Her wooden house is in Enerotali, the capital of Paniai County in Indonesia's Papua province, and the housewife usually simply puts a sweet potato - which locals call "nota" - straight into the fire.
Half an hour later, the charred sweet potato was eagerly picked up by a pair of unwashed hands and gobbled up.
Dedger sat on the mud - she had no furniture, and it was the place where she did her daily household chores, such as washing clothes, and the water was so muddy that it came from the nearby marshes.
There's a bucket in a room without a roof, and this is the outdoor toilet.
She was the youngest of her husband's four wives, so she was not assigned to the fields to look after.
Polygamy is common here.
Of course it's dangerous to work to a party: Most of the men in the village don't work, and a lot of them are drunk, plus there are a lot of soldiers here.
"No one dares walk around the village after 5pm," she said.
It was a rare glimpse of everyday life in the Papua Highlands, once a Dutch colony that was incorporated into Indonesia after the 1969 referendum, but that referendum was also controversial, when only 1,026 elders were forced to vote by show of hands in front of the army occupying the site.
The current campaign for independence and opposition to Dutch rule soon turned its back on the Jakarta government, which has imposed heavy-handed rule on the region, isolating foreign journalists and rights activists.
In 2003, the province officially split into the provinces of Papua and West Papua, while Papua New Guinea independently controlled the eastern part of the island.
Enerotali is remote and deserted; to get here it takes a 90-minute plane ride from the provincial capital, Chayapra, to Nabireh, then a five-hour drive by hire car, all the way down the river in the stomach.
There is no public transport here.
In this town of about 19,000 people, the wooden huts are surrounded by bamboo fences, and the ruffled iron roofs are a variety of yellow-brown coverings made of rust.
Few Indonesians came, not to mention journalists, and few foreigners.
Before the arrival of the Christian preacher, Mee Pago Papuans believed in a god called Uga Tamee.
There are other changes here, too.
"We can't get used to these clothes," she said, referring to her brightly colored hand-woven headscarf, dark shirt and bright half-skirt.
"We used to cover our bodies with only leaves."
Papua is Indonesia's poorest province, where 28 percent of people live below the poverty line and the region with the highest infant mortality and lowest literacy rates in Asia.
But here, too, is Indonesia's Golden Continent.
Located in the Highlands, about the same size as New Jersey and home to 153,000 people, Glasberg, the world's largest and most profitable gold mine, is just 60 miles away, owned by Phoenix based Felipe McMoran Copper.
In 2015 alone, Felipe mined about $3.1 billion worth of gold and copper mines here.
In addition, Papua is rich in timber resources with an estimated value of $78 billion.
But these rich resources are also a source of tragedy for the Papuans, and Indonesia's powerful military forces have been able to keep them down.
A 2005 New York Times investigation reported that Felipe paid nearly $20 million to local military personnel and troops between 1998 and 2004, up to $150,000 for an official alone.
The Papuans' growing appeal for independence threatened the golden lord, and they were subjected to cruel treatment.
More than half a million Papuans have been killed and thousands raped, tortured and held by Indonesian troops since 1969, according to rights activists.
The mass killings in the tribal highlands of Papua in the 1970s have escalated into genocide, according to the Asian Human Rights Commission.
Last year alone, Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful protesters.
A 2016 report by the Catholic Brisbane General Diocese,"We Will Lost Everything," encapsulated evidence of the year before, such as extrajudicial killings, torture - another report said rape and electric Xing were particularly common - and a brutal crackdown on peaceful demonstrations.
"Violence is happening every day, so it's difficult to count the number of victims," said Andrias Halsono, an Indonesian researcher at Human Rights Watch.
The oppression began when Papua's resources brought in large numbers of migrants from outside Indonesia.
Eighty-three per cent of the province's 3.5 million people are Christian, but the demographic structure has changed since the arrival of Muslim economic migrants from the densely populated islands of Java, Kalimantan, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
The Javanese snack stand sells fried chicken and vegetables mixed with Gadogado, served with peanut butter.
The locals struggled to fight.
Apos Yew, a 24-year-old Paniai native who moved to the provincial capital, Chayapra, to find work, explained that "those immigrants started selling chicken and vegetables at a lower price in traditional markets than local Papuans.
This has left the local Papuans - the Mama-mama women - without their market."
Indonesian President Zoko Widodo, often referred to as Zokowi, vowed at his 2014 election campaign to tackle inequality and abuse of power in Papua.
The one-time carpenter's path to the presidential palace in Jakarta was supported by 27 of all 29 districts - including Paniai.
But nothing has changed in Papua, and today, locals feel betrayed.
Yew said "we are heartbroken that in 2014 we voted for Zocovi in the hope that he would fulfill our desire to restore fairness."
In fact, just two months after Zocovi took office in October, Paniai suffered one of his worst nightmares.
On December 7, 2014, 11 children in Enerotali were singing Christmas carols in front of a bonfire outside when two Indonesian soldiers suddenly rushed over on a motorbike.
Frightened children told them they should turn on the headlights.
One of the soldiers was unhappy with their tone and then returned with four soldiers, according to local pastor Yavette Tebey.
Victims and witnesses said the drunk soldiers chased the group of children with their guns.
Then one of the soldiers fired at the group of children.
Juliannus Yemo, 16, was left in a coma after being hit hard.
Hours later, a blaze broke out at the electoral commission building, a nearby government agency, and the incident escalated the following day.
About 1,000 young Papuan men, women and children gathered at a football stadium in front of the local police station and military command centre to demand justice.
Armed with ceremonial hunting bows, they danced the waita of the Papuan Mee Pago tribe - running around in circles and mimicking birdsong.
Some of the protesters began throwing stones at regular military posts.
According to an official document seen by Time magazine, as emotions continued to heat up, soldiers received orders via internal radio: "If the crowd resists more than three times, shoot immediately." But the document was not released to local media.
Sensing the imminent danger, Jeremias Kayamu, 56, the chief of the Kego Koto neighborhood in Enerotali, called on the crowd to calm down and implored them to go home.
But no one was in the mood to listen to him.
Standing on the porch of his brightly colored wooden house, he told Time magazine,"When I look back, I suddenly shot myself in the left wrist."
Kayamu still doesn't know who fired the gun, but he said the bullets came from among the assembled soldiers.
He added,"It was very crowded at the time, they fired a lot of shots."
He witnessed the shooting and saw Olfyus Juul shot three times in the body, according to the cousin of local Olfyus Juul.
Juhanes sadly told Time magazine, 'I ran over to check his body to see if it was him,
I found out he was dead... I kissed him.""
Papua Police Chief Inspector Yuj Mend told reporters his subordinates were simply "protecting" the police station because it had been attacked.
"We have to defend ourselves when someone threatens to kill us," police chief Phugio Sulistio, a spokesman for Papua police in 2015, said.
This is a matter of life and death."
Five young protesters were killed and many more were injured, according to Human Rights Watch.
News of the killing spread only slowly in Jakarta the next day.
Three weeks later, Zocovi gave a vociferous speech in Chayapra, expressing deep sympathy for the victims' families and vowing to address abuses left over from Papua's history.
"I hope this case will be resolved as soon as possible so that nothing like this can happen again in the future," he said.
In October 2016, Security Minister Brando said he wanted to set up a non-judicial mechanism to address the historical legacy of human rights violations.
But the excuse for pushing off also sounded almost immediately.
"Most of the violations occurred a long time ago," he said.
Some were in the 90s and early 2000s.
The focus is that we are committed to addressing these violations, but that requires a process."
Then on June 5 in Jakarta, Villando went out of his way to speak with Time magazine, saying he had no plans to set up a grievance mechanism in Papua.
Instead, he said,"everything will be resolved by law."
The United Nations has filed a complaint against Villando for "anti-human rights crimes" over the deaths of more than 1,000 people in East Timor's bloody independence vote in 1999, but he said 11 human rights violations in the Papua region had been resolved, including the Paniai incident.
The families of the victims of the Paniai incident scoffed at the claims.
"I've been interviewed four times in the last three years, but things have gone completely nowhere," Juhanes said.
Years later he said "I'm tired."
He still lives in fear now.
He said "I'm scared.
I'm afraid of being arrested by the army, I'm afraid of being shot.""
His brother, Yucabos, also thought the people of Paniai were scared to talk about the incident.
He said he was beaten by the military after helping bury four victims.
He said "after burying the body, the military came to me."
The shooting did not stop.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police shot villagers in Deayi County, a neighboring county of Paniai.
A construction company manager refused to help transport a comatose man to hospital after clashes between the two sides left one dead and 17 others injured, including children.
Man Lavianus Dorwood, 24, drowned while fishing by a nearby river and died on his way to hospital.
Angry villagers protested in front of the company's on-site office.
Police said villagers threw stones at officers, so officers fired warning shots.
But riot mobile units (Indonesian paramilitary police) started shooting into the crowd and one person was killed.
"We were panicking at the time and now we were scared they were going to retaliate," Dominic Valley Buddy, 29, told Time magazine, who was staying near the hospital when he witnessed the wounded being rushed to hospital.
'I've been hiding at home for two days.'
The Diayi parliament has called for the police involved to be brought to justice and riot mobile units to be evacuated from the area.
Paniai has always been a land of right and wrong for the Indonesian government.
The absence of effective development feeds the discontent of the people of the Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal tribes scattered across the lush central highlands of Paniai.
Many have joined the Free Papua Movement (OPM), a rebel army that claims to protect the rights of Papuans by dispersing attacks and raids to kidnap Indonesian soldiers.
Part of the senior leadership of the Free Papua movement was born in Paniai, including Tadiyus Yuji and Daniel Yudas Kogoa.
As a result, in recent years, thousands of Paniai have been arrested and deliberately detained by the military under the guise of "safeguarding national sovereignty."
Some never showed up again.
In the eyes of Papuans, Paniai is a "forgotten place of tragedy."
Poverty breeds discontent.
Enerotali is selling so little rice that locals simply can't afford it.
Bread is simply out of reach.
People here grow everything they can eat: Mainly sweet potatoes and some fruit and leafy vegetables.
Farming is a woman's job, and every woman can care for four or five sweet potato plots.
They usually leave most of the harvest for writers and sell the rest on the local market.
Ten sweet potatoes are worth just 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Over time, economic inequality has opened up among local Papuans and new immigrants, whose numbers have increased significantly since the opening of the new route to Nabiere airport.
The small number of jobs available usually fall to better-educated and wealthier immigrants.
Papuans rarely have the funds or the necessary skills to run a competitive company.
"Young people don't want to stay in this village... because there are no jobs and no money," said John Gobey, president of the Paniai tribal council.
Papua is isolated.
In addition, restrictions on international media coverage remain tight.
Earlier this year, French journalists Frank Escudi and Basel Longchamp were expelled from Papua because they "did not cooperate with the relevant agencies," even if they had already received a rare filming authorization.
Zocovi's election vow to withdraw reporting restrictions to promote transparency and development has not materialized, according to Human Rights Watch's deputy Asia director, Felim Kane.
"If foreign journalists try to cover Papua and West Papua, Indonesia's most eastern disaffected provinces, they are at new risk: Denying visas and pulling into the blacklist," he said in a statement.
The absence of media scrutiny means international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely confined to Papua's neighbours.
In March, six Pacific countries - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands, Solomon Islands - asked the UN Human Rights Council to investigate "all kinds of widespread human rights violations" in Papua, including the Paniai shooting.
These countries have also supported the Free Papua Movement.
Indonesia's foreign ministry spokesman, Almanata Nassir, shrugged off the group's allegations, telling reporters in Jakarta that "democracy is still in place in Indonesia and there is freedom of the media, so evidence of human rights violations is hard to hide."
Locals want more foreign governments to take seriously.
The local people broke their silence on May 4 when Dutch human rights ambassador Kath Wan Barr led a delegation of officials to Chayapra, pleading,"We want freedom," according to a person familiar with the meeting, who also attended but requested anonymity.
Indonesia will hold its next presidential election in 2019, but Papuans say they are unlikely to vote for Zokowi again.
Tribal Council President Gobai called "Zocovi's intentions good, but he was surrounded by people who were involved in the Paniai shooting."
He wants Zocovi to know that the people of Paniai not only live under the threat of a greedy army, but have nothing, that the region is poorly educated and that public health care is scarce.
Gobai said the people of Paniai, like other Papuans, thought their vote for Zocovi was a debt he had to pay off.
He said "they don't need money, they need justice."
Even under threat and intimidation, the families of the victims of the Paniai shooting staged their last symbolic revolt: Burying the body of one of the victims opposite the military police post.
They know justice may never come, but at least they won't let those responsible forget their crimes.
Yucabos bowed his head and said,"My family was killed,
What else can we do?""
On February 10, 2017, the CSRC approved the initial application of Guangdong Shang Goods Homestead Home Co. Ltd and issued the Shenzhen Stock Exchange small and medium sized board listing pass, more than 20 days after the initial adoption of the European Home IPO.
Industry insiders believe that, with the Shang homestead, the European homestead followed by the listing, originally in the wind on the custom home field will change from product competition to capital competition.
At the beginning of the new year, a typical representative brand in the field of custom homestead is coming to market, attracting the attention of the whole household industry.
Beijing (Reuters) - Samsung Electronics on Tuesday released the first self-driving car components it has developed with Harman International, as well as information entertainment solutions, an important step in the company's push into the automotive electronics market, the company said.
Samsung Electronics acquired Harman International about a year ago.
At the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas this week, Samsung released car cameras with collision warnings, lane deflection alerts, cruise control features that were developed in partnership with Harman.
Samsung plans to start shipping the camera system this year, which is built on technology such as machine learning and augmented reality.
Samsung also shows the "digital cockpit," which allows users to download drivers from mobile devices and the cloud, to make the vehicle more personal even if the driver is not the owner.

Fire engulfs Dubai 'torch' skyscraper again
A fire at a world's tallest residential building in Dubai on Friday forced hundreds of residents to flee the 337-metre, 79-storey ultra-high-rise building.
It was the second blaze to sweep through high-rise buildings in just two years, and happened to be in a skyscraper known as the "Torch."
The building has been evacuated and no injuries have been reported and no cause of the blaze has yet been identified.
'We were sleeping and then we were woken up by the fire alarm and people started screaming.
We ran down the stairs and it took about 10 minutes to run down the 50th floor,"a resident named George told Reuters.
Dubai's civil defence authorities said the fire brigade extinguished the blaze at about 04:00 local time (0000 GMT) and were conducting cooling treatment for the building.
The Government indicated that efforts were being made to provide places of refuge for those affected.
The accident could reignite concerns around the world about the safety of high-rise buildings using exterior wall materials.
An investigation by the management of the "Torch" skyscraper following its 2015 fire found that most of the objects damaged were cladding exterior wall panels for decoration and insulation.
British police have said they believe problems with insulation and cladding systems at the Grenfell Tower in London may have contributed to the rapid spread of the fire in June, which killed about 80 people.
The Williams team also hinted at the possibility that Massa could return, although he has announced his retirement.
On January 9, just one month after the opening of the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea, the atmosphere in the country grew stronger as the Olympic flame passed from south to north, preheating and preparing for the Games.
South Korean public opinion expects the long-overdue inter-Korean talks to bring a "colored egg" to the countdown to the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics in a month.
The Pyeongchang Winter Olympics flame arrived in South Korea on November 1 last year.
The boom in the flame is directly reflected in ticket sales for the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics.
Just over two months ago, ticket sales for the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics hovered at 32%, and for the Winter Paralympic Games at 4.3%.
But as Lee Hee-fan, chairman of the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics organizing committee, predicted to reporters not long ago,"as the Winter Olympic flame is passed around South Korea, the heat of the Winter Games is growing and it is believed that ticket sales will soon improve."
As of January 3, ticket sales for the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics had reached 64 percent, and ticket sales for the Winter Paralympic Games had also exceeded 50 percent, according to South Korean media.
To encourage foreigners to visit South Korea, the Ministry of Justice announced on August 8 that it would extend the stay in the country for up to 120 days for foreigners visiting the country to watch the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics.
More than a fifth of U.S. travelers board with contraband, survey finds
A survey of plane passengers found that more than 20 per cent of passengers had knowingly or unintentionally packed illegal items to board through a U.S. Transportation Security Administration checkpoint, and that at least 6 per cent of those passengers had unintentionally boarded with prohibited knives or other edged items.
Less than 1 per cent of passengers claimed they only found out after the fact that they were travelling with guns, ammunition or explosives by mistake.
The survey of more than 1,000 people, conducted by charter services firm Stratos Jet Charters Inc, also found that young travelers were more likely to blatantly ignore regulations.
Of those who admitted to trying to deliberately carry TSA contraband on board, 19.7 per cent were millennials, compared with less than 15 per cent of Generation X.
The most common items that deliberately slip past TSA security agents are food and drink.
More than 3 per cent admitted to deliberately carrying a blade for a security check, while 2.2 per cent of female respondents and 3.7 per cent of male respondents also said they had deliberately brought prohibited drugs on board.
The company said the survey of travelers across the country was to find out the number of people who accidentally carried and intentionally carried prohibited goods across the plane to check and board.
Not surprisingly, the people most likely to carry contraband through security - intentionally or unintentionally - are those who fly the most frequently.
However, the company points out that the TSA guide is a bit complicated and difficult to understand.
People are usually unsure what kind and how much liquid they can carry.
So it's no surprise that the TSA seized the largest amount of banned liquid.
It was once thought that the TSA might have treated books as contraband, too.
Domestic flights are allowed to carry liquids, but international flights are not allowed to carry them.
EPA chief Pruitt changes his mind on Obama-era emissions reduction regulations
A day after being sued by 15 states, Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt reversed his earlier decision to delay implementation of Obama-era regulations to reduce emissions of smog air pollutants.
Pruitt proposed the change because the Environmental Protection Agency was able to respond more quickly to the needs of state agencies that regulate the environment than previous administrations.
He did not mention a legal challenge filed by a federal appeals court against his predecessor's post.
The dispute centers on setting an October 1 deadline for states to begin meeting the 2015 ground-level ozone standards.
In June, Pruitt announced he would delay compliance for a year in order to give the Environmental Protection Agency more time to study the program and avoid "interfering with local decision-making or impeding economic growth."
Before being appointed by President Donald Trump, Pruitt was Oklahoma's attorney general and had long opposed the tightening of environmental regulations.
Since arriving in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly turned to blocking or delaying regulations opposed by the chemical and fossil fuel industries.
Wednesday's sudden reversal is the latest legal hurdle on Pruitt's regulatory rollback agenda.
Last month, a federal appeals court in Washington ruled that the head of the Environmental Protection Agency overstepped his authority to try to delay enforcement of an Obama administration rule requiring oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leaks.
In a statement released Wednesday night, Pruitt offered a U-turn on his approach to ozone standards, saying he wanted to strengthen the Environmental Protection Agency's commitment to work with states to adopt complex procedures to reach new standards.
Pruitt said that "under previous administrations, the EPA typically did not meet the designated deadline, and then waited for activist groups and others to sue before agreeing to set a designated timeline through an agreement." He has launched more than a dozen prosecutions against the Environmental Protection Agency in previous work.
"We don't believe in regulation through litigation, and we take deadlines seriously," he said.
We also take regulations and authorities seriously."
Nonetheless, the EPA statement said Pruitt may again use his "extension authority and all other legally available authorizations" to ensure that the provisions comply with "good policy and the best information available."
Republicans in Congress are pushing for a broad rewrite of ozone layer regulations.
The House bill, approved last month, aims to delay implementation of the 2015 rule by at least eight years.
The measure has not yet been voted on in the Senate.
New York State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman led a coalition of states to sue the EPA this week, saying it intends to maintain legal pressure.
"The EPA reversal - following our lawsuit - is a significant victory for the health and safety of 6.7 million New Yorkers, with communities of more than 115 million Americans directly affected by smoke emissions," Schneiderman said.
California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington, and the District of Columbia all joined New York State in the case.
Ground-level ozone is formed when common pollutants emitted by cars, power plants, refineries, chemical plants and other sources react to sunlight in the atmosphere.
The resulting smoke can cause severe breathing problems for sensitive people, causing thousands of premature deaths each year.
Of course, public health advocates and environmentalists cheered Pruitt's surprising turn.
Lori Ann Bird, of the Center for Biological Diversity, said: "It is disturbing that this common-sense measure is under intense pressure from the head of the department that protects the air we need to breathe."
"We have to fight to the end with the Trump administration's ideological campaign to cater to polluters and special interest groups." "

Since the second half of 2009, the sales volume of flowers and trees in Xiaoshan has remained relatively high, especially this spring, when the sales volume of seedling trees in Xiaoshan reached a new all-time high and sales volume and prices rose sharply. According to statistics, the sales revenue of seedling trees in Xiaoshan District increased 48 percent from the same period last year in January to June this year, the largest increase in nearly 20 years.
Shi Haiyong, deputy director of Xiaoshan Forestry Bureau, said that along with the good sales situation, Xiaoshan flower and wood production has also achieved a relatively rapid development.
In the past two years, the area under cultivation of Xiaoshan trees has expanded by 30,000 mu to a total area of 180,000 mu, and at the same time, efforts have been made to develop outside the region, with Xiaoshan Miao farmers establishing flower and wood bases in various parts of the country reaching 80,000 mu, an increase of 30,000 mu over 2008.
Along with the expansion of planting area, the quality of seedlings has been continuously improved, the value of nurseries storage has been continuously improved, large specifications and high quality seedlings have been retained more, and some seedlings have been sold off.
Shi Haiyong also reminded that, in the face of the current boom in production and marketing, producers should be calm and objective in their analysis, not only to see that the demand for flowers and trees in society will be long-term and increasing, but also to realize that market competition will be more intense.
On the morning of July 13, Beijing time, the U.S. company Somaltus filed a lawsuit in East Texas District Court accusing Apple of violating a battery technology patent it filed in 2010.
The company has previously sued Asus, Lenovo, Samsung, Sony and Toshiba over the same patents.
The suit alleges that both the iPhone 6s and similar Apple devices violated US patent 7,657,386, known as the Integrated Battery Services System.
The plaintiffs want cash compensation or a patent fee for infringing equipment after the verdict is announced.
Judging by the indictment, the plaintiffs appear to believe that the iPhone's fast-charging features infringe on the company's patents.
An iPhone with a fast-charging feature will quickly charge up to 80 per cent of the power, before trickle-down charging.
Somaltus is actually a so-called "patent hooligan" because the company does not offer obvious products and services, and it is difficult to find relevant information online.
However, they have successfully reached an out-of-court settlement with automakers such as Ford and Nissan over the patent.
The meeting held that accelerating the development of informationization, promoting the integration and efficient utilization of resources, and upgrading the level of digitization and intelligentization of industry are of great significance in promoting "Made in China 2025" and mass entrepreneurship and innovation, fostering new kinetic energy and improving the quality of life of the masses.

It was previously revealed that the railway department had expanded the 12306 website, introduced new services during the Spring Festival ticket purchase period, and nearly 60 per cent of the tickets no longer required the use of a certificate code.
Trump once pressured Mexico to pay for border wall, according to leaked phone records
The Washington Post leaked a transcript of a phone call between US President Donald Trump and the leaders of Mexico and Australia.
On January 27, during a call to Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto, Trump urged him to stop publicly saying he would not pay for the proposed border wall.
The US president reportedly expressed his displeasure at his public bashing of the wall, to which Putland allegedly once told him: "You don't tell the media."
Trump pledged during his presidential campaign to build a wall on the southern border of the United States and solemnly announced he would make Mexico pay for the project.
A transcript of his phone call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, which showed a tense exchange between them, was also released.
Mr Trump told Mr Turnbull that it was "ridiculous," "annoying" and "stupid" for the US to assume the deal for refugees to be sent to Australia, and that he had suggested the US ban on refugee resettlement and now insisted the deal brokered by the Obama administration would make him look like a "fool."
Trump hung up after telling Turnbull "this is the most unpleasant call of the day."
In an award-winning message read by the US ambassador to Sweden, Dylan said he was on his way to the tour when he received the award and "it took me a while to react."

Seoul, Xinhua News Agency (Reuters) - South Korea and North Korea concluded high-level talks at Panmunjom on the evening of January 9, with the two sides issuing a joint statement agreeing on the DPRK's participation in the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics and talks between the two sides on military affairs.
According to a joint statement issued by the two sides, the DPRK will send a high-level delegation and a delegation of the National Olympic Committee to the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics.
In addition, the DPRK will send athletes, cheerleaders, art troupes, press corps and other groups to visit the ROK; the ROK will provide necessary facilities for this purpose.
The Koreas also agreed to ease current military tensions and decided to hold talks between the two Koreas' military departments.
The report analyzed the results of a questionnaire involving 1,045 foreign tourists who visited Seoul last December.
The report noted that foreign tourists shopped 1.06 million won per capita.
Among them, Chinese tourists had the largest amount of shopping per capita, at 2.13 million won, 6.5 times that of Japanese tourists and 3.2 times that of tourists from the United States and Europe.
Asked about the purpose of visiting Seoul, 62.2 percent of Chinese tourists answered "shopping" and 94.9 percent of Chinese tourists bought cosmetics.
96.3 percent of Chinese tourists shop in the city's duty-free shops, spending 1.56 million won per capita.

Moore Beach fiasco: Activists recreate racist lynching, get justice
A 1948 Ford Mercury car ploughs through a crowd of onlookers in the small town of Monroe, Georgia, toward the tiny Moore Beach Bridge.
The vehicle, which was carrying four black passengers and a white driver, blocked the vehicle's path forward as a group of white men with guns walked in front of it before it arrived at the bridge.
The head of the gang - a middle-aged man in a pinstripe suit - took a deep sip of a cigar and glimpsed his eyes into the windscreen.
The passengers inside the car were filled with fear.
"We want - Roger!" The man shouted.
'Drag him out of the car!'
A young black man was dragged from the front passenger seat and screams pierced the silence.
Fortunately, the horrific scene on July 22 was just a repeat.
But when "Roger" had a noose around his neck, almost all the spectators around him gave a real gasp.
Since 2005, civil rights activists have returned to the Moore Beach Bridge to recreate scenes from the night two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and Mere Dorsey - were lynched by the Ku Klux Klan in 1946.
No one has ever been charged with murder.
"While we know who they are, even though we've seen them in the community, it's unbelievable that none of them have been arrested in all these years," said Tyrone Brooks, who helped organize the repeat.
'It's a stain on history and a burden on our souls.'
Brooks, 71, is a former Georgia congressman and lifelong rights activist.
For him, a repeat is a remarkable rallying cry, reminding people in the Monroe community every year that injustice has never been corrected.
"We want to sue, we want to close the case, we want to heal, we want reconciliation, but we have to get justice first," he said.
"Unless we get justice, we don't get healing and reconciliation."
A coroner covers a sheet over the body of a Moore Beach lynching victim on July 27, 1946.
More than 50 men from Monroe and surrounding counties are suspected of involvement in the lynching, according to FBI files obtained by NBC News.
But none of them have ever been prosecuted.
While the suspect has been at large for decades, civil rights activists say the dual motive for carrying out the lynching is well known across town: Political and sexual.
In April 1946, a Supreme Court ruling allowed black citizens of Georgia to vote in the primary for the first time later that summer.
Around the same time, according to FBI statistics, black tenant farmer Roger Malcolm assassinated white landlord Barnett Hurst in a struggle - seemingly for a woman.
Brooks said the town rumors were that Hurst had slept with Malcolm's wife, Dorothy, and that her baby was not her husband's.
On July 25, 1946, prominent white landlord Loy Harrison spent $600 to bail Malcolm out of jail, the FBI said.
Dorothy accompanied him to prison with cousins Mack Merry and George Dorsey.
But as they returned from prison and fast-tracked to the Moore Beach Bridge, a mob of vigilantes rounded up the car.
"It turns out that it was Harrison who organized and ordered the murder," an FBI report concluded.
"It is clear that there is a conspiracy between state and local law enforcement who are not only involved in the murder, destroying the evidence, but also concealing the identity of the witness," it said.
Brooks is very concise.
"This is a voting rights fiasco," he said.
"They were tragically killed and it was the killer who sent a message to black people in this community:" If you sign up and vote, you will suffer the same end.""
For nearly a decade, Cassandra Green has been responsible for dominating the annual repeat of the Moore Beach Bridge lynching fiasco.
Her expressive style is vivid and gripping, with a deeply racist background that many hope no longer exists in the United States.
It's hard to watch, it's harder not to watch, but Green says that's the key.
"We don't want to talk about lynchings, because lynchings make us confront the ugly face of all people," she said.
'But I can't have a relationship with you if you don't listen to me or hear me tell my own story.'
This year's show began in June, with nearly 30 actors - a dozen white and the rest black - huddled in a room on the first day to hear Green release an overview of the rehearsed performance.
Wade Malbaugh as Green's co-director.
For years, he played the role of the Ku Klux Klan, but he said the role was never easy.
"I feel dirty because I'm not such a person," Malbaugh said.
"But I think it's very important to keep this piece of history alive because we don't want to go back to that era." "
In the room, actors Darios Bradshaw and Nick Lascone, who play Roger Malcolm and Barnett Hurst, rehearse their lines.
The play began with Malcolm yelling and pushing Hurst, angry that he had slept with his wife, Dorothy.
"I said," Get out of my place!"
Lascona hit back.
And then they hit it off.
Then everyone (at least the All Blacks cast) burst into laughter.
Green laughs the most.
"What's going on?!" Asked Lascona.
He was panicked, confused.
Am I acting too much?
"No," Green said with a laugh.
"I just don't think white people would say" ah "when they hit back."
"Yes," another black actor quipped.
"Your tone has to be tough." "
In this way, the energy in the room changed; the feeling of fraternity drove away the discomfort.
Everyone tried to do that, not just to perform the play, but also to honor the four victims.
The scene starts again.
This time, when Lascona said the word "ah," the tone was sharp and powerful.
No one laughs.
The repetition came to a strong and swift end.
The screams, the shots, and then there was a silence.
A woman in a funeral black dress stood by the actor's body and sang Billy Halladay's mournful words "strange fruit."
Her voice pressed over other words.
A hundred yards away, about forty spectators kept wiping away sweat and tears.
Black and white made up almost half of the audience.
A couple came to see the show from Ithaca, New York, and a lot of people lived just off the road.
Brooks took them to Malcolm and Dorothy's graveyard for a pilgrimage, nearly eight hours away, and everyone was enduring Georgia's uncomfortably wet heat.
Until now, the murderer was still a mystery, but now, standing in the same land where the lynching took place, there was anxiety in the air.
When the song's final note disappears, Green asks people to get closer to check on the bodies played by the actor.
The children leaned over and looked down at fake blood and corpses and whispered to each other.
"They're not really dead," a little boy muttered, as if to remind himself.
A few minutes later, Green thanked the crowd and then the show ended.
The actor shook off the lynx and wiped away tears.
Bradshaw hugged Malbaugh, the suit man who plays the head of the Ku Klux Klan.
Nick Lascona hugs two of his peers and falls silent crying in their arms; the emotion in the performance eventually infects him.
"It doesn't matter," one of the women whispers.
'We know it's not like that inside of you.
You do it for a reason.""
After that, the audience sat down for dinner with the actor.
At the same table, a white couple from Atlanta chatted intimately with a black couple they had just met and talked freely about repeating themselves.
Denise Duplinsky had a hard time finding words to describe how she felt after watching.
"It's hard to imagine those terrible words and actions... that should have been spoken and done by people like you, because they look so much like you," she said.
"That, for me, really made me think the lynching was still going on," she added,"and now this kind of thing is only called police shootings."
In the room, Tyrone Brooks sat at a table watching, tasting and reflecting on civil rights.
He said he had started planning for next year's show.
"Repeating it is an inspiring way because it describes the horrors we have experienced, but it is also very educational," he said.
'If you don't learn from it, this kind of thing could happen again.
Those who don't study and don't know their history are doomed to repeat it."
For the reform of natural gas market, the importance of the reform of "pipeline network independence" is self-evident, but the resistance and controversy are also great.
Reporter 7 from Hebei Kailuan Group learned that 7 at 11:25 a.m., the Kailuan Group Chemical Co. Ltd emulsification workshop located in Tangshan City, Hebei Province, an explosion accident, the site of 13 workers trapped.
As of now, one of the 13 people trapped has been rescued and rushed to hospital for rescue, while the remaining 12 are in intensive search and rescue.
It is understood the scene has now been cordoned off and local public security, fire and medical services are on the scene to rescue.
According to eyewitnesses, there was a loud bang at the time of the incident and a mushroom cloud sprang up in the air.
Tangshan Kailuan (Group) Chemical Co. Ltd. is located in the north of Zhao Qizhuang, Tangshan Guiye District, Hebei Province, and is a designated production enterprise of civil blasting equipment approved by the state, which was founded in 1958 and was formerly known as Kailuan Mining Administration Plant Six O 2, according to Kailuan Group personnel who organized the search and rescue work on the spot.

Media captionScientists at China Air Force Engineering University study laser satellites used to remove space junk
Chinese scientists have made a bold and innovative proposal to use large lasers to clean up cluttered Earth orbits and destroy old satellites as well as their sky junk, the Reference News Network reported on January 18.
Researchers at the China Air Force Engineering University wrote a paper entitled "Space-based Laser Removal of Small Scale Space Debris Variable Rail Model Research," which describes how space debris can be irradiated by a laser into smaller, less harmful pieces by using a space-based platform laser, the US Newsweek website reported on January 15.
Space junk has been a concern for international space agencies for years, with NASA considering multiple options to track, detect and remove man-made debris, the report said.
Chinese scientists have carried out laser simulation studies to conclude that this would be an effective way to clean up Earth's orbit, including giant nets used to clean and collect waste and magnets that can be used to suck them out of orbit.
"(Simulation research) provides the necessary theoretical basis for the application of UN-SPIDER laser debris removal technology," the paper's summary said.
A 2014 study by U.S. defense giant Lockheed Martin found that there are about 200 threats a day for satellites that are operating in orbit.
High-speed debris moving along Earth's orbit is seen as a serious threat to future space missions, described by experts at the European Space Agency as a "deadly chain of threats" that has continued to grow in each of the past year.
Space is largely empty, but the space next to Earth is becoming more crowded, and each satellite we send into space will eventually become another piece of debris orbiting the Earth that will pile up over time, according to a January 17 report on the website of Volkswagen Mechanics.
The more debris there is, the higher the chance that a satellite that is still functioning will be hit by debris, thereby damaging or destroying a multimillion-dollar investment.
All space agencies have plans in place to remove space junk in the future, the report said.
NASA is considering reducing the speed of debris with jet gas to get it out of orbit, Europe is considering launching a satellite carrying a large net to capture debris and bring it back to Earth, and Japan's idea is to capture debris with an electric chain.
For now, China is also proposing a solution to space junk, using a large laser to knock floating space debris into smaller, less harmful pieces.
Installing such a laser on a satellite would be effective enough to clean up space, at least according to simulations, according to a paper published in the German monthly optics by a group of researchers at the Chinese Air Force Engineering University.
The only way to prove effectiveness, the report says, is to test, and there are no plans for such a mission, but perhaps sooner or later someone will install a laser on a satellite and send it into space.
Once that's done, we can finally begin to eliminate the problem of space junk once and for all.

Pearson Group to axe 3,000 more jobs, slash dividend to revive business
British education group Pearson Group said on Friday it would cut another 3,000 jobs and sharply cut its interim dividend by 72 per cent as it embarked on another restructuring project to deal with business pressures.
Chief executive John Fallon said most of the job cuts would take place in the second half of 2018 and the first half of 2019, after shedding 4,000 jobs in the previous restructuring.
Pearson Group announced plans in May to cut another £300m ($394m) in costs in its third cost-cutting project to revive the business, which has been hit by the rapid development of digital learning.
Last month, the company agreed to sell its stake in Penguin Langdon Book House to partner Bertelsmann and published reports that its underlying sales were up 1 per cent in the first half to £2.05 billion, but said the outlook for the year was unchanged.
A few days ago, the Chinese Athletics Association issued a serious notice, strictly fight for the running phenomenon, and is ready to impose a lifetime ban on violators of the heavy penalties.
NATO soldier killed in suicide bombing attack on convoy in Kabul
A military convoy has been hit by a suicide bomber in the Afghan capital Kabul, killing a NATO soldier and injuring several others, according to official sources.
Five soldiers and an interpreter were wounded, the NATO statement said.
Three civilians also died in the incident in the Qarabag area of the city, according to unconfirmed local reports.
It was the latest violent attack to hit Afghanistan - the Herat mosque bombing on Tuesday that killed more than 30 people.
A suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul on Monday.
The bombing late Thursday night saw a joint patrol of Afghan and NATO coalition forces hit by "individuals carrying improvised explosive devices," according to a NATO statement.
All of the injured are currently in stable condition and are being treated at the U.S. military hospital at Bagram Air Force Base, the statement said.
The growing Taliban and the so-called Islamic State (IS) group in the Karabakh region has raised serious concerns among NATO forces stationed near Bagram, according to reporters.
At least 1,662 civilians died in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, according to the United Nations, while the death toll in the capital was about 20 percent.
A suicide car bomb attack in Kabul's predominantly Shiite district in late July killed at least 30 people.
The Taliban claimed they carried out the attack.
On May 31, a huge explosion killed more than 150 people in central Kabul, the deadliest militant attack in the country since the U.S.-led multinational force toppled the Taliban in 2001.
The violence underscores the perilous security situation in the country as U.S. President Donald Trump weighs whether to increase troops in Afghanistan to support his troops and police.
Suicide bombings in Kabul in recent weeks have also triggered a crisis of public confidence in the government and its policies, particularly President Ashraf Ghani's reputation, according to reporters.
U.S. National Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) reverses resolution after lawsuit, delays smog regulations
Obama took office with a rule requiring states to curb smog-causing emissions, and 15 states sued the U.S. National Environmental Protection Agency over the rule, a day after the EPA overturned it.
The EPA on Wednesday announced its decision to continue the so-called "2015 ozone compliant zone" and promised the EPA would work with states.
EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt said in a statement that "we are confident in dialogue with our national partners and are committed to responding to it."
Pruitt announced in June that the EPA plans to delay implementation of the ozone compliant zone standard until October 2018, with a one-year delay - under which existing smog pollution in some areas is measured to determine which areas should reduce emissions that cause smog pollution to meet air quality standards.
Fifteen major Democratic states, as well as the District of Columbia, filed a lawsuit against it on Tuesday, declaring the act illegal.
As part of a broader agenda, President Donald Trump's authorities have been working to revive various environmental regulations pushed by former President Barack Obama to spur economic growth.
But those efforts have sparked opposition from Democrats and conservative groups, who worry that more emissions will affect public health.
Breathing air containing ozone "reduces lung function and increases respiratory symptoms," such as asthma, the EPA website states.

Mackie Garcia and Vasily Lomachenko meet for the first time to explore a possible showdown in the future
The most high-profile under-147-pound boxing event will be held soon after, with Vasily Lomachenko and Mackie Garcia, currently in a state of potential conflict, meeting for the first time on Thursday.
They were in separate rooms at ESPN offices in Los Angeles, where unbeaten World Boxing Council lightweight champion Garcia took the lead down the aisle to greet World Boxing Organization super-featherweight champion Lomachenko.
At the Showtime boxing match on Saturday, the referee unanimously decided that Garcia had beaten four-division world champion Adrian Broner to victory, and both fighters have now made the top five on the same heavyweight list.
Garcia stretched out his right hand and said,"Champion, how are you?
Good luck with that.""
Lomachenko saved his status with a victory over Miguel Mariaga in Saturday night's 7pm ESPN game.
When the two of them took photos, Lomachenko's agent, Egis Klimas, noted that the potential confrontation between the two contestants depended on the "perfect size."
"I was lightweight before," Garcetti said.
'I stepped up the ranks to fight Brona (140 pounds), but I didn't weigh that much.
Compared to 140lbs, I'm still a little bit underweight.
I want to go back to lightweight.
And he has to reach lightweight (135 pounds) before we can fight.
That's what fans want, too.
Then we'll satisfy them.""
Lomachenko agreed.
"The boxing world needs this fight." "
Klimas asked if he should be charged a second time, and part of his strategy is to have Lomachenko make his debut later this year against a 135-pound player to set a date next summer with Garcia (37-030 knockout), who is also interested in playing against the winner of the Jorge Linarez-Luke Campbell fight after the Forum lightweight title fight on September 23.
"With all the fans asking the question, this matchup could be a pay-per-view," Garcia said, after which he expressed an openness to playing on the network that offers the best financial options.
'We're the main characters.
It is impossible for others to generate such a high level of attention.
As long as they're ready... '
Garcia appreciates Lomachenko as "a fantastic player" and may watch his boxing match live on Saturday.
But Lomachenko was hesitant to praise Garcia, saying he thought the three-division champion from Riverside looked "slow. Sorry, McGee... You're going to get knocked out."
'The point is to show the strength of the fist and then boxing,' Garcia said.
They all said they could feel the momentum of their boxing match.
"This is a battle that has to be fought," he said.
Attention and heat are beyond the reach of any other boxing match.
I'm more than happy to compete,"Garcia said.
"I've been waiting for top fighters and this time it's McGee's turn," Lomachenko said.
It's going to be a great matchup.""

The announcement by officials of China's National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) on the early completion of the 11.5 emission reduction target has given the steel industry, which has been squeezed by limited electricity production, strong expectations of a return to production.
Although the steelworks have not received a clear notification from the local government that the energy-saving and emission reduction work has been completed, the industry estimates that, around 15 December 2010, the local steel mills that were originally limited in production will gradually resume production and that steel prices will start to bear pressure.
No notice has yet been received of the end of the power limit, but in fact the pressure on companies has been much smaller than in September and October, a private steel company source in Hebei province told reporters.
Some parts of Hebei have repeatedly issued power limit production documents, and at one time adopted the method of forced sluice pulling to restrict the production of enterprises.
Reporters from the local enterprises understand that the majority of Hebei steel mills have resumed work, production restrictions to ease pressure.
Zhang Tiishan, an analyst with my steel network, expects the terminal demand for construction steel to gradually turn from strong to weak as the north is already wintering.
Combined with the gradual end of energy saving and emission reduction, by December 15, most of the steel plants will be back in production, products will arrive in the local market before New Year's Day.
The increase in the supply of resources will put pressure on steel prices, which are now rising at the right pace.

International Online News (reporter Liu Pai): On 18 June, the Economic and Commercial Department of the Italian Embassy in China held a China-Italy environmental protection fair, during which people from enterprises and scientific research institutions of the two countries exchanged views and reached a positive consensus on cooperation between the two countries in the field of renewable resources under the new situation.
It is reported that China's representatives at the meeting mainly include China Renewable Resources Development Co. Ltd., China International Technology Transfer Cooperation Network, and Italy's Bologna Regional Federation of Enterprises.
The representative of Italy said that Italy had a variety of environmental protection technologies and solutions in the field of renewable resources, proposed pilot projects with China on industrial waste disposal, waste oil treatment and waste incineration disposal equipment, and looked forward to extending its experience of environmental cooperation with China to other parts of the world.
Latest results of age assessment test for asylum seekers in Sweden published
The Swedish asylum seeker test uses the latest method to medically assess their age, and the latest results show that more than 80 per cent of the subjects were judged to be over 18, but not everyone is convinced of its accuracy.
The Swedish National Centre for Forensic Medicine (R? Ttsmedicinalverket) began the test earlier this year.
After being accused of failing to accurately assess the age of some of the refugees claiming to be minors, the Swedish Migration Agency (Migrationsverket) designed the tests with a view to making a more accurate age assessment during the asylum process.
So far, the Swedish Migration Agency has sent 6,880 testers, and the Forensic Science Centre has now published the results of a total of 2,481 testers between mid-March and July 31, 2017.
Eighty per cent (2002) were judged to be 18 years or older, however, in another 25 cases, the Swedish National Centre for Forensic Medicine determined that the subjects "may be 18 years or older."
In 432 tests, the result was that the person was "probably under the age of 18."
The test is only for people whose age is in doubt.
The results are consistent with those of previous months, according to John Glaxen of the Center for Forensic Medicine.
He told The Local: "These figures are not too different from those of the previous months and the numbers are all very consistent."
The high proportion of cases judged to be over the age of 18 does not necessarily mean that these asylum-seekers have lied about their age.
In May, the center published 581 test results and said 442 "indicate that the subject is 18 years or older."
News newspaper Svenska Dagbladet investigated the published results of 581 tests and found that 243 of the subjects had publicly said they would turn 18 this year.
X-rays of wisdom teeth, an MRI scan of the joints and then analysis of the results by dentists and radiologists are also being questioned in parts of the country.
One skeptic is Claude Marcus, an endocrinologist at Caroline College, whose work includes assessing people's biological maturity to determine whether they experience puberty earlier or later than their normal age.
He told news.com.au Metro: "I have reason to think so, and I don't think the measurement used should be that way.
It is not accurate to judge biological age in this way.
If we can't guarantee accuracy, we shouldn't pretend we can do it."
Yet Glaxen, of the Center for Forensic Medicine, defended the accuracy of the tests: "The risk of uncertainty in judging a child as an adult is, by and large, small."
The greatest risk is that the person is just under 18 years of age, which is about 10 per cent.
West Virginia governor announces party change
On Thursday night, West Virginia's Democratic governor, Jim Justice, announced at a rally for President Trump that he would change partisanship.
"Like it or not, the Democrats have left me," the governor said.
"Today, after a lot of prayer and a lot of thought, I'm going to tell you... today I'm going to tell you as West Virginians that I can no longer help you as a Democratic governor," he said.
The rally erupted into cheers.
"So, tomorrow, I'm going to change the party membership to the Republican Party," Jastis added.
'As a coach, I'm going to tell it's time to start another game.'
Trump earlier promised a major announcement at a rally in West Virginia.
Mr. Trump won 42 percent of the vote in West Virginia, and Mr. Jastis did not endorse Democrat Hillary Clinton.
Jastis was named the state's only billionaire in 2016, according to Forbes.
Forbes noted that he inherited his father's coal industry and owned coal mines in all five states.
At the moment, he's worth about $1.59 billion.
Meanwhile, the Republican National Committee issued a statement late Thursday saying: "Governor Jastis's change of party is another blow to Democrats that, far from preventing our country from becoming great again, will make our country great again."
"Democrats currently have only 15 governors, and control of the state legislature is at an all-time low, and Governor Jastis's statement is the latest rejection of such a party that has lost leadership from top to bottom and is unable to find a positive unifying slogan," Republican National Committee chairwoman Rona McDaniel said in a statement to CBS News.

Sebastian Coe praises Russia's' frank 'apology over doping scandal
On Thursday, the president of the International Association of Athletics Federations, Sebastian Coe, applauded Russia's apology over the doping scandal and called it very "frank," but reiterated that it was also not the moment for Russia to rejoin the sport.
Speaking at the IAAF congress on the eve of the World Athletics Championships, Russian Athletics Federation president Mitri Chirakdin said his country was right to be banned from the sport and was determined to fight doping.
He said he regretted that "all athletes who have won gold and silver in the competition have been stripped of their medals."
Despite his comments, the IAAF General Assembly voted in favour of maintaining the ban, which was imposed in November 2015 after a World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) report referred to the discovery of evidence of Russian state-sponsored doping.
"I think the response today was very frank, very frank introduction," IAAF president Ko told reporters.
"The whole council and the IAAF congress are very happy... the Russian Federation acknowledges that it has been through a very scorching period and is doing everything possible to ensure that Russia can re-enter the competition," the statement read.
Ko said he was also "pleased" that Russia had accepted the criteria for re-entries.
"I think it was a very constructive day and think we have made some progress, but the IAAF General Assembly supports the recommendations of the panel and now is not the time to reinstate the Russian entry," Ko said.
"We need to do everything we can in the next few months to normalize this," he said.
Our guiding principle has always been the desire to separate clean athletes from contaminated systems,"he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes meet strict IAAF standards and will compete as neutrals at the World Athletics Championships in London on Friday.
The head of the IAAF panel, Rune Anderson, said on Monday that Russia had yet to meet a number of criteria for the resumption of entries.
He told reporters after a speech to the IAAF Council in London that drug testing was still underdone and banned coaches were still in charge.
At the first anniversary of the implementation of the Beijing Regulations on the Control of Smoking held this morning, representatives of the young students who won the award in the "My Declaration on Tobacco Control" video interacted with Huang Xuan, the national ambassador for tobacco control publicity, and reviewed the collection video and the exhibition of the award winning works.
The French evening reporter learned from the event that young actor Huang Xuan was hired as the national tobacco control publicity image ambassador.
Huang Xuan, who smoked cigarettes during his college years, successfully quit smoking after fully understanding the dangers of smog, and this time took on the role of ambassador to quit smoking, calling on teenagers to stay away from tobacco.
The audience puts on masks and becomes the ghost-like presence in the story, which is the biggest game-changer for "sleepless nights."

Almost all of the 12 Fed regions reported moderate to moderate growth in economic activity in early 2018, keeping an upbeat outlook for the year, according to the Fed's economic brown book.
Meanwhile, the U.S. unemployment rate remained at 4.1 percent in December, the lowest since 2000, and businesses are expected to raise wages in the coming months.
Fed officials generally view the tax overhaul as a factor in supporting this moderately stronger economic outlook, with the Fed forecasting 2.5 percent economic growth and three rate hikes in 2018.
Market sources pointed out that the recent tightening of ECB monetary policy expectations has pushed up the euro exchange rate, the dollar index has fallen in a row and the yuan has seen a corresponding surge against the dollar, although it is unlikely that the ECB will soon adjust its policy stance, with short-term volatility in foreign exchange markets eventually returning to fundamentals, and the continued smooth running of the yuan is a big probability event.
It is worth noting that the attractiveness of renminbi assets to foreign investors has gradually become apparent as market expectations for the currency have become more stable.

How do football's financial rules affect Neymar's move to Paris?
Rules designed to prevent unrestricted spending by European giants football clubs will not prevent Neymar from moving from Barcelona in Spain to Paris Saint-Germain Football Club in France (PSG) for a record fee.
The fallout has been further relegation from the Paris Saint-Germain Football Club by the UEFA, the governing body of European football, which has the power to ban teams from the much-watched Champions League.
The Financial Fair Play Rules (FFP), introduced by UEFA in 2011, mean the Paris Saint-Germain football club will eventually have to prove that Neymar's transfer was funded financially without causing huge losses.
FC Barcelona have paid 222 million euros ($262 million) just to pay for the Brazilian player's demotion, while Neymar will be paid tens of millions of dollars a year.
Here are some of the financial implications of Nemar's move to France.
Given that the team is funded by the cash-rich Qatari ruling family, Paris Saint-Germain football club could certainly sign Neymar with cash and include him in the squad that has other stars in the cloud.
Clubs can spend huge sums on players, but they must use legitimate sources of income to make up for the huge sums spent, leaving them with a break-even in football-related business.
The Financial Fair Play Rules were conceived by Michel Platini after he was elected UEFA president in 2007.
The former French player believes that for clubs who are in debt in pursuit of success, if the bank or everyone withdraws their support money, they are actually cheating and putting the club at risk of destruction.
In 2011, the focus of the Rules shifted from the issue of club debt to the monitoring of the club's loss situation.
The change means that the business model used by Roman Abramovich when he bought Chelsea FC in 2003, namely buying a club with potential and then spending huge sums to improve the team and build it a global brand, now faces a more demanding situation.
The club could lose up to 30 million euros in the three year assessment period to 2018 under the Rules.
UEFA successor Aleksander Ceferin remains committed to stopping excessive spending, despite Abu being disparaged by the then-president in 2015.
"Of course the Rules haven't lapsed and we will certainly strengthen the regulations in the future," UEFA's Andrea Traverso, who is in charge of matters related to the Rules, told The Associated Press last week.
While Paris Saint-Germain Football Club will pay off Neymar's buyout clause in a lump sum, it can also distribute the amount over the life of the contract for accounting purposes.
Neymar has signed a five-year deal so the transfer fee is likely to show up as a fee of €44.4 million in the annual accounts for the next five years.
The first wave of Rules sanctions imposed in 2014 put Paris Saint-Germain Football Club, as well as Abu Dhabi's Manchester City club, under the most severe sanctions.
Paris Saint-Germain Football Club was fined 60 million euros ($82 million at the exchange rate at the time), later reduced to 20 million euros, and asked for the team to be reduced to 21 players in the Champions League in the 2014-15 season, instead of the normal 25.
UEFA is eyeing clubs trying to hoodwink financial regulators by hooking up with club owners to raise revenue.
While Qatari companies can sponsor Paris Saint-Germain Football Club, UEFA will not see the sponsorship as a legitimate income if the amount is deemed to exceed the standard market price.
It was something that happened in 2014, when UEFA ruled that the amount of money the Qatar Tourism Authority had sponsored the Paris Saint-Germain football club had been inflated.
Part of Neymar's income at Paris Saint-Germain football club could come from payments from the 2022 Qatar World Cup organizing committee, according to reports.
But both Paris Saint-Germain Football Club and the organizing committee denied that Neymar would be a World Cup ambassador, and it would be easy for UEFA regulators to make such a move.
Recent sanctions imposed on Paris Saint-Germain football club mean UEFA will be more wary of any attempt to bypass the rules.
Sources familiar with the matter said on Thursday that UEFA had not held pre-discussions with Paris Saint-Germain football club over a move for Neymar.
All of the above spoke to The Associated Press in an unnamed capacity only because they were not authorized to discuss the situation at Paris Saint-Germain Football Club.
The last published accounts showed Paris Saint-Germain Football Club had operating income of 542.4 million euros in 2015-16, making a profit of more than 10 million euros.
The accounts for the previous fiscal year have not been released.
Paris Saint-Germain Football Club expects Neymar's arrival to bring gospel to sponsorship events, franchises and jersey sales.
The club expects revenues to grow by at least 30 per cent after signing Neymar.
It is clear that seeing the most famous of these players leave, the Spanish league is deeply outraged, trying to block Neymar's move and claiming the Paris Saint-Germain football club are in breach of the Rules.
Xavier Tebas, the president of the Spanish league, told Spanish newspaper AS that "this is a clear example of a 'financial doping' in which the club and the country are the same," referring to Qatar, which has ultimate ownership of the Paris Saint-Germain football club.
Arsene Wenger, manager of the Arsenal team (the club's owner is the American sports tycoon), has reservations about the state-funded club as much as the Spanish league.
"This is a consequence of ownership and this has revolutionised the whole ecology of football over the last 15 years," Wenger said on Thursday.
"Once the country has the club, then anything can happen," he said.
That would make it very difficult to comply with the Rules, because there are many different ways or interests for a country to require big-name players to represent a country."
Smart interactive robot R & D maker Rokid gets new investment Temasek lead
In recent years, start-ups in the field of artificial intelligence have continued to receive capital buzz.
Artificial Intelligence Rokid recently completed a new round of financing, led by Temasek, followed by Credit Suisse, CDIB, an investment arm of Taiwan's China Development Financial Holding Company, and veteran shareholder IDG Capital.
It is reported that the current round of financing is about $100 million, the first time Credit Suisse and CDIB in the domestic artificial intelligence sector financing deals.
Rokid is an intelligent interactive robot R & D, dedicated to the field of robotics, products can control the home intelligent equipment, can continue to learn and grow autonomously, and have the functions of recognition, understanding, feedback, and so on.
This round of financing will be mainly used for R & D, talent introduction, strategic promotion and industrial chain investment layout.
In August 2014, Rokid received $8.3 million in angel round investments from IDG, Linear Capital, Mfund and Metal Jing Capital; in October 2015, the company received a further $10 million round A investment from Warden International and Angel Investors; and on November 1, 2016, Rokid completed round B financing from Sham Capital, IDG, Mfund, Metal Jing Capital, Warden International and others.
Rokid said at the time that the company's valuation had reached $450 million after the B round of financing.
In May 2017, Rokid released the consumer-grade smart voice robot "Jookie Moon Stone," which combines artificial intelligence and home scenes for 1,399 yuan.
The robot uses speech synthesis, natural language understanding, speech recognition technology and microphone array technology, with chat conversations, playing music, and smart home functions.
He has won two major awards at the International Consumer Electronics Show (CES) Tech For A Better World and Home Audio / Video Compacts An Accessories, as well as the German IF Design Award, known as the Oscars of the design world.

The 3-D Huan animated film "Doufu Biography" premieres in Wuhan on April 25, and the director of "Doufu Biography" zou Hao, the director of "Tofu Biography" animation Meng Wisdom, the film producer and Emmy winner Tom Disher, all appeared to share the behind-the-scenes stories of the film's creation.
Based on the story of Wang Liu'an of Huainan in the Han Dynasty in Chinese traditional culture, the story of the protagonist "Doufu" is transformed from a bean into a human figure, overcoming many difficulties and sticking to the dream of Xiuxian. The animated film of the budding Xiuxiang is deeply rooted in the local culture of Hubei Province.
Wudang Mountain in Shiyan City, Hubei Province, is one of the world cultural heritage sites published by the United Nations. It is also the birthplace of Taoist culture and Wudang Wushu.
Director zou Hui revealed that in the film's early stage, he and the lead team went to Wudang Mountain to pick the wind.
He said that the story of "Beanfu Zhuan" took place in the West Han Dynasty Wudi years, Huainan Wang Liu'an alchemy Xian background, the film protagonist "Beanfu" is a Liu'an alchemy when accidentally changed into a human shape of beans.
In addition to Wudang Mountain, the birthplace of Taoist culture, Hubei also has a long history of traditional Chinese musical instruments, the chime has a deep origin.

Nostalgia infects the market - "Hala Summer Camp" and "Detective Twin Sung"
Retelling the story is a nostalgia for the actors "80s scenery years and the trash days of the 90s (before and after David Wayne and Michael Thewart produced the sketch comedy" The Nation "for MTV); and for nostalgia itself, a nostalgia for 2001; a year before so many stars such as Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Luther had yet to wind up.
As a cultural artwork, it is a parody and embodiment of the permanent memories of our Facebook era.
But as a series, it feels like time is running out.
There's a backlash after the first day of camp aired, but it's not just because of its absurdist humour (the plot is an original story about a talking can of vegetables, dubbed by H Jon Benjamin).
It's part of the fun to double the core of the plot - middle-aged actors playing spooky kids - making it impossible to get back to the past.
In "Ten Years Later," when adults actually play adults, the mood is less ingrained and the imitation is more diffuse, including improvisations about 90s stalking movies like "Hands That Drive the Cradle."
At one point, a character gets stuck in an Apple notebook, some straight-line skates and "something else from 1991."
Many of the core stories are the same.
Mr. sweetheart (Mr. Sewart adorn) has now become a novelist, but he still hasn't forgotten Katie (Margaret Morrow adorn).
Victor (Ken Mariano) still has a man's body.
There's another sinister plot involving Ronald Reagan (also played by Mr. Thwaites), instigated by George H.W. Bush (played by Michael Ian Black, impressive).
As always, the best part of this series is interjecting.
It was particularly interesting to see the forever young Mr. Luther, who flaunted Matt Dillon's soul patch in the film "The bachelorette," before Andy in "The Campus Giant" now feels like a giant.
It was a moment of random madness that might have powered the film, like the recursive "Seven Years of Life" series, until it came to what I thought was the logical conclusion: "Hala Summer Camp: Twenty Years Later," whose final act was to get the gang to see the movie premiere of "Hala Summer Camp."
Meanwhile, Amazon's "Detective Twins" tells of different nostalgia: The Cold War Revivalist's "American Spy Dream," the film "The City of the Extreme Cold," and even the East-West wrestling imagery of "GLOW: Gorgeous Women's Wrestling League."
The comedy, created by Bryan Getwood and Alexandro Tanaka, was pushed onto the TV screen by director Rhys Thomas: It's a hard-nosed comedy-drama set in 80s Romania, about two Bucharest officials fighting for truth, atheism and the Marxist-Leninist line.
The main characters - the hard-nosed Grigor and the idealistic Joseph - are played by Florin Pierszi, Jr., and Corneliu Ulitch, respectively, with dialogue dubbed in English by Channing Tatum (also an executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
It's a brilliant idea.
But it's not just an idea.
There are some good visual gimmicks (the police spend their time watching chess on TV because Americans like to play football).
And there are a host of celebrity soundbiters - among them Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mach Sarah Hashbaz Ali and Colo Sevigny - who have forged a fabulous sound extravaganza.
But "Detective Twin" is so committed to creating a raucous, lifelike propaganda comedy - featuring a killer wearing a Reagan mask - that it usually plays such a role.
The six-episode long TV is a bit of a drag, and the comedic effects aren't released quickly or frequently enough.
The "Detective Twin Men" film director is more tightly edited, and presents a better demagogic satire when Gregor and Joseph repeatedly visit the US embassy, where two fat men always gobble up a pile of burgers.
For an imaginary communist audience, the message means Western culture can turn anything into fodder to revel in.

Reporters recently learned that the northeast iron and steel, rail transit, ships, machinery and other industries, such as the general decline in benefits, even losses.
Some experts believe that under the current situation, the new revitalization of northeast industry is not only related to the national economic recovery, but will also have an impact on the long-term development of China's manufacturing industry and international competitiveness, so it is urgent to adjust and transform.
The general decline of corporate benefits in traditional industries and the loss of raw materials industry and heavy machinery equipment manufacturing industry is a serious decline or even a loss, is the primary performance of the Northeast industry in the current economic downturn.
In the past, in the economic downturn, mainly low-end, primary products have been hit by the big characteristics, but in this economic fluctuation, the Northeast traditional industrial high-end, low-end industrial products are affected.
In previous years, Angang Group (Weibo) has focused on the development of high-end panels, such as container panels, rail, hoverboards and civil appliances, but sales of these varieties have declined significantly this year, in particular by 50 per cent compared with the same period last year.

Liu Yifei, for his part, revealed that he had "wept miserably" at the time of the film, and at one point cried until he collapsed.

Bank of England to maintain 0.25% interest rate
The Bank of England will announce at a later date that interest rates will remain unchanged after weak economic growth and loose inflation dashed hopes of a hike.
The Bank of England has warned that growth will continue to be "weak" as it controls interest rates while tightening household incomes.
Policymakers on the bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted 6-2 to maintain the 0.25 percent rate, while a handful of members this month called for higher rates even as weak economic growth has dampened the boost from the hike.
In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank of England narrowed its growth forecasts for 2017 and 2018 to 1.7 per cent and 1.6 per cent respectively, and issued a warning that the squeeze on household incomes would continue while inflation surged to nearly 3 per cent in the autumn.
But it said it would need to raise interest rates over the next few years to curb inflation from Brexit, while borrowing costs may need to be raised more sharply as expected in financial markets.
Members also voted to withdraw a massive economic boost that was imposed a year ago by the impact of Brexit.
The Bank of England will announce the end of its fixed-term funding scheme to provide cheap money to banks from February next year, although the bank says it now needs an extra £15bn on top of £115bn under the scheme.
In the minutes of the interest rate decision minutes, the Bank of England said: "In the MPC's core forecast, gross domestic product (GDP) remains weak in the near term as the squeeze on household real incomes will continue to suppress consumption."
On interest rates, the bank has repeatedly reiterated the need for "some monetary policy tightening" to clamp down on inflation, and to a "greater degree" than market expectations.
The market is now expecting its first growth in the third quarter of next year and its second in 2020.
But the bank stressed that any increase would be "slow" and "restrained."
The bank's growth forecasts for this year and next are on a downward trend, compared with forecasts of 1.9 per cent and 1.7 per cent in May.
The bank maintained its forecast of 1.8 percent growth in 2018.
The pound fell against the dollar and the euro followed suit.
Sterling fell 0.5 per cent against the dollar to 1.31 and 0.4 per cent against the euro to 1.11.
The unchanged decision comes after rising expectations were dashed by recent gloomy growth figures, with GDP rising to 0.3 per cent in the second quarter, compared with 0.2 per cent in the previous three months.
The bank said growth in the third quarter was likely to remain at 0.3 per cent, although it would rise slightly by the end of the year.
Ordinary households have been hit by skyrocketing inflation, while wage growth has been negligible, and the Bank of England's recent inflation report has not given them happy news, as the bank says austerity will get worse before it gets better,
Monetary policy "cannot prevent" a hit to incomes over the next few years, but wages are expected to recover "massively" at the end of the three-year forecast.
At the same time, the economy will be stimulated to offset some of the effects of low consumption because of the fall in the value of the pound and a sharp increase in demand for British goods.
The decision comes a year after a shocking EU referendum saw the pound plunge and interest rates cut to 0.25 per cent in August.
The Bank of England estimates it could take four years to fully impact prices and the UK economy.
Calls for a rate rise came before the bank published its latest rate ruling, as inflation added to the already stressed average household, while three policymakers called for a rate hike to 0.5 per cent in July.
Inflation retreated to 2.6 per cent last month from 2.9 per cent in June, although the Bank of England said it was expected and would rise again in the coming months.
The bank said the excess, relative to its 2 per cent target, was already entirely the last bottom line for the weak pound.
Andrew Monterick, director of Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: "Given the recent fall in swap rates, the mortgage market looks set to become more competitive again as lenders make a strong call for more business and look to put the perfect end to the year on a positive note.
For those who may be nearing the end of an existing deal, such a market looks particularly favorable, as remortgaging (many of which can be fee-free and have low interest rates) is becoming more popular.

NHS England's controversial HIV drug goes green
Patients will be able to access "transformative" HIV prevention treatment from September after the dust settled in the High Court over NHS drug funding.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), a drug that can be taken before sex, has been shown to reduce the risk of infection in people at high risk by about 86 per cent, NHS England has announced, and the health service will now offer the drug to an estimated 10,000 people through a three-year initial trial.
It agreed to fund the trial after the Court of Appeal upheld the High Court ruling last year, which said the NHS was entitled to pay for PrEP despite its claims that local authorities should fund the drug.
The move announced on Thursday was branded a "major new intervention" by NHS England chief executive Simon Stevens, while the National AIDS Trust (NAT) described it as a "critical moment."
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to be registered, with more to join in October, followed by full implementation across England in April 2018.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is an HIV drug taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
Trials have shown that PrEP significantly reduces HIV transmission in people at risk of infection.
Taking PrEP before sex means there are enough specific drugs in the body to prevent HIV infection.
The drug can be taken every day or two hours before intercourse.
Those eligible for treatment include gay, bisexual men, transgender people and HIV-positive people who have not been successfully treated.
The clinic will determine whether eligible and consenting participants, including men, women, transgender people and those whose sexual partners have HIV status, are receiving antiretroviral treatment for unknown conditions.
People who live in England and register as GPs can also sign up at the sexual health clinic they attend locally.
The scheme will cost £10m, while the NHS England branch has signed a contract to procure the drugs this week after international competitive procurement.
The trial aims to assess the full potential of PrEP by collecting clinical evidence on how it is positioned, absorbed and implemented on a large sample basis.
Mr Stevens said: "This major new intervention should complement and reinforce HIV prevention in a broad and increasingly successful way.
This is yet another milestone in more than 30 years of action worthy of progress in addressing major human health challenges."
Dipola King, chief executive of the UK AIDS Trust (NAT), said: "This is a critical moment in the fight against AIDS.
If it does target people in need and at risk, pre-exposure prophylaxis offers the possibility of changing the AIDS epidemic in the UK.
Starting in September, people at high risk of HIV will be given a permitted new tool through this NHS-funded trial in England, which is truly solo and does not require consultation with sexual partners, which will lead to improvements in the lives of so many people.
We're double-handed in favor of the announcement."
Ian Green, chief executive of the Terrence Higgins Trust, said: "The priority now is to make sure the trial is pushed quickly across the country and that none of those infected with HIV can fall.
Now that we have purchased the PrEP trial drug, we are ready to protect more than 10,000 people at high risk of HIV."
Shadow Public Health Minister Sharon Hodgson claimed: "After months of delays and government procrastination, the start of PrEP's initial trial is welcome and should come sooner.
The evidence shows how the drug can bring about change as part of our approach to preventing HIV and halting the spread of this deadly infectious disease.
This trial will give us a further and full understanding of PrEP's strengths.
It is important that this trial be rolled out nationwide as soon as possible in order to protect people exposed to HIV and to help us to further end the spread of HIV in society."

High quality life: Apply attic and ingenious design, make Earl's Palace small apartment into a spacious home
Joanne Ray, a former banker, was so keen to renovate the house that in 2014 she moved from her large house in Knightsbridge to the Earl's Palace small apartment.
The apartment is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace, which Joanne didn't pack up to sell, a testament to the new design.
"Before that, I lived with my ex-boyfriend in a bigger house in Knightsbridge," says Joanne.
'I was looking for the right house with the offer.
I saw this apartment in the Earl's Palace, and its ceiling was high.
I'd like to make an offer the same day."
The 1,000-square-foot apartment has now been completely overhauled since it was first viewed.
The apartment was originally a complex one-bedroom -- it needed to go through the kitchen to get to the bedroom -- and Joanne wanted to add storage space and an attic to make the most of the ample ceiling height.
'I want high ceilings, big windows, plenty of light.
That's what I'm asking for,"she said.
To that end, she hired Elvan Azadi from the Duck & Shed Architecture and Design Studio (in Notting Hill) to use the 12.5-foot-high ceiling to elaborate a home that was not only a development project, but also where Joanne lived.
The ceiling is not high enough to add two up and down spaces, so the architectural challenge is to create a loft high enough for people to stand.
Elvan had to think creatively in order to solve the problem.
"The steel structure is quite complex," he explained.
"We must arrange the space for it to be displayed up and down, and there is no need to shrug our shoulders and bow our backs.
It's not just that simple to build a simple platform, but also to start the steel so that it's at the right height to function."
Through this arrangement, Elvan was able to obtain two full-body rooms in the space -- which could add many interesting elements.
The loft features Retrouvius-branded retro copper windows overlooking the glamorous living area.
Gold furniture with mirrors, small silver pieces of furniture and Serge Mouille retro lighting laid out the overall style.
The use of mirrors plays an important role in increasing atmosphere, space and light.
Installing mirrors at both ends of the short hallway can make it look longer.
In the kitchen, splashboards with mirrors are like windows leading to another room.
At the entrance, a small lattice with mirrors provides storage space for Joanne to store cutlery and glassware.
The beautiful living room has an engaging sense of space and is able to put the kitchen away when it's not in use.
The folding kitchen is not new.
But what's unique about this folding kitchen is a garage-style lift door.
"There's a bit of engineering knowledge involved here," Elvan explains of the reinforced veneer MDF doors.
'This uses the principle of balance, so it's easy to slide when you push the door.'
Thanks to clever use of space and storage, Joanne gained an extra 16 square metres, an extra bedroom and an improved layout.
"Ultimately, what you sell is the size of the house -- or the valuation of your property is based on the size of the house," says Elfan.
"Basically, the real estate agent would walk into the room and make calculations based on the floor size." "
They will try to increase the amount of space they occupy while using premium materials, bringing a lavish feel to the space.
Mr Elfan said "the material is all hand-picked by you and therefore helps create emotional bonds at home."
'You don't fall in love with the power on the wall.
These things are important, but they don't break your heart."
It turns out that, with good design and extra space, standard apartments can shake and become breathtaking.
In fact, you might choose to live, as Joanne did.

Two brothers stage $500 million real estate empire battle
Forty years after its Italian family founded the dynasty, the brothers are waging a battle over one of Victoria's biggest real estate empires worth more than $500 million.
Colin De Lutis, a former Carlton football club director and developer, lives in a mansion in the Tucara district, and three doors away is the residence of his younger brother Paul, who took him to the Supreme Court over the division of their real estate and business assets.
Paul has been hoping to break away from the family business since 2014, but the brothers have been locked in a bitter dispute in the Supreme Court over the asset split.
The brothers and their mother owned a total of 38 real estate properties worth more than $500 million, which had accumulated since the family bought Smith Street in the Collingwood area in 1973.
There, the family founded Westco Jeans and gradually grew it to the size of 160 retail chains.
In 1999, the company sold for $85 million.
That money was then put into real estate, and the De Routis family's portfolio now includes city office buildings, Brunswick and Sorrento development projects, Gold Coast and Bull Hill apartments, and suburban shopping centres.
Under an agreement with his late father, Colin, who was described by his younger brother Paul as the "prime mover and dominant figure" of the De Routis family, owns about two-thirds of the company's assets, while Paul accounts for about a third.
Documents filed with the court said the converted property, owned by Colin, was worth $316 million, while the property owned by Paul was worth $176 million.
According to Paul, the division of real estate and cash proved to be the crux of the negotiations.
"Colin's proposal for a division of property left him what I thought was the best property," he wrote in an initial court affidavit in 2015.
On Friday, the Supreme Court held its first hearing after several failed mediation attempts.
Now the brothers are still vying for control of the existing business, with Paul claiming Colin has kicked him out.
And Colin denied it and accused Paul of poor management of certain real estate properties.
In an early affidavit filed by Colin, he expressed a desire to resolve the dispute.
"My Italian heritage determines that family is the most important option. My Italian ancestry determines that family is the most important," he wrote.
The cost of the case has climbed, and there are hundreds of pages of affidavits, emails, and corporate reports from top law firms such as Deloitte, Pitcher Partners, Charter Keck Cramer, Allan Myers, QC, and senior lawyers hired by both parties.
Ms. de Routis and her late husband, Luigi, both Italian immigrants, began running popular eateries and delis in the late 1950s and bought a shop in Brunswick in the early 1970s.
They used collateral to buy the Collingwood property, where Colin opened the family's first jeans shop.
Colin said,"when I read High Three," where he started Westco,"at the time, Paul was very young (about 10 years old)."
Anna De Routis says she and Luigi, who died in 2012, want to be able to pass on the property peacefully to their son
"Luigi used to say to me that he never wanted the brothers to end up in court," she wrote.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer members of the De Routis group, and Colin said Mark paid him $10 million when he left the company and $26 million to Luke.
Paul said both Luke and Mark had "expressed dissatisfaction with the terms of their property division."
Colin has kept a low profile despite being a former AFL club board member, according to a biography published by TV star Eddie McGuire until 2015.
"Fairfax Media" contacted Colin and Paul, as well as their lawyers, on Friday.
But only Colin responded via text message, saying that because the case had gone to court "I really can't say too much."
"It is very, very sad that my brother Paul chose to sue me and bring our family affairs to court," he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote in a court filing that he had tried to meet his brother's demands.
"Our father did not want to see Paul and I finally have a dispute like this at the moment," he said, adding that he "still has hope for a settlement of the dispute."
On Friday, that hope seemed dashed.
"Our problems will be resolved through the courts in the near future," Colin wrote.

Trump's new chief of staff plans to limit the president's media time
Others have tried, but all have failed.
John F. Kelly might actually be able to do it.
If that's the case, then he's the first man.
The new White House chief of staff plans to limit the flow of information to President Trump - including news media reports - with a view to guaranteeing a smoother boss, according to Politico, a US political news website.
Here's an excerpt from journalist Josh Dawsey:
"When the new White House chief of staff, John F. Kelly, began his first day of work gathering with senior officials, he pointed out that he wanted to address one of President Trump's main problems in the White House: Bad information flowing to the president."
Kelly told the officials that receiving good information helps the president make better decisions, so the information needs to go through his hands - whether in writing or in the form of a briefing.
Kelly's diagnosis was patchy, but others had tried to tame it by monitoring Trump's media time, but it all ended in failure.
President Trump has a long history of TV addiction - and now in the White House, his habit of watching TV is still deepening.
In February, former campaign adviser Sam Nagberg told Politico: "If candidate Trump is frustrated with unfair reporting, it would be helpful to let him know that he has also received positive coverage in credible channels."
Politico's Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that "based on the experience of six former campaign officials, the focus of the habit of controlling Trump's tweets is to guarantee that certain praise has always been included in the media messages he personally receives."
It's totally fine.
But the notion that Trump's Twitter habit was once "controlled" is laughable.
It's possible that these campaign officials knew something we didn't - that if it wasn't for their intervention, Trump's tweets would have been even more fiery.
We may never know those tweets that Trump didn't send.
If his staff could save him from the fire, even if only a few times, their efforts would be worth it.
But no one has been able to keep Trump from being controversial.
Part of the problem is that in a White House of competing groups, people preach their worldview by handing Trump information that may or may not be reliable, fancy pushing their cause.
Politico - all about the story - reported in May on various advisers "penchant for strategically providing questionable information to the president.
Here's an example of what journalist Sheen Goodmancher described:
"Current and former Trump officials claim that Trump's response to negative news clips, such as volcanic eruptions, especially those with damaging information leaks, would be frantic to figure out where it came from," the statement read.
At the end of February, an article on GotNews.com, the website of Charles C. Johnson, a cyber-agitator, was maliciously copied to the president, accusing Deputy Chief of Staff Katie Walsh of being the White House's "source of a lot of information leaks," as Trump did at the time.
Even if Johnson had been permanently blocked by Twitter for harassment, no concrete evidence had been provided, and he had blown up a lot of false quality control, which he later blatantly denied.
Trump read the article and then began asking officials about Walsh."
Goodmancher also said then-Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and White House Secretary Rob Porter "had tried to establish a system to manage and document documents that Trump received."
And what about the results?
Kelly intends to do the same thing, in three months.
Maybe he can prove himself to be a more efficient administrator than Priebus, but Trump is still that impulsive Trump, and his aides are still competing for influence.
These timeless influences will make Kelly's task even harder.
Tourist amorous town: How amorous feelings intoxicate tourists
[Abstract] The potential of small towns in Zhejiang is gradually awakened.
Now these small towns have become an important destination for visitors to Zhejiang to enjoy Zhejiang mountains and waters, read Zhejiang culture and feel Zhejiang homesickness, and will also provide an important help for our province to build the most beautiful tourist destination in China,"Zhejiang Poetry and Painting."

Housemates negotiate ditches to return to 'Rich Street'
Some of the wealthiest owners in the West Midlands have once again been at loggerheads with determined homeowners who have negotiated a government-dug trench for the return of land outside the mansion.
The housemates parked their 20 trailers in a vacant lot outside the bustling Solihull Street, which has been dubbed "Rich Street."
The "moat" dug up by the municipal department did not stop the occupants, who were carrying horses, carrying babies and leading a fleet of housemates, returning again after being driven away in May.
The sleek and sophisticated team found a gap in the defensive line through which their vehicles squeezed in, although there was a section of the road where no barricades were set up to fit through.
Furious residents have slammed Solihull Council for its "poor performance in dealing with the issue."
One resident, who did not wish to be named, said: 'They were there on Monday night before coming to Bingley Heath Street and throwing stones at passers-by.
The council should be ashamed of what they are doing because they are simply nothing to deal with.
The housemates came here in May and were then driven away, and now they are back.
It came quite a bit last night, and it could have been more today.""
She added: "Birmingham City Council knows how to deal with it by implementing a long-term ban to protect its parks.
I live on Streetsbrook Road and I'm not willing to continue paying council tax if the council can't stop something like this.
One local resident, who did not want to be named, said: "It's ridiculous, we've just seen the last batch of house cabs go, just for the convenience of another to destroy.
The numbers have increased again this time, with some even seeing horses grazing on the park lawn.""
A Solihull council spokeswoman said: "We are aware of unauthorised camping in an open area on Szewitzbrook Road and now we cooperate with Solihull Police and take the necessary legal action to get them removed as soon as possible.
To support us in gathering evidence, it is very important that as many local residents as possible report any anti-social or criminal behaviour to the police by calling 101.
This helps us to provide a general picture of the situation for the Court to look at when we bring a case before it."

Italy takes a hard line on NGO migrant rescue boats
Italy has issued a warning to NGOs operating migrant rescue boats in the Mediterranean that they will not be allowed to continue rescues without signing new operational management norms.
"It is difficult to see how non-governmental organizations will succeed if they do not sign the new code of conduct," Interior Minister Marco Minniti said in an interview with the Turin daily Newsbeat.
A day before Minniti's warning, Italian officials seized a German aid group, Youth Aid, on suspicion that the crew of a ship actually colluded with human traffickers to assist illegal migrants.
The aid group has only been operating for a year and declined to comment on the specific subject of allegations by Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.
"Saving lives is and will be the most important thing for us, so we regret not being able to operate in search and rescue zones at this time," the group said in a social media statement.
"After all the information has been collected, we can only assess all the allegations and the situation at this time."
Italian officials have been monitoring the Iuventa, a boat belonging to the group Youth Aid, since October.
Its crew is suspected of carrying migrants brought directly from small boats by traffickers, and allowing smugglers to flee in haste and retake the ship.
At least one such meeting allegedly took place at sea 1.3 miles off the coast of Libya, according to prosecutors' documents, published by Italian media.
Its crew is suspected of brazenly ignoring the authority of the Italian coastguard, which oversees rescue operations in the area for humanitarian zeal rather than any other motive.
According to the code of conduct, vessels such as Iuventa clearly require an Italian police officer on board to oversee their activities.
At present, only three of the nine non-governmental organizations involved in search and rescue operations have agreed to comply with the code of conduct, namely Save the Children, the Malta-based Migrant Maritime Assistance Station and the Pro-Activa Open Arms in Spain.
The latter said on Thursday it believed the new rules, while unnecessary, were acceptable because they would not bring any "significant changes and impediments" to its rescue operations.
Among the organizations that refused to sign was the Nobel Prize-winning organization Doctors Without Borders (MSF).
Meanwhile, Minniti says the number of migrants arriving in Italy has plummeted in recent weeks, suggesting efforts to strengthen Libyan coast guards and unite local mayors are beginning to bear fruit.
"In recent days, we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel," the minister said.
He unveiled plans for deep talks this month: Discussions with Libyan mayors on economic development activities and with Chad, Niger and Mali on how to reduce the number of migrants who want to leave those countries for Europe.
Lianping, chief financial economist at the Bank of Communications, said growth in industrial value added was expected to accelerate to 6.6 per cent in December, given the end-of-season uptick in both industrial value added in the first three quarters of 2017.
The cumulative growth in fixed asset investment is expected to be 7.2 per cent in December, flat from the previous month and down from last year.
Industrial production, though weaker than in October, was essentially flat from November.
In December, China's manufacturing investment was running low, but infrastructure investment improved slightly, so fixed asset investment is expected to be flat in November.

New Measures of "Dissolution of Colleges and Universities" in Beijing: Tens of thousands of teachers and students of North Chemical Industry will be admitted to the new campus in Changping
The opening ceremony of the new campus of Beijing Chemical University was held in Changping District of Beijing on February 2, and the green campus, covering 1,800 acres, was officially put into use.
The reporter learned from the ceremony that in order to strengthen the core functions of the capital and manage the "big city disease," in recent years, in the context of the coordinated development of Beijing, Tianjin and Hebei, and to relieve non-capital functions, Beijing has accelerated the decentralization of central urban colleges and universities to the suburbs, and teachers and students of some colleges and universities are moving to new suburban areas such as Shunyi, Daxing and Fangshan in batches.
Located in the town of Nankou, Changping, the new North Chemical Campus occupies 1,800 mu, 40 km from the city, and is one of the key projects in Beijing to unlock the functions of the non-capital city.
The construction of the new campus has been completed in three phases, and the second phase is expected to be fully launched by the end of this year, and the plan will meet the learning and living needs of nearly 20,000 undergraduates, graduate students and staff.
Looking back at this year's film market, we found that the original text of the film and the two fans of the stars became an important part of the movie's intended audience.
At 1710 hours today, the Shaoyang City Command Center 119 was alerted to a fire involving tetrahydrofurans stored at the Hongzhi Chemical Plant in Longshutang, in the city's Shuangqing district.
Shaoyang City Fire Brigade immediately dispatched 5 squadron 20 fire trucks to the scene with heavy protective clothing, anti-chemical washing vehicles and other equipment.
After preliminary investigation, the fire was started by small storage tanks storing chemicals such as tetrahydrofurans, which produced heavy smoke at the scene.
By the time the reporter sent his manuscript, fire officers and soldiers were in intensive rescue, and the municipal departments of public health, security, environmental protection, public security and transportation had rushed to the scene in succession, and no casualties had been found.
Michelle Carter sentenced for texting encouraging Conrad Roy to commit suicide
A Massachusetts woman has been sentenced to two-and-a-half years for encouraging her boyfriend to commit suicide via text messages and phone calls.
Michelle Carter, 20, will serve a 15-month sentence, which can be converted to probation, plus five years of probation.
Carter was sentenced in June to murder Conrad Roy, who killed himself on July 13, 2014, with or without intent and premeditated murder.
Roy's father said at Thursday's hearing: 'My family is heartbroken.
My son is my best friend."
While awaiting appeal, Carter was granted personal liberty.
She faces up to 20 years in prison, but her legal team believes both she and Mr. Roy are mentally ill.
At the sentencing, Carter stood, wearing red trousers and a beige blouse, his hands clasped, his eyes tearful and his eyes looking down.
"Her actions killed Conrad Roy," prosecutors told the court.
'She ended his life in order to live better for herself.
She did not take responsibility,"the prosecutor said.
'She doesn't have any remorse.'
But Carter's lawyer said it was "a terrible consequence and she feels very remorseful."
However, Judge Lawrence Moniz said he did not find her "age or maturity, or even her mental illness, to have any significant impact on her behaviour."
A prosecutor read a statement from Roy's mother, Lynn Roy, who said 'there's not a day that goes by that I don't grieve the loss of my beloved son.'
I want him to be proud of me and what I have done. I am trying to stand with his sisters in all my pain that will be with us forever,"the statement said.
Mr Roy's sister, Camdyn Roy, testified she was "in a trance" because she realised she would never be able to attend her brother's wedding or become an aunt to his children.
"It's a pain to lose someone who has been with me since I was born, and the rest of my life will be with that pain," she said.
The case appears to set a legal precedent, as Massachusetts law does not make it a crime to encourage others to commit suicide.
Roy was found dead of carbon monoxide poisoning in his car in 2014; that year, Carter was 17.
The case sparked national attention after Carter's text messages revealed she had encouraged him to commit suicide.
"There are many ways to hang, jump, stab yourself," she said in several text messages sent two weeks before his death, while he was on holiday with his family.
In the period before his suicide, she wrote,"You need to do this, Conrad," and "all you have to do is start the generator and then get free and happy."
Judge Moniz said Carter gained attention through Mr Roy's death and ordered her not to profit from the case through any media.
There are legal differences of opinion in this case.
One of the few people defending Carter, Amanda Knox, who was accused of murdering her British roommate in Italy in 2007, was acquitted two years later.
"Michelle Carter deserves sympathy and help, not imprisonment," Ms. Knox, 30, said in an op-ed published by the Los Angeles Times.
Zhang Yimou is destined to be a controversial film artist, and since he started filming his first film,"Red sorghum," he has reaped a lot of criticism while leading the Chinese film bandwagon.
Reporter 2 from the Lhasa Pure Land Basketball Club learned that recently, Lhasa Pure Land Basketball Youth Team in Beijing held the national youth basketball league final in the fourth place.
Lhasa Pure Land basketball youth team is composed of 11 local players, head coach for Lhasa Pure Land men's basketball adult team assistant coach Ji Ren Sanzhu.

Liang Junchao, general manager of the Lhasa Pure Land Basketball Club, told reporters that compared with last year, the team's achievements had improved, and the players' confidence and confidence in the game had improved markedly.
After the game, the team, Changjiang Tsui, said he hoped to build up experience by participating in the game and do his best for Tibet's basketball career.
It is understood the players overcame factors such as low altitude intoxication to project an image of Tibet during the match in Beijing.

Automakers face shock, Audi to refit up to 850,000 diesel cars
The announcement comes a day after BMW said it would provide software upgrades to more than 350,000 vehicles.
BMW's chairman said BMW believes "driving has more intelligent options than restrictions," meaning major European cities - including Munich, where BMW is headquartered - consider banning or restricting diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it would retrofit three million Mercedes cars in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions.
None of the companies claimed the move as a recall.
European automakers have aggressively promoted the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to help meet carbon dioxide emissions regulations.
But nitrogen oxides emitted by diesel engines are considered carcinogens and can cause asthma.
The cost of car companies installing equipment to offset diesel car exhaust emissions is also increasing, making it difficult to keep diesel cars competitive on price.
As German automakers face scrutiny, the government led by Chancellor Angela Merkel has also been accused of too laissez-faire with these powerful car companies and ignoring all signs of the problem.
The car companies are trying to avoid a repeat of Volkswagen's mistake of covering up its use of so-called defeat devices, adjusting emissions to meet regulations when cars are tested and returning to normal under normal driving conditions.
Multiple Volkswagen executives have been charged in the United States, while others are being investigated by countries on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former head of thermodynamics at Audi's engine development department was arrested in Germany.
Former manager Zachero Giovanni Palmio is Italian and therefore not protected from extradition and could face trial in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi was embroiled in a German criminal investigation involving Volkswagen, which the German government accused of installing systems to evade European emissions requirements, expanding an investigation previously limited to the United States.
Audi's investigation could have a major impact on Volkswagen: Luxury automakers account for a disproportionate share of Volkswagen's profits.
It is common for a film to take a year or two, or even a few years, from preparation to release.
The animated film "Big Fish Begonia" has been announced for release on July 8, 12 years from preparation to release.
"Big Fish Begonia" original author Liang Xuan, 21 years old from Tsinghua University thermal energy professional, and friends Zhang Chun founded the other side of the sky, in 2008, a million dollar venture capital, launched the animated film's first female "Big Fish Begonia."
The film has won many awards at home and abroad in the creative sample stage, and has been collected and praised as "one of the most outstanding works of art" by the Pompidou Centre for Contemporary Art in France.
The film has been dubbed the "pit of the gods" by millions of fans who are looking forward to its release, as it has taken six years from creativity to production.
"Big Fish Begonia" tells a fantasy story that belongs to the Chinese. With the release of the trailer, it brings a whole new look to the audience.
"It's only done this one thing in 12 years, and now it's gone from a dream to a reality, and I'm both nervous and excited," Liang said.
"The team is going to be driven crazy by me," says Zhang Chun,"always thinking about using 50% of someone's budget to make exactly the same picture as someone else."
Dongguan, a "world factory" that once relied on raw materials processing and a large number of popular workers, is setting its sights on the high level of talent that can lead the city to reposition itself.

Provence lavender threatened by climate change
Lavender has become a symbol of the city of Provence in southern France, but now there is bad news that it is being threatened by climate change.
Lavender is decaying due to persistent drought and the emergence of virus-carrying insects, causing headaches for scientists and farmers who are trying to find solutions.
"Lavender in Provence is facing a huge threat as the plant has been affected by climate change in recent years, with a significant reduction in spring rainfall and a steady drizzle in autumn," said Eric Chaisse, an expert at the Province-based Agricultural Research Institute (CRIEPPAM).
This can affect the life cycle of lavender.
There is also a smaller individual cicada, a leaf cicada that can spread tiny bacteria, which can appear in large numbers in very dry weather."
The key is its sheer volume.
In addition to the elegant lavender fields that can appeal to holidaymakers, lavender oil has been courted by the perfume and cosmetics industry.
"In contrast to plants that can have many large flowers and have long spikes, we have smaller individuals that are stunted, missing, or weak," says Eric Chase.
So we have less of "essential oil."
Solutions being studied include adopting better irrigation techniques and slowing the evaporation of soil moisture, spraying protective mixtures of clay and water on plants, and developing more drought-tolerant varieties.
In contrast to the sci-fi elements of the film, the two main actors said they were more attracted to the story in the film.
On the afternoon of September 5, a reporter from the Huaxi Metropolis newspaper interviewed a number of prominent people in the crosstalk world, as well as two performance artists, who, surprisingly, remained almost silent in unison.

Mexico is dangerous, journalists are killed
The entire staff of the weekly newspaper Riodoce typically rallied on Wednesday to review their plans for coverage of riots in Sinaloa state caused by criminal organizations, corrupt officials and an endless war on drugs.
But today, the shadow of tragedy hangs over themselves as they gather to discuss security.
They are told to change their daily habits, which is important.
Two senior journalists discussed what makes them feel safer: Whether to bring their children to the office, which was hit by a grenade attack in 2009, or leave them at home.
Security experts wrote three words on the blackboard in front of the room: Enemies, neutrals and allies.
They asked these journalists to name each column - without the need for evidence, observation and intuition enough.
There are suspected drug dealers, politicians, businessmen and journalists on government lists, or cartels, and this gang of villains makes reporting in Mexico dangerous.
The violence never stops and the country is littered with dead bodies, including a growing number of journalists: At least 25 journalists have died since President Enrique Peña Nieto took office in December 2012, according to records from the Committee to Protect Journalists; 589 journalists are under federal protection following attacks and threats; and at least seven journalists have died in seven states so far this year.
The last to die was their editor and inspiration, as well as Javier Valdez Cardenas, co-founder of Riodoce.
Valdez, who has written many books about drug violence, wrote this way in one of them: "The biggest mistake is living in Mexico and becoming a journalist."
Everyone was able to feel deeply that he had left, although he was everywhere - a huge photo hung on the facade of the Riodoce office building, with Valdez holding up his middle finger with the word "justice"; a T-shirt worn by two journalists in their 30s, Aaron Iwala and Miriam Ramirez, also showed him smiling, wearing glasses or his iconic Panamanian straw hat.
The seminar took place less than two months after his death; journalists rushed to discuss their shared trauma, nightmares, insomnia and paranoia.
Although a special federal prosecutor's office was set up in 2010 to handle journalists' cases, it prosecuted only two people, according to records from the Committee to Protect Journalists.
Most of the thousands of crimes committed each year involve drug trafficking and organized crime, so few perpetrators of journalist killings can be brought to justice.
In "Riodoce," they insisted on covering the violence in Sinaloa, though they were heartbroken, though the land was in tatters.
'There is no information about the killer, there is no justice, and there is not much use in holding security seminars,' Iwala said.
"It would be foolish to waste time attending a seminar like this," he said.
As long as we don't know why, you don't believe anyone.""
On the morning of May 15, Valdez left the office of Riodoce in Culiacan, the capital.
His red Toyota Carola was stopped just a few blocks away by two men; they forced him to get out of the car and fired 12 shots, guessing it was because of the newspaper's name - translated as The Twelve Rivers.
The gangster drove off in his car and crashed it nearby.
Valdez is 50 years old.
Leave behind his wife and two grown-up children.
The Culiacan rumors abound.
But on the topic of Valdez, there was actually nothing but silence.
Since Guzman was arrested last year and extradited to the United States in January, Sinaloa has become the bloodiest battleground in the country, with hostile forces fighting furiously.
The streets of Sinaloa state, where one or several people are shot every day, and cemeteries filled with the drug lord's ornate two-story mausoleum, have become commonplace.
Temporarily forgetting the state of "calm" is when only one cartel controls this seaside state and its ports and drug trafficking routes to the United States.
Even so, even if Valdez knew deeply about the dangers of the job, Ismail Bohoqui, the 60-year-old co-founder and director of Riodoce, was guilty of failing to protect his friend.
He believes two mistakes caused the tragedy.
First, an interview with Damaso Lopez, who leads a cartel group fighting several of Guzman's sons, was published in February.
The report may have angered the sons; the newspaper was bought out by suspected gang members as soon as it was sent to the newsstand.
The second mistake was not forcing Valdez to leave Mexico for his own safety after another newspaper reporting the same story was seized.
Valdez is a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his death is of great significance to Mexico's violence against journalists.
His spirit lives on and his friends and colleagues believe he has always been with us.
He was also a senior reporter for Noroeste in 2003, when he joined five colleagues to start Riodoce, selling a $50 stake.
In Sinaloa state,"pedaling journalism is impossible not to deal with the drug problem," Mr. Bohoqui said.
As time passed, the newspaper gained a good reputation for bold and honest reporting, and sales and advertising increased.
Journalists like to be able to publish hard-hitting investigative stories without fear of censorship, and readers like newspapers to publish stories that others are afraid to report.
"Riodoce" won the Latin American Maria Moscapo Prize for journalism five years after it was founded.
That same year, the Society for the Protection of Journalists awarded Valdez the International Press Freedom Award for his courage in pursuing the most authentic Mexican drug coverage.
He confessed that he was afraid, too.
At the time the Society for the Protection of Journalists awarded the award, he said "I want to keep living."
Later, in late October, he said in an interview on local television station Rompeviento TV that "drug trafficking is a way of life in Sinaloa state,
You have to take on the task that falls on your shoulders as a journalist - either so, or pretend to be deaf and mute.
I don't want to be asked "What have you done in the face of so many deaths... why don't you be vocal about what's going on?"
All the staff at Riodoce miss Valdez, cursing like a docker, the friend who never begrudges hugs and advice, the teacher who knows how to live.
They depend on his habits.
He used to wear that hat.
Often go to the El Guayabo bar opposite the office and always sit at the same table.
Now, they will ask: Was it his daily habits that caused his downfall?
His death also forced them to think about how to do a good job and live well.
'They don't like the fact that you're causing trouble for their women and children, or the fact that you're influencing their legitimate companies and the secret airports used to transport drugs,' Pohoqui said.
These are all over their bottom line.""
The result is to maintain a high level of self-censorship and self-protection even at the safest of times.
Trust your instincts.
If you smell danger, get away with it.
The problem, says Andreas Villarreal, editor of Riodoce, is that "breath is a feeling that will be cheated... and then something like Xavier happens."
He and others say the previous rules no longer apply to Sinaloa - just as they no longer apply to Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states, where smuggling routes are lucrative and agencies are weak, government officials corrupt and smoky.
The situation is constantly changing.
Cellphones were suddenly not allowed in rooms where Riodoce employees attended security training; a few days earlier, spyware allegedly sold only to the government had been used in Mexico to spy on journalists and activists.
Outside, two police officers took shelter from the 104-degree (40-degree Celsius) heat in the shade of a tree.
They were sent by the state government to protect the offices of the Riodoce, located in a four-storey building in the middle-class neighborhood of Culiacan.
Some reporters joked half-jokingly that they did not know if the police officers would be 50% of what the governor himself said they believed.
Journalists have been going to the mountains for months, where drug cartels are under the control of a physical presence.
This week's Riodoce featured three big things.
Among them was the killing of the brother of Sinaloa state great former boxer Julio Cesar Chavez,
And the disclosure of government funds in the governor's home state,
And the kidnapping inside an expensive restaurant in Culiacan, just a block from the prosecutor's office.
Officials do not release information about the subject and the process of kidnapping, so it is prudent to write down what the city knows: The restaurant is where drug dealers and officials love to go.
A journalist learned from the public archives that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician from the ruling PRI party, which dominated the political class almost throughout the previous period.
Recently, several PRI governors have been accused of corruption in several highly regarded cases.
Villarreal asked reporters to write about previous incidents at the site, including one in which a son of Guzman, Mexico's top drug lord, escaped a military attack.
If only a few months ago, readers would have looked at Valdez's column for the most powerful message about the kidnapping.
Villarreal, 46, who calls himself "skinny" because of his thin build, said that "before, we had known what was going on.
Now all of our sources of information communication channels have been pinched.
Valdez's office is now used to store signs and stickers protesting the killing of journalists as employees become what they never wanted to be: Activists representing the media.
The next morning reporter Miriam Ramirez casually grabbed a handful of logos and walked out of the room to the local prosecutor's office for a march associated with another reporter.
Salvador Adame disappeared in the western state of Michoacán three days after Valdez was killed.
Officials found a charred body and said it was his body, according to DNA tests.
Across the country, journalists have become more outspoken, organizing protests and painting sidewalks and buildings with the words "Save the Media."
On this day, director Bohokui was not in Washington, and he was trying to get justice for the Valdez case and garner international support.
The day after Valdez was killed, during a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa state, Ramirez accused officials of spying on journalists' information and killing them because they had told the truth.
Given that her anger has affected her objectivity, she has also asked to resign from her position covering government affairs.
Valdez has repeatedly reiterated that journalists in Mexico are "surrounded" by organized crime, complicit government officials and indifferent societies.
In his last book,"Drug Journalism," he wrote that journalists were not only mutilated by drug cartels, but were also on the list of politicians and security forces who were complicit in organized crime.
Media watchdog group Articulo 19 has blamed police and public officials for more than half of last year's attacks on journalists.
"In Mexico, they let you die just to shut you up," Ramirez said.
Obviously, these murders are chilling.
No one has forgotten that six years ago, blogger Maria Elizabeth Marcias died on the northern border of Tamaulipas.
Beside her body was a note allegedly signed by the Zetas cartel: "I came for my coverage."
Her head was cut off and a computer keyboard and headphones were placed next to her.
After Miroslava Brec was killed in March, some newspapers chose to close, such as El Norte newspaper on the northern border of Chihuahua state.
Others continued, with the 2014 killing of the director of El Manana of Nuevo Laredo, but they continued.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juarez opened up about the drug cartel with a front-page news story with the headline "What do you want from us?"
Part of the journalists fled their hometown, or even left the country.
This is a difficult choice.
It is difficult to find work in exile, and they still need to be careful and alert to danger on the streets.
Sometimes they would be arrested, reportedly after photographer Ruben Espinosa was killed with four women in a Mexican city in 2015, three months after fleeing Veracruz.
For those who stay behind the scenes to continue working, it's a daily dance step for high-risk decision-making.
Iwala, who had wanted to be a poet, admitted that reporting on the drug trade left him terrified.
He said "Mexico is turning into hell, so I became a journalist."
In the middle of the night on a recent Friday, the latest edition of the paper had gone to print, and the editors of The Riodoce were sitting in the aisle outside their offices drinking beer when, suddenly, their phones rang.
Nineteen people have been confirmed dead in a series of shootouts between gang hostile forces and security forces near the beach holiday city of Masatran.
The fighting is still escalating, as foreshadowed by a series of cartel messages found in the region.
They uploaded the news to the website Riodoce just by the side of the road via their mobile phones.
The next day's headlines had to be changed.
Sirens sounded nearby - and there was another shootout in the area of a life-or-death duel.
Bohoqui glanced at the police officers standing guard to see if they were alert.
If they have a little bit of fear, then they don't show it either.
The paper's founder has died in action, and on his large portrait, his middle finger points to where the entire Sinaloa state needs to look, with the entire staff of The Riodoce following in his footsteps.
"How can you even want to shut down? The same day Javier was killed, the intern asked me to send her down the street to participate in the coverage," Pohoqui said.
China's self-driving car tour to market size or break trillion yuan in 2020
[Abstract] In the broader context of rising consumption and the prevalence of free movement, self-driving travel is encouraged by national policies and is increasingly popular with consumers.
But at the same time, the self-driving market, which is expected to break through the trillion-dollar scale, faces a double challenge.
In the broader context of rising consumption and the prevalence of free movement, self-driving travel is encouraged by national policies and is increasingly popular with consumers.
But at the same time, the self-driving travel market, which is expected to break through the trillion scale, faces a double challenge: On the one hand, the development of the self-driving travel industry is not proportional to the market demand, and self-driving tour organizers, such as self-driving clubs and travel agencies, face the dilemma of meagre profits; on the other hand, the infrastructure and services that self-driving travel faces are still in their infancy.
Accounting for 60% of the total number of domestic trips, the market is expected to break trillion yuan
In 2016, 4.44 billion domestic trips were made, accounting for about 60 percent of the total, and the market for self-driving trips is expected to surpass the trillion mark by 2020.
According to the statistics of the China Association of Travel Vehicles and Boats on the number of self-driving excursions, the number of excursions has continued to increase in the past five years, and the proportion of excursions in the number of domestic tourists has remained stable at more than half.
At the same time, more attention and support has been shown at the regional and national levels for the emerging field of self-driving travel, with policies and regulations related to self-driving cars, journeymen and camping tours intensive from 2016 to 2017.
In July 2017, eight departments, including the National Tourism Administration and the National Sports Administration, jointly issued the Development Plan for Auto Self-Driving Camp; in the same month, self-driving tours were highlighted in the Action Plan for Promoting Quality Upgrading in Rural Tourism Development (2017), jointly issued by 14 departments, including the National Development and Reform Commission and the Ministry of Finance.
The introduction of the policy provides opportunities and policy guidance for the development of domestic self-driving tourism.
Self-driving travel club profit is meager, complete industrial chain is the key
Although the domestic self-driving tourism market potential is huge, the national policy actively guides, but the self-driving tourism industry is still in its infancy.
While there are thousands of self-driving clubs, car clubs and car clubs in China, the proportion of self-driving travel arrangements by tourists accounts for the majority, with only about 15 per cent of visitors participating in various institutions, such as car clubs and self-driving clubs, according to the Annual Development Report on China's Self-Driving Tours 2016-2017.
At the same time, online travel companies and traditional travel agencies that independently develop self-driving travel products are few and far between. Many online travel platforms sell only self-driving travel products from some suppliers, and some self-driving clubs are also important suppliers.
From the organization of self-driving activities, covering "eat, live, travel, travel, purchase, entertainment," a high degree of fragmentation, the upstream supply chain heavy, tourists consumption randomness.
Li Guanjie, founder and CEO of the Beijing Automobile Club, believes that self-driving travel clubs are essentially similar to travel agencies, and that the early main profit model was based on offline activities, with the core point being self-driving line products and team leader services.
But now the homogenization of line products in the field of self-driving travel is serious, the service level of the leading team is uneven, self-driving clubs are facing the need to transform again.
It can be seen that self-driving tour itself is not an independent industry, but with its displacement characteristics formed a cross-regional, industry ecological circle, forming a complete industrial chain is very important.
Experts point out that, in addition to basic tourism consumption, experience is a more important consumer element.
Therefore, for the development of the self-driving travel industry, we should enhance the experience features, develop the theme of "self-driving travel +" and the IP of self-driving travel products.
Scenic roads are not just roads, car camps should not just cater for food and accommodation
Faced with the rise of self-driving tour, the basic supporting development of self-driving tour is also relatively junior.
Li pointed out that the tourist scenic route is not just a road, but needs to integrate the elements of traffic and tourism, but the road repair and tourism itself are the responsibility of the two departments, the transport sector added tourism elements, also stay in the construction of toilets, counselling centres, publicity bars and other facilities, and tourism integration is not high.
Compared with the well-known self-driving route "US Route 66," the construction experience is worth drawing lessons from.
The scenic route design is no longer the most direct and fast route from place of origin to destination, but follows the design concept of "experience driving fun" to provide self-driving tourists with the best enjoyment of the beautiful scenery along the road; the scenic route can link point and face tourism landscapes, preserve the historical and cultural value of ecotourism resources along the route, and organize various thematic activities to enhance the participation and recreation experience of tourists and create economic benefits for the local tourism industry.
In addition to the scenic route, the camp is also an important companion facility for self-driving trips.
But the number of self-driving tourists who choose to stay in the camp is not high among the new Peking News journalists.
In their view, many camps are oriented towards infrastructure and can only meet the need for food and shelter, low grades and a single product that does not meet the many elements of self-driving travel.
Industry insiders, who did not want to be named, said many of the businesses that did camp in previous years were to take the land, after which the late-stage supporting infrastructure construction and services did not keep up, and operating conditions were much of a loss, without a late-stage infusion of funds, it was difficult to do some matching products.
Consumer group
According to data released by the China Travel Vehicle and Ship Association in 2017, the age group of self-driving tourists is concentrated in the 21-40 age group, especially in the 31-40 age group, which has a certain economic base and a higher demand for personalised tourism, with more parent-child visitors.
According to the accommodation survey, the self-driving people prefer the non-standard accommodation.
In terms of the type of self-driving, peripheral self-driving is the most important type of self-driving, accounting for 84.32%.
Driving out of the country is the aspiration of many people, but the proportion is still smaller.
At the same time, with the rise of consumer demand, visitors who used to like self-driving "tourist attractions" began to change their minds, no longer "get out of the car to take pictures, get in the car to sleep" during self-driving trips, but to pay more attention to the experience and process of travel.
Dinosaurs used camouflage to evade enemies
At first glance, it's scary, but it looks like a statue.
Researchers have released the first study of a rhino-sized, incredible fossil of a creature discovered by Canadian miners, noting that the fossil is well preserved, so experts have dubbed it the "Mona Lisa of the dinosaur world."
The fossil was so well preserved that it could even be concluded that its scaly skin was reddish-brown, suggesting that it had had some "troubled experiences."
Related reports in the journal Current Biology described it as "the most well-preserved armored dinosaur ever discovered and one of the best dinosaur specimens in the world."
The fossil is a newly discovered species of nodular dragon that lived between 110 million and 112 million years ago in the mid-Cretaceous period.
Its extremely well-preserved state shocked researchers, who described it as "truly stunning."
The herbivorous Beatles dinosaur fossil is the most well-preserved dinosaur fossil of its kind ever found, National Geographic reported.
Shawn Funk discovered the fossil while digging at the Suncor Jubilee mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada, March 21, 2011.
At the time, he came across something that seemed different from the rocks around him, so he decided to take a closer look.
After that, the fossils he found were sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology in Canada.
It took researchers six years to make the beast, which was hidden inside a 2,500-pound (1,100kg) piece of earth, come to life.
After all this hard work, the final result has only now been announced.
"If you look at it, you almost believe it's sleeping," said Caleb Brown, a scientist and first author at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature is displayed.
'It's going to be one of the most beautiful and well-preserved dinosaur specimens in the history of science - the Mona Lisa in the dinosaur world.'
By studying its skin, the researchers found that the herbivorous creature, while wearing armour like a walking tank, was at risk of a major threat from carnivorous dinosaurs.
The heavily armored dinosaur used red and white camouflage to evade predators and a covert technique known as "anti-shade," a technique also used by many modern animals.
In this way, experts say, it is better able to blend in with its surroundings, thus avoiding enemies, suggesting it was preyed upon by larger dinosaurs.
The 110million-year-old creature, which belongs to the nodule dragon family, first made headlines in May and is currently on display at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Ancient Biology.
After Mark Mitchell, a museum technician who was part of the team, took 7,000 hours to meticulously unveil the behemoth, researchers now study it and name it "Borealopelta markmitchelli."
The samples were extremely well preserved, allowing Dr Mitchell, as well as the international team of scientists, to record the patterns and shapes of scales and armor on their bodies.
They found "anti-shade," a common form of defense in the animal kingdom, which means the creature's back is darker than the color on its side.
Although "anti-shading" is common, the findings are surprising because the dinosaur was much larger than the existing animals that used anti-shading.
The dinosaur faced pressure to be hunted by flesh-eating dinosaurs and thus evolved in a favorable direction, allowing it to hide in opposition as a means of survival.
But most of the existing anti-shade animals, such as deer, zebra or armadillo, are as small and vulnerable as prey, suggesting that the creature is under real pressure to survive.
"The frenzied predation of large heavy armour dinosaurs shows how dangerous the Cretaceous carnivorous dinosaurs were," Brown said.
Chemical analysis of organic compounds in its scales also showed that the dinosaur's skin color was reddish-brown.
Scientists are continuing to study the creature's life clues, including its retained stomach contents, to find the last food to eat.
They believe the dinosaurs fell into the river at the time of their death and were then swept into the sea before finally sinking to the bottom of the sea with their backs down.
At the time, the climate in Alberta was as warm as it is in southern Florida today, and rivers and oceans may be deeper inland than they are now.
"This nodular dragon is truly breathtaking because it is completely covered in preserved scaly skin and, to this day, preserved in dimensional space, thus allowing its original shape to be preserved," Brown said.
So the creature is now almost the same shape as it was during the Cretaceous.
You don't have to rebuild it with too much imagination; if you look at it, you almost believe it's sleeping."
The Cretaceous period was a time when large, bipedal orca dinosaurs roamed the Earth.
Although Tyrannosaurus rex was the king of dinosaurs, it emerged millions of years after the Beatles, which may have been killed by some of the Tyrannosaurus's ancestors.
They include high-thorn dragons, a behemoth weighing up to six tons and measuring 38 feet (11.5 meters) long.
Scientists whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology believe the nodular dragon was washed out to sea after its death, after which mummies formed in the dirt.
Sean Fink excavates the creature at the Jubilee Mine near Fort McMurray, Alberta, Canada, March 21, 2011.
According to the museum, it is the most well-preserved armored dinosaur in the world, complete with skin and armour in areas from the nose to the hips.
The creature is on average about 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighs 3,000 pounds (1,300 kilograms).
It has two 20-inch long, pointed horns protruding from the shoulder.
Researchers believe the herbivorous manicured dinosaur was active in what is now western Canada before being swept into the sea by rivers that burst into floodwaters.
However, the dinosaur was buried on the bottom of the sea, allowing its mantle to be preserved in its entirety.
The fossilized remains of this particular sample are perfectly preserved, leaving the remaining skin still covered with the bumpy crustacean on the dinosaur's skull.
As Michael Greshko wrote in the journal National Geographic, this level of preservation is as rare as winning a lottery.
The more I look at it, the more I find it unbelievable.
The remaining skin fossils are still covered in mottled armour on the dinosaur's skull.
Its front right palm is located on its side, and five toes are spread upward.
I can count the "armour."
The reporter learned that adding natural or plant source alginate, humic acid and amino acid efficiency carriers to urea production process can improve the efficiency of traditional urea, resulting in the utilization of urea, zinc humic acid urea and cereals urea nitrogen by 5 to 10 percentage points compared with common urea.
Environmentally friendly, crop yield potential is obvious, especially large particle value added urea is the high quality raw material of BB fertilizer.
The total number of security personnel is double that of the 2012 London Olympics.
To ensure the safety of the Rio Olympics, Brazil will launch the largest-ever security linkage programme.
Previously, the Brazilian government said a total of 85,000 people from the army and police would work together, including 20,000 troops and 65,000 police.
Most of the military will be responsible for defending Olympic venues, while the additional 3,000 troops will be responsible for security at international airports, subway stations and streets.
Police, in turn, patrol other parts of the city, including subways, buses and streets.
It is reported that 6,000 military personnel have arrived in Rio for the Olympic security services.
In addition to being in charge of the four major racing areas of the Rio Olympics, they are also responsible for patrolling the airport as well as the main roads connecting the airport and Olympic venues.
The introduction of evaluation mechanisms in the service sector is no longer new. To make evaluation mechanisms effective, it is important to make regulation more effective and non-formalistic.
How do radicals learn to answer the question: "Whose streets?"
Brittany Ferrell's inner turmoil on August 9, 2014.
On the first day of his trip to New York City, the St. Louis native sat in a rented bed in Epiphany, browsing Facebook on his phone.
She stumbled across a post from a high school student.
It read 'Police just killed an 18-year-old and the child was still lying in the street'.
She was puzzled to find that no one else on the feed had posted the message. She shut down Facebook and opened the tweet.
One @ TheePharoah user kept pushing her dynamic Times.
The St. Louis-area rapper's live Twitter feed broadcast the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old black man who was killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri.
He posted a picture of Brown's lifeless body lying on the street, where his body lay for four hours.
"Crazy," Ferrell thought.
But death is nothing new for her and her community.
She put down her phone and didn't turn on the tweet again until that evening, reading tweets about the crowd gathering on Canfield Avenue.
There were police videos and pictures of people shouting, and a picture of a man claiming to be Brown's father with the caption: "Ferguson police just killed my unarmed son!"
She saw a live feed and a police officer standing in front of a group of protesters with a barking dog.
In another video, another officer raises his rifle and screams,"I will kill all of you... brutes," she said.
"It wasn't normal," Ferrell said as he recalled.
"It's not something we're used to and can call a typical murder." "
At that moment, I felt a shudder.
I was so angry, I cried with anger."
She booked a return flight and went home the next day.
After landing at 11pm, she picked up her six-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided the pair would head to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson over the next three years is the subject of a new documentary,"Whose Streets?," which hits theaters August 11.
It's a story about survival and protest, love and loss, strength and tenacity from the perspective of the people who live in this community and fill the streets demanding answers.
As Ferrell drove to Ferguson with her daughter (wearing a floral skirt and crowned accessories), the pair revisited a topic they had discussed countless times before that morning - "about black experiences and the state of black people."
"Do you remember when I taught you when black people had to fight for their beliefs?" She recalled.
'We're going to Ferguson now because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and that's not right.
I had to take her,"Ferrell said later.
'What happened today is the culmination of everything that's happened in the past...
She wants to know, see and rise from this.
Not only does she need to develop well in radicalism and organization, but she needs to understand the different dimensions of the black experience and the black situation and understand what we have to do to be free and liberated.
Even if I had the privilege of providing her with a racist experience she had not experienced firsthand, she was no different from other black girls.
If I protect her in this matter, I feel like I'm hurting her.""
They arrived at Ferguson's first stop at a site opposite the South Florissant Road police station, which became their camp when the militants waited until police officer Darren Wilson finally failed to prosecute.
Ferrell and her daughter got in touch with a local business owner who made a bag lunch.
They prepared the bags and were responsible for passing them on to the protesters.
Slowly, Ferrell began to form a new type of activism.
"My radicalism changed completely after August 9," she said, as an undergraduate at Missouri State University in St. Louis, where she was president of the Minority Nurses Association and focused on food justice and health disparities in the black community.
'I don't have organizational experience.
That's how it all came to be.""
A few weeks later, Ferrell met with the film's co-director Sabah Faleyan during a nightly parade.
Fleyan said she and her director of photography, Lucas Alvarado Faller,"just wanted to record" what happened.
A question came to Ferrer's mind: "Do you want to record or do you want to find a story that you can exploit?"
The suspicion stems from many of these cases: People - usually white people - enter a community to benefit from its pain and tenacity.
As Fleyan explained in a recent interview,"We've heard that people who are native to Ferguson don't focus their voices, and we want to do it in a different way."
Foleyan has been linked to co-director Dimon Davis, a regional artist known for his radicalism against dead prisoners.
His involvement led Ferrell, along with six other locals, to join the "Whose Streets?" Project team, which remained intact for several years after Brown's shooting.
"This documentary is not about someone speaking for us or talking to us, this is our statement," Davis said.
'I mainly focus on how these characters are presented, because that's how I'm presented as well.'
Although the goal is not to focus on Ferrell's experience - but to show that the movement is "not about the savior leader, but about community cohesion," Fleyan said - it turns out she is the most open of the film's participants.
As a result,"Whose Streets?" Surprisingly chronicles Ferrell's personal life, such as falling in love and stepping into marriage.
"I felt naked," Ferrell laughed when he first saw the finished product.
"But I understand that there has to be a degree of vulnerability to doing this work and humanizing black people." "
In addition, Ferrell's story reaffirms and repositions the role of black Cool Woman in the broader Black Lives Matter movement.
Two of the movement's three founders - who created # BlackLivesMatter on social media after the 2012 shooting of black teenager Trevor Martin - have been identified as cool.
"Black cool women in leadership have supported this movement in general," Ferrer said,"and that's because we keep fighting on multiple fronts.
Black cool women have to live with this."
Fleyan agreed and mentioned that "the movement really has the support of black women and a lot of black cool women."
Because of her identity, Ferrell was chosen to be at the heart of the film. However, she insisted that "this is not an affirmative action for things."
"She's the one who inspires that energy," she said.
"Although she's on the front line, it's no coincidence, because in life at these crossroads, as a black cool woman, you have a lot to do.
Through the screen, you can feel her energy."
Meanwhile, in Ferguson, news cameras have long since disappeared, but tensions between the community and the police over race persist.
Ferrell was sentenced to more than two-and-a-half years of probation for trying to block the highway during a march.
She described the socio-political atmosphere in the area she calls home: "A mess."
Still, since taking to the streets of Ferguson three years ago, she has stuck to the hymn she has struggled to remember.
'We have a responsibility to fight for freedom.
We have a responsibility to win.
We must love each other and support each other.
We have nothing to lose but the shackles on our bodies."
In fact, online translation services were already available on the Internet a decade ago, and the argument that "machines are about to replace humans for translation" was heard long ago.
Similarities: Artist creates portrait using Chelsea Manning's DNA
There are multiple faces in the middle of the pavilion at the Friedman Gallery in New York: White, black and brown, each with an almost imperceptible resemblance, tied by a wire rope hanging from the ceiling.
The 30 portraits were created by artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg using cheek cotton swabs and hair scraps sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent hair scraps from Livingsburg prison, where the former intelligence analyst was sentenced to 35 years in prison for leaking classified diplomatic cables through the WikiLeaks website.
The exhibition opens on August 2 with the title "Similar."
It was the culmination of two years of correspondence between Dewey Hagenburg and Manning, who combined her discipline with her own in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a prominent dissident who had been in prison and completed sex reassignment surgery in prison, and former U.S. President Barack Obama pardoned her remaining sentence three days before the end of her term.
By analyzing the algorithm from Manning's DNA, and thus creating 30 portraits of "likely appearances," Heather Dewey Harbaugh makes a scathing and slightly callous comment, both about the versatility of DNA and about the very concept of identity.
Manning, who was born Bradley Edward and has publicly admitted to thinking of herself as a woman during her adolescence, was convicted in 2013 on 20 charges, including six espionage law violations, computer fraud and theft.
While in prison, her image was subdued, with only one photo, a grainy black-and-white selfie, looking visibly upset, sitting in the driver's seat and wearing a platinum-coloured wig.
In 2015, Heather Dewey Harbaugh had a huge success with her 2012 project Stranger Visions.
In that piece, she used DNA extracted from scraps from cigarette butts and chewing gum medium court exhibits to create 3-D portraits of human beings that might resemble looks.
That's when she just happened to receive an email from Paper magazine.
"They want to interview Chelsea Manning in prison and need a portrait photo," Heather Dewey Harbaugh told the media at the opening of the exhibition.
Chelsea Manning couldn't visit or take photos at the time, so they contacted Chelsea to ask if she was interested in making a DNA portrait.
So the artist and her jailed muse became Ben's unlikely pen pals, exchanging numerous letters with each other over the course of two years.
They even created a comic book,"The repressed Head," by Shoili Kanungo, which envisaged that the president would grant Manning privileges in the future and that she would be able to see the exhibition in prison.
Obama asked for her release just days after the book was published, perhaps by coincidence, when Manning was in her seventh year in a Kansas military prison.
In addition, there is another layer of deep meaning to this exhibition, which is about bridging the divide as contemporary America, where the Trump administration keeps declaring war on government leaks and transgender military personnel while searching for new ways that can be hyped on Twitter to stoke division outright.
When asked about all this special timing, Heather Dewey Harbaugh said there was "a reason for anything to happen."
In an artist's statement written on the gallery wall, Manning's oversized signature is below (the name "i" is painted with a heart), calling for an end to the "chaotic images of partisanship based on gender, sexual orientation and culture."
On the opposite wall is her mitochondrial DNA sequence, written in pencil twisting curvature with symbols of Cs, Gs and As.
By containing 200 letters (or nucleotides, each artist's complex scientific dictionary), Heather Dewey Harbaugh hopes to express, at least physiologically, that everyone is, by portraying these strangely similar portraits.
"I hope people get out of this, that our genome doesn't care who we are, how publicly available genetic data is interpreted, how subjective it is," said Heather Dewey Harbaugh, whose 2007 video work,"False Memory," is also on display.
'DNA data can tell us a lot of different stories, so this is 30 of them.'
The last work in the exhibition, in a room, comes from a page in the previously illustrated middle story.
Showcasing the pompous, King Gang-styled Manning beneath an American soldier holding a megaphone.
"When they make your speech stop, they win," Wall wrote.
"So, don't shut up."
"The content comes directly from a letter she wrote to me," said the artist, who is from Philadelphia.
"I'm just scared again, I'm still going to say it."
Manning hasn't seen the exhibition in person, as foreseen in the comics, but when she does, she will be masked by her own DNA portrait, like a group of protesters getting cheers in the center of the pavilion.
It was also purposeful, reaching, as with all the items in the exhibition, the height of the genetic single-fold group information she had written in pencil (5.2 feet, Manning's height).
"In the past, I hung them on the wall, but I wanted them to feel like a bunch of people," Dewey Hagenburg said of the portrait.
"But I wanted them to feel like a bunch of protesters following Chelsea, just as people were protesting at the time to release her."
Northwestern University professor and Oxford University employee wanted in homicide case
A Northwestern University professor and an Oxford University employee were subsequently wanted after a man was found fatally stabbed inside a luxury Chicago apartment and a nationwide search is underway for a suspect, police said.
Cook County Court records show that on Monday, Wyndham Lytham, 42, and Andrew Warren, 56, were issued first-degree no-bail murder warrants in connection with the death of Trenton H James Cornell Duranlow.
Cornell Duranello, 26, died from multiple stab wounds, according to documents.
A community alert issued by the Chicago Police Department said the body was found on July 27.
Police arrived at the Grand Plaza apartment after receiving the call and found the victim with multiple lacerations.
Cornell Duranello died instantly and detectives are investigating the killing, while police are actively looking for two suspects, police said.
Lytham has been an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
In an emailed statement, Deputy Director of Campus Relations Aaron K. Kauberge said Lytham has now been removed from his post and has been banned from Northwestern University's campus.
"Now this is a criminal case, the relevant authorities are investigating and Northwestern is actively cooperating with the investigation," Mr Kaubech said.
Warren is a senior finance assistant at Oxford University.
"We have been in contact with British police and stand ready to assist US investigative agencies as needed," a spokesman for Somerville College, Oxford, said in an emailed statement.
Warren's colleagues were deeply shocked and hoped he would turn himself in, the statement added.
Chicago Police Department Chief Liaison Officer Anthony Guglielmi expressed strong encouragement for the suspect to turn himself in to authorities.
Mr Guglielmi said "the police have had a rough idea of their whereabouts and we are trying to locate the possible location."
Mr Guglielmi said local, regional and national authorities were fully assisting in the search for the suspect.
Mr Guglielmi said police received a call from the manager of the Grand Plaza apartment, who had just received a secret tip that something had happened to apartment 1008.
Police described the situation as horrific at the time.
Mr Guglielmi said it was still unclear whether the incident also happened on July 27.
He said, according to security cameras, it was confirmed that Lytham and Warren were in the building at the time.
"We believe Professor Lytham had something to do with the victim," Guglielmi said.
Issuing a statement to residents, Grand Plaza's management team said: "Police are currently looking at the timeline of the victim's case and the circumstances of the case and are investigating various motives, including a possible domestic incident."
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mutko says "we will complete the World Anti-Doping Agency Roadmap in the near future"
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said it would not take too long to implement the remaining World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) standards aimed at restoring the rights of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA).
"The implementation of the road map standards has reached a stage where RUSADA has been granted the right to work with UKAD (UK Anti-Doping Agency) on planning and testing," it said.
The WADA road map has been updated in this regard,"Mutko said on Thursday.
Deputy Prime Minister Mutko made the remarks while commenting on the second part of the World Anti-Doping Agency's road map, Compliance, which sets out the criteria for the restoration of RUSADA rights and was recently posted on the organization's website.
According to Mutko, the criteria do not contain anything that could cause concern to Russia.
He added,"Everything has to be announced and everything will be implemented.
And the results will be presented to the IOC [IOC] and WADA in the near future."
One of the criteria mentioned in the list, however, is that Russia's anti-doping agency must publicly accept the findings of a WADA-approved investigation into Russian state support for doping in its own sport by Canadian lawyer Richard McKellen.
Speaking about the matter, Mutko said: "We are investigating and our anti-doping system has undoubtedly failed.
All measures have been implemented.
But there's no national plan behind that, and we're not going to acknowledge something that doesn't exist.""
Mutko's words echoed those of Vitaly Smirnov, head of Russia's independent public anti-doping commission.
Smirnoff acknowledged problems with the Russian anti-doping agency in the past during a visit to media outlet Russianoutlet RSport earlier in the day, but added: "We have said on various occasions that the report contains controversial positions and regulations.
No one plans to accept the report unconditionally,"Smirnoff said.
After the doping scandal in November 2015, WADA suspended RUSADA's right to carry out doping inspections inside Russia.
But in June, RUSADA was allowed to plan and coordinate testing this year under the supervision of international experts and UKAD.
During a visit to the group's headquarters in Moscow in July, WADA Director General Olivia Negri said RUSADA was "moving in the right direction" in an effort to restore its rights.

No more need to find a surrogate! Zero tariffs on more than 8000 products
At a regular press conference held by the Ministry of Commerce on January 11, peak press spokesman of the Ministry of Commerce said that as of now, China has 15 FTAs in force, involving 23 countries and regions, covering more than 8,000 imports with zero tariffs.
At the same time, import cosmetics, Icelandic salmon, Chilean red wine, ASEAN tropical fruit... You don't have to pay a big price for these products.
At present, China has signed 16 free trade agreements with 24 countries and regions, and 15 have entered into force, covering more than 8,000 zero-tariff imports.
In the case of agricultural products, with the implementation of the FTA, consumers can taste agricultural products from different places of origin, high quality and low prices all year round.
For example, in ASEAN, tropical fruits such as durian, lychee and fiery dragon fruit, import tariffs were reduced from 15 to 30 per cent to zero.
The import tariff for salmon in Iceland has been reduced from 10 to 12 per cent to zero;
Red wine in Georgia and Chile, with import tariffs reduced from 14 to 30 per cent to zero;
In addition, New Zealand beef and milk powder and other characteristics of agricultural products, such as a substantial tax reduction.
In the case of industrial goods, for example, import tariffs on some cosmetics in Switzerland have been reduced to zero;
Import tariffs on some watches have been reduced by 50 per cent and will be reduced to zero in a few years;
South Korea's import tariffs on products such as refrigerators, rice cookers, massages, beauty paraphernalia have been reduced by 40 per cent and will be reduced to zero tariffs in a few years;
There are also consumer electronics, such as a relatively large tax reduction.
At the same time, the zero-tariff products under the free trade zone also include intermediate products and raw materials needed for the manufacture of many domestic terminal consumer goods, and to some extent promote the structural upgrading of domestic consumer goods.
A spokesman for the Ministry of Commerce said nearly a third of China's total imports could be treated with preferential tariffs under the FTA, most of which are end consumer goods, bringing tangible benefits to consumers.
Further reduction of import tariffs on consumer goods
Since December 1, 2017, China has adjusted import duties on some consumer goods, further reducing import duties on consumer goods, covering such consumer goods as food, health care products, pharmaceuticals, daily chemical products, clothing, shoes and hats, household equipment, cultural entertainment and sundry goods, involving 187 8-bit tariff numbers.
The average tax rate on this batch of consumer goods will fall from 17.3 per cent to 7.7 per cent, almost "stopped and beheaded"!
From January 1, 2018, our country has also made partial adjustments to other import and export tariffs.
Import duties on some cosmetics, such as lip balm, eye shadow and perfume, were reduced from 10 per cent to 5 per cent;
Lower tariffs mean that consumers don't have to buy on their behalf, much less travel abroad to buy their favorite foreign products.
Yiwu Imports Shopping Festival 2018: Imported red wine, snacks, fruit... all cheap!
Foreign REPORT: Year-end U.S. mall rules big difference shopping returns need to be cautious
China New Network (CNN) December 29
Just after Christmas, there was a wave of returns, according to the US daily Le Monde.
About half of the items sold on Christmas Day last year were returned, according to the ABC.
In addition, a number of readers have been tricked online shopping, consumers in the informal site shopping need to pay more attention.
In general, large shopping companies have formal, reasonable return procedures, but care must be taken when buying gifts or electricity from small shops.
Ms Hou, of Roland Gang, bought a coat for more than 60 yuan (US $, same) at an online shop selling printed coats on December 1, local time, and has not yet sent it.
She emailed the customer service and did not reply.
Another netizen, last year to travel to the United States, a third party seller to buy a mobile phone, sent to find that it is a box of rubber mud.
When you know you've been cheated, apply to the website for a refund, and you're lucky to get a full refund.
But there are also customers who believe the website refund service is not 100 per cent perfect.
Mr. Wang, a Chinese resident of Northern California, said he had twice bought an emergency distribution service for a site, once for four dollars, but twice failed to deliver it on time.
A refund was then applied for, and no response was received.
Large shopping malls or shopping malls have a better return policy.
Macy's refunded most of its goods in full within 180 days.
However, the goods must remain in their "original" appearance and must be supported by purchase documents such as receipts or bank purchase records.
Without vouchers, customers can also get mall points, which can be used to buy other goods.
Target typically has a 90-day return period for general merchandise and 15 days for electronics.
But the return period for electronic, recreational goods purchased between November 1 and December 25, 2017 was extended to 30 days.
It should be noted that the 30-day refund period starts on December 25, which is to return the goods by January 25, 2018.
Extreme shopping experience, the advent of a new era of shopping development in business circles
More than a decade ago, China was still in the seller's market in general, people's choice is limited and demand is limited.
But after a decade of development, the market has already achieved a shift from a seller's market to a buyer's market, and now consumer tastes have become more tricky, and they are no longer content with the simple act of "one-handed delivery."
Therefore, how to let the consumer get an extreme shopping experience is the next competition point for real estate developers.
And among the many factors that affect the consumer shopping experience, the shopping center in the business circle has the most significant impact.
See how city builders everywhere focus on the shopping experience.
There are no two exactly the same leaves in the world, much less two exactly the same shopping centres, a famous shopping centre must have its own characteristics.
For example, Turkey's world-famous Kanyon shopping centre, with its unique wavy architectural design inspired by the Grand Canyon, has walked the 200-metre walkway in Kanyon as if it were inside the Grand Canyon.
In addition to the canyon design, in the center of the shopping center there is also a concave large oval performance venue, unique shape, often featuring performances.
Because of the open platform design, visitors walk on each floor to look down at the activities carried out in the "canyon" and have the effect of shifting and changing scenery.
At home, Nanjing Forest Moor Commercial Street, known as China's first forested stroll, combines shopping with ecology and fairy tales.
The project consists of nine single buildings, each connected by an air corridor, the whole sunken courtyard design, the French sycamore tree above the earth as the building epidermis, and the roof water terrace, creating a forest feel.
Walking into the forest mole is like accidentally falling into a rabbit hole in Alice's wanderings, climbing along a tree trunk to surround the building, the meadows, clear springs, and bring people into a vibrant and vibrant forest.
Also in Chongqing, Longhu built the Raijiabin Water Business Circle, planning a hundred businesses, plans to introduce more than 50 international flagship stores, more than 100 international top brands and more than 500 domestic and foreign famous brands in the future, to create a service industry agglomeration, the theme of the distinctive business center.
Not only that, but it also integrates ecology into architecture and TOD public transport, integrating fashion shopping, life services, catering, entertainment, education and sports, bringing consumers the ultimate shopping experience while also leading them to enjoy Chongqing's unique "waterfront culture," integrating shopping with water entertainment and leisure.
It can be found that, at present, a number of housing companies have insight into the discovery trajectory of this new urban business, and industry insiders say that this consumer experience-centric, how to combine shopping with experience consumption patterns will also be the mainstream of future urban development.
Now the business circle is not only the distribution of goods, but also the integration of arts, culture, creative themes, and people's responsibility for urban living.
Therefore, in order to meet the demand of consumers to buy one-stop-shop materials, it is necessary to maximize the transfer of cultural and artistic multi-level spiritual needs and bring into full play the livable demand for residence.
In Chongqing, the north bank of Guoxing Jiangshan, located in the north of the river, near Guanyin Bridge, a collection of world business elite, international giants around the world, first-class brands gathered, and international fashion close to the interface.
Here is a luxuriant walk, gathering the essence of the world;
Dongyuan Jinyue has a good shopping environment, Dongyuan Jinyue near the Nanping Business Circle, exclusive access to the West and even the country's leading four-storey three-dimensional transportation system, enhanced shopping comfort.
In addition, the landscaping and landscaping floors of Huisheng Road and Wanda Square have been upgraded, with about 300 trees planted and 40,000 square meters reconstructed to enhance the image of Nanping Business Circle;
Longhu Yu Lake One, near Chongqing's first low-density waterfront business circle, is surrounded by nine parks, with a low density and high degree of openness, making people more willing to stay, stop and enjoy shopping, rather than being hustled forward by the flow of people behind, and really "walking shopping."
Today's business competition will only become more and more intense, how to kill a blood road in the homogenization of the serious market, the future consumers of the "shopping mecca" reputation, worthy of all real estate developers to seriously consider.
It is far from enough to rely solely on differentiation strategies, and only developers who truly put consumers in their hearts, anxious consumers, want consumers to think, to provide consumers with the ultimate and minimalist shopping experience can laugh in the stormy market.
Of course, at the end of the day, I think the most happy people in Chongqing, with such a good shopping experience and business circle, 10 years ago no one could imagine today's prosperity.
Festival of Things: Consumerist revelry masks real environmental prices
168.2 billion yuan, the amount of turnover consumed by Skycat users within 24 hours of the "Skycat Double XI Global Carnival" on Nov 11, 2017.
Specifically, after the start of "Double 11," in just three minutes, Skycat turnover exceeded 10 billion yuan, more than 20 billion yuan in 6 minutes and 05 seconds, and 100 billion yuan in 9 hours.
On that day, the total number of payments made by consumers across the globe through Alipay reached 1.48 billion, up 41 percent from last year.
These consumption will bring in 812 million logistics orders.
And whether Skycat net purchase platform or Alipay platform, all belong to Ma Yun's Ali Group.
Ten years ago, no one would have thought that the "Hanukkah" subculture created by young singles out of self-deprecation on Nov. 11 would have been picked up by electricians as the phenomenal "Double 11" shopping carnival of today.
On November 11, 2009, Alibaba used the marketing gimmick for the first time: No one is in love with you, so "single dogs" come online to buy it.
The results came as a surprise, with Taobao Merchants (the predecessor of the "Skycat") trading at more than 52 million yuan, 10 times the daily turnover at the time.
Since then,"Double 11" has become a shopping carnival created by Alibaba, from the beginning of the domestic buyer sellers to amuse themselves, to the current global influx of businesses, nine years on, the Skycat "Double 11" 100 billion transactions more than 3,200 times that year, making "Black Friday" impossible to see.
With the wind Skycat "Double Eleven" promotion, there are a number of electric merchants, among which "Jingdong" is the strongest.
"Jingdong" has its own shopping festival,"6.18," but no "Double 11" has had a big impact, with cumulative sales of "Jingdong" reaching 127.1 billion yuan from November 1 to November 11 this year.
And "Double 11," followed by a similar "Double 12" discount carnival, Christmas New Year shopping period.
Across the New Year, Chinese consumers are waiting for the Spring Festival before the purchase of annual goods, Valentine's Day shopping, consumption, will not take a holiday.
The environmental problems caused by the instantaneous consumption of large quantities have attracted the attention of professionals and institutions.
According to Xinhua Daily Telegraph, the industry's usual standard estimate of 0.2 kg per packaging box is conservative, with at least 300,000 tonnes of waste generated during the "Double 11" period this year.
Liu Hua, director of the pollution prevention and control program at Greenpeace East Asia, told the Chinese and foreign dialogue that orders for the "Double 11" day-only cats this year would generate 160,000 tons of packaged garbage.
The National Post Office previously issued a report in 2016 noting that the 2015 "Double 11" period (November 11-16) had about 780 million express shipments, using more than 3 billion woven bags, 99.22 billion packing boxes, and 16.985 billion meters of duct tape, the length of which can circle the Earth's equator 425 laps.
And this year, the National Post Office expects "Double 11" to have more than 1.5 billion express shipments.
Wang Shi, manager of a garbage incineration center in Beijing, told Xinhua that more than 2,000 tons of garbage came in every day after "Double 11," which also exceeded the disposal capacity of the burning station.
The courier company has realized that the environmental pollution caused by the courier industry can not be underestimated.
Some electrician logistics firms, including Suning, have introduced recyclable reusable plastic courier boxes, recycled packaging bags that can be reused as shopping bags and garbage bags, but troublesome consumer acceptance is not high.
Mr Ma also tweeted a call for the logistics industry to support "green packaging" and "green logistics."
The Weibo reaped more than 68,000 "compliments."
What kind of mobile payment do Germans want?
Zhang Dongfang: The mobile payment war in Germany is not expected.
Microsoft Pay and Alipay have moved the battlefield to Europe, competitors have not changed, and the grabbing of positions has not changed - the Chinese, this is also globalisation?
Where there is a treasure to pay, there must be a microletter to pay.
Under an agreement with Wirecard, a German electronic payment service provider, Microsoft Pay officially started landing in Germany in November and is gradually being distributed across Europe.
This exotic reunion of the two "homelands" took place in Europe.
All the while, Alipay and Weixin Pay have been chanting all the way down the road of globalization.
For China's global approach to mobile payments, Airey consults the China Third Party Mobile Payment Industry Research Report 2017 to summarize two types: First, through strategic investment, experience output, access to shares and support domestic mobile payment enterprises abroad.
The second is to promote mobile payment services to foreign businesses through the consumption behavior of Chinese tourists abroad, thus changing the recognition and acceptance of mobile payment in foreign countries.
It is true that the Chinese are the world's best.
China's rapid economic growth, coupled with a large population base, is an attractive figure for Chinese tourists to spend in Europe.
But it is also doomed, this time in Germany to pull the China Mobile payment war is not expected.
Weixin Pay and Alipay simply moved the battlefield to Europe, with rivals unchanged, snatched positions unchanged - or the Chinese, which is also globalised?
More pioneering is the question of whether China's mobile payments can expand in Europe?
Take Germany, for example.
The 'new retail' that has been cast in magic
Chen Xin Lei, Yang Kaihan: Amazon announced its foray into bookstores and grocery stores as it squeezed into the world's top 10 retailers, both timing and motivation.
In November 2015, Amazon opened its first brick-and-mortar bookstore in Seattle, followed by two bookstores in Portland and San Diego.
At the start of 2017, Amazon opened stores in New York and plans to have at least eight by the end of the year.
Almost at the same time, Amazon announced a trial run of its unmanned supermarket, where customers do not have to queue or check out, sweep the door and leave with the desired item, and the amount of shopping is automatically deducted from the customer's Amazon account.
As far as Amazon is concerned, it has been a very unexpected thing to suddenly move up the physical store in recent years.
As early as 2007, in an open letter to shareholders, CEO Jeff Bezos stressed that Amazon would not easily open physical stores unless four conditions were met at the same time:
1. We must be confident that this new opportunity will lead to a return on shareholder investment;
2. We must be convinced that this new opportunity is of great significance to the company as a whole;
3. We must be convinced that this new opportunity is neglected by the market;
We must be sure that in this market we have sufficient resources to make customer-oriented differentiation.
Bookstores and grocery stores, the most shaky of the two brick-and-mortar retail categories, were the first rivals to fall after the rise of Amazon.
Amazon's announcement of its foray into both brick-and-mortar markets as it squeezed into the world's top 10 retailers is well worth playing with, both timing and motivation.
Is Amazon's approach, contrary to the assurances in the shareholders' letter?
A similar sound was heard at the other end of the planet, where Ma Yun, chairman of Alibaba's board of directors, gave a keynote speech on the morning of October 13, 2016, at the 2016 Hangzhou Yunfu Congress.
"Starting next year, Alibaba will no longer mention the phrase" e-commerce,"" he said.
The era of pure electricians will soon be over, and there will be no e-commerce for the next decade, two decades, replaced by "new retail."
Online, offline, and logistics combine to produce new retail."
For a while,"new retail" three words as if by magic, by the industry people frequently hang in the mouth.
But what exactly does "new retail" mean?
The concept is not novel if it's just a combination of being on and off the line.
In 2016, eMarketer estimated total electrician sales at about $200 billion after tracking 180 of the largest, while the top 25 accounted for more than $159 billion.
Of those 25, 18 are traditional retailers that have only started operating online in the past five years (such as Macy's, Nordstrom, Target, Gap, etc.).
And Alibaba Group 28.3 billion yuan into the Suning Yun Shang, also in sight.
Globally, retailers and electricians are moving from a single channel to a full-channel retail system that covers brick-and-mortar stores, electricians, mobile ends and social media.
Is Ma Yunti "new retail," more of a summary than a vision for the future?
If not, what is the difference between the full-channel concept and "new retail"?
Perhaps the key to the problem is not whether or not the line and the line will merge, but how.
Looking back over the past 20 years in retail, the rise of electricians, like the rise of discount retailers in the early years, has focused on price and convenience.
Relying on these two pain points, the electrician moved very standardized products, such as books and CDs, from the line down to the line.
With the development of online consumption habits and the improvement of customer experience, the electrician extended his tentacles to other categories and began to improve efficiency.
In the words of Alibaba CEO Zhang Yong,"using the ideas and technologies of the Internet to overhaul and upgrade the existing total of about 30 trillion social retailers makes it possible for Chinese consumers to meet their escalating consumer demand effectively, making the whole process of producing goods, circulation, services more efficient because of the extensive use of the Internet, big data."
So the electrician's road, is a surface light assets, the actual heavy assets of the road.
"Light" refers to fixed assets, staffing, management processes and other burdens that are not large in traditional retail; "heavy," refers to the need for huge input in logistics, warehousing, etc.
The change of the logistics mode ensures the high efficiency of the electrician.
On April 28, Premier Li Keqiang of the State Council chaired an executive meeting of the State Council, which held that expanding domestic consumption demand was an important measure to stabilize growth and adjust the structure, according to the Chinese government's website.
The meeting determined that the departments concerned should urgently come up with concrete plans on the basis of scientific assessment.
Some consumer goods for daily use abroad, which are in high demand for domestic consumers, will carry out import tariff reduction pilot projects by the end of June this year, gradually expanding the range of goods subject to tax reduction;
In the light of the reform of the tax system, we will improve the consumption tax policy on consumer goods such as clothing and cosmetics, and coordinate and adjust the scope, tax rate and collection links of taxation;
The establishment and restoration of import duty free shops at ports of entry, the reasonable expansion of duty free varieties, the increase of a certain amount of duty free shopping, and the convenience of domestic consumers to buy foreign products within China;
We will further promote the facilitation of customs clearance and tax rebates for overseas travellers, and strictly implement the voluntary declaration and tax payment requirements for imported goods in accordance with the law.
To formulate the inspection and quarantine policy to support the import of cross-border electric merchants, and to clean up the import links of unreasonable charges;
We will accelerate the promotion of Chinese product brands, support the development of physical stores, and achieve online and offline interaction.
We will standardize market order, crack down on counterfeiting and shoddy, and promote the survival of the fittest.
Let the consumer can be near comfortable, convenient shopping.

On January 18, Alibaba held a summit dialogue in Chongqing on lifting electricity merchants out of poverty, announcing a new model of "Internet + poverty eradication" to help drive accurate poverty eradication and rural revitalization.
After proposing a rural strategy, launching a rural Taobao project, setting up a poverty alleviation platform for farmers on the line, and setting up an Alibaba Poverty Eradication Fund, Ali has "added a code" to the fight against poverty.
The fight against poverty is one of the most important national strategies in China today.
Total poverty eradication has never been achieved in China for thousands of years.
"Electric merchants' poverty alleviation is an innovative initiative in the new round of poverty alleviation and development, and it is an important grasp to achieve accurate poverty alleviation and accurate poverty alleviation.
The central government attaches great importance to and points out that it can play the role of the Internet in helping to lift people out of poverty, promote accurate poverty alleviation and accurate poverty eradication, and enable agricultural products to get out of the countryside through the Internet."
As a result, Ali proposed a rural strategy as early as 2014, along with big data cloud computing and globalisation, as Ali's three core strategies for the next 20 years.
In the same year, Ali launched the rural Taobao (village Taobao) project, recruiting "village two" in the countryside to lead farmers out of poverty and get rich through electricity merchants.
In 2017, Ali worked with the business sector to create a poverty alleviation channel for farmers, now docking a cumulative total of 13 provinces and 120 state-level poor counties.
The Taobao Village, spawned by Ali's platform, already has 2,118.
Of these, nearly 400 appeared in poverty-stricken counties in the province and 33 in 13 poverty-stricken counties in the country.
In 2017, national Taobao Village sales reached 120 billion yuan on Alibaba's Chinese retail platform.
Zhang Yong said that in the face of the national strategy to fight poverty, Ali has been thinking about how to use the technology, big data, cloud computing and other innovative capabilities of the Ali economy to get out of poverty a new way.
Among them, the village Taobao is the main carrying platform of Ali electric merchants to get rid of poverty, and through a direct sale of a new Internet link to get rid of poverty.
In the planting link, the village Taobao and the ant gold clothing joint development of agricultural capital farm tools and micro-credit support.
In 2017, ant gold suits served 795 of the 832 state-level poor counties, providing them with convenient payment, credit and other services.
Rookie solve storage and logistics, Skycat is responsible for sales, Ali Yun's big data back to guide agricultural production, further improve the supply standards, quality and market competitiveness of agricultural products.
The development of electric merchants out of poverty requires not only products, sales channels, industrial planning, but also talent.
Through Taobao University, Ali taught farmers standardization, quality and large-scale cultivation methods through an electrical business course, and achieved a combination of "poverty alleviation and mental support" to enable farmers to sustainably lift themselves out of poverty.
These courses already cover about 92 per cent of the poor counties at the national level.
But the "public interest mentality, commercial means" of the way out of poverty, can also guarantee that Ali in the poverty alleviation "true poverty alleviation."
Alibaba board chairman Ma Yun has said poverty eradication should be divided into three stages: Poverty alleviation, poverty alleviation and enrichment.
Poverty alleviation is to teach people to fish, poverty alleviation is to teach people to fish, to get rich is to create a "fish pond" for farmers, so that farmers can have fish to feed.
The industry driven by electric merchants to alleviate poverty is to build fish ponds.
In terms of industrial poverty alleviation, the model developed by Ali in cooperation with Luochuan, Shaanxi Province, has been replicated and popularized throughout the country as an example by the relevant departments.
Ali Electronics has also been recognized at the decision-making level for its work in poverty alleviation.
Alibaba as the representative of the electric business enterprises have been sent word, through the line up and down channels, to ensure that farmers increase production and increase revenue.
Some village sophomores and ant gold garment workers have also been invited to the United Nations and Africa to share their experiences in lifting electricity merchants out of poverty.
At present, the China office of the United Nations World Food Program has been working with Village Taobao to alleviate poverty in the electrical and commercial industries in Anhui Province and other places.
The Third Congress of the New Economic Think Tank, jointly organized by the Ali Research Institute and the China Vision think tank, was held on January 16, attended by Zhang Li, Director of the Institute of Electronics and Business of the Ministry of Commerce.
She believes that our globalization actually ignores the most important issues, namely, the body and use of globalization, and the stage of globalization.
In this way, many people believe that globalization has stagnated, and that many developed and developing countries, in the new phase, have different attitudes towards globalization and different models.
The second concept is the question of the medium-term phase of globalization. What are the constraints on the medium-term phase of globalization?
Restricted by the economic environment foundation, it is precisely because the economic foundation has changed globalization has been restricted.
Zhang believes that the global economic adjustment is essentially over at the end of 2017 and will enter a new round of growth after 2018, with the next round of growth necessarily driven by raw products.
Jingdong's first fresh supermarket, 7FRESH, has officially opened, with plans to lay more than 1,000 stores across the country in the next three to five years.
Add Ali's box of horses, Yonghui's superspecies, Suning's sauvignon, the meringue's palm fish freshness, and so on, and "new retail outlets" start to pile up and "call each other the board" on innovative models and even prices.
Fresh supermarket scramble to upgrade, has become the phenomenon level topic in the new retail field, where is the new retail in the end?
"We will enter the country quickly in 2018, and we will open a lot of stores in Beijing, Shanghai and Hangzhou before the Spring Festival."
Box Horse Fresh CEO Hou Yi revealed the "new beats" for 2018 at the second New Retail Summit on Sunday.
"Starting in 2018, Boxed Horse is not just a raw electrician, but a life-size electrician that caters to consumers" instant service,"the company said in a statement.
The core mode line is the drainage, the experience, the line is the real sales."
Different from the traditional big selling shops, supermarkets, box horse fresh in the eyes of many consumers is a fun and delicious "red shop," even the intermediary agencies hit out at the concept of "box room."
Online platform and online retailer have their own advantages and disadvantages, but consumers appear in a variety of channels, so both sides are trying the full-channel model.
The industry believes there will be more and more stores in the "box horses" category in 2018 in the broader context of an uptick in consumption.
And box horses continue to explore more consumer areas from their original freshness, heralding more innovation in the retail market in the new year.
"For example, the combination of online and offline business model, attracted the attention of consumers, all over the opening of fresh supermarkets called seats and good."
"But these relationships don't work any more, they don't work, and I'm willing to pay for them until you've had a great experience for the consumer."
In the new retail environment, consumer habits have changed and the demand for purchases has changed, according to Yuan Bing, co-CEO of Da-Runfa Flying Cow Network.
The original pure line, the line is cut, the line to beat the line, the line to counter the line under the line, now is a hand in hand, because consumers have no line on the line under the distinction.
The scramble for capital has given the new retail sales, represented by fresh supermarkets, a taste of fire and fury.
The analysis suggests that the current competition for new retail in frontline cities is far from the Red Sea landscape, and there are large swathes of second-tier cities yet to be excavated, and there is still plenty of opportunity and space in the market.
Different types of industry for the layout of new retail, will bring the development of new retail into a diversified state of development.
CCTV Financial and Economic Channel, in conjunction with the Institute of Financial and Economic Strategy of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, combed out a dry goods, is this heavy annual development report of China Electricity Merchants.

What are the development trends of the global electric merchants?
Let's find out one by one for everyone.
Sales volume again record growth back on track to accelerate
Since 2006, China's online retail sales can be said to have been extremely high growth, it is estimated that at that time online shopping is very fresh, do not go out of the door can buy things, too cool!
But online retail growth began to fall below 50 per cent in 2013, to below 40 per cent for the first time in 2015, and to 26.2 per cent in 2016.
But this year has been different, with online retail sales accelerating again, rising to 34.2 per cent in January-September.
That's significantly higher than the growth rate in 2015, 2016.
Maybe people go for a spin around the outside and find it more pleasurable to buy or buy.
Of these, the online retail sales of physical goods amounted to nearly 508 million yuan, and the online retail sales of services amounted to 149 million yuan.
The proportion of total retail sales of social goods reached 13.6 per cent, an increase of nearly 3 percentage points year-on-year.
Students, don't doze off, focus, service online retail sales is definitely a great credit!
Second, the French netizens who love chopping hands, the net purchase per capita is 1925 dollars, and they buy the most goods online, is the clothing, is worthy of love fashion country.

Help you avoid the company becoming the next go-to startup
Amy Erett once wanted to investigate employee happiness at her e-commerce startup, but the survey did little.
Responses are often vague, unhelpful, and even worse, deceptive.
Even though she promised anonymity, some employees still don't trust the process.
Madison Reed, the San Francisco e-commerce hair care company that Erett manages for 75 people, said "the responses received lacked consistency and objectivity."
So she called for help.
A slew of new human resources start-ups have sprung up to help companies understand how employees feel.
They build and authorize software specifically designed to measure employee engagement, allowing companies to quickly poll specific teams and population groups, provide anonymous and complaint hotlines for employees and, in some cases, allow whistleblowers to bypass executives to report directly to the board.
"Now, you can track your health with tools like Strava and Fitbit, but where is the company's Fitbit?" Said Jim Barnett, co-founder and CEO of Redwood City startup Glint, a software analytics tool used by companies to measure employee dedication.
Ms Erett said within three years she had used Glint to gain more insight into her staff's thoughts and feelings.
In addition to quick surveys and opinion polls by specific teams, Glint offers company heat maps, which units have the most complaints, and which managers have low approval scores, at a glance - which gives her an insight into why.
Companies began to realize that they had to master the company's workplace culture so as not to be the next best step, and after the company punished the speaker with a blog post describing the harassment environment, YouStep became embroiled in a scandal.
For start-ups like Glint, the company's desire for oversight is a money-losing business opportunity.
The global governance, regulatory and compliance industry could be worth more than $118.7 billion by 2020, according to the financial technology analysis website Let's Talk Payments.Source: Supplied
Convercent, a startup in Denver, Colorado, is committed to helping companies prevent and detect bad behavior, and they saw an increase in interest and activity in this area during the reputational damage of Utrecht earlier this year.
Convercent has nearly 600 customers, including EpiPen, Microsoft and Tesla.
YouStep recently signed up to become a customer.
Like Glint, Convercent allows companies to send customised "diagnostic" surveys, collect confidential responses in real time and view heat maps of their problem areas.
Convercent also offers an anonymous messaging hotline for employees to report bad behavior.
If the chairman is implicated, then the complaint will go directly to the board.
Patrick Quinlan, founder and chief executive of Convercent, said: "The court of public opinion usurped the powers of the regulator.
If a company is found to treat employees poorly or behave unethically towards them, even if regulators don't step in, the company could face high consequences of consumer boycotts, staff attrition and involvement in lawsuits, Mr Quinlan said.
Ruby Tuesday, a catering chain that spans more than 500 locations and has more than 25,000 employees, has been using Convercent for more than a year to ensure employees understand work guidelines and work protocols and provide easy access to the company's headquarters.
Until then, if employees want to report a problem, they must find the company's headquarters phone number or email, file a formal complaint and hope the headquarters takes it seriously.
It's often a daunting and unsettling experience, as James Vetrano, Ruby Tuesday's general counsel for law, says he doesn't think there's a good way to track employee complaints.
But now that the company uses Convercent, it can more quickly detect and address issues - such as discrimination, harassment or unfair wage practices - that were previously unknown to executives in remote offices, cities or states.
"I can get a closer, 360-degree overview of the work experience," said Vetrano, who is in charge of Ruby Tuesday's risk management team.
"We are protecting our shareholders from employment litigation."
Mr Quinlan said companies had placed greater emphasis on ethics, values and employee professionalism since 2002, after the collapse of the Andorran accounting firm over the Enron scandal.
But it wasn't until "social media went into its own world" that companies realised they couldn't stop their exploits from going viral online.
"Before using technology to monitor ethics, people see hope as a strategy," he said.
Both Glint and Convercent offer their software as a service and charge companies recurring fees for product use.
This business model and business opportunity is supported by venture investors who already support both start-ups.
In February, Convercent raised $10 million from the likes of Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, with its total capital rising to $47 million.
In November, Glint received $10 million from Bessemer Venture Partners, bringing its total to $60 million.
Given the interconnectedness of companies, culture and venture capital, these investments hardly come as a surprise.
A growing body of research has shown that today's employees expect more from the workplace than before.
In a competitive market like Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are just bets.
Employees want to feel that they are accepted, valued, and feel that their time is spent in a company with a positive mission.
"When people are happy to join the company, feel their voices are being listened to, and the work they do is beneficial, they are more committed to making the company successful," said Nina McCartney, vice president of global welfare and employee experience at LinkedIn, which uses both Convercent and Glint.
Investors deliver returns when their portfolio companies perform well; companies perform well when employees are loyal and dedicated.
If third-party analytics tools promise to increase employee loyalty and professionalism, it is not surprising that they will seek financial support.
Workplace culture experts say it's important to have data on employee professionalism.
But the data is useless unless the company's administrators take action.
In fact, if a company asks for feedback from employees, it can be expected that the company is making changes.
If change doesn't move fast enough, or without a bit of progress, it can lead to disappointment and cause employees to leave the company.
"If you want to seek 4,000 recommendations, then you need to be ready for 4,000 conversations," said Russell Rath, head of consulting operations at business management firm Cotter International, who has seen some companies rely too heavily on data collection errors.
"Because if it doesn't follow up all the way through, the staff will think," Did you really hear what I said?
Do you care?
If you don't care, why should I care? '
Mr Erett said Madison Reed, who now conducts monthly staff surveys, had been able to take action on the day Glint reported problems.
After collecting feedback from employees about their frustration with the speed of decision-making and quality of communication, she was able to solve the problem by restructuring the company's internal team and increasing communication training.
Ruby Tuesday is gaining new insights into its employees, and in the long run they hope to be able to make a shift in an industry known for its high turnover of talent and better retain staff.
"If you're not committed to creating a culture of transparency, you lose talent," Vetrano said.
'If you lose talent, you're going to lose customers.
And when you lose customers, you lose the company."

NCAA cancels twice-daily workouts to extend Bears' daytime workouts
As the hour approached 11 p.m., members of the UCLA football team hovered and chatted next to the team's new campus practice field.
Some players have taken off their jerseys to reveal their sweaty bodies from the first day of training.
For a big part of the team, this free few minutes is a break.
Players taking the summer course will return to the dormitory after three hours of practice to prepare for their final exams, before returning to the Wasserman Football Center for a meeting at 6:30 a.m. the next morning.
"The next three days are a grind for these guys," Bears coach Jim Mora said as he approached Tuesday on Monday.
The NCAA canceled two practice sessions a day (designed to ease the burden on players), but actually extended their daytime workouts - at least until the end of Friday.
That's why UCLA's first three workouts are scheduled to begin at 7:15 p.m. to accommodate a schedule in which players are already jammed.
From canceling two workouts a day to more once-a-day workouts, the Bears rolled out nearly a week before last season, and Mora trained at summer school for the first time in six seasons at Westwood.
They plan to start 18 training sessions starting on August 20 before they begin pre-game preparations for the official game against Texas Rangers in September.
Mora said he supports the NCAA's rule changes, though that would add another item to a player's busy schedule.
"In three or four days, we'll put a huge amount of training on them, it's very challenging," Mora said.
'They've just passed, too. They're grinding, they're all great kids.
I thought about Saturday and we'll have more time, it's really great. '
At the end of the training camp, the University of California, Los Angeles, will stop training, which is not an easy task given the adjacent parking lot and the clear view of the Luskin Center High Hotel, which has been littered with football thrown through the net behind the goal post.
Bears players will be staying at the hotel starting this weekend, but Mora admits there could be problems once the rooms are empty during the season.
"We'll take security measures," Mora said.
"It's a real worry. The idea that someone might rent a room and sit in a room and record a training scene is not far-fetched.
If you have a training tape, it's pretty good, too.
But we'll take security measures there, and we'll take security measures in parking lot 8.
We will make the best of our available resources.
I don't worry too much about that.
We've got a plan in place.""

Facebook to launch fact-checking feature to combat fake news
Facebook, the world's largest online social network, is trying to crack down on so-called fake news after it claimed on Thursday that it would send more potentially prank articles to third-party detection agencies and display the results below the original post.
Facebook will start using newer machines to learn to detect possible pranks and send them to fact-checkers, and may display fact-checking results below the original post, the company said in a statement on its website.
Facebook has been criticised as one of the main points of spread of so-called fake news, with many suggesting it influenced the 2016 US presidential election.
The issue has also become a major political topic in Europe, with voters hit by a flood of false stories ahead of France's presidential election in May and Germany leading the way in passing support for a penalty scheme ahead of the September election, which could see social media networks fined if they fail to remove hate posts in time.
Facebook said in a separate statement in Germany on Thursday that a new fact-checking function test was being launched in the United States, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
"In addition to seeing which stories are challenged by third-party fact-checkers, people want more context to help them make informed decisions about what they read and share," Facebook News Feed product manager Sarah Sue said in a blog post.
She added that Facebook would continue to test its "related articles" feature and make other changes to its news feed to reduce fake news.
Creating a graphic novel: The story of England's castles
The diminutive Scotney Castle recently featured in the compressed version of the music film, and at one point served as a refuge for Lady Margaret Thatcher during the Seventies and Eighties.
But Scotney, who has witnessed 700 years of tumultuous history in the comfort of the Belle River Canyon in Kent, is now the inspiration for graphic novels written by Jamie Rhodes, a Yorkshireman with a particular penchant for historical documents and a drag on his head.
"I can see the handwriting of the ancients 300 years ago, and I find it very beautiful," he said wistfully.
"What kind of interpersonal affinity is it for this letter to fall on my hands."
Spanning the Middle Ages until the Edwardian era,"A Castle of England" readings chronicled the various families living in Scotney, each story by different, future British artists such as Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer, and Isabel Greenberg.
This is not Rhodes's first book with archives as a raw material: He also wrote The Dental and Other Stories of the Dead in 2014, a book inspired by British Library literature, a work he accomplished with uncontrollable creative passion.
"I couldn't contain my urge to write from the moment I saw the thumbprint left on the side of the letter, written by a double agent who worked for the Jacobites in the 18th century," he said.
'That's his fingerprints!'
And the letter has always smelled of smoke, because at that time, you need to ignite to have light.
For us 300 years later, the smell makes it feel like they're on our side too.
Oh, I love archival literature!""
For those touched by the old paper, to have the support of the National Trust and Arts Council of England and to have lived in the castle for almost four months ("to tell the truth, I stayed a little bit longer") seems fantastic and simply unbelievable to be true.
Rhodes spent days visiting and browsing Victoria's "new" castles, poring over archives, studying the estate's many treasures and antiques, such as the hyena head hanging on the wall, and bottles that had spent centuries in the moat, among other things.
He strolled through the land and ruins of the old castle, chatting with wanderers, gardeners, and sometimes with illustrators who had drawn illustrations for his books.
And then at night, he would "drink some whisky and write."
Scotney's stealthy history is not yet clear, as the National Trust only fully entered after the death of its last heir, Elizabeth Hersey, in 2006.
Ten years later, when Rhodes arrived, the staff only began working on the files, which he described as "hundreds of years ago the aristocrats were going:" Oh, put it in the attic.""
Diaries, letters from the British Empire, maps of national boundaries: "You would think a land dispute would be boring," Rhodes said,"but there would be two families who would fight big for a birch tree.
Let it go, guys!""
Some of the stories in the work take the castle as a starting point and go on to study British history on a broader level, including The Labour, which leads with a man who left the newly built castle to take part in the peasant uprising of 1381.
"The book," The Knight Family of Kent and Sussex,"chronicles a riot in the castle in 1380," says Rhodes.
"The peasant uprising began in that area, and I think it was a good place to start an uprising.
Maybe there's a correlation between the two?""
Other stories are deeply rooted in the history of the castle, such as The Priest, which tells the story of the Darrell family who hid a Jesuit priest for seven years during the British Reformation.
Or The Smuggler, the story's owner, Arthur Darrell, an 18th-century smuggler who is thought to have given himself a funeral by filling his coffin with stones (it was years before his coffin was revealed to the ground).
"The Darrells" is Rhodes's favourite Scotney Castle family: "These gentlemen seem to be rogue, constantly borrowing money and spending more money on things they can't afford.
Generations of Darrell men solve their debt problems by marrying rich old women, and I think they should be a bunch of handsome lads who know how to pursue women.""
As his mission in the castle came to an end, Rhodes began searching for other bizarre writing experiences.
He spent two weeks in the wilds of Finland working on a graphic novel about "El........" An early 20th-century nursing home that was slowly abandoned.
But Scotney has a special place for him.
"I left with a lot of sadness," he said.
"It's like:" Oh, I have to face the real life of the trough cake.""

Big energy companies are all "rich and powerful," so who of the world's many energy companies take the most advantage of the money?
Yesterday, prominent PFC Energy unveiled its top 50 ranking of listed energy companies in 2011, with US oil and gas producer ExxonMobil crowned champion with a market value of $406.3 billion, followed by PetroChina and Royal Dutch Shell.
In the PFC list, PetroChina was asked twice in 2007 and 2009, with ExxonMobil taking the top spot in the rest of the year.
A total of three companies from mainland China were shortlisted for the top 50 list in 2011, along with PetroChina, which ranked second, and PetroChina, which ranked ninth, and China Ocean Oil, which ranked 15th.
According to PFC statistics, however, although oil prices are now much higher than they were four years ago, the CEO of PFC Energy points out that there are many reasons for the low total market value, including the decline in gas prices in North America and low activity in global stock markets.

Us changes green card regulations
The United States will introduce a new immigration program with changes to green card regulations, the media said, citing a speech by President Donald Trump.
The program aims to reduce legal immigration to 50,000 people a year, and temporary work visas, as well as family-oriented visa applications, will be subject to stricter regulations.
The new rules were proposed by Republicans and supported by the president.
The draft law will be discussed in both chambers.
"This law will reduce poverty, raise wages, save taxpayers billions of dollars and realize the above benefits by changing the way the United States issues green cards to citizens of other countries," Trump was quoted by US media as saying.
The law would replace the current program and reduce chain migration.
This new application process benefits applicants who speak English, have financial support and have skills that are good for economic development."

In order to optimize the scenic area environment and build beautiful Nanyue, recently, the "636" voluntary service brigade of the Special Tobacco Bureau (Branch) of Nanyue District launched the environmental protection activities of "mountaineering forest protection and homestead care."
The activities not only received the support of all cadres and staff of the District Tobacco Bureau, but also attracted retired senior cadres and family members to participate in environmental protection practices, and the three generations of the elderly and young people worked together to protect forests and clean up garbage, contributing their part to the construction of the "Beautiful South Yue."
The purpose of this voluntary service activity is to protect the landscape resources of South Yue and promote the concept of "caring for others, caring for society and caring for nature," so that the next generation will be educated from an early age and inherit the virtues of voluntary service.
It is reported that since its establishment in early April this year, the "636" voluntary service brigade has developed 16 members, and has carried out a series of voluntary service activities, including visiting retail customers in distress, helping farmers to care for tobacco leaves, and making donations from Ya'an Earthquake Love, to become a volunteer force with the intention of conveying positive energy.

Sex robots are on the rise, but we should be careful
Just when you feel 2017 can't be more bizarre, the sex robot field has released a new technology development report.
Yes, it is.
Now sex robots are a big deal.
Recently, the Responsible Robotics Foundation (FRR) released a report looking ahead to the development of sex robots over the next five to 10 years.
According to Noel Sharkey, emeritus retired professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of FRR, we need to start taking the rise of sex robots seriously.
Customers can choose the robot's eye colour, nipple shape and nail type.
"People scoff at the back, but companies do put out a lot of sex robots, and we'll see a lot more," Sharkey said at the launch of the new report.
Modern sex dolls have evolved from inflatable dolls into robots that have silicone skin, feel warm and purposely use artificial intelligence to set up human-like sexual responses.
Users can also "customize" their robots to suit their preferences, with options ranging from eye color, nipple shape to nail type or color.
But what's more disturbing is that a lot of robots with "personality" will make "replicant petite wives" look sophisticated.
Modern sex toys have evolved into robots with silicone skin.
RealBotix robots, for example, are able to come from definitions based on features that users consider attractive, such as shyness.
There's also the Roxxy Gold sex robot, developed by True Companion, which can pre-set character traits, including the slightly sheepish "Cold Faller" and the "Wild Wendy" who are "adventurous."
"The Roxxy Gold robot has the personality to match you as much as possible," the True Companion website gushed.
So she loves what you love, and evil what you do.
She also had little emotions in those days like normal people!
She can be lazy, talkative, or "sexually active"!
The rise of sex robots has brought a lot of unease - not just in place of real human relationships - but the servile feminine traits and the hint of rape whipping up on cold-blooded (read: Resist) Farah are the most worrying.
True Companion likens Roxxy to a man's vibrating stick on its website.
"If women have vibrating rods, then why can't men have Roxxy?" The site says.
Yet these sex robots are not a mere fetish, or just a sex toy.
Their presence and growing maturity point directly to the darker, deeper parts of our culture: Escaping from perfect gender equality to sex with submission as an add-on option.
Of course, most men don't have sex robots, and while FRR points out that sex robots are becoming more popular, they are still on the fringes of consumer culture.
But what seeps in from the edge allows us to see the course of the era we are in.
A lot of people are not weird or aggressive until the free market gives them a chance to become so.
It's no coincidence that these fine sex robots come at a time when women's rights are under threat across the globe, and there is another president in the White House who has bragged about sexual violence against women.
The most chilling part of the TV drama "The handmaid's Tale" lies not in the lifelike picture, not in the suspended corpse, or the gouged eyes, but in the overly real imagination.
The Republic of Gilead is a jump, but now it looks like it's not far away.
The goal behind these sex robots is to do everything technically possible to create the body that most resembles a real woman (though in proportion to porn stars).
The creators of these robots want them to have human touch and mimic real human movements.
But to put it bluntly, their "personalities" do not represent real women.
They can't break up and they can't run away.
They have no recourse agencies and no follow-up stories, no independence at all, and nothing that could break the illusion of outright slavery.
In other words, they are sex slaves.
Or according to the popular phrase of 2017: The handmaiden.

Trump's great exploits?
Make Mitt Romney the epitome of common sense
The political divide has polarized American voters and, from a microcosmic point of view, undermined American family harmony, which is no surprise in the Trump era.
Around Christmas and Thanksgiving, major US newspapers flooded comment columns with stories of how to deal with the fear of ticketing Trump relatives.
It is often thought that we are doing everything we can to puncture our "filter bubble."
Less vocal is Trump's power to bring his family together.
I mention this because my cousin, a left-wing poet living in Chicago who had a long feud with the Republicans in our family, was coming to visit me in New York this week.
She reminded me that uniting against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.
Thanks to working with Trump in the White House, everyone she knows, even relatives of Republicans who have had political squabbles for decades, is now suddenly and strangely on the same line.
It's certainly a good thing if it's all at the table, but it's shocking to me that, from a broader perspective, it raises significant risks.
While leftist figures have long been abetted by Trump, the warping effect of his presidency has pushed us all to the right.
When we talk about "normalization" and Trump, we're referring to the possibility of concern that his outlandish behavior might one day stop.
There is, however, a more worrying long-term scenario in which Trump wants to "normalize" relations with right-wing Republicans who previously opposed Mr. President's standards and now suddenly look like symbols of reason.
I found myself nostalgic recently for the Mitt Romney version of the madness: Putting a dog in a car, 14 percent income tax (but at least we know his tax returns), for the crime of both moves does seem too minor compared to Trump.
After the Trump era has passed, the next Republican candidate only needs to sensibly qualify for immeasurable improvement.
When my cousin lived in town, we took the kids to the New York park merry-go-round, the largest run by New York's Central Park administration, and the $3 ticket is the most consumer value you'll get in the city if you don't need coffee.
The sound of the Trojan horse is thunderous, the central cylinder is designed for fiberglass, and all the clowns and animals wriggle their heads, looking horribly and sinister over their shoulders, while the jingling music rings strangely.
Too many vulgar cities are disappointing: The landscape overlooking from high-rise buildings becomes old-fashioned, the skyline becomes too familiar to provide too much thrill anymore, and the reality of the city doesn't hold up the dream.
Thirty-five years later, I haven't quite forgotten that day when I discovered that this "Swiss hut" was not actually a Swiss hut, but an old Swiss hut in the theme bar, Ye Olde Swiss Cottage, I can't remember, but near a junction in north London.
However, the Central Park merry-go-round is still a magical experience, with everyone having a good time for the two 2-year-olds, an 11-year-old, and four events available to both girls in their 40s.
If I could evaluate the merry-go-round, I would give it a full score, but fortunately no one asked.
But this week at a department store, before brushing my credit card, I was asked to rate my trading "experience" by one to five stars.
The same goes for coffee shops in the corner of my street, in addition to the option of scoring with a 15 per cent tip, which is to buy over the counter.
The effect is not only to slow down what should have been a neutral deal, but to put pressure on waiters to add personal factors to an unwanted scenario.
The poor woman in the department store smiled apologetically, while I was exhausted, and the credit card experience gave her five stars.
Oscar Pistolis transferred from prison to hospital with chest pain
This is the second time Pistolis has left prison and transferred to hospital.
He was taken to the hospital last year to be treated for a cut to his wrist, which prison officials say was caused by a fall in his cell.
Pistolis was convicted of murder after prosecutors appealed the original manslaughter ruling.
In the early hours of Valentine's Day 2013, he shot Stinkamp multiple times through a toilet cubicle door at his home in Pretoria until his death.
Pistolis claimed to have mistaken his girlfriend for an intruder who hid in a cubicle at night.
Prosecutors have announced their intention to appeal again, this time for a six-year sentence against Pistolis, which they believe is too lenient.
The National Public Prosecutor's Office said it would appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa and that the appeal could be heard this year.
If prosecutors win, Pistolis faces up to 15 years in prison.
South Africa has no death penalty.

Two Bulgarians Detained in Greece for Illegal Camping
Two Bulgarians have been detained in Greece for illegal camping, bTV reported, citing Foreign Ministry sources.
On the morning of August 1, Sisonia police detained a group of illegal campers, including two Bulgarians.
The detainees were released that day and the investigation is still ongoing.
Two Bulgarians were subsequently released, the ministry revealed to bTV.

On May 18, the Ministry of Finance promulgated the Measures for the Administration of Special Awards and Supplementary Funds for the Structural Adjustment of Industrial Enterprises, which will arrange special awards and supplementary funds to promote the elimination of excess capacity in the coal and iron and steel industries, for a total amount of 100 billion yuan.
Recently, many local governments in Shanghai, Shanxi, Shandong, Jiangsu and Heilongjiang have put forward reform proposals to eliminate excess capacity.
Among them, many provinces have even suggested that they should actively seek financial support from the central government for their provinces to eliminate production capacity.
One corroboration is that the coal decapacity target announced in just eight provinces stands at 90 per cent of the national coal production cut plan.
In an interview with reporters, Lin Boqiang, president of the China Energy Policy Research Institute at Xiamen University, said the "de-productive capacity" of the steel and coal industries is not enough to rely on the 100 billion yuan from the central government alone, and more money needs local governments and enterprises to solve it themselves.
Shanxi Province recently published detailed rules for the implementation of coal production capacity proposed the restructuring of Shanxi coking coal group into a state-owned capital investment company, reorganization and integration of the assets and business of enterprises, and the construction of a new business model.
The shortfall is likely to be three times higher than the subsidy, after Human Resources and Social Security Minister Yin Weimin said preliminary statistics on the number of workers to be relocated "to capacity" were 1.3 million in coal and 500,000 in steel.
The Southern Daily News (reporter / Xie Qingyu) reporter learned today from the provincial environmental protection bureau that the results of the 2012 environmental protection credit rating of key pollution sources in Guangdong province were being announced.
As a result of the evaluation, 134 of the 1,251 enterprises listed in the environmental credit management list were temporarily not rated for reasons such as shut-down, non-acceptance and shut-down.
In the proposed red card enterprises, mainly electroplating, printing and dyeing, prevention and control of heavy pollution enterprises, some sewage treatment plants are also on the list.
In order to reflect the principles of openness, fairness and impartiality and subject to public supervision, the rating results are now posted on the website of the Department of Environmental Protection, the provincial environmental protection department said.
During the public announcement period, the Environmental Protection Bureau will receive calls, letters and visits from the public, and will investigate, verify and deal with the issues reflected.
Climate change could destroy a large number of species, including the resources and food on which humans depend, in an irreversible manner.
Mr Wynes said even if the heat doesn't kill the species directly, it can spawn potential risk factors.
The Wynes study also showed that native extinctions vary from region to region, with species in the tropics more than twice as likely to be native extinctions compared to temperate regions.

Does thin meat, dairy products and chocolate help relieve inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)?
Thin meat and chocolate may sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.
But a new study shows the opposite: A diet rich in meat protein and dairy products can help alleviate the associated symptoms in patients with inflammatory bowel disease.
The incurable disease affects about 1.3 million Americans and about 300,000 Britons, causing stomach cramps and abdominal distension, recurrent or hemorrhagic diarrhea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
Researchers at the University of Washington typically advise patients to avoid eating meat and dairy products to relieve symptoms, but researchers found the protein's key amino acid, tryptophan, helps boost immune cell growth, which boosts gut tolerance.
Lead researcher Dr Marco Colonna explained that immune cells patrol the gut to ensure harmful microbes hidden in food don't sneak into the body.
Maintain a balance between the cells that trigger inflammation and those that promote tolerance, protecting the body without damaging all kinds of sensitive and fragile tissue.
Inflammatory bowel disease can occur when the equilibrium is too skewed towards inflammation.
In the experiment, an immune-boosting cell was found to appear in mice carrying special bacteria.
Bacteria need tryptophan (one of the components of the protein) to form the appearance of the cells.
Professor Cologna said: 'We have established a link between a bacterial population (Lactobacillus roe, which is a normal part of the gut microbiome) and the development of a cell population that promotes tolerance.
The more tryptophan the mice consumed in their diet, the more immune cells they had.
He suggested that if humans use the same method, the combination of Lactobacillus Lucidum and a diet rich in tryptophan may create a more resistant, less inflammatory bowel environment.
Luisa Cervantes-Barraganwas, a postdoctoral researcher, studied an immune cell that promotes tolerance, and when she found one group of study mice had such cells, the other group of the same strains were raised separately without.
She suspected that the difference was related to the gut microbiome (referring to the bacteria, viruses and fungi that normally live in the gastrointestinal tract) community of mice.
DNA sequencing of cholesterol in mice found that six bacterial populations were present in mice with immune cells, but not in mice without immune cells.
Mice are raised in sterile environments, so they lack gut microbes and cannot develop such immune cells, while the presence of Lactobacillus Lucidum produces immune cells.
To understand how bacteria affect the immune system, the researchers cultured Lactobacillus Lucidum in the liquid and then transferred a small amount of the bacteria-free liquid to immature immune cells isolated from mice.
The immune cells develop into resistant cells.
When the active ingredient is purified from the liquid, it can be shown that the active ingredient is a byproduct of tryptophan metabolism, known as indole-3-lactic acid.
When researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in mice feed, the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent, but when tryptophan levels were halved, the number of cells halved.
'People have the same stress-enhancing cells as mice, and most of us have Lactobacillus Lucidum in our gastrointestinal tract,' explains Dr Cervantes-Barragan.
Whether humans can induce cell development with tryptophan by-products from Lactobacillus Lucidum in the body, like mice in the experiment, is unknown, but genetic defects linked to tryptophan have been found in patients with inflammatory bowel disease.
"The development of these cells may be exactly what we want to get, because these cells can control the inflammatory response on the surface of the gut," she said.
It is inexact that high levels of tryptophan present in Lactobacillus Lucidum may lead to an increase in the number of this strain.
Jose Mourinho believes Manchester United signed 'talented' Nemanja Matic
After Nemanja Matic made his debut against Sampdoria on Wednesday night, Mourinho determined United had signed a 'talented' midfielder.
Matic, who is from Chelsea and signed for a whopping £40m, opened 2-1 in the league's final pre-season game ahead of the European Super Cup against Real Madrid in Dublin on Tuesday, winning the favour of Paul Bogba and Andreas Pereira.
However, in Bruce's pre-season tour of Asia, Matic was woefully under-matched and finished with just 45 minutes to go, with Mourinho admitting improvement was needed before the start of the Premier League season.
"He needs time, but he has the experience, the intelligence and the way talent thinks - he thinks about football," Mourinho said.
'We'll help him get ready as soon as possible.'
Mourinho began scheduling his starting line-up at the start of the season and, like Matic, new signings Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku also started the game at the Aviva Stadium.
The Independent reported this week that Mourinho still wants to bring in three more signings but insists the club are "doing a fantastic job" with four first-choice signings in his heart and the club have brought in three of them.
"I am very grateful to the club for bringing in three of the contracted players," he added.
'I'd be happier if the club could bring in all four players, but they've put a lot of effort into me.'
Will China fall behind if it doesn't build this warship at the height of the global frigate boom?
With the recent announcement by the world's major naval powers of plans for the construction of new frigates, as if overnight the frigates had become the focus of attention of the major naval powers, first Japan's decision to purchase two new frigates in its 2018 defense budget has finally led to a substantial breakthrough in Japan's DEX frigate program, and then the recent announcement by Lockheed Martin of the latest plan for the U.S. FFG frigate program, where should China's new frigates go?
With the launch of the latest Type 054A frigate at the end of 2017, signalling that the 054A frigate has been built up to a whopping 29, approaching the sum of the 053H series of frigates, the construction of the 054A has been 12 years in the making since the first 054A went down in 2006, and even around the world, building such a large number of high-performance utility frigates, with the exception of China, is only comparable to the "Perry" class frigates built by the United States in the 1970s and '80s.
And the reason why so much 054A is being built is simple: It's affordable, easy to use, plus it's replenishing years of Navy debt.
The Type 054A frigate has been favoured by the Chinese navy for many years for its high cost and good combat capability, with a displacement of around 4,000 tons, a 76-millimeter main gun, a 32-unit Sea Red Flag 16 and fish-8 anti-submarine missile launch system, eight Hawk Strike 83 and a direct-9 helicopter, although it was built in 2006 and designed much earlier, but its combat power is not too bad even today, and it can reach the mid-to-upper levels of frigates worldwide.
But this is, after all, a ship designed in the early 2000s, with weapons deployed to one side, with power systems and electronic radar equipment vastly different from the current mainstream frigates in the world, and with the same type of frigates in Europe already equipped with all-electric propulsion, small multifunctional phased array radars, and large helicopter decks, it is time to develop new models.
So how China's new frigates should develop is directly related to its future positioning and the strategic direction of our Chinese navy.
The future development of the Chinese navy is bound to become a blue-water navy, and the future is bound to be the ocean, with rapid deployment in areas where China's vital interests are closely linked, a show of force and, if necessary, a strong combat capability to ensure that China's vital interests in the region are not damaged, so it seems that the new Hu Weijiang will surely move towards large-scale and ocean-going development.
Looking at the positioning of the new frigates in the future Chinese Navy sequence, the future Chinese Navy should be similar to the US Navy, except for the necessary offshore defense vessels, other main ships will form carrier battle groups or amphibious assault ship strike groups as the case may be.
The role of the new frigate in the future carrier battle group should act as the anti-submarine main force and the positioning of the near and medium area, in the amphibious assault ship strike group should act as the escort ship class, so according to such demand the new frigate must have strong anti-submarine capability and a good mid-range area to empty the capability.
Based on the above positioning, we can boldly envision the general appearance of domestic frigates in the future.
In the first place, there will be a significant increase in the amount of water discharged from the current 054A frigate, which is expected to be in the form of an integrated electric propulsion system, consisting of a single QC280, which will be equipped with a QC280, which will be used for the launch and storage of the aircraft, as well as for the construction of a new type of aircraft, which will be used for the purpose of building a new type of aircraft, which will be used for the purpose of launching a new type of vehicle, which will be used for the purpose of launching a new type of vehicle, which will be used for the purpose of launching a new type of vehicle, which will be used for the purpose of launching a new type of vehicle, which will be used for the purpose of launching a new type of vehicle, which will be used in the form of an integrated power system, which will be used for the purpose of launching a new type of vehicle, which will be used in the form of an integrated power system, which will be maintained at a rate of about 30 per cent of the total number of aircraft, as well as in the case of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
As a result, the overall level of the new frigates will reach the current world class level, even compared with the United States FFG.
Of course, the above concept is only the author of the domestic new frigate conjecture, how we can only wait until the new frigate is under water, let us look forward to it together.

In recent years, the city has encouraged enterprises to take an active part in the construction of national, trade standards and regional group standards, and has awarded 300,000 yuan to enterprises that mainly or participate in the formulation of Zhejiang manufacturing group standards, and 500,000 yuan to enterprises that have passed Zhejiang manufacturing brand certification, the highest amount of the award in the province, which has inspired enterprises to participate in the enthusiasm for the subject matter.
A few days ago, Wang Li Group production workshop, the head of the group system, Gao Jian, together with the staff, is packing an anti-theft security door seal box, as participating in Zhejiang manufacturing group standards to meet the standard work samples, ready to be sent to Shaoxing Quality Testing Center.
Just two days ago, Wang Li has passed the "Zhejiang Manufacturing" certification expert group's on-site audit.
Gao said a professional team of industry technical experts and quality certification organizations praised the group's achievements in core areas such as quality excellence, autonomous innovation, and agreed to fully align the bid, with Wang Li next becoming one of the first companies to pass the standard as long as the product passes the test.
Wang Li Group is just a microcosm of the transformation and upgrading of the standard pry industry.

China's household debt ratio is closer to that of the United States than it is to not being able to afford a home is more frightening not to be in debt?
In recent times, we have been discussing the recent changes in real estate policy, whether the real estate policy should be loosened again? Land policy supply diversification, will not let the house price decline?
But at a time when we are worried about real estate prices, about macroeconomic regulation, and about the future of the real estate market, the People's Daily has written again, the last time we discussed the tone of the People's Daily commentary on real estate regulation, and now the People's Daily has written about a more serious topic than not being able to afford a home, is that even if you can afford a home, you can afford to pay the debt?
Today, we come to talk about a more serious problem than buying a home: Paying off a loan.
I. China's growing housing debt crisis
The overseas edition of the People's Daily published an opinion piece on January 17,"Awards and Loans: The Music and Worrying of the Struggle Youth," according to the data in the article, which showed that in November 2017, the China deleveraging Process Report for the Third Quarter, published by the National Financial and Development Laboratory of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences and the National Center for Balance Sheet Research, noted that leverage in the residential sector continued its upward trend, rising 1.3 percentage points from 47.4 percent in the second quarter of 2017 to 48.6 percent in the third quarter, and 3.8 percentage points in the first three quarters of 2017.
The resident sector accounts for a larger share of the debt in the entire real economy, and leverage is rising at a faster rate.
Studies have shown that Chinese households' liabilities in financial institutions are dominated by consumer loans, accounting for about two thirds of residents' liabilities and about two times as much as operating loans.
Among them, about 80 percent of the consumer loans are medium- and long-term loans dominated by home loans, but in incremental terms, short-term consumer loans are growing faster than medium- and long-term loans.
In addition, China's household debt ratio is only a statistic of the total amount of credit the household sector receives from financial institutions, while Chinese households have many private loans, including loans from relatives and friends, with large hidden debts.
It is striking to see such figures, which show that China's resident leverage ratio was only 3 per cent in 1996 and 18 per cent in 2008, but has begun to grow rapidly since 2008, doubling to 36.4 per cent in just six years, and reaching 48.6 per cent in the third quarter of 2017, according to statistics from the Suning Institute of Finance.
In May last year, HSBC released a survey of nearly tens of thousands of respondents across nine countries.
The report was aimed at the "millennial generation" of young people in nine countries (born between 1980 and 2000).
The report notes that China has a 70 per cent home ownership rate for young people after 80 or 90, well ahead of second-place Mexico (46 per cent) and two times the US target (35 per cent).
The data tell us the most likely problem is that the biggest potential "grey rhino" for Chinese residents at this stage is estimated to be out of debt, compared to not being able to afford a home.
Why is the housing debt crisis the most serious problem?
As we have previously analyzed, while we have been saying that China's house prices are higher, China's home ownership rate is actually quite high compared to the rest of the world, so the question for many friends now, I'm afraid, is whether you can afford a loan, rather than a high house price.
We look at the real estate market all over the world. China's real estate market, because of its late start, has not had a major real estate crisis, except for Hainan, as we said before, but the origins of the 2008 financial tsunami around the world just a decade ago were the real estate crisis in the United States.
And the US real estate crisis has been blamed on two houses: Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
In the golden age of the United States, real estate companies sold homes for extremely low down payments in order to expand sales to lower-income people in the United States at the time, and the housing market was booming at a time when the economy was going well, but not for long, and as growth stagnated in the United States, triggering a decline in homebuyers "incomes, a large chunk of household consumer spending began to fall.
At the time, however, the status quo in the United States was an integral part of the financial and real estate assets of American household assets, with almost all of the household assets of low-income groups in the United States being real estate, while most of the assets of the top 20 per cent of high-income groups were financial assets, resulting in a higher debt ratio for real estate of the poorer households in the United States.
A serious fact is that these people are buying homes when the economy is better, so the money to pay for the mortgage is also calculated on their better income, and when there is a downturn in income, the pressure on the mortgage has not diminished, even as some subprime schemes have become floating, so the real estate problems of these American families have evolved into a real estate crisis.
So someone can't afford a mortgage because their income is too low, so the bank starts to reclaim the property, and when the bank reclaims the property from the defaulting buyers, they sell it at a very low price, leading to a gradual decline in house prices in the region, a process that triggers a further decline in house prices, creating a vicious cycle in which more and more homebuyers find their homes are worth even less than their own loans, and more people stop repaying the mortgage and cause more bad loans.
As a result, a huge vicious circle has been formed:
"The economy is depressed - incomes are falling - some people can't afford a mortgage - banks are selling the homes of people who owe money cheaply - house prices are falling - more people are stopping repaying their mortgages - banks are selling again - house prices are falling again..."
And the problem is more than that, because of the continuing decline in house prices, it's not that you have no debt after you stop paying back the house to the bank, and if the money you get from the bank auctioning the house is not yet on the loan you owe to the bank, then you still need to pay it back, simply assuming that you used a down payment of 600,000, a loan of 2.4 million to buy a house that was worth 3 million at the time, and when the house price drops to just 2 million, you no longer pay back the house to the bank, and after the bank auctions the house, you not only lose your own down payment of 600,000, but also your debt of 400,000 to the bank, you still have to pay back the money.
So, in one vicious cycle after another, the US economy gradually collapsed, culminating in the US financial crisis of 2008.
It is therefore a matter of great vigilance that the current level of household debt in China, at 46.8 per cent, is still below the level of developed countries, but the problem is beginning to emerge, and the country has repeatedly stressed the issue of deleveraging since last year. This is a very prescient judgment. If the household debt ratio is allowed to continue to rise, it is bound to raise huge risks, so we must guard against financial risks.
So after the house is used to live, not to stir-fry positioning, the state has accelerated the establishment of multi-main supply, multi-channel security, rent and purchase, and other multiple measures to further defuse the potential risks.
For our individual families, we must give up real estate speculation thinking, buy a home when the capacity to do so, to avoid their own families into a huge burden, only a reasonable assessment of their income and debt levels is a healthy family wealth development path.

British inventor implanted chip in his own body, waved it in to get inside car
A British inventor has become the first person in the country to install a chip for himself, opening the front door of his home, entering his office and even starting his car with a single wave of his hand.
Steven Northam, 33, has a tiny chip implanted between his thumb and forefinger and is now offering the service to companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives, which his company BioTeq uses technology to do.
He has teamed up with Dr Jeff Watson, a senior consultant anaesthetist at the Royal Hampshire Hospital in Winchester, Hampshire, to ensure the implant process meets medical standards.
The technology is similar to cat and dog chip implants and takes just 30 seconds.
Mr Northam's company will also replace locks for rooms and vehicles to be compatible with the chip, costing £300 per lock.
The married father, who has a child, has now installed the technology for both his home and his BMW Z4, and he can start the car simply by putting his hand on the steering wheel.

White House props cost thousands
Last month, the White House decided to send a Marine helicopter to the South Lawn to highlight the great glory of American manufacturing, costing up to $24,000, according to military records released by Time magazine.
The green-and-white Sikorsky VH-3D, also known as Marine One when the president was on board, is an important exhibit at the White House's July 17 event highlighting construction projects in the United States.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and top White House officials toured manufactured products from all 50 states.
Exhibits include a Connecticut-made helicopter, a Maine yacht, a Wisconsin fire truck and a Mississippi forklift.
The White House military office asked the helicopter to appear on a daily order (FRAGO), just 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn for the "special" event, according to records from the Marine Corps Helicopter First Flight Team (HMX-1), the force responsible for operating the helicopter.
The day before the event, the HMX-1 commander said in an email sent to a superior Marine Corps flight deputy commander,"I just want to confirm that you know, because this event is highly valued."
The information indicates that the helicopter will arrive on the South Lawn at about 7am on July 17 for the 3pm event, leaving only after the lawn empties between 6pm and 9pm that evening.
The message also said that in the event of a delay in departure from the White House, the return flight would require a second crew because of the time limit on duty.
The original crew were on standby by the helicopter during the event, while security forces personnel were on standby nearby while the aircraft was on the ground.
Records obtained by Time magazine did not clearly indicate whether a second crew was ultimately needed.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using government property for political purposes.
The record notes that HMX-1 had asked if the event violated the bill.
"One question we asked was whether this violated the Hatch Act and were told there was no violation," the commander wrote.
"Sounds like you're locked up," the deputy commander replied.
The White House defined the "Made in America" event as an official event and therefore not subject to the Hatch Act.
But even official events carry political overtones.
At the event, the president pushed through what was then the Senate's agenda: Health care reform, and touted regulation of government regulations.
Using Marine One or Air Force One aircraft for political propaganda purposes is no longer new.
Successive presidents have been asked to travel on these planes.
But it is not common for them to be requisitioned for photo purposes only.
Trump was in the spotlight in February, when it was in Melbourne, Florida, that the presidential jet slowly skidded and eventually stopped to the background cloth of his first campaign rally, while his Twitter account was inundated with complaints about the former president's use of the presidential jet.
Deputy White House press spokeswoman Lindsey Walters said the White House was thrilled by the "Made in America" exhibition, which showcases products from all 50 states made by American workers using American materials.
The HMX-1 crew regularly conducts flight training near the Washington area and on the South Lawn, practicing to accurately place the U.S. president in the White House.
HMX-1 practiced 58 touchdowns at the White House during Trump's G-20 summit in Germany in early July.
An official said the U. S. manufacturing flight was included in crew training requirements this month.
The helicopter unit also flew an extra 11 hours of "non-presidential support missions" that day.
The White House said taxpayers did not bear the cost of any other props at the event.
A Sikorsky spokesman said the company was not involved in arranging the South Lawn helicopter display.
HMX-1 does not keep a budget record for presidential flights, so it is very difficult to determine the exact cost of the event.
But according to the Department of Defense's hourly expense records for fiscal year 2017, the Department of Defense reimbursement for VH-3D is $24,380 per flight hour.
The force recorded a 30-minute flight from the base of Marine Corps Airport in Quantico, Virginia.
The White House said the cost of operating the helicopter was far less than that.
Mr Walters said it was "very misleading to estimate the cost to taxpayers on the basis of refundable fees.
These estimates include personnel costs, maintenance costs and many other sunk costs included in the annual appropriation.
A 2015 RAND study showed that the Department of Defense's reimbursable costs did not include personnel costs, but did include fuel costs, maintenance costs and contracting costs.
At the time, former White House press spokesman Sean Spicer defended the use of the helicopter at the event,
"The idea is to show what's made in the United States this week," he said.
And I know that Sikorsky and Connecticut are proud of it, and they both contribute to our national security, and I guess hundreds of jobs depend on it, if not thousands.
And I feel like, like most Americans, we are proud of this helicopter and other military equipment, the result of countless Americans who have worked tirelessly to make it.
So it's certainly not an anachronism to highlight this."
We don't know if Trump interacted with the helicopter as he toured the South Lawn at the event, but he did get in the driver's seat of the fire truck.
Inside the White House, Trump addressed representatives of the Sikorsky company, joking with the media about the company's planes, which he owns himself.
He said,"I know Sikorsky very well. I have three."

From 2005 to 2011, the province's GDP rose from the middle to the bottom of the table, according to the Market Star newspaper.
However, the economic growth of our province still suffers from low investment efficiency and lack of core competitiveness of the industrial economy. To this end, the latest issue of the Economic Blue Page of the provincial economic information center recommends improving the quality and efficiency of economic growth.
On the basis of some representative indicators of the economy of our province in 2005 and 2011, it is compared with the national and central regions.
In terms of industrial economic benefits, in 2011, a significant proportion of energy-consuming industries, such as industrial energy and raw materials, were affected by market fluctuations and the "double pressure" of overcapacity. At the same time, the lack of innovation in leading industries, such as home appliances and automobiles, resulted in meagre profits.
And a large amount of investment did not bring the corresponding economic benefits, which is the main reason that the quality and efficiency of economic growth in our province is not high.
In this regard, experts suggest that effective measures should be taken to encourage enterprise innovation, and the scientific and technological achievements of colleges and universities and scientific research institutes should be transferred to enterprises in a timely manner.
For industrial economic benefit is not high, experts say, we should also actively promote industrial merger and reorganization, optimize industrial layout, and extend the industrial chain.

GMB to focus on investment targeting McVitie's Glasgow plant
The union wants the management of biscuit maker McVitham to pledge a long-term commitment to production at the Lasgow plant.
The company has been silent on the future of investment in the Tollcross plant, according to the Scottish branch of the UK's General Trade Union.
The factory, which has more than 500 employees, makes products such as oatmeal biscuits (Hobnobs), thick tea biscuits (Rich tea biscuits).
Pladis, the owner of McVay's company, said it had invested more than £5m in the plant over the past few years.
He added that staff and union representatives "will be the first to know" if there are changes to factory operations.
In a letter to the company's factory director, the Scottish branch of the UK's General Trade Union called on Mr McVay to "address the issue of money not being carried over to modernise the production line."
"Our members are deeply concerned that we have not been able to get a clear picture of the future business needs and investment plans of Tollcross from the general manager of the plant," said Drew Duffy, senior organiser of the UK General Trade Union.
Generations of families work here, and the high concentration of labour in local communities and the Greater Glasgow area is an important pillar of decent employment in areas with high unemployment and social deprivation.
So in terms of jobs, pay and economic prosperity, in the context of Brexit, rising living costs and a prolonged decline in manufacturing, the east of Glasgow desperately needs McVay to expand his production network."
A spokesman for Pladys said: "The director of Tollcross has just received a letter from the Scottish branch of the UK General Union yesterday and the company will respond immediately as we value ongoing engagement with employees and union representatives.
Two months ago, we had a regular meeting at Tollcross with staff and representatives of the UK General Trade Union to discuss a number of issues publicly.
We had discussions with staff and then, like all other companies operating in an environment of intense competition and economic uncertainty, we reviewed the ongoing operating model that we applied to businesses and factories in order to remain competitive.
She added: "We have invested more than £5m in the Tollcross plant in recent years, particularly in production lines and operational improvements.
We are fully aware of Tollcross's historic position as a production base and staff and union representatives will be the first to know if there are any changes to our operations at the plant."

Serie A may regret throwing an olive branch at Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain will not give up on signing Neymar after making a £189million offer to try to get him to exercise his immunity clause, but did they warn Barcelona three years ago to launch an attack on the world-record raiders?

Barcelona are furious at the way Neymar has attacked and barged his way out, with sources with knowledge of the Catalan team's board insisting the club have gone to great lengths to look after him since his arrival from Santos in 2013.
But did the Paris Saint-Germain chairman make such predictions about the football world three years ago?
When City expressed an interest in signing Blaise Matteidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi issued a stern warning to any club that wanted to sign Paris Saint-Germain's best player.
"I'm not worried because they know that if they touch any of our players, we will definitely be in tit-for-tat with them and we will be in touch with their players as well," Alhelaifi said.
'We respect all the clubs.
But if they're trying to sign our players, then they're going to take it upon themselves, too.""
