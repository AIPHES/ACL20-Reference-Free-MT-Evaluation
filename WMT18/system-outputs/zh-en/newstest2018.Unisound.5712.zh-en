Civil rights groups issue travel warning against Missouri
The American Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) issued a travel warning to people of color preparing to travel to Missouri because of discriminatory policies and racist attacks in Missouri.
"The NAACP Missouri Travel Advisory, effective August 28, 2017, calls for all African American travelers, tourists and Missourians to pay special attention and exercise extreme caution when traveling in Missouri as a result of the recent series of suspected racial incidents in Missouri," the group's statement declared.
The NAACP noted that a recently passed Missouri law makes it harder for people to win discrimination lawsuits, and that state law enforcement is partly targeting minorities, phenomena that have prompted the group to issue travel warnings.
Civil rights violations are happening to people.
They were stopped and questioned, beaten or killed because of the color of their skin, "Rod Chappell, president of the Missouri NAACP, told the Kansas City Star.
"We have received a number of complaints, an unprecedented number." "
It was the first such warning issued by the group against a state in the United States.
The group cited racial slurs against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, a 28-year-old black male from Tennessee.
Sanders, who died under suspicious circumstances earlier this year, ran out of fuel while traveling in Missouri and was taken into custody by Missouri police without charge of a crime.
The advisory also noted that a recent report by the Missouri attorney general's office showed that "black drivers in the state are 75 percent more likely to be stopped and frisked than whites."
"The consultation was to raise awareness and warn their families, friends and colleagues about what could happen in Missouri," Chappell said.
"People need to be prepared, whether it's carrying bail to Missouri or letting relatives know they're traveling in the state."
According to the most recent data from the FBI's hate crime reporting program, Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015; the state ranks 16th nationally based on the volume of crimes.
The travel warning is also a response to a new Missouri law that would make it harder to prosecute businesses for housing or employment discrimination.
The move comes after states passed immigration enforcement laws requiring local law enforcement to detain people for immigration violations, a move the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) said would increase the number of racial lawsuits and issued a travel advisory for Texas and Arizona.
Travel warnings are typically issued by the U.S. government against other countries, but more recently, advisory groups have taken this approach in response to certain laws and trends within the United States.
After a "golden age" of surging box office sales in 2015, the overall movie market in 2016 has entered a lull, and whether it can beat last year's total of 44,069 million yuan is a cliffhanger.
According to data released by the National Bureau of Statistics, the price of new and second-hand homes in Beijing both cooled in October, rising by just 0.6% and 1.1%.

The BBC says Beijing is the most exciting city: making foreigners feel like they are "living in a new era"
Beijing may have a long history of 3,000 years, but it is also fast becoming the modern glamour city it is today, British media said.
The Chinese capital, with its astonishingly high-speed internet, cutting-edge technology such as face-recognition software, huge investment in artificial intelligence and unrivalled international energy, is one of the most exciting cities for adventurous foreigners.
"If I can make it there, I can make it anywhere in the future," German expat Clemens Sethi said, quoting the lyrics of singer Frank Sinatra singing the praises of New York City.
"If Sinatra were alive today, he'd probably be singing about a city like Beijing," said Sethi, who works as creative director at Traveller File magazine, noting that living in the city makes you feel like "living in a new era" and can always keep up.
Simon Norton, who is based in England but recently lives in Beijing, wrote on the personal blog site 4cornes 7 seas: "There is a general feeling of being at the centre of something grand, which is hard to say, but it keeps many foreigners there for a long time. They want to see what it becomes and want to witness it for themselves."
The city's quality high-speed Internet and technology-friendly environment make everyday life easier than ever, the report said.
"Beijing is rapidly transforming into a cashless society, with the Internet integrating the functionality of traditional wallets into smartphones, making it easier for everyone to make many transactions," said Andy Pe√±a Fuerte, who is from Manila and currently serves as deputy editor in chief at the Beijing Children's Website.
But smartphones are just the beginning of Beijing's technological ambitions, and facial recognition software has become so popular that many mobile apps use the technology to make bank transfers and payments, get people into apartments and offices, and even use it to verify the identity of the driver of a net-rental car, the report said.
Beijing also recently announced plans to spend 13.8 billion yuan to build an artificial intelligence technology park that will be home to more than 400 companies that will focus on developing artificial intelligence technologies ranging from biometrics to self-driving cars.
Food is also at the heart of many of China's major festivals over the years, and participation in these celebrations is highly regarded by foreigners, with the Spring Festival being the most important social and economic holiday and one of the easiest for foreigners to take part in.
"I recommend helping Chinese friends prepare for the Chinese New Year, cleaning their apartments and posting red couplets with New Year's greetings on their homes," he said. "On New Year's Eve, all family members gather together for a big meal and then wait until midnight to welcome the New Year with loud fireworks.
The number of foreigners in Beijing is large and growing, but language barriers in China and the ease of communication among expatriates could easily serve as an excuse for not fully integrating into local culture, the report said.
"Some foreigners have been living in China for years but have little experience of their host country, and if your initial attempts to reach out to the Chinese don't count as a success, it's easy to get a sense of whether it's easier to get along with other foreigners," Sethi said.
In these so-called "foreigner bubbles" (meaning that foreigners mix only among foreigners and have no contact with locals and local cultures), foreigners huddle in their own communities, eat in Western restaurants and have only foreigners among their friends.
The easiest way to overcome this is to learn a bit of Mandarin - which is simpler than one might think.
"An hour or two a week of private lessons in Chinese or learning an entry-level radio play should suit everyone's busy schedule," says Sethi.
Learning even a few classic short sentences can help with shopping, ordering a meal at a restaurant, or gossiping in a taxi.
Stubborn air pollution is also a fact of daily life, the report said, though in recent years the government has struggled to contain some of the problems.
Residents stress that it is important to get outdoors during warmer months when pollution is often lighter, using the blue sun as an opportunity to wander through historic hutongs or explore the popular Ritan Park.
"Beijing is the Chinese city that finds the most things below the surface, and you can find great art and music activities, indulgent nightlife, historical wonders, ultra-modern business districts and ancient Hutong districts," Norton said.
According to the report, the effect of aging on the growth of human capital is becoming more and more obvious, especially in northeast China, where the annual contribution of aging to the growth of human capital is 1.28%.
Pan pointed out that the current risk of cross-border capital flows can be controlled, the fundamental factors supporting the balance of payments still exist for a long time.
Beijing, Dec 17 (reporter Gao kai) The World is resplendent with heritage - the 2016 International Summit Forum on the restoration and protection of ancient Chinese painting and calligraphy opened on December 17 at Renmin University of China.
The European Commission accused Google in April of forcing handset makers to pre-install software such as Google search and the Chrome browser, otherwise they would not be allowed to use other Google apps.
The European Commission argues that the move is detrimental to consumers and hinders competition.
EU regulators initially asked Google to respond by July 27.
If convicted on antitrust charges, Google faces a fine of up to 10% of its global revenue, about $7.4 billion.
Google was not immediately available for comment.
Google is also facing an EU investigation for favouring its own shopping service in its search results.

A graphic read: Bitcoin's legal status around the world
Abstract: in addition to the price correction triggered by the nature of speculation, the current digital currency slump also has something to do with the "old enemy" - regulatory risk.
From a visual map, the eastern countries are more conservative than the West, with the dominant global players still waiting to see the legitimacy of the digital currency, representing the "black swan risk" that remains large.
* This article is from Wall Street News (micro-credit id: Wall Street cn), editor Wang Mu. For more information, please visit WallStreetcn.com or download the Wall Street News app. *
The global digital currency, led by bitcoin, has been bloodied since the start of the week as regulatory storms in major bitcoin markets such as China, South Korea and the European Union piled up, sending the price of bitcoin tumbling below the $10,000 psychological integer level on Tuesday and its biggest daily drop in three years.
In addition to the speculative nature of the price correction, the current digital currency slump has also been linked to the "old enemy" - regulatory risk.
At this important juncture, the visual big data site Howmuch. net has produced a map showing the extent to which bitcoin is legitimate and regulated in countries around the world.
As shown below, Green represents a legitimate market for bitcoin; orange represents a neutral market, which has not yet publicly legalized Bitcoin status, but there are no major restrictions on its use; pale pink represents a restricted market, where local governments try to approach the use of digital currency through red line policy or regulation; deep pink represents a country where Bitcoin is defined as illegal; and Grey is a country that has yet to comment.
(pictured above from the howmuch.net visualization team charting on January 15)
The paper points out that the non-green color distribution in the picture shows that the traditional eastern countries have a more conservative attitude to the special currency than the West.
Russia is by far the largest country to define bitcoin as illegal, China is one of the largest restricted markets for bitcoin, and India is one of the largest countries where bitcoin has yet to comment and no policies have been put in place.
North America and Western Europe are the regions with the highest acceptance of the special currency, namely, the distribution of the green block is more concentrated.
There is a marked divergence in views of the special currency in the Middle East and Latin America, where the color distribution is more mixed.
Among them, Iraq, Iran, Turkey, Brazil are all legitimate bitcoin markets, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Bolivia and others have some degree of restrictions on their transactions and use, and more Latin American countries have yet to speak out against the currency.
Taken together, the data show that, of the 246 countries surveyed globally, 99 (or 40 per cent) do not impose restrictions on the trading and use of the special currency, i.e., green and orange areas.
Seven countries (or 3 per cent) are restricted markets (pale pink), 10 Countries (or 4 per cent) define bitcoin as illegal (dark pink), and 130 countries (or 53 per cent) have yet to treat digital currency information more (GREY).
This suggests that countries with a global majority (53%, more than half) are still waiting to see the legitimacy of the digital currency, led by Bitcoin, within their borders, and that bitcoin's "black swan risk" remains high, as some of these countries may eventually make legislative decisions to limit the digital currency.
The article argues that global regulators do not yet fully understand the emerging category of digital currencies, and may be the main reason why most countries have yet to make a statement.
While bitcoin's "popularity" has grown exponentially since last year and is not of interest to all countries, it may be that some are concerned that the local legal currency is under threat as a result, or are more worried that the digital currency is being exploited by criminal organizations.
Wall Street has written a detailed summary of international regulatory news on bitcoin since last week, including China's crackdown on online platforms and mobile apps for centralized services on over-the-counter exchanges, South Korea's continued consideration of shutting down digital currency exchanges, the European Union's belief that Bitcoin is not yet widely accepted and warning investors of the risk of "losing their money."
The Wall Street editor's pick "\ 124; 2018: the world's central mother opens the year of digital money?" has said that, in terms of regulation, acceptance / criticism, and adoption, 2018 will be the year of the digital currency for the world's central banks.
Major powers such as Russia's criticism of bitcoin's legitimacy is also intended to pave the way for the official issuance of digital currencies.
Madrid, Jan 8 (XINHUA) -- Barcelona recruit Philippe Coutinho made his debut in a Barcelona shirt at the Nou Camp on Tuesday.
Coutinho passed Barca's medical that morning and signed with Barcelona president Bartomeu on a contract that is due to expire in the summer of 2023.
He was then unveiled as a Barcelona player in front of nearly 7,000 fans at the Nou Camp.
According to Spanish media, Coutinho's total transfer fee, or 160 million euros (1 euro is about 7.77 yuan), is the Barca club and La Liga history of the first value.
With Coutinho still injured, he will need to rest for the next 20 days to make his debut in a Barcelona shirt.

Now Trump's White House is taking aim at the Statue of Liberty
The most sure sign of regime change was when they began to attack the statue.
Americans agree with this as much as anyone, so Saddam Hussein in Baghdad's Paradise Square was deliberately bulldozed in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the key think tanks in the Trump administration, must have known what would happen to his symbolic axe to the Statue of Liberty as he sparred with CNN's Jim Acosta over the president's proposal for strict limits on legal immigration.
To be fair, Miller did not attack the statue itself.
If he did, a group of cruise ship owners and liberal followers would be sure to eat him alive.
But he did attack the significance of the statue, especially when Emma Lazarus's famous poem was inscribed on a pedestal in 1903 (the monument was built 17 years later).
As Miller scolded acosta: "I don't want to talk about the full facts of history here, but the Statue of Liberty is a symbol of American liberty lighting up the world...
The poem you are referring to, which was added later, is not part of the original Statue of Liberty.
In fact, Miller is right, but as he himself said, it's not really about history.
This involves a modern echo of the Lazarus scare, the only country that seems to invite not just any old immigrant, but also the poorest of the poor: "Your tired, your destitute, or your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, / suffering people rejecting your crowded beaches."
There is no such thing as "the suffering man refuses" at a moment when our screens become more glaring.
Miller, who has not worked in literary review, made it clear that these people would not be welcome in America in the age of Trump.
This conflict over the meaning of statues is part of a broader political and cultural war: it's actually in conflict with the American spirit.
Lazarus, and her friends, who held events after her death to inscribe her verses on a pedestal, are well aware of the highly political nature of the acts they are taking part in.
The sculpture aims to express the connection between French and American republicanism through ancient, classic tropes as the female incarnation of the Statue of Liberty.
Lazarus changed this meaning: in her poems, the female figure is no longer abstract, she wants to be vocal.
She gave herself a very different name: the mother of exile.
The combination of the poem and the painting was a successful feminist coup, and a devastating blow to American nativism.
Just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, the right winger has always wanted to change it back to its original meaning.
The great speaker, Rush Limbaugh, a Baptizer of Trump's advent, argued in 2010 that liberalism was not inviting anyone, and that he was now an early neoconservative, bringing the flame of American wisdom to the benighted world: "The Lady of Liberty is invincible."
She was meant to carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
The torch is not the way to light up America. "
Unusually, limbo was actually struck by something.
The significance of the statue depends entirely on the perspective of cognition.
Lazarus's highly imaginative approach is to be able to see it, when the tired, poor but hopeful will be able to see it on the ship's deck after a long and often terrifying journey.
On the face of it, this involves looking at the world from the perspective of those who seek asylum and have the opportunity to improve their lives.
Her statue conveys to them and needs the meaning of the hope and welcome that they hear.
Of course, that's not a view that Miller and Trump ever wanted to admit.
They torch not to light the way, but to ignite the hatred that is their only source of power.

World Championships 2017: Neil Black praises Scotland players in Great Britain squad
Eilidh Doyle recalls a time when there were only two Scots in the English national team.
Neil Black, executive director of UK Athletics, said a contingent of 16 strong Scots in the World Championships team would make a "huge contribution to the national team."
A record number of Scottish field athletes have been selected for the 2017 Athletics World Championships in London, which opens on Friday.
Black believes that "Scotland is making an extraordinary development" and that British track and field athletes must learn from it.
"We accept and try to understand that, and we'll stick with it until we're successful," Black said.
"I talk to the people at the Scottish Institute of Sport. They think it has something to do with what they do.
Scottish track and field athletes think it has something to do with what they do.
British Athletics think it has something to do with what they do.
Even people on the street think so.
Whatever the case, it was brilliant.
A number of Scottish track and field athletes are medal contenders, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart, who will face Mo Farah in the 5,000m, while Eilidh Doyle has been selected by the panel as captain.
"Erid is a little modest.
Her captain's speech was incredible, "Black said.
"Many track and field athletes, whether they are Scottish or not, or wherever they live or train, walk out the door with pride and energy.
Erid is very good with his natural passion and true feelings.
The Commonwealth silver medallist, who competed in the 400m hurdles in his fifth world championships, said it was "incredible" to have 16 Scots in the British team.
Previously, the maximum number of Scottish track and field athletes taking part in the World Series was seven, the number of entries achieved in 1983 and 2015.
Muir, the leading runner, has set five British and two European records in the past year.
She will compete in the 1500m and 5,000m events.
Chris O'Hare, who competes in the 1500m, is another Scot to watch, having previously had a good season, winning the British national against qualifiers and the Olympic Anniversary Games respectively.
Doyle recalled going to her first world championships when the only other Scot on the team was Lee McConnell.
The captain said she was deeply proud that so many of her compatriots would not only join the team but, in some cases, challenge for medals and compete to reach the final.
"What's special about being captain of the national team is that it's voted for by the rest of the national team, so it's a great privilege for me to know that your teammates voted for you to go for a highly unusual achievement, anyway," she added.
"Of course, I am very proud of all the Scottish players.
It just shows how far we've come.
And they are all established track and field athletes here who are about to make their way to the podium.
How was my captain's speech?
Well, I think it's fantastic.
I was just referring to the fact that we are very lucky in this situation because we have the world championships at home.
So it really matters that we have the home support and that we have been able to grow as a result of going back to the Olympic Stadium.
I will get a second chance to compete and the atmosphere will be fantastic.

Block critics on facebook: if you can't stand the censure of voters, don't run for office
The father of our nation understood the ways of the bad press.
Americans love Washington, but it wasn't long before newspapers began lashing out at him for everything from domestic policies to political principles.
He bristles at the criticism, no doubt about it.
But he did not silence the critics.
Because back in 1783, Washington said, "Freedom of speech is denied - and we will be slaughtered in silence and ignorance like lambs."
Which brings me to Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, who needs to learn from Washington.
Hogan's staff blocked and deleted posts from at least 450 people for posting their views on his official Facebook page.
The American Civil Liberties Union filed a lawsuit against him earlier this week.
The governor's staff thought the lawsuit was sloppy, and online reports were rife with their backlash: "Who cares?"
A lot of people say "it's just Facebook."
But, it's important.
That's especially important because it's up against the likes of Hogan.
This is a Republican who has served as governor in a state with a Democratic majority, and he is surprisingly popular.
Of the 50 governors in the country, he received the second highest praise.
Hogan is not a reactionary edgy.
He is smoothly in charge of Maryland and strictly abides by the rules.
He is also very good at using Facebook as a primary way to connect with voters, jokingly showing off his post-chemotherapy bald head for the first time on his home page.
So it is completely unnecessary and ultimately dangerous to screen people who come to the governor's home page, which is a public forum and an official management platform touted by members of the public who pay their taxes.
In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan's spokeswoman, Amelia Sasse, defended the governor's actions, saying she thought blocking their comments was simply an attempt to get them to hold back.
But they are too quick to describe it as a scourge or a cynic sweeping the web.
The Washington Post has spoken face-to-face with people who have been blocked by Hogan.
They are just ordinary people talking to their elected leaders: they are teachers, small business owners and pastors, not a scourge.
They have said that their comments have depth, respect, and do not go down.
The priest quoted from the Bible in his post, calling on Hogan to remember his Catholic faith.
Lakshmi Salma Lamani, a barrister in Bowie, Maryland, wasn't cynical, but she asked questions about hate crimes.
'I politely commented that I was disappointed that he did not respond to hate crimes and other recent news events,' she wrote in the comments section of The Washington Post's news story.
I also don't like a group of people commenting on the same topic, because they will be directly ignored by some as a so-called herd mentality, rather than as a group of concerned citizens. "
What the governor's staff called a "dense bombardment of junk information" may seem to others to be "sticking to the claim."
The Facebook era has made it easy to modify a message, simply by blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment.
And it is far cleaner than in the past, when the same effect was achieved by sending staff out to collect and burn critical newspapers or to arrest or silence protesters.
But that is exactly what is happening now, but on a digital level.
Hogan is not the first public official to be accused of silencing others on Facebook and other social media.
President Trump is being sued by Twitter users for blocking them on Twitter.
There was a landmark ruling last week in Virginia on such issues.
The chairman of the Loudoun County Board of Supervisors violated the First Amendment by blocking voters from her Facebook page, according to U.S. District Judge James C. Kataris of Alexandria.
Kentucky Gov. Matt Bevin (R) has also been patronized by the American Civil Liberties Union for his use of Facebook and Twitter.
It shouldn't be this hard.
In the Washington era, affordable postage and the Internet had a similar influence.
The number of news newspapers quadrupled between 1776 and 1800, and others wrote anonymous letters fiercely critical of his leadership.
And even then, Washington had an anonymous scourge on him.
Pseudonyms such as yurikla, Varelius, pelarius, borgius, etc., were used to write letters to the newspaper to harshly criticize Washington's decision-making.
According to historical documents collected by the George Washington newspaper's online project, his office was inundated with petitions criticizing his attitude to the Treaty of Amity, Commerce and Navigation between His Majesty the King of England and the United States of America, which he signed with Britain.
But he did not silence them.
Freedom of speech, freedom of dissent and freedom of speech are the foundations of this country.
And real leaders need to accept that.
The property market a trace of the wind and grass are affecting people's sensitive nerve.
Limited purchase is a hard bar of real estate control policy in many cities.
In May 2017, Jinan issued provisions for undergraduate students to pay social security for half a year, can enjoy local permanent residents the same home purchase policy;
In June, Wuhan issued a policy that stipulates that college students can be settled within three years of graduation with their diplomas and employment certificates.
Then the policy increases, the official said, "University students can buy a house at 20% below the market price";
In July, Chengdu issued regulations, foreign university bachelor's degree or above young talent, with the graduation card can apply to settle in Chengdu.
In addition, there are Kunshan, Shanghai, and other cities or regions have also introduced "the introduction of talent" related policies, the purchase of talent to lower the threshold.
Zhang Hongwei believes that this is actually the major cities for the population, especially talent competition, to retain the population, especially talent, the city is competitive, which is the most important significance of these real estate policies.
Some even believe that this means that the property market "limited purchase" cancellation of the time has come.
The director said on the same day that the project has a long history, the first adaptation of the script was in 1999, and even prepared to look for Jin Chengwu to play Yan 13.
Ronan Lafferty is looking forward to enjoying a homecoming at the Renaissance Club
The East Lothian Renaissance Club hosts the 25th Evergreen Scottish Open and former European champion Ronan Lafferty will enjoy a homecoming over the next three days.
The Northern Irishman, who led Archerfield Links, next door, to the final last year but lost out to Paul Ils, now works for the new venue, representing Jerry Sarwati, the club's founder and chief executive, as an ambassador for the event.
Lafferty said: "I witnessed the founding of the Renaissance Club and we will also witness its glory through this tournament.

It's the perfect stage to show this pitch. ""
Englishman Ilse is looking to defend his title for the first time, although in a 32-year career he has won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour.
The shorsport athlete said: "it was really, really special.
I didn't defend the Estelle Madura Open because it was called off in the second year of my win.
It feels amazing to be in this place,
It's wonderful to play golf here.
Memories of last year emerged one by one, and for me and my wife, Sharon, winning last year had a special meaning for us.
That was really a special memory that we will remember forever. ""
Returning to his native land to compete is Gary Orr, who turned 50 earlier this year and then played on the evergreen European Tour.
This time it was his first Scottish event since the 2013 Scottish Open.
Mr Orr, of Helensburgh, said: "it always makes more sense to play back home,
You want to do well; but you can feel that extra pressure.
I'm really enjoying being able to play again, I've been playing golf.
I'm happy with the way things are at the moment. ""
Joining the field trio were former Masters winner Ian Woosnam and evergreen winner Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
A total of six Scottish athletes on the field, Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance were two of them, while the other four were Andrew O'Driscoll, Stephen McAllister, Bill Lang and Ross Drummond.

In August, a total of 57 consecutive daily penalties were imposed nationwide, and a new amendment to the Environmental Protection Law implemented earlier this year significantly increased China's environmental law enforcement, said Zou Shoumin, director of the Environmental Monitoring Bureau of the Ministry of Environmental Protection in Beijing.
At present, environmental protection authorities in various parts of China can investigate and deal with environmental violations by means of punishment such as continuous punishment on a daily basis, seizure, suspension of production, and transfer of administrative detention, and cooperate with judicial organs in punishing environmental crimes.
In August, a total of 335 seizure and seizure cases were carried out in various parts of China, 177 cases of production restriction and suspension of production were carried out, 189 cases of administrative detention were transferred and 166 cases of suspected environmental pollution crimes were transferred, Zou said.
Among them, Henan carries out by day continuous punishment 7, at present, China is from the end control to the whole embedding, comprehensive afterburner environmental pollution control.
Despite the downward pressure on the economy, China's Environmental Protection Ministry has previously made it clear that China should properly handle the positioning of environmental protection in economic development, strengthen its "green power," and the lower the rate of economic growth, the less it will be able to relax environmental protection, and give full play to the optimized effect of environmental protection on the economy.

She rarely even uses a pot.
Her log cabin is located in Enarottali, the capital of Panai County in Indonesia's Papua province, the housewife usually just puts a sweet potato - referred to by locals as "nota" - directly into the fire.
Half an hour later, the charred sweet potato was eagerly taken out by a pair of unwashed hands and devoured.
Daijie sits on the mud - she has no furniture, and this is where she does her daily chores, such as washing clothes, which are so muddy the water is from the nearby marshes.
There was a bucket in a room without a roof, and this was the outdoor toilet.
She was the youngest of her husband's four wives, so she was not assigned to the field for care.
Polygamy is common here.
Of course it's dangerous to work to a party: most of the men in the village don't have jobs, and a lot of them are dead drunk, plus there are a lot of soldiers here.
"No one dares to walk around the village after 5pm," she said.
It was a rare glimpse into everyday life in the highlands of Papua, once a Dutch colony that was incorporated into Indonesia after the 1969 referendum, but that referendum was also highly controversial, when only 1,026 elders were forced to vote by show of hands in front of the troops occupying the site.
The current campaign for independence and against Dutch rule was quick to point the finger at the Jakarta government, which imposed repressive rule on the region and cut off foreign journalists and rights activists.
In 2003, the province officially split into Papua and West Papua provinces, while Papua New Guinea independently controlled the eastern part of the island.
Ennarotari is remote and uninhabited; to get here it takes a 90-minute flight from the provincial capital, Jayapura, to nabi√©, and a five-hour rental car ride, with its stomach turned upside down.
There is no public transport here.
In this town of about 19,000 people, the wooden houses are surrounded by bamboo fences, and the crumpled tin roofs are all kinds of tan coverings made of rust.
There are few Indonesians, let alone journalists, and few foreigners.
Before the arrival of Christian missionaries, Mee Pago Papuans believed in a god called Uga Tamee.
There are other changes here, too.
"We can't get used to these clothes," Daijie said, referring to her brightly colored hand-knitted headscarf, dark shirt and bright half-skirt.
"We used to cover our bodies with only leaves."
Papua is the poorest province in Indonesia, where 28 per cent of people live below the poverty line and the region with the highest infant mortality and lowest literacy rates in Asia.
But this is also the Golden State of Indonesia.
Located in the Highlands, Panai County, roughly the same size as New Jersey and home to 153,000 people, is just 60 miles from Glassberg, the world's largest and most profitable gold mine, which is owned by Felipe MacMoran Copper Gold, a company based in Phoenix.
In 2015 alone, Felipe mined an estimated $3.1 billion worth of gold and copper mines here.
In addition, Papua is rich in timber resources, with an estimated value of $78 billion.
But these rich resources are also a source of tragedy for Papuans, and Indonesia's powerful military has been able to keep them down.
A 2005 New York Times investigative report showed that Felipe paid nearly $20 million to local military personnel and troops between 1998 and 2004, up to $150,000 for one official alone.
The Papuans' growing desire for independence threatened the Golden Master, and they were subjected to cruel treatment.
More than half a million Papuans have been killed since 1969, and thousands have been raped, tortured and imprisoned by the Indonesian military, according to rights activists.
The mass killings in the tribal highlands of Papua in the 1970s have escalated into genocide, according to the Asian Human Rights Commission.
Last year alone, Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful protesters.
A 2016 report by the Catholic Archdiocese of Brisbane, "We Will Lose Everything," included testimony to the previous year's egregious abuses, such as extrajudicial executions, torture - another report said rape and electrocution were particularly common - and a brutal crackdown on peaceful demonstrations.
"Violence is happening on a daily basis, so it is difficult to count the number of victims," said Andreas Halsono, an Indonesia researcher at Human Rights Watch.
Papua's resources brought in large numbers of migrants from outside Indonesia, and the oppression began.
83% of the province's 3.5 million people are Christian, but the demographics of Muslim economic migrants have changed since they arrived from the densely populated islands of Java, Kalimantan, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
The Javanese snack stand sells fried chicken and vegetables mixed with gadoga, served with peanut butter.
The locals fought hard.
Apop Yu, a 24-year-old Panai native who moved to the provincial capital, Jayapura, to find a job, explained that "those immigrants started selling chicken and vegetables in traditional markets at lower prices than local Papuans.
This has caused the local Papuans - the Papuan women - to lose their market. "
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, often referred to as Jokowi, vowed during his 2014 election campaign to tackle inequality and abuses in Papua.
The one-time carpenter's path to the presidential palace in Jakarta was supported by 27 of all 29 districts - including Panai.
But nothing has changed in Papua, and today, the locals feel betrayed.
Yoo said "we are heartbroken, and in 2014 we voted for Jokowi in the hope that he will fulfil our wishes and restore fairness."
In fact, just two months after Jokowi took office in October, Paniyie suffered his worst nightmare.
On December 7, 2014, 11 children in Ennaroli were singing Christmas carols in front of a bonfire outside when two Indonesian soldiers suddenly rushed over on a motorbike.
The frightened children told them they should turn on their headlights.
One of the soldiers was unhappy with their tone and then returned with four soldiers, according to local priest Arvit Tebbi.
Victims and witnesses said the drunken soldiers chased the group of children with their gun butts.
One of the soldiers then opened fire on the group of children.
Yulianus Yemmer, 16, was left in a coma after being badly beaten.
A few hours later, a huge fire broke out in the building of the election commission, a nearby government agency, and the incident escalated the next day.
About 1,000 young Papuan men, women and children gathered at a football stadium in front of the local police station and military command center to demand justice.
Armed with a ceremonial hunting bow, they danced the Waita of the Papua Mee Pago tribe - running in circles and mimicking the song of birds.
Some of the protesters began to throw stones at regular military posts.
As emotions continued to intensify, soldiers received orders via internal radio: "If the crowd resists more than three times, shoot immediately," according to an official document seen by TIME magazine, but the document was not released to local media.
Jeremias Qayamu, 56, was the head of the Enarottali Kego Koto block and, sensing imminent danger, called on the crowd to be calm and pleaded with them to go home.
But no one was in the mood to listen to him.
Standing on the porch of his brightly coloured wooden house, he told Time magazine that "when I looked back, I suddenly got shot in the left wrist."
Kayamu still does not know who fired the shots, but he said the bullets came from among the assembled soldiers.
He added that "it was crowded at the time, they fired a lot of shots."
He witnessed the shooting and saw Orfyus Yor shot three times in the body, according to the cousin of local man Orfyus Yor.
Yohanes sadly told Time magazine, "I ran over to check his body to see if it was him,
I found out he was dead... and I kissed him. ""
Papua Police Chief Inspector Yogi Mende told reporters that his subordinates were only "protecting" the police station because it had been attacked.
"When someone threatens to kill us, we have to defend ourselves," said Police Chief pugio sullistio, a spokesman for Papua police in 2015.
It's a matter of life and death.
Five young protesters were killed and many more injured, according to Human Rights Watch.
The next day news of the killing spread only slowly in Jakarta.
Three weeks later, Jokowi gave an emotional speech in Jayapura, expressing deep sympathy for the victims "families and vowing to address abuses left over from Papua's history.
"I hope this case will be resolved as soon as possible so that this doesn't happen again in the future," he said.
In October 2016 Security Minister Wiranto said he was setting up a non-judicial mechanism to address the historical legacy of human rights abuses.
But the excuse to push off sounded almost immediately.
"Most of the violations took place a long time ago," he said.
Some were in the 90s and early 2000s.
The point is that we are committed to addressing these violations, but it needs to be a process. "
Then on June 5 in Jakarta, Virando hit back when he spoke to Time magazine, saying he had no plans to set up a grievance mechanism in Papua.
Instead, he said, "Everything will be resolved in accordance with the law."
The United Nations has filed a complaint against Velando for "crimes against human rights" over the deaths of more than 1,000 people in the bloody independence vote in East Timor in 1999, but he says 11 human rights violations in the Papua region have been resolved, including the Pani case.
The families of the victims of the Panai incident scoffed at these remarks.
"I've been interviewed four times in the last three years, but things have gone absolutely nowhere," Yohanes said.
Years later he said, "I'm tired."
He still lives in fear.
"I was scared," he said.
I'm afraid of being arrested by the army, of being shot. ""
His brother, Yucabos, also believes that the people of Panai are afraid to talk about the incident.
He said he was beaten by the military after helping to bury the four victims.
He said that "after burying the body, the military came to me."
The shooting did not stop.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police shot villagers in Deyai County, Pani's neighboring county.
A construction company manager refused to help transport an unconscious man to hospital and the two sides clashed, killing one person and injuring 17 others, among them children.
Man Raviyanus Dorwu, 24, drowned while fishing in a nearby river and died on the way to hospital.
Angry villagers protested in front of the company's on-site offices.
Police said villagers threw rocks at police, so officers fired warning shots.
But the riot mobile unit (indonesian paramilitary police) began firing into the crowd and one person was killed.
"We were in a panic and now we're afraid they're going to retaliate," Dominguez Badi, 29, who lives near the hospital where he witnessed the wounded being rushed to the hospital, told TIME.
"I hid at home for two days." "
The Deyai parliament has called for the police involved to be brought to justice and for riot mobile units to be withdrawn from the area.
Paniyie has always been a place of right and wrong for the Indonesian government.
The lack of effective development breeds discontent among the peoples of the mee, Moni, Dani and Damal tribes, which are scattered across the lush central highlands of Pani.
Many have joined the Free Papua Movement (OPM), a rebel army that claims to protect the rights of Papuans by dispersing attacks and raids to kidnap Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the top leaders of the Free Papua movement were born in Panai, including Thaddeus Yogi and Daniel Yordas Kogoya.
As a result, in recent years thousands of Panis have been arrested and deliberately detained by the military under the guise of "safeguarding national sovereignty."
Some never showed up again.
Panai is a "tragic place to be forgotten" in the eyes of Papuans.
Poverty breeds discontent.
Ennarotelli is selling so little rice that locals simply can't afford to buy it.
Bread is simply out of reach.
People here grow everything they can eat: mainly sweet potatoes and some fruit and leafy vegetables.
Farming is a woman's job, and every woman can look after four or five sweet potato fields.
They usually keep most of the crop for writers and sell the rest on the local market.
Ten sweet potatoes are worth just 10,000 Indonesian rupiah (75 cents).
Over time, economic inequality has opened up among local Papuans and new immigrants, whose numbers have increased significantly since the opening of the new route to nabi√©rre airport.
The small amount of work available usually ends up in the hands of better educated and wealthier immigrants.
Papuans rarely have the funds or the necessary skills to run competitive companies.
John Gobai, president of the Panai Tribal Council, said "young people don't want to stay in the village... because there are no jobs and no money."
Papua is isolated from the rest of the world.
Moreover, restrictions on international media coverage remain tight.
Earlier this year, French journalists Frank escudi and Bassel Longchamp were deported from Papua because they "did not cooperate with the relevant agencies," even though they had been given a rare warrant to film.
Jokowi's election vow to lift reporting restrictions to promote transparency and development has not been fulfilled, according to Human Rights Watch's deputy Asia director, Felim Kane.
"If foreign journalists try to cover Indonesia's easternmost disaffected provinces of Papua and West Papua, they are at new risk: denying visas and pulling into the blacklist," he said in a statement.
The absence of media scrutiny means international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely confined to Papua's neighbours.
In March, six Pacific nations - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands, the Solomon Islands - asked the UN Human Rights Council to investigate "all types of widespread human rights violations" in Papua, including the Pani shootings.
These countries have also supported the free Papua movement.
Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesman Almanta Nasir shrugged off the group's allegations, telling reporters in Jakarta that "Indonesia is still in a democracy and the media is free, so evidence of human rights abuses is hard to hide."
Locals want more foreign governments to pay attention.
When the Dutch ambassador for human rights, Keith van Baar, led a delegation of officials to Jayapura on May 4, local people broke their silence and implored, "We want freedom," according to a person familiar with the situation, who also attended that meeting but requested anonymity.
Indonesia will hold its next presidential election in 2019, but Papuans say they are unlikely to vote for Jokowi again.
Gobi, the president of the tribal council, said that "Jokowi's intentions were good, but he was surrounded by people who were involved in the Panai shooting."
He wants Jokowi to know that the Pani people not only live under the threat of a greedy army, but have nothing, a region with little education and a lack of public health care.
Gobai says the Panini people, like other Papuans, believe that their vote for Jokowi is a debt he must pay.
He said "they don't need money, they need justice."
Even under threat and intimidation, the families of the victims of the Panini shooting staged their last symbolic act of defiance: burying the body of one of the victims opposite the military police post.
They know that justice may never come, but at least they won't let the culprits forget their crimes.
Yocabos kept his head down and said, "My family has been killed,
What else can we do? ""

Beijing, Oct 9 (REUTERS) - Samsung Electronics on Tuesday released its first set of components for self-driving vehicles developed with Harman International, as well as infotainment solutions, an important step in the company's push into the automotive electronics market, Reuters said.
Samsung Electronics bought Harman International about a year ago.
At this week's Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas, Samsung released vehicle cameras with collision alerts, Lane deflection alerts, cruise control features that were developed in collaboration with Harman.
Samsung plans to start shipping the camera system this year, which is based on technology such as automatic machine learning and augmented reality.
Samsung also demonstrated a "digital cockpit" that can make a vehicle more personal, even if the driver is not the owner, as the system allows users to download drivers' data from mobile devices and from the cloud.

Fire engulfs Dubai 'torch' skyscraper tower again
A fire at the world's tallest residential building in Dubai on Friday forced hundreds of residents to flee the 337m-high, 79-storey Ultra High-Rise building.
It was the second fire to sweep through high-rise buildings in just two years, and happened to be in the skyscraper known as the "Torch."
The building has been evacuated, no injuries have been reported and the cause of the blaze has not yet been found.
'We were sleeping and then we were woken up by the fire alarm and people started screaming.
We ran down the stairs and it took about 10 minutes to run down the 50th floor, "a resident named George told Reuters.
Dubai's civil defence authority said the fire brigade extinguished the blaze at around 4: 00 local time (0000 gmt) and was in the process of cooling the building.
The government said it was working to provide shelter for those affected.
The accident is likely to reignite concerns around the world about the safety of the use of exterior wall materials in high-rise buildings.
An investigation by the management of the torch skyscraper in the wake of its 2015 fire found that most of the objects that were damaged were cladding exterior panels for decoration and insulation.
British police have said they believe problems with the insulation and cladding panel system at the Glenfair Building in London may have contributed to the rapid spread of the fire in June, which killed about 80 people.
The Williams team also hinted at a possible return for Felipe Massa, although he has announced his retirement.
January 9, only a month before the start of the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea, with the Olympic flame from the South to the North of the relay preheating and various preparations, the atmosphere of the Winter Olympics in South Korea has become increasingly intense.
South Korean public opinion is expecting the long-overdue Inter-Korean talks to bring an "egg" to the one-month countdown to the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics.
The Pyeongchang Winter Olympic flame arrived in South Korea on November 1 last year.
The flame craze is directly reflected in ticket sales for the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics.
Just over two months ago, the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics ticket sales rate hovered at 32%, the Winter Paralympics ticket sales rate was only 4.3%, and the low ticket sales rate was once a cause for concern about the popularity of the Pyeongchang Winter Games.
But as Lee Hee-fan, chairman of the organizing committee for the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics, recently predicted to reporters, "With the Olympic flame being passed around South Korea, the heat of the Winter Games is growing, and it is believed that ticket sales will improve soon."
As of January 3, ticket sales for the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics had reached 64 percent, and ticket sales for the Winter Paralympics had topped 50 percent, according to South Korean media.
To encourage foreigners to attend the Games, South Korea's Justice Ministry also announced Tuesday that foreigners visiting South Korea to watch the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics will extend their stay in South Korea for up to 120 days.
More than a fifth of U.S. travelers bring prohibited items on board, survey finds
A survey of airline passengers found that more than 20 percent of passengers had intentionally or unintentionally clipped illegal items to board a plane through a U.S. Transportation Security Administration checkpoint, and that at least 6 percent of those passengers had unintentionally brought prohibited knives or other bladed items on board.
Less than 1 per cent of passengers claimed they only found out afterwards that they were travelling with guns, ammunition or explosives by mistake.
The survey of more than 1,000 people, conducted by charter service company Stratos Jet Charter Inc., also found that young travelers were more likely to blatantly ignore the rules.
Of the respondents who admitted to trying to intentionally bring TSA prohibited items on board, 19.7 percent were millennials, compared to less than 15 percent of Gen X people.
The most common items that deliberately slip past TSA screeners are food and drink.
More than 3 per cent admitted to deliberately carrying a blade through security, while 2.2 per cent of female respondents and 3.7 per cent of male respondents also said they had deliberately taken illicit drugs on board.
The company said the survey was conducted to determine the number of people who accidentally and intentionally carried prohibited items through the security of a plane.
Not surprisingly, the people most likely to carry contraband through security - intentionally or not - are those who fly the most frequently.
However, the company points out that the TSA guidelines are a bit complicated and difficult to understand.
People are often unsure of what and how much fluid they can carry.
So it should come as no surprise that the TSA seized the most illicit liquids.
At one point it was thought that the TSA might have made books a contraband as well.
Liquids are allowed on domestic flights, but not on international flights.
EPA chief Pruitt changes his mind on Obama-era emissions reduction regulations
A day after being sued by 15 states, EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt reversed his earlier decision to delay implementation of Obama-era regulations to reduce emissions of smog-causing air pollutants.
Pruitt proposed the change because the EPA was able to respond more quickly to the needs of environmental regulatory state agencies than previous administrations.
He made no mention of a legal challenge brought by a federal appeals court against his former post.
The dispute centers on setting an October 1 deadline for states to begin meeting the 2015 ground-level ozone standards.
In June, Pruitt announced that he would delay compliance for a year in order to give the EPA more time to study the program and avoid "interfering with local decisions or impeding economic growth."
Prior to his appointment by President Donald Trump, Pruitt was Oklahoma attorney general and had long opposed the strictures of environmental regulations.
Since arriving in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly turned to blocking or delaying regulations opposed by the chemical and fossil fuel industries.
Wednesday's abrupt reversal is the latest legal hurdle on Pruitt's regulatory turnaround agenda.
Last month, a federal appeals court in Washington ruled that the head of the Environmental Protection Agency overstepped his authority in an attempt to delay enforcement of Obama administration rules requiring oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leaks.
In a statement released Wednesday night, Pruitt offered a sharp turn in his approach to ozone standards, vowing to strengthen the EPA's commitment to work with states to adopt complex procedures to reach new standards.
"Under previous administrations, the EPA typically did not meet a specified deadline, and then waited for radical groups and others to sue before agreeing to set a designated timetable by agreement," said Pruitt, who has launched more than a dozen prosecutions against the EPA in his previous work.
"We don't believe in regulation through litigation and we take the deadline seriously."
We also take the regulations and the authorities seriously. ""
Nonetheless, the EPA statement said Pruitt may again use his "deferred authorization and all other legally available authorizations" to ensure that the regulations are in line with "good policy and the best information available."
Republicans in Congress are pushing for a broad rewrite of the ozone layer regulations.
The House bill approved last month aims to delay implementation of the 2015 rules for at least eight years.
The measure has yet to be voted on in the Senate.
New York State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman led a coalition of states to sue the EPA this week, saying it intended to maintain legal pressure.
"The EPA's reversal - after we filed our lawsuit - is a significant victory for the health and safety of 6.7 million New Yorkers, with communities of more than 115 million Americans directly affected by smoke emissions," Schneiderman said.
California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington state and the District of Columbia all joined New York State in the case.
Ground-level ozone is formed when common pollutants emitted by cars, power plants, refineries, chemical plants and other sources react under sunlight in the atmosphere.
The resulting smog can cause severe breathing problems for sensitive people, causing thousands of premature deaths each year.
Of course, public health advocates and environmentalists cheered Pruitt's surprising turnaround.
"It is disturbing that this commonsense measure is under enormous pressure from the head of the department that protects the air we need to breathe," said Lori Ann Bird of the Center for Biological Diversity.
"We have to fight to the end with the Trump administration's ideological campaign to cater to polluters and special interests." "

According to statistics, the sales of trees in Xiaoshan from January to June this year increased by 48% compared with the same period last year, the largest increase in nearly 20 years.
Shi Haiyong, deputy director of Xiaoshan Forestry Bureau, said that with a good sales situation, Xiaoshan flowers and plants production has also made rapid development.
In the past two years, the area of planting flowers and plants in Xiaoshan has expanded by 30,000 mu, bringing the total area to 180,000 mu.
While the planting area is expanding, the quality of nursery stock is also improving, the value of nursery stock is increasing, large-scale and high-quality seedlings are retained more, and some of them are reluctant to sell.
Shi also reminded that in the face of the current boom in production and marketing, producers should be calm, objective analysis, not only to see that the social demand for flowers and plants will be long-term, increasing, but also to recognize that the market competition will be more intense.
Beijing, July 13 (UPI) -- U.S. company somaltus filed a lawsuit in East Texas District Court accusing Apple of infringing a battery technology patent it filed in 2010.
The company has previously sued Asus, Lenovo, Samsung, Sony and Toshiba with the same patent.
The lawsuit alleges that both the iPhone 6s and the so-called Apple devices infringed on the 7,657,386 U.S. patent, which is called the Integrated Battery Service System.
The plaintiffs wanted cash compensation, or a patent fee for the infringing equipment after the verdict was announced.
Judging by the indictment, the plaintiffs appear to believe that the iPhone's Quick Charge feature infringes on the company's patents.
The fast-charging iPhone will quickly charge up to 80%, followed by a trickle charge.
Somaltus is actually a so-called "patent hooligan" because the company doesn't offer obvious products and services, and it's hard to find information online.
However, they have successfully settled out of court with auto makers such as Ford and Nissan over the patent.
The meeting held that accelerating the development of information technology, promoting the integration and efficient use of resources, and raising the level of digitization and intellectualization of industries were of great significance in promoting "Made in China 2025" and mass entrepreneurship and innovation, fostering new kinetic energy and improving the quality of life of the masses.

Trump pressured Mexico to pay for border wall, according to leaked phone records
The Washington Post has leaked transcripts of calls between US President Donald Trump and the leaders of Mexico and Australia.
On January 27, in a call to Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto, Trump urged him to stop publicly saying he would not pay for the proposed border wall.
The US President reportedly took offence at his public bashing of the wall, with Mr putlang allegedly telling him: "You don't tell the media."
Trump promised during his presidential campaign to build a separation wall on America's southern border and vowed to make Mexico pay for the project.
A transcript of his call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, which showed a tense exchange between them, was also released.
Mr Trump told Mr Turnbull that the US taking on the deal to send refugees to Australia was "ridiculous," "disgusting" and "stupid" and that he had advised the US to ban refugee resettlement and now insisted the deal brokered by the Obama administration would make him look like a "fool."
Trump hung up after telling Turnbull "this is the most unpleasant call of the day."
In his acceptance speech, read aloud by the US ambassador to Sweden, Dylan said he was on his way to the tour when he received the award. "It took me a while to react."

Moorbeach massacre: activists recreate Racist Lynching, deliver justice
A 1948 Ford Mercury plowed through a crowd of bystanders in the small town of Monroe, Ga., and rumbled toward the tiny Moorbeach Bridge.
The vehicle, carrying four black passengers and a white driver, blocked the path of the car before it reached the bridge as a group of white men with guns moved forward.
The head of the mob - a middle-aged man in a pinstripe suit - took a deep breath of his cigar and glanced into the windshield.
The passengers in the car were filled with fear.
"We want -Roger!" the man shouted.
"Drag him out of the car!" "
A young black man was dragged from the passenger seat in the front row and screams pierced the silence.
Fortunately, the horrific scene on July 22 was just a repeat.
But when "Roger" put a noose around his neck, almost all the onlookers let out a real gasp.
Since 2005, civil rights activists have returned to the Moorbeach Bridge to recreate scenes from the night that two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcolm and George and Maire Dorsey - were lynched by the Ku Klux Klan in 1946.
No one has ever been charged with murder.
"While we know who they are, even though we've seen them in the community, it's incredible that none of them have been arrested over the years," said Tyrone Brooks, who helped organize the repeat.
"It's a stain on history, a burden on our souls." "
Brooks, 71, is a former Georgia congressman and lifelong rights activist.
For him, the replay was a compelling call to action, an annual reminder to people in the Monroe community that injustice has never been corrected.
"We want to prosecute, we want to close the case, we want to heal, we want reconciliation, but we have to get justice first," he said.
"Unless we get justice, we will not get healing and reconciliation."
A coroner covers a sheet over the body of a Moorbeach lynching victim on July 27, 1946.
More than 50 men from Monroe and surrounding counties are suspected of being involved in the lynching, according to FBI files obtained by NBC News.
But none of them have ever been prosecuted.
While the suspect has been on the loose for decades, civil rights activists say the dual motive for the lynching is well known throughout the town: politics and sex.
A Supreme Court ruling in April 1946 allowed black citizens in Georgia to vote in the primary for the first time later that summer.
Around the same time, according to the FBI, black sharecropper Roger Malcolm stabbed white landowner Barnett Hurst in a struggle - looking like it was for a woman.
Brooks said the rumor in the town was that Hearst slept with Malcolm's wife, Dorothy, and that her baby was not her husband's.
On July 25, 1946, prominent white landowner Loy Harrison paid $600 to bail Malcolm out of jail, the FBI said.
Dorothy and cousins Mai Meary and George Dorsey accompanied him to the prison.
But when they returned from prison, close to Moorbeach Bridge, a lynching mob surrounded the car.
"As it turns out, it was Harrison who organized and ordered the execution of the murder," an FBI report concluded.
"It is clear that there was a conspiracy between state and local law enforcement who not only participated in the murder, destroyed the evidence, but also concealed the identity of the witness." "
Brooks was brief and to the point.
"It's a voting rights tragedy," he said.
"They were brutally murdered and it was the killer who sent a message to black people in this community: 'If you sign up and vote, the same will happen to you.'"
For nearly a decade, Cassandra Green has been in charge of leading the annual repeat of the Moorbeach Bridge lynching tragedy.
Her presentation was vivid and gripping, with a deep background of racism that many hoped would no longer exist in the United States.
It's hard to watch, it's harder not to watch, but Green says that's the point.
"We don't want to talk about lynchings because they make us face the ugly face of all people," she said.
'But if you don't listen to me or hear me talk about my own experiences, I can't have a relationship with you.'
The first day of this year's show, which began in June, saw nearly 30 actors - a dozen white and the rest black - huddled in a room to hear green release a rehearsed overview of the show.
Wade Malpao serves as Green's co-director.
For years, he played the role of the Ku Klux Klan, but he said the role was never easy.
"I feel dirty because I'm not that kind of person," Malpao said.
"But I think it's very important to keep this history alive because we don't want to go back to that time." "
In the room, actors Darios Bradshaw and Nick Laskona, who played Roger Malcolm and Barnett Hearst, were rehearsing their lines.
The drama began with Malcolm shouting and pushing Hirst away, furious that he had slept with his own wife, Dorothy.
"I said," Get out of my place! "
Laskona shot back.
Then they got into a fight.
Then everyone (at least all the black actors) erupted in laughter.
Green had the biggest laugh.
"What's going on?!," Raskona asked.
He was panicked and confused.
Have I gone too far?
"No," Green said with a laugh.
"I just don't think white people say 'ah' when they hit back." "
"Yes," another black actor joked.
"Your tone has to be tough." "
In this way, the energy in the room changed; the sense of camaraderie drove away the discomfort.
Everyone strives to do so, not only to perform the play, but also in memory of the four victims.
The scene begins again.
This time, Raskona's tone was sharp and forceful as he said the word "ah."
No one laughed.
The replay came to a strong and swift end.
Screams, gunfire, and then there was silence.
A woman dressed in funeral black stood by the actor's body, singing Billy Hallyday's mourning word "strange fruit."
Her voice drowned out the other words.
A hundred yards away, about forty spectators kept wiping away sweat and tears.
The audience was almost evenly split between black and white.
One couple made a special trip from Ithaca, New York, to see the show, and many others lived just down the road.
Brooks took them to Malcolm and Dorothy's cemetery for nearly eight hours, and they were all suffering from the uncomfortable heat and humidity of Georgia.
Until then, the murderer remained a mystery, but now, standing in the same land where the lynching took place, there was anxiety in the air.
When the final notes of the song disappeared, Green asked people to come closer to examine the bodies played by the actors.
The children leaned over and looked down at the fake blood and bodies, whispering to each other.
"They're not really dead," a young boy muttered, as if to remind himself.
A few minutes later, Green thanked the crowd and then the show was over.
The actor shook off the lynching cord and wiped away tears.
Bradshaw hugged Malpao, the suit man who played the head of the Ku Klux Klan.
Nick laskona hugged two of his colleagues and wept in their arms; the emotion in the performance eventually infected him.
"It doesn't matter," one of the women whispers.
'We know that's not what's going on inside you.
You do it for a reason. ""
After that, the audience sat down to dinner with the actor.
At the same table, a white couple from Atlanta had an intimate chat with a black couple they had just met and talked about repeating themselves.
Denise Dubinsky had a hard time finding words to describe how she felt after watching.
"It's hard to imagine those horrible words and actions... being said and done by people like you, because they look so much like you," she said.
"For me, it really made me think that the lynching was still going on," she added, "And now this kind of thing is just called police shootings."
In the room, Tyrone Brooks sat at a table watching, tasting and reflecting on civil rights.
He said he had already started planning for next year's show.
"Repetition is an inspiring way, because it describes the horrors we have experienced, but it is also very educational," he said.
"If you don't learn from it, this sort of thing could happen again.
Those who do not study and understand their own history are doomed to repeat it. "
For the natural gas market reform, the "pipeline network independent" aspect of the importance of the reform is self-evident, but the resistance and controversy are also great.

Us media: scientists at China Air Force Engineering University study laser satellites used to remove space junk
Chinese scientists have come up with a bold and innovative proposal to use large lasers to clean up the clutter of Earth's orbit and destroy old satellites and their sky waste, US media reported on Monday.
Researchers at the China Air Force University of Engineering wrote a paper entitled "Study on a variable-orbit model for space-based laser removal of small-scale space debris," which describes how space debris can be irradiated into smaller, less hazardous debris by using a space-based platform laser.
Space junk has been a concern for international space agencies for years, with the U.S. space agency considering a variety of options to track, detect and remove man-made debris, the report said.
Ways to remove large-scale space debris include giant nets used to sweep and collect waste, as well as magnets that can be used to suck them out of orbit. Chinese scientists conducted laser simulations and concluded that this would be an effective way to clean up the Earth's orbit.
"[The simulation study] provides the necessary theoretical basis for the application of sky-based platform laser space debris removal technology," the abstract of the paper said.
A 2014 study by U.S. defense giant Lockheed Martin found that for satellites in orbit, there are about 200 threats a day.
High-speed debris moving along Earth's orbit is seen as a serious threat to future space missions and has been described as a "deadly cascade of threats" by experts at the European Space Agency, which has seen a steady increase in high-speed debris in each of the past year.
Space is largely empty, but the space next to the Earth is getting more crowded, and each satellite we send into space will eventually become another piece of debris orbiting the Earth, piling up over time, according to the website of the American Journal of Popular Mechanics.
The more debris there is, the higher the probability that a satellite that is still functioning will be hit by debris, thereby damaging or destroying an investment worth millions of dollars.
All space agencies have drawn up plans to remove space junk in the future, the report said.
NASA is considering using jets of gas to reduce the speed of the debris and get it out of orbit, Europe is considering launching a satellite carrying a large net to capture the debris and bring it back to Earth, and Japan's idea is to capture the debris with an electric chain.
Now, China is also proposing a solution to space junk by using a large laser to break up floating space junk into smaller, less harmful pieces.
According to a paper published in the German journal Optics by a group of researchers at the Chinese Air Force Engineering University, installing such a laser on a satellite would be effective enough to clean up space, at least according to the simulations.
The only way to prove effectiveness is through testing, and no such missions have been scheduled, but perhaps sooner or later someone will put a laser on a satellite and send it into space, the report said.
Once that's done, we can finally begin to eliminate the problem of space junk once and for all.

Pearson Group to cut another 3000 jobs, slash dividend to revive business
British education group Pearson said on Friday it would cut another 3,000 jobs and slash its interim dividend by 72 per cent as it embarked on another restructuring programme to deal with business pressures.
Chief executive John Fallon said most of the job cuts would take place in the second half of 2018 and the first half of 2019, after 4,000 jobs had been cut in the previous restructuring.
Pearson Group in May announced plans to cut a further ¬£300 million ($394 million) in costs in a third cost-cutting project to revive a business hit by the rapid development of digital learning.
Last month, the company agreed to sell its stake in Penguin Random House to partner Bertelsmann and published a report that its underlying sales rose 1 per cent to ¬£20.5m in the first half, but said the outlook for the year was unchanged.
A few days ago, China's IAAF issued a serious notice, severely beat the phenomenon of running, and prepared to give offenders a life-long suspension of heavy fines.
NATO soldier killed in suicide bombing attack on convoy in Kabul
A military convoy has been hit by a suicide bomber in the Afghan capital Kabul, killing a Nato soldier and wounding several others, according to official sources.
Five soldiers and an interpreter were wounded in the blast, the Nato statement said.
Three civilians also died in the incident in the Karabagh area of the city, according to unconfirmed local reports.
It was the latest violent attack in Afghanistan - the Herat mosque bombing on Tuesday that killed more than 30 people.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
The explosion occurred on Thursday night, when a joint patrol of Afghan and Nato coalition forces was attacked by "individuals carrying improvised explosive devices," according to a Nato statement.
All of the injured are in stable condition and are being treated at the U.S. Military Hospital at Bagram Air Base, the statement said.
The growing strength of the Taliban and the so-called Islamic State (IS) group in the Karabakh region has raised serious concerns among Nato forces stationed near Bagram, according to journalists.
At least 1,662 civilians were killed in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, compared with about 20 percent in the capital, according to the United Nations.
At least 30 people were killed in a suicide car bomb attack in a predominantly Shiite district of Kabul in late July.
The Taliban claimed they carried out the attack.
On May 31, a huge explosion in the center of Kabul killed more than 150 people, the deadliest militant attack in the country since a U.S.-led multinational force toppled the Taliban in 2001.
The violence highlights the country's perilous security situation as US President Donald Trump weighs whether to send more troops to Afghanistan to support his troops and police.
The suicide bombing in Kabul in recent weeks has also triggered a crisis of public confidence in the government and its policies, particularly the reputation of President Ashraf Ghani, according to journalists.
National environmental protection agency (EPA) lawsuit overturns resolution, delays smog regulations
While in office, Obama issued a rule requiring states to curb all types of emissions that cause smog, and 15 states sued the National Environmental Protection Agency over the rule, which the EPA overturned a day later.
The EPA announced its decision Wednesday to continue the so-called "2015 ozone reach zone" and promised that the EPA would work with the states.
EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt said in a statement that "we are confident in dialogue with our national partners and are committed to responding to it."
Pruitt announced in June that the EPA plans to delay the implementation of the Ozone Reach Area Standard until October 2018 for a one-year delay - under which existing smog pollution in some areas is measured to determine which areas should reduce emissions that cause smog pollution to meet air quality standards.
Fifteen major Democratic states, as well as the District of Columbia, filed a lawsuit against it on Tuesday, alleging that the act was illegal.
As part of a broader agenda, President Donald Trump's administration has been working to restore various environmental regulations pushed by former President Barack Obama to spur economic growth.
But those efforts have sparked opposition from Democrats and conservative groups, who fear more emissions will affect public health.
Breathing air that contains ozone "reduces lung function and increases respiratory symptoms," such as asthma, according to the EPA's website.

Mackie Garcia and Vasily Lomchenko meet for the first time to explore a possible future showdown
The most notable boxing bout under 147 pounds will be held soon, with Vasily Lomachenko and Mackie Garcia, who are currently in a state of potential conflict, meeting for the first time on Thursday.
They were in separate rooms at the ESPN offices in Los Angeles, where undefeated World Boxing Council lightweight champion Garcia led the way down the hallway to greet World Boxing Organization super featherweight champion Vasyl Lomachenko.
In Saturday's Showtime fight, the judges unanimously decided that Garcia had beaten quarterback world champion Adrian Brogna to victory, and both fighters are now in the top five of the heavyweight rankings.
Garcia held out his right hand and said, "Champion, how are you?
Good luck with that. ""
Lomachenko saved his status with a victory over Miguel Marianga on Saturday night at 7 p.m. on ESPN.
As the two posed for photos, Lomachenko's agent, Edgars Klimas, pointed out that the potential showdown between the two contestants depended on the "perfect size."
"I was a lightweight before," Garcetti said.
"I stepped up to fight Brosnan (140 pounds), but I wasn't that big.
I'm still a bit short of my weight compared to 140 pounds.
I want to go back to lightweight.
And he has to get to lightweight (135 pounds) before we can fight.
That's what the fans want, too.
Then we will satisfy them.
Lomchenko agrees.
"The boxing world needs this matchup." "
Klimas asked if he should pay a fee, and part of his strategy was to have Lomachenko make his debut against a 135-pound fighter later this year to set a date for next summer's fight with Garcia (370, 30 knockout), who is also interested in a rematch with Jorge Linares-Luke Campbell after the lightweight title fight on September 23.
"With all the fans asking the question, this matchup could be a pay per view," said Garcia, who has since expressed an openness to playing on a network that offers the best financial package.
"We are the main characters.
Other people are unlikely to generate such a large amount of attention.
As long as they're ready... ""
Garcia appreciates that Lomachenko is "a fantastic player" and could be on hand to watch his boxing match on Saturday.
But Lomachenko balked at Garcia's praise, saying he thought the three-point champion from Riverside looked "Slow. Sorry, McKee... You're going to get knocked out."
'The focus is to show the power of the fist and then boxing,' Garcia said.
They all said they could feel the momentum of their boxing match.
"This is a battle that must be fought,
Attention and heat are beyond the reach of any other boxing match.
I'm more than happy to play, "Garcia said.
Lomachenko said: "I've been waiting for the top fighters and this time it's McKee's turn.
It's going to be a great matchup. ""

The announcement by NDRC officials on the early completion of the 11th Five-year emissions reduction targets has given the steel industry, which has been constrained by electricity restrictions, strong expectations of a resumption of production.
Although the steel mill has not received a clear announcement from the local government that the energy saving and emission reduction work has ended, the industry estimates that around December 15, 2010, the original restricted production of steel mills throughout the region will gradually complete the resumption of production, steel prices may start to come under pressure.
There has been no notification of the end of the limit, but in fact the pressure has been much less than 9, October, a private steel enterprises in Hebei province told reporters.
Parts of Hebei have repeatedly issued power limit production documents, and once forced to pull the brake to restrict the production of enterprises.
The reporter learned from local enterprises, at present, most of Hebei's steel mills have returned to work, limited production pressure eased.
My steel network analyst Zhang Tieshan predicted that, as the North is already in winter, construction steel terminal demand will gradually from strong to weak.
Coupled with the gradual end of energy saving and emission reduction, by December 15, most steel mills will basically resume production, products will arrive in the local market before New Year's Day.
The increase in the supply of resources will put some pressure on the price of steel, which is rising at the moment.

Latest results of age assessment test for asylum seekers in Sweden released
The Swedish asylum seeker test uses the latest method to assess their age medically, and the latest results show that more than 80 per cent of the subjects were judged to be over 18, but not all were convinced of its accuracy.
The Swedish National Centre for Forensic Science (r? Ttsmedicinalverket) began the test earlier this year.
After being accused of failing to accurately assess the ages of some of the refugees who claimed to be underage, the Swedish Migration Agency (MIGRATIONSVERKET) designed the tests with a view to conducting a more accurate age assessment during the asylum process.
So far, the Swedish Migration Board has sent 6,880 test cases, and the Centre for Forensic Medicine has now published the results of a total of 2,481 subjects between mid-March and July 31, 2017.
Eighty percent (2002) were judged to be 18 or older, but in a further 25 Tests, Sweden's National Forensic Science Center determined that the subjects were "likely to be 18 or older."
In 432 Tests, the result was that the person was "probably under the age of 18."
The test is only for people who have questions about their age.
These results are consistent with those of previous months, according to John Glassen of the Centre for Forensic Science.
"The numbers are not very different from previous months, the numbers are pretty consistent," he told The Local.
The high proportion of cases judged to be over the age of 18 did not necessarily mean that the asylum seekers had lied about their age.
In May, the center published the results of 581 tests and said there were 442 "indicating that the subject was 18 or older."
News newspaper Svenska Dagbladet examined the results of 581 tests published, and found that 243 of the subjects had publicly said they would be 18 years old this year.
An X-ray examination of wisdom teeth, an MRI scan of the joint and then analysis of the results by a dentist and radiologist, a form of medical assessment that has also been called into question in parts of the region.
One of the doubters is Claude Marcus, an endocrinologist at Caroline College, whose job involves assessing people's biological maturity to see if they are going through puberty earlier or later than their normal age.
He told News newspaper metro: "I have reason to think so, and I don't think the measurement used should be that way.
It is inaccurate to determine the biological age in this way.
If we can't guarantee accuracy, we shouldn't pretend we can do it. ""
Yet glagson, of the Centre for Forensic Science, defended the accuracy of the tests: "By and large it can be said that the risk of uncertainty in judging a child as an adult is very small."
The biggest risk is that the person is just under 18, which is about 10 per cent.
West Virginia governor announces change of party
On Thursday night, Jim Justice, the Democratic governor of West Virginia, announced at a rally for President Trump that he would change the party.
"Like it or not, the Democratic Party has left me," the governor said.
"Today, after a lot of prayer and a lot of thought, I'm going to tell you... today I'm going to tell you as a West Virginia man that I can no longer help you as a Democratic governor," he said.
The rally erupted in cheers.
"So, tomorrow, I'm going to change the party membership to the Republican Party," Jastis added.
"As a coach, I'm going to tell it's time to start another game." "
Trump had earlier promised a major announcement at a rally in West Virginia.
Mr. Trump won 42 percent of the vote in West Virginia, and Mr. Jastis did not endorse Hillary Clinton, the Democratic nominee.
Jasantis was named the state's only billionaire in 2016, according to Forbes.
Forbes noted that he inherited his father's coal industry and owned coal mines in five states.
He is now worth about $1.59 billion.
Meanwhile, "Governor Jasantis' change of party is another blow to the Democratic Party, and far from standing in the way of making our country great again, it will make our country great again," the Republican National Committee said in a statement Thursday night.
"The Democratic Party currently has only 15 governors and controls the lowest number of state legislatures on record, and Governor Justis' statement is the latest rejection of a party that has lost leadership from top to bottom and has been unable to find a positive unifying slogan," Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said in a statement to CBS News.

Sebastian Coe hails Russia's' frank 'apology over doping scandal
On Thursday, the head of the International Association of Athletics Federations, Sebastian Coe, applauded Russia's apology over the doping scandal and called it "candid," but reiterated that it was also not the time for Russia to re-enter the sport.
The head of Russia's athletics federation, Mitri Chirac, told the IAAF Congress on the eve of the World Athletics Championships that his country was right to be banned from the sport and that he was determined to fight doping.
He said he regretted that "all the athletes who won gold and silver medals in the competition were stripped of their medals."
Despite his comments, the IAAF General Assembly voted in favour of maintaining the ban, which was imposed in November 2015 after a World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) report referred to the discovery of evidence of state-sponsored doping in Russia.
"I think the response today was very frank, very candid presentation," IAAF president Coe told reporters.
"The whole council and the IAAF congress are pleased... the Russian Federation acknowledges that it has been through a very scorching period and is doing everything possible to ensure that Russia can re-enter the competition." "
Coe said he was also "delighted" that Russia had accepted the criteria for re-entry.
"I think it's been a very constructive day and think we've made some progress, but the IAAF General Assembly supports the recommendation of the ad hoc panel and it's not the time to reinstate Russia," Coe said.
"We need to do everything we can to normalise this over the next few months."
Our guiding principle has always been a desire to separate clean athletes from a tainted system, "he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes meet the strict criteria of the IAAF and will compete as neutrals at the World Athletics Championships in London on Friday.
The head of the IAAF's ad hoc team, Rune Anderson, said on Monday that Russia had not yet met a number of criteria for resuming the competition.
He told reporters after a speech to the IAAF council in London that drug testing was still inadequate and the banned coach was still coaching.

It is worth noting that, with smoother market expectations for the renminbi, renminbi assets have become increasingly attractive to foreign investors.

How did football's financial rules affect Neymar's move to Paris?
Rules designed to prevent unrestricted spending by European giants football clubs will not stand in the way of Neymar's move from Spanish club Barcelona to French club Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) for a record price.
The consequence has been a further relegation of Paris Saint-Germain football club by the European football association (UEFA), the governing body of European football's competition, which has the power to ban teams from the widely watched Champions League.
The Financial Fair Play rules (FFP), introduced by Uefa in 2011, means Paris Saint-Germain football club will eventually have to prove that Neymar's transfer was funded without incurring huge losses.
FC Barcelona have paid 222 million euros ($262 million) just to pay for the Brazilian player's release, while Neymar's salary will run into tens of millions of dollars a year.
Here are some of the financial implications of Neymar's move to France.
Given that the team is funded by the wealthy Qatari ruling family, the Paris Saint-Germain football club could certainly use the cash to sign Neymar and include him in the rest of the star-studded squad.
Clubs can spend huge sums on players, but they must use legitimate sources of income to make up for the huge sums spent, allowing them to break even on their football-related business.
The Financial Fair Play rules were conceived by Michel Platini after he was elected Uefa president in 2007.
The former France player believes that for clubs who are deeply in debt in pursuit of success, if the bank or the owners withdraw support funding, they are effectively cheating and putting the club at risk of ruin.
In 2011, the rule's focus shifted from the club's debt issue to the club's loss condition monitoring.
The change means that the business model used by Roman Abramovich when he bought Chelsea FC in 2003, buying a club with potential and then spending big to improve the team and build it into a global brand, now faces a more demanding position.
The club could lose up to ‚Ç¨30m over the three-year rule assessment period up to 2018.
Although Roman Abramovich was disparaged by the then president in 2015, Uefa's successor, Aleksander Ceferin, remains committed to stopping excessive spending.
"Of course the rules have not expired and we will certainly strengthen future regulations," UEFA's Andrew Traverso, who is in charge of matters related to the rules, told The Associated Press last week.
While Paris Saint-Germain Football Club will pay off Neymar's buy-out clause in a lump sum, it can also distribute the amount over the term of the contract for accounting purposes.
Neymar has signed a five-year deal, so the transfer fee could be shown as a fee of ‚Ç¨44.4m in the annual accounts for the next five years.
The first wave of rule-breaking sanctions, imposed in 2014, put Paris Saint-Germain football club, as well as Abu Dhabi's Manchester City club, under the toughest sanctions.
The Paris Saint-Germain football club was fined 60 million euros ($82 million at the exchange rate at the time), later reduced to 20 million euros, and asked to reduce the squad to 21 players in the Champions League for the 2014-15 season, instead of the normal 25.
Uefa is eyeing clubs that are trying to defraud financial regulators by linking up with club owners to raise revenue.
While Qatari companies can sponsor the Paris Saint-Germain Football Club, UEFA will not treat it as a legitimate income if the sponsorship amount is deemed to exceed the standard market price.
This is what happened in 2014, when Uefa ruled at the time that the Qatar Tourist Board's sponsorship of the Paris Saint-Germain Football Club had been inflated.
It has been reported that part of Neymar's income at Paris Saint-Germain football club could come from payments from the organising committee for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.
But both Paris Saint-Germain Football Club and the organising committee denied Neymar would be an ambassador for the World Cup and it would be easy for Uefa's regulator to make such a move.
The recent sanctions imposed on the Paris Saint-Germain football club mean that Uefa will be more wary of any attempts to circumvent the rules.
UEFA is not in advanced discussions with Paris Saint-Germain Football Club over the transfer of Neymar, people familiar with the matter said on Thursday.
All of the above spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the status of the Paris Saint-Germain Football Club.
The last published accounts show that Paris Saint-Germain Football Club made an operating income of ‚Ç¨542.4 million in 2015-16, making a profit of more than ‚Ç¨10 million.
The accounts for the previous fiscal year have not been released.
Paris Saint-Germain Football Club expect the signing of Neymar to be a boon for sponsorship events, franchises and shirt sales.
The club expects revenue to rise by at least 30 per cent after signing Neymar.
It is clear that the Spanish league, angered by the departure of one of its most famous players, tried to block Neymar's move and claimed that the Paris Saint-Germain football club broke the rules.
La Liga president Javier Tebas told Spanish newspaper AS that "this is a clear case of 'financial doping' and that the club and the country are the same," referring to Qatar, which has ultimate ownership of the Paris Saint-Germain football club.
Arsene Wenger, the head coach of the Arsenal team (the club's owner is an American sports tycoon), has reservations about state funding for the club as much as the La Liga title.
"This is a consequence of ownership and this has completely changed the whole ecology of football over the last 15 years," Wenger said on Thursday.
"Once the country owns the club, then anything can happen," he said.
That would make it very difficult to comply with the rules because there are many different ways or various interests for a country to require big-name players to represent a country. ""
Smart interactive robot developer Rokid gets new investment
In recent years, start-ups in the field of artificial intelligence have continued to be feted by capital.
Artificial Intelligence rokido recently completed a new round of financing, led by Temasek, Credit Suisse, CDIB (the investment arm of Taiwan's China Development Finance Holding company), old shareholder IDG Capital and other institutions.
The funding round is understood to be about $100m, with Credit Suisse and CDIB appearing in financing deals in the domestic artificial intelligence sector for the first time.
Rokido is an intelligent interactive robot developer dedicated to the field of robotics. The product can control smart devices in the home, with continuous autonomous learning and growth functions, as well as recognition, understanding, feedback and so on.
This round of financing will be mainly used for research and development, the introduction of talent, strategic promotion and the investment layout of the industrial chain.

From February 28 this year, iCloud services in mainland China will be transferred to the cloud Guizhou company, according to Apple.
Apple said that "the partnership with Guizhou on the cloud will allow us to continue to improve the speed and reliability of iCloud services, while also complying with the new rules for Chinese cloud services to be operated by local businesses."
During the outage, the user's data previously stored in iCloud will also be stored in iCloud and will not be lost.
If deactivated users want to use the iCloud service after February 28, they will need to accept the new terms and conditions first to ensure the account is reactivated and moved to Guizhou on the cloud.
Meanwhile, in its statement, Apple also stressed that "Apple has strong data privacy and security protections and will not create a backdoor into any of our systems."
The iCloud Guian new area master data center will also be Apple's first data center project in China, which, when completed, will be used to store data on Apple users in China.
When built and put into use, Chinese users upload and download data without having to travel long distances between China and the United States, increasing speed and reducing latency.

3-D Family Carnival animation film "Doufu Zhuan" held its premiere in Wuhan on 25 July, "Doufu Zhuan" director Zou 291446; "Doufu Zhuan" animation director Meng wisdom, film soundtrack producer and Emmy winner Tom Disher all appeared, the scene shared the film creation behind the story.
"Doufu" is based on the story of Liu An, the king of Huainan in Chinese traditional culture, and is derived from the traditional allusion of "Liu an made tofu by mistake," which tells the story of the protagonist "Doufu" who is transformed into an adult by a bean, overcoming difficulties and persisting in the dream of immortals.
Wudang Mountain in Shiyan City, Hubei Province, is one of the world cultural heritage sites published by the United Nations. It is also the birthplace of Taoist culture and martial arts.
Director Zou\ 29146; revealed that he had travelled to Wudang Mountain with the main creative team in the early days of the film's creation.
He said that the story of "Doufu Zhuan" took place in the Western Han Dynasty Emperor Wudi years, Huainan King Liu an refining Dan Xixian in the background, the film hero "Doufu" is a Liu an alchemy when the unexpected illusion of adult beans.
In addition to Wudang Mountain, which is the birthplace of Taoist culture, Hubei has a deep connection with the chime, a traditional Chinese musical instrument with a long history.
At a recent international conference, experts predict that within 25 years robots with artificial intelligence will walk into people's bedrooms and offer a variety of services to humans.
Through their research, scientists have discovered that one of the greatest characteristics of memory is its inaccuracy.
"Thunderstorm," written in 1934, is the first work of Cao Yu, a symbol of the maturity of modern Chinese drama and the most translated Chinese drama in all languages.
Nostalgia hits the market - "Summer Camp" and "The Detective Duo"
Retelling the story is meant to be nostalgic for the actors "80s glory days and the garbage days of the" 90s (before and after David Wayne and Michael Hewatt made sketch comedy "country" for mtv); but also nostalgic for nostalgia itself, nostalgic for 2001; a year before many stars such as Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Luther had not yet thrived.
As a cultural work of art, it is an imitation and embodiment of the lasting memories of our Facebook age.
But as a series, it felt like time was running out.
"The first day of camp" reverberated strongly after it aired, but not just for its absurdist humor (the plot is an original story about a talking can of vegetables, voiced by H. Jon benjamin).
The plot doubles down on the core laughing terrier - a middle-aged actor playing a child at a troublesome age - making it a funny part of not being able to go back to the past.
In "Ten Years From Now," when adults actually play adults, the mood is less ingrained and the mimicry more discursive, including improvisations of "90s tracking movies such as" The Hand That Propelled the Cradle. "
At some point, a character gets stuck in an Apple laptop, some line skates and "something else from 1991."
Many of the core stories are the same.
Mr. sweetheart (mr. stewart) has now become a novelist, but he still hasn't forgotten Katie (margaret morrow).
Victor (ken marino) is still a virgin.
There is another sinister plot involving Ronald Reagan (also played by Mr. sewater), abetted by George H.W. Bush (michael Ian Black, impressive).
As always, the best part of this series is the interruption.
It's especially interesting to see the eternally young Mr. Luther, who flaunted Matt Dillon's soul patch in the movie "The Bachelorette," and Andy from the previous "campus giant" now feels like a giant.
It was a moment of random madness that might have powered the movie, like the recursive "seven Years of Life" series, until it came to what I thought was the logical conclusion: "Ha la camp: twenty years from now," and its final act was to get the gang of Cass to see the movie premiere of "Ha LA camp."
At the same time, Amazon's "Detective shuangxiong" recounts a different nostalgic content: Cold War revivalism's "The American spy dream," the movie "The City of the extreme cold," and even east and west wrestling imagery's "glow: the gorgeous women's wrestling league."
The comedy, written by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka, was pushed onto the TV screen by director Reece thomas: it's a buddy comedy set in 80s Romania and tells the story of two Bucharest officials fighting for truth, atheism and a Marxist Leninist line.
The main characters - the hard-nosed Grigor and the idealistic aissef - are played by Florian pirizzi Jr. and korneliu Urich, respectively, with a dialogue dubbed in English by Channing Tatum (also an Executive producer) and Joseph Gordon Levitt.
It's a brilliant idea.
But it's not just an idea.
Among them are some good visual gimmicks (police watch chess on TV to pass the time, because Americans Like to Play football).
And there are a host of celebrity voice actors - among them Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahshara Hashbaz Ali and Colo Sevigny - who have forged a brilliant sound extravaganza.
But "Detective Shuang Xiong" is so committed to creating a raucous, lifelike promotional comedy - featuring a killer wearing a Reagan mask - that it usually plays such a role.
The six-episode TV is a bit of a drag, and the comedic effects aren't released quickly or frequently enough.
The detective double-header was more tightly edited, presenting a better rabble-rousing satire when Gregor and Joseph repeatedly visited the US embassy, where there were always two fat men wolfing down a pile of burgers in the lobby.
For an imagined communist audience, the message means that Western culture can turn anything into material to revel in.
There is nothing wrong with the creators of this Romanian fictional story, and we will even tell the story with our own recent history and their history.
Reporters recently learned that the northeast region of iron and steel, rail transit, ships, machinery manufacturing industries, such as the benefits of the general decline, and even losses.
Some experts believe that under the current situation, the new round of revitalization of Northeast industry is not only related to the national economic recovery, but also will have an impact on the long-term development of China's manufacturing industry and international competitiveness, so it is urgent to adjust the transformation.
General decline in business efficiency traditional industries are more loss-making Raw Materials Industry and Heavy Machinery Equipment Manufacturing Industry Benefit serious decline or even loss, is the current economic downturn in the northeast industry's primary performance.
In the past, in the economic downturn, mainly low-end, primary products have been hit by the characteristics of large, but this economic fluctuations, the northeast traditional industrial high-end, low-end industrial products are affected.
In previous years, Anshan Iron & Steel Group (WEIBO) has focused on the development of high-end panels such as containerboard, rail, shipboard and civil electrical panels. However, sales of these products have fallen considerably this year, especially as ship-board sales have fallen by 50 per cent compared with the same period last year.

In January of this year, the output of crude steel in Liaoning province was 21.54 million tons, the production and marketing situation of products needed for projects with strong state policies and local government construction was relatively good, and the decline of products with more intense market competition was another feature of the Northeast manufacturing industry.

Bank of England to keep interest rates on hold at 0.25%
The Bank of England will announce at a later date that interest rates will remain on hold, after weak economic growth and easy inflation dashed hopes of an increase.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain "weak" as it tightens the squeeze on household incomes while controlling interest rates.
Policymakers on the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted 6-2 to keep interest rates at 0.25%, while a handful of members this month called for higher interest rates, even as weak economic growth has blunted the upward push.
In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank of England narrowed its growth forecasts for 2017 and 2018 to 1.7 per cent and 1.6 per cent respectively, and issued a warning that the squeeze on household incomes would continue, while inflation would soar to almost 3 per cent in the autumn.
But it said it would need to raise interest rates over the next few years to curb inflation from Brexit, while borrowing costs may need to be raised more sharply than expected in financial markets.
A massive economic promotion policy was implemented as a result of Brexit a year ago, and members also voted to withdraw it.
The Bank of England will announce a halt to its regular funding programme, providing cheap funding to banks from February next year, although it says it now needs an additional ¬£15bn on top of ¬£115bn under the plan.
In the minutes of the interest rate decision meeting, the Bank of England said: "In the MPC's core forecast, gross domestic product remains weak in the near term as the squeeze on household real incomes will continue to depress consumption."
On interest rates, the Bank repeatedly reiterated the need for "some monetary policy tightening" to quell inflation, and to a "greater degree" than the market expected.
The market is now expected to grow for the first time in the third quarter of next year and the second in 2020.
But the bank stressed that any increase would be "slow" and "restrained."
The Bank's growth forecasts for this year and next are on a downward trend, compared with forecasts of 1.9 per cent and 1.7 per cent in May.
The bank maintained its forecast for growth of 1.8 per cent in 2018.
The pound fell against the dollar and the euro followed.
The pound was down 0.5 per cent against the dollar at 1.31 and 0.4 per cent against the euro at 1.11.
The unchanged decision comes after mounting upward expectations were dashed by recent lackluster growth figures, with GDP rising to 0.3 per cent in the second quarter, compared with just 0.2 per cent in the previous three months.
The bank said growth was likely to remain at 0.3 per cent in the third quarter, although it would rise slightly at the end of the year.
Ordinary households have been hit by soaring inflation, while wage growth has been negligible, and the Bank of England's recent inflation report has not brought them good news, because the Bank says austerity will get worse before it gets better,
And said monetary policy "cannot prevent" the hit to earnings over the next few years, but wages are expected to recover "massively" by the end of the three-year forecast.
At the same time, the economy will be stimulated to offset some of the impact of low consumption because of the fall in the value of the pound and a big increase in demand for British goods.
The decision comes a year after a shock EU referendum sent the pound plummeting, with interest rates cut to 0.25 per cent in August.
The Bank of England estimates it could take up to four years to have a full impact on prices and the UK economy.
Calls for a rate increase came even before the Bank announced its latest interest rate decision, as inflation took its toll on already stressed households, and three policymakers called for a rise to 0.5 per cent in July.
Inflation retreated to 2.6 per cent last month from 2.9 per cent in June, although the Bank of England said this was expected and would rise again in the coming months.
The bank says the excess is completely the bottom line for the weak pound, relative to its 2 per cent target.
Andrew monterek, director of Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: "The mortgage market looks set to become more competitive again given the recent fall in swap rates, as lenders make a strong call for more business and look to finish the year on a positive note."
Such a market looks particularly advantageous for those who may be on the verge of closing their existing deals, as remortgaging (many with no fees and low interest rates) becomes increasingly popular.

NHS's controversial HIV drug given the green light
After the dust settles in the High Court over NHS drug funding, patients will be able to access "transformative" HIV prevention treatment from September.
NHS England has announced that pre-exposure prophylaxis (PREP), a drug that can be taken before sex, has been shown to reduce the risk of infection in people at high risk by about 86 per cent, and the health service will now offer the drug to an estimated 10,000 people through a three-year initial trial.
It agreed to fund the trial after the Court of Appeal upheld a High Court ruling last year, which said the NHS was entitled to pay for PrEP despite NHS claims that local authorities should fund the drug.
The move announced on Thursday was described as a "major new intervention" by NHS England chief executive Simon Stevens, while the National Aids Trust (NAT) described it as a "pivotal moment."
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be the first to be registered, and more will be added in October before being fully implemented across England in April 2018.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PREP) is an HIV drug taken before sex to reduce the risk of contracting HIV.
Trials have shown that PrEP can significantly reduce HIV transmission in people at risk of infection.
Taking PrEP before sex means there are enough specific drugs in the body to prevent HIV infection.
The drug can be taken every day or two hours before intercourse.
Those eligible for treatment include lesbian, gay, bisexual men, transgender people, and HIV positive people who have not been successfully treated.
The clinic will identify eligible, consenting participants, including men, women, transgender people, and those whose sexual partner's HIV status is unknown for antiretroviral treatment.
People who live in England and register as a general practitioner can also sign up at their local sexual health clinic.
The scheme will cost ¬£10m and the NHS England branch has signed a contract to procure the drugs this week following international competitive procurement.
The trial aims to assess the full potential of PrEP by gathering clinical evidence on how it is located, absorbed and implemented on a large sample basis.
Mr Stevens said: "this major new intervention should play a broad and increasingly successful complementary and reinforcing role in HIV prevention.
This is another milestone in more than 30 years of action worthy of progress in addressing humanity's major health challenges. ""
Deborah King, chief executive of the British AIDS Trust (NAT), said: "this is a pivotal moment in the fight against AIDS.
If it does target people in need and at risk, then pre-exposure prophylaxis drugs offer the potential to change the AIDS epidemic in the UK.
Starting in September, people at high risk of HIV will receive, through this NHS-funded trial in England, a permissible new tool that can truly be implemented on its own, without consultation with sexual partners, which will make a difference in the lives of a large number of people.
We have both hands in favour of this announcement. ""
Ian Green, chief executive of the Terrence Higgins Trust, said: "the priority now is to ensure that trials are pushed away quickly across the country and that none of those infected with HIV can fall.
Now that we have purchased the PrEP trial drug, we are ready to protect more than 10,000 people at high risk for HIV. ""
"After months of delays and government delays, the start of the PrEP trial was welcome and should have come sooner," said Sharon Hodgson of the shadow public health department.
The evidence shows how transformative this drug can be as part of our approach to preventing HIV and stopping the spread of this deadly infectious disease.

High quality living: apply the loft and clever design to make the earl's palace small apartment a spacious home
Joanne Leigh, a former banker, was so keen on renovating that in 2014 she moved from her large house in Knightsbridge to a small flat in Earl's Court.
The apartment is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and Joanne's failure to pack her bags to put it up for sale is a powerful testament to the new design.
"Before that, I was living with my ex in a bigger house in Knightsbridge," says Joanne.
"I was looking for the right house with the offer.
I saw this apartment at Earl's Palace, which also has high ceilings.
I would like to make an offer on the same day.
Since its first viewing, the 1,000 square foot apartment has now undergone a complete overhaul.
The apartment was originally a single room with a complex layout - it needed to go through the kitchen to get to the bedroom - and Joanne wanted to add storage space and a loft to make the most of the ample ceiling height.
"I want high ceilings, big windows, plenty of light.
That's what I'm asking for, "she said.
To that end, she hired Elvan Azadi from Duck shed architecture and design studio (in Notting hill) to use the 12.5-foot ceiling to craft a home that is not only a development project but also the place where Joanne lives.
The ceiling is not high enough to add two up and down spaces, so the architectural challenge is to create a loft that is high enough to stand.
Elvan had to be creative in order to solve the problem.
"The steel structure is quite complex," he explained.
"We have to arrange the space so that it is displayed up and down, and there is no need to shrug our shoulders.
It's not just as simple as building a simple platform, but also starting the steel so that it's at the right height to function. "
Through this arrangement, Elvan was able to acquire two full-height rooms in the space - which could add a number of interesting elements.
The loft features retro copper windows from the Retrouvius brand, which overlooks the glamorous living area.
Gold furniture with mirrors, small silver pieces and Serge Mouille retro lighting laid out the overall style.
The use of mirrors plays an important role in increasing the atmosphere, space and light.
Mirrors are installed at both ends of the short hallway to make it look longer.
In the kitchen, a splash board with mirrors is like a window to another room.
At Xuanguan, a small lattice with mirrors provides Joanne with storage space for the storage of cutlery and glassware.
The beautiful living room has an engaging sense of space, being able to put the kitchen away when it's not in use.
The fold-up kitchen is nothing new.
But what's unique about this fold-up kitchen is a garage style elevator door.
"There's some engineering knowledge involved here," Elvan explains of the reinforced veneered MDF doors.
"This uses the principle of balance, so when you push the door, it's easy to slide." "
Thanks to clever use of space and storage, Joanne gained an extra 16 square metres, an extra bedroom and an improved layout.
"Ultimately, what you're selling is the size of the home -- or the valuation of your property is based on the size of the home," says Elvan.
"Basically, the real estate agent would walk into the room and make calculations based on the size of the floor." "
They will manage to increase the footprint while using premium materials, thus bringing a sense of luxury to the space.
Mr Elvan said that "the material is all personally selected by you and therefore helps to create emotional bonds in the home."
'You don't fall in love with the power on the wall.
These things are important, but they don't tug at your heartstrings. ""
It turns out that with good design and the addition of extra space, standard apartments can shake up to wow you.
In fact, you might choose to live, just like Joanne.

Two brothers stage $500 million real estate empire fight
Forty years after their Italian family founded the dynasty, the brothers are locked in a battle for one of Victoria's largest real estate empires worth more than $500 million.
Colin de Lutis, a former Carlton Football Club director and developer, lives in a mansion in the Tukara district, three doors away from the home of his brother Paul, who took him to the Supreme Court over the division of their real estate and business assets.
Paul has been hoping to break away from the family business since 2014, but the brothers have argued bitterly in the Supreme Court over the asset split.
The brothers and their mother owned a total of 38 estates worth more than $500 million that had accumulated since the family bought Smith Street, Collingwood, in 1973.
There, the family founded Westco Jeans and gradually grew it to the size of 160 retail chains.
In 1999, it sold for $85 million.
That money was then ploughed into real estate, where the De Rutis family's portfolio of assets currently includes city office buildings, Brunswick and Sorrento developments, Gold Coast and Mount Buller apartments, and suburban shopping centres.
Under an agreement with his late father, Colin, who was described by his brother Paul as the "prime mover and dominant figure" of the De Rutis family, owned about two thirds of the company's assets, while Paul accounted for about a third.
Documents filed with the court said that, on conversion, the property owned by Colin was worth $316 million, while the property owned by Paul was worth $176 million.
Paul believes that the division of real estate and cash proved to be the crux of the negotiations.
"Colin's proposal for the division of property left him what I thought was the best property," he wrote in an initial court affidavit in 2015.
On Friday, the Supreme Court held its first hearing after several failed attempts at mediation.
Now the brothers are still battling for control of the existing business and Paul claims Colin has kicked him out.
Colin denied this and accused Paul of poor management of some real estate.
In an earlier affidavit filed by Colin, he expressed a desire to resolve the dispute.
"My Italian heritage determines that family is the most important option. My Italian ancestry determines that family is the most important," he wrote.
The cost of the case keeps climbing, and there are hundreds of pages of affidavits, emails, as well as company reports filed by Deloitte, Pitcher Partners, Charter Keck Cramer, top law firms such as Allan Myers, QC, and senior lawyers hired by both sides.
Ms de Rutis and her late husband Luigi, who are both Italian immigrants, have run the popular eatery and deli since the late 1950s and bought a shop in Brunswick in the early 1970s.
They used collateral to buy the Collingwood property, where Colin opened the family's first jeans shop.
Colin said, "When I was in high school," where he started Westco, "At the time, Paul was very young (about 10 years old)."
Anna de Rutis said she and Luigi, who died in 2012, wanted to be able to pass on the property peacefully to their son
"Luigi used to say to me that he never wanted the brothers to end up in court," she wrote.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer members of the De Rutis Group, and Colin said Mark paid $10 million to him and $26 million to Luke when he left the company.
Paul said both Luke and Mark had "expressed dissatisfaction with the terms of the division of their property."
According to TV star Eddie McGuire's biography, published in 2015, Colin has kept a low profile despite being a board member of the former AFL club.
"Fairfax Media" contacted Colin and Paul, along with their lawyers, on Friday.
But only Colin, who replied via text message, said that because the case had gone to court "I really can't say too much."
"It is very, very sad that my brother Paul has chosen to sue me and bring our family affairs to court," he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote in a court filing that he had tried to meet his brother's request.
"Our father does not want to see Paul and I end up having this current dispute," he said, adding that he "remains hopeful that the dispute will be resolved."
On Friday, that hope seemed to be dashed.
"Our problems will be resolved through the courts in the near future," Colin wrote.

Trump's new chief of staff plans to limit the president's media time
Others have tried and failed.
John F. Kelly might actually be able to do it.
If that's the case, then he's the first person.
The new White House chief of staff plans to restrict the flow of information to President Donald Trump - including news media reports - in a bid to keep the big boss on a more even keel, according to Politico, a US political news website.
Here's a quote from journalist Josh dawsey:
"When the new white house chief of staff, John F. Kelly, began his first day of work gathering discussions with senior officials, he pointed out that he was going to address one of the main problems with President Trump moving into the white house: the bad information flowing into the hands of the president."
Kelly told the officials that receiving good information helps the president make better decisions, so the information needs to go through his hands - both in writing and in briefings.
Kelly's diagnosis is similar, but others have tried, unsuccessfully, to tame it by spying on Trump's media time.
President Trump's TV addiction has a long history - and now in the White House, his TV viewing habits are still deepening.
"If candidate Trump is frustrated with unfair reporting, it would be helpful to let him know that he's also getting positive coverage in credible channels," Sam Nunberg, a former campaign adviser, told Politico in February.
Politico's Tara Palmieri wrote at the time that "based on the experience of six former campaign officials, the point of controlling Trump's tweeting habits is to ensure that a certain amount of praise is always included in the media messages he personally receives."
That's no problem at all.
But the idea that Trump's tweeting habits were once "controlled" is laughable.
It may be that these campaign officials know something we don't - that Trump's tweets would have been even angrier had it not been for their intervention.
We may never have known about those tweets that Trump didn't send.
If his staff can save him from the fire, even if only a few times, their efforts will be worth it.
But no one has been able to keep Trump from causing controversy.
Part of the problem is that in a White House of competing blocs, people promote their worldview and fancy advance their cause by submitting information to Trump that may or may not be reliable.
Politico - all about the story - reported in May on the advisers "penchant for providing questionable information to the president strategically.
This is an example described by journalist Shane goodmancher:
"Current and former Trump officials claim that Trump reacted to negative news segments like a volcanic eruption, especially those with damaging information leaks, and that he would be frantically trying to figure out where it came from," the letter states.
In late February, someone maliciously copied an article on the web firebrand Charles C. Johnson's website, gotnews.com, to the president, accusing deputy chief of staff Katie Walsh of being a "source of massive information leaks" for the White House, as Trump did at the time.
Even if Johnson had been permanently banned by Twitter for harassment, no concrete evidence had been provided, and he had blown up numerous false accusations, which he later publicly denied.
Trump read the article and then started asking officials about Walsh. ""
Goodmancher also said that then chief of staff Reince Priebus and White House Secretary Rob Porter "had tried to set up a system to manage and document the documents that Trump received."
And the result?
Kelly intends to do the same, in three months "time.
Maybe he can prove himself to be a more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump is still the impulsive Trump, and his aides are still competing with each other for influence.
These timeless influences will make Kelly's task even more difficult.

RV customers in talks over ditches, return to 'full-house'
Some of the wealthiest owners in the West Midlands are again at loggerheads with determined car-owners, who consulted over a government-dug ditch to demand the return of land outside the mansion.
The RVs parked their 20 trailers in a vacant lot off the bustling Solihull Street, which has been dubbed "Rich Hall Street."
The RVs, who led horses, carried babies and led caravans, returned again after being driven away in May, and the "moat" dug up by the city department did not prevent their entry.
The slick team spotted a gap in the defensive line, and although a section of the road was not barricaded to fit through, their vehicles squeezed through the gap.
Furious residents have lashed out at Solihull Council, saying it has "behaved badly in dealing with this issue."
One resident, who did not want to be named, said: "they were there on Monday night, before coming to bentleyheath street and throwing stones at passing passers-by.
The committee should be ashamed of what they have done, because they are simply useless in dealing with the problem.
The RVs came here in May and were then driven away, and now they are back.

Italy takes tough line on NGO migrant rescue boats
Italy has issued a warning to NGOs operating migrant rescue boats in the Mediterranean that they will not be allowed to continue rescues unless they sign up to new norms for the management of operations.
"If NGOs do not sign up to the new code of conduct, it is difficult to see what they will do," Interior Minister Marco Minniti told the Turin Daily News.
Minniti's warning came a day after it was seized by Italian authorities on suspicion that the crew of a ship owned by a German aid group, Youth Rescue, had actually colluded with human traffickers to assist illegal migrants.
The aid group, which has been operating for just one year, declined to comment on the specific subject of allegations by Italian prosecutor Ambrosio Carlottio.
"Saving lives is and will be the most important thing for us, so we regret not being able to operate in the search and rescue zone at this time," the group said in a social media statement.
"Having gathered all the information, we can only assess all the allegations and the situation at this time." "
Italian officials have been monitoring the "youth rescue" group's ship, the Iuventa, since October.
Its crew is suspected of carrying migrants brought directly by traffickers in small boats and allowing smugglers to make a hasty escape and reuse the ship.
At least one such encounter is said to have taken place at sea 1.3 miles off the coast of Libya, according to prosecutors' documents, the contents of which were published by Italian media.
Its crew is suspected of blatant disregard for the authority of the Italian coast guard, which oversees rescue operations in the area out of humanitarian zeal rather than any other motive.
According to the code of conduct, vessels such as the Iuventa clearly need an Italian police officer on board to monitor their activities.
Currently, of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations, only three have agreed to comply with the Code of conduct: Save the Children, the Migrant Offshore Aid Station based in Malta and the Proactiva Open Arms in Spain.
The latter said on Thursday it believed the new rules, while unnecessary, were acceptable because they would not bring any "significant changes and obstacles" to its rescue operations.
Among the organizations that refused to sign was the Nobel Prize winning organization Doctors Without Borders (MSF).
Meanwhile, Minniti says the number of migrants arriving in Italy has plummeted in recent weeks, suggesting that efforts to strengthen the Libyan coast guard and unite local mayors are beginning to bear fruit.
"In recent days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel," the minister said.
He unveiled plans for deep talks this month: with Libyan mayors on economic development activities, and with Chad, Niger and Mali on how to reduce the number of migrants who want to leave those countries for Europe.
Lian Ping, chief financial economist at Bank of Communications, said that industrial value-added growth is expected to accelerate to 6.6% in December, as industrial value-added in the first three quarters of 2017 is characterized by an upturn at the end of the quarter.

Industrial production, although it will be weaker than in October, is about the same as in November.

New measures of "university evacuation" in Beijing: tens of thousands of teachers and students of North chemical industry will be admitted to the new campus in Changping
The opening ceremony of the new campus of Beijing Chemical University was held in Changping District of Beijing on Tuesday, and the 1,800-acre green campus was put into use.
The reporter learned from the ceremony that in recent years, in order to strengthen the core functions of the capital and manage the "big city disease," in the context of the coordinated development of Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei and the evacuation of non-Capital functions, Beijing has accelerated the evacuation of central urban colleges and universities to the suburbs, some of the teachers and students are moving to Shunyi, Daxing, Fangshan and other new suburban campuses.
North chemical new campus is located in Changping Nankou Town, covering an area of 1,800 Mu, 40 kilometers from the city, is one of the key projects to solve the non-Capital functions.
The new campus will be built in three phases, with the first phase completed and the second phase expected to be fully operational by the end of this year. Upon completion, the project will meet the learning and living needs of nearly 20,000 undergraduates, graduate students and faculty.
Looking back at this year's film market, we found that the original text and the stars of the two groups of fans have become an important part of the film's intended audience.
At 17: 10 today, the 119 command center in Shaoyang City was alerted to a fire at the tetrahydrofuran stored at the Hongzhi chemical plant in longxutang, Shuangqing district of the city.
Shaoyang City Fire Detachment immediately dispatched 5 Squadron 20 fire engines to carry heavy anti-chemical clothing, anti-chemical washing vehicles and other equipment to the scene.
After a preliminary investigation, the fire broke out in small tanks storing chemicals such as tetrahydrofuran, which produced large plumes of smoke at the scene.
Up to the press release, fire officers and soldiers are tense rescue, the city health, security, environmental protection, public security, transportation and other departments have rushed to the scene, found no casualties.
Michelle Carter sentenced for texting Conrad Roy to commit suicide
A Massachusetts woman has been sentenced to two and a half years in prison for abetting her boyfriend's suicide through text messages and phone calls.
Michelle Carter, 20, will serve 15 months of her sentence, which can be converted to probation, plus five years of probation.
Carter was convicted in June of the involuntary manslaughter of Conrad Roy, who committed suicide on July 13, 2014.
Roy's father said at Thursday's hearing: "My family is heartbroken.
My son is my best friend.
While awaiting an appeal, Carter was allowed to keep his personal freedom.
She faces up to 20 years in prison, but her lawyers believe both she and Mr. Roy are mentally ill.
At his sentencing, Carter stood, wearing red trousers and a beige smock, his hands clasped, his eyes tearful, his eyes looking down.
"Her actions killed Conrad Roy," the prosecutor told the court.
'She ended his life in order to live better for herself.
She did not take responsibility, "the prosecutor said.
'She doesn't have any remorse.'
But Carter's lawyer said it was "a terrible consequence and she feels very remorseful."
However, Judge Lawrence Moniz said he did not find that her "age or maturity, or even her mental illness, would have any significant impact on her behaviour."
A prosecutor read a statement from Roy's mother, Lynn Roy, who said, "There is not a day that goes by that I do not grieve the loss of my beloved son."
I hope he is proud of me and what I have done and I am trying to stand with his sisters in all my pain that will be with us forever, "the statement said.
Mr Roy's sister, Camdyn Roy, testified that she was "in a trance" because she realised she would never be able to attend her brother's wedding or become an aunt to his children.
"It's a pain to lose someone who has been with me since I was born, and I will live with that pain for the rest of my life," she said.
The case appears to set a legal precedent because Massachusetts law does not make it a crime to encourage others to commit suicide.
In 2014, Roy was found dead of carbon monoxide poisoning in his car; that year, Carter was 17.
Carter's text messages reveal she egged him on to take his own life after the case sparked national attention.
"There are many ways to hang, jump, stab yourself," she said in several text messages sent two weeks before his death, while he was on holiday with his family.
In the period before he killed himself, she wrote: "You need to do this, Conrad," and "all you have to do is start the generator and then you will be free and happy."
Judge Moniz said Carter gained attention through Mr Roy's death and ordered her not to profit from the case through any media.
There is a difference of legal opinion in this case.
One of the few people to defend Carter was Amanda Knox, who was accused of murdering her British roommate in Italy in 2007 and was acquitted two years later.
"Michelle Carter deserves sympathy and help, not imprisonment," Ms. Knox, 30, said in a column published by the Los Angeles Times.

Reporter 2 From the Lhasa Pure Land Basketball Club learned that recently, the Lhasa Pure Land Basketball Youth team held in Beijing in the National Youth Basketball League finals won the fourth place.
Lhasa Pure Land Basketball Youth team composed of 11 local players, the head coach for the Lhasa Pure Land Men's Basketball Team Adult Team Assistant Coach Secondary Ren Sanzhu.

The team's results have improved compared to last year, with a marked improvement in players' confidence and mastery of the field.The exchanges between players and other teams are also more comprehensive, more on and off the field and more relaxed, Liang Junchao, general manager of the Lhasa Pure Land Basketball Club, told reporters.
After the game, Jiang Cuo, the team leader, said he hoped to accumulate experience by participating in the games and do his best for the cause of basketball in Tibet.
It is understood that in the competition in Beijing, the players overcame low altitude drunk oxygen and other factors, showing the image of Tibet.
Although track and field in the Olympic Games is a large gold medal, won the world of track and field, but the track and field athletes compared to attract gold is in the underdog.
Carmakers face shock as Audi to refit up to 850,000 diesel cars
Audi's announcement of the refit comes a day after BMW said it would provide software upgrades for more than 350,000 vehicles.
BMW's chairman said BMW believes "driving has more intelligent options than restrictions," meaning that major European cities - including Munich, where BMW is based - consider banning or restricting diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it would retrofit 3 million Mercedes cars in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions.
None of the companies claimed the move as a recall.
European carmakers have heavily promoted the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to help meet carbon dioxide emissions regulations.
But nitrogen oxides emitted by diesel engines are thought to be carcinogenic and can cause asthma.
Car companies are also increasing the cost of installing equipment to offset emissions from diesel vehicles, making it difficult to keep diesel cars competitive on price.
With German carmakers facing scrutiny, Chancellor Angela Merkel's government has also been accused of allowing these powerful car companies too much, and ignoring signs of the problem.
The car companies are trying to avoid a repeat of Volkswagen's mistake of covering up its use of so-called defeat devices, adjusting emissions to comply with regulations when cars are tested and returning to normal under normal driving conditions.
Multiple Volkswagen executives have been charged in the United States, while others are being investigated by countries on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former head of thermodynamics at Audi's engine research and development department was arrested in Germany.
Former manager Zacchero Giovanni Pameu, who is Italian and therefore not subject to extradition protection, could face trial in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi was embroiled in a German criminal investigation involving Volkswagen, and the German government accused Audi of installing systems to evade European emissions requirements, expanding the scope of an investigation previously limited to the United States.
Audi's investigation is likely to have a major impact on volkswagen: the luxury automaker holds a disproportionate share of Volkswagen's profits.
It is not uncommon for a movie to take a year or two, or even years, from preparation to release.
The animated film "The Big Fish Begonia" has been announced for release on July 8, a 12-year period from preparation to release!
"Big Fish Begonia" original author Liang Jun, 21 years old from Tsinghua University thermal power major, and friends Zhang Chun created the other side of the sky, in 2008 won the joint venture source million US dollars, launched the animated film debut "Big Fish Begonia."
The film has won many awards at home and abroad in the creative sample stage, and has been included and praised as "one of the most outstanding works of art" by the Pompidou Center for Contemporary Art in France.
After six years of creativity and production, the film has been dubbed a "sinkhole" by millions of fans looking forward to its release.
"Big Fish Begonia" tells a fantasy story that belongs to the Chinese people. With the release of the trailer, it brings new expectations for all audiences.
"It's only done this for 12 years and now it's gone from a dream to reality and I'm both nervous and excited," Liang said.
"Always thinking about using fifty percent of someone else's budget to make the exact same picture effect, the team is going to drive me crazy," Zhang said.
Dongguan, a "world factory" that once relied on processing materials and a large number of general workers, is looking to those who can lead the city to reposition high-level talent.
Recently, Dongguan city government held a high-level talent Activity Week, the first financial reporter saw that some of the strength of the local enterprises have to participate in the talent fair.
On the billboards, which are particularly bright against an orange background wall, they each carry a hefty price tag.

Lavender in Provence under threat from climate change
Lavender has become a symbol of the city of Provence in the south of France, but now there is bad news that it is under threat from climate change.
Lavender is declining due to the ongoing drought and the emergence of insects that carry the virus, creating a headache for scientists and farmers who are trying to find a solution.
Eric chaisse, an expert at the provence-based Institute of Agricultural Research (CRIEPPAM), said: 'lavender in Provence is facing a huge threat because the plant has been affected by climate change in recent years, with a significant reduction in rainfall in the spring and a rainy autumn.
This affects the life cycle of lavender.
There is also a smaller individual cicada, a leaf hopper that can spread microscopic bacteria, which can appear in large numbers in very dry weather
The point is that the numbers are huge.
In addition to attracting holidaymakers, lavender oil is also sought after by the perfume and cosmetics industries.
"In contrast to plants that can have many large flowers and have long ears of grain, we have problems with smaller individuals, stunted growth, loss or weakness," Erik Chase said.
So we have less essential oils. ""
Solutions being studied include adopting better irrigation techniques and slowing the evaporation of soil moisture, spraying plants with a protective mixture of clay and water, and the development of more drought-resistant varieties.
Compared to the sci-fi elements in the film, the two stars have said it is the story in the film that appeals to them more.

Mexico is dangerous, journalists killed
The entire staff of the weekly newspaper Riodoce usually gather on Wednesday to review their plans for coverage of the unrest in the state of Sinaloa, caused by criminal organizations, corrupt officials and an endless war on drugs.
But today, the shadow of tragedy hangs over themselves, and they come together to discuss security.
They were told to change their daily habits, which was important.
Two senior journalists discussed which felt safer: whether to take their children to the office (which was hit by a grenade attack in 2009) or leave them at home.
Security experts wrote three words on a blackboard at the front of the room: enemies, neutrals and allies.
They asked these journalists to put their names under each column - without the need for evidence, observation and intuition.
There are suspected drug dealers, politicians, businessmen and journalists on the government's list, or cartels, the gang of villains who make Mexico's reporting work dangerous.
Violence has never ceased, and there are more and more journalists in the country: according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, at least 25 journalists have died since President Enrique Pe√±a Nieto took office in December 2012; 589 journalists are under federal protection after attacks and threats; and at least seven have died in seven states so far this year.
The last to die was their editor and inspiration, as well as Javier Valdez C√°rdenas, co-founder of Rimodioce.
Valdez, who has written many books on drug violence, wrote in one: "The biggest mistake is living in Mexico and being a journalist."
There was a deep sense that he was gone, though he was everywhere - a huge photograph hung on the front of the rimodioce office building, Valdez raising his middle finger with the word "justice"; the T-shirts of Aaron Illawarra and Miriam Ramirez, two journalists in their 30s, displayed his smile, his glasses or his trademark Panama hat.
The seminar was held less than two months after his death; journalists rushed to discuss their shared trauma, nightmares, insomnia and paranoia.
Although a special federal prosecutor's office was created in 2010 to handle journalists' cases, the office indicted only two people, according to records from the Committee to Protect Journalists.
Most of the thousands of crimes each year involve drug trafficking and organized crime, so the killers of journalists are rarely brought to justice.
In the Riodoce, they insist on reporting on the violence in the state of Sinaloa, though they are heartbroken, even though the land is riddled with holes.
'Without information about the killer, without justice, it wouldn't be very useful to have a security seminar,' Mr. Iwala said.
"It would be foolish to waste time attending a seminar like this," he said.
As long as we don't know why, you don't trust anyone. ""
Valdez left the office of "Rimodioce" in the capital, Culiacan, on the morning of May 15.
His red Toyota Carolla was only a few blocks away when he was stopped by two men; they forced him out of the car and fired 12 shots, presumably because of the newspaper's name - which translates as "twelve rivers."
The gangster drove off in his car and crashed it nearby.
Valdez is 50 years old.
Leaving behind his wife and two grown children.
Culiacan was full of talk.
But on the subject of Valdez, there was really nothing but silence.
Since Guzman's arrest last year and his extradition to the United States in January, the state of Sinaloa has become the bloodiest battleground in the country, with rival forces fighting like crazy.
The streets of Sinaloa state, where one or more people are shot every day, and cemeteries filled with the drug lord's ornate two-story mausoleums, have become commonplace.
Forget for a moment that the state of "calm" is when only one cartel controls this waterfront state and its ports and drug trafficking routes to the United States.
Even so, even though Valdez was acutely aware of the dangers of the job, Ismael Bohoqui, 60, co-founder and director of Rimodioce, felt guilty about failing to protect his friend.
He believes two mistakes contributed to the tragedy.
First, an interview with Damaso Lopez, who led a cartel that fought several of Guzman's sons, was published in February.
The report may have angered the sons; the paper was bought by suspected gang members as soon as it arrived at the newsstand.
The second mistake was not to force Valdez to leave Mexico for his own safety after another newspaper covering the same story was seized.
Valdez is a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his death is of great significance to the violence against journalists in Mexico.
His spirit lives on, and his friends and colleagues believe he has always been with us.
He was also a senior correspondent for Noroeste in 2003, the year he co-founded five colleagues to launch the Riodoce, selling a $50 stake.
In the state of Sinaloa, "It's impossible to go into journalism without dealing with the drug problem," Mr. Poholquin said.
As time went on, the paper gained a good reputation for bold and honest reporting, and sales and advertising increased.
Journalists like to be able to publish critical investigative stories without fear of censorship, and readers like newspapers to publish stories that others are afraid to report.
"Rimodioce" won Latin America's Maria Mosscabo Journalism Award five years after it was founded.
The same year the Society for the Protection of Journalists awarded Valdez the International Press Freedom Award for his courage in pursuing the most authentic Mexican drug coverage.
He confessed that he was scared, too.
While the Society for the Protection of Journalists awarded the award, he said "I want to continue to live."
Later, in late October, he claimed in an interview with local television station Rompeviento TV that "in the state of Tinaro, drug trafficking is a way of life,
You have to take on the task that falls to you as a journalist - either that or play dumb.
I don't want to be asked 'What have you done in the face of so much death... why are you not vocal about what is going on?'
The entire staff at Rimodioce were nostalgic for Valdez, for swearing like a Docker, for the friend who was never generous with hugs and advice, for the teacher who knew how to live.
They depend on his habits.
He used to wear that hat.
The El Guayabo bar, which is often opposite the office, also always sits at the same table.
Now, they will ask: was it his daily habits that caused his downfall?
His death also forced them to think about how to do a good job and live well.
"They don't like the fact that you're causing trouble for their women and their children, or that you're influencing their legitimate companies and the secret airports that are used to transport drugs," Poholquin said.
It's all over their line. ""
The result is a high level of self-censorship and self-preservation, even in the safest of times.
Trust your instincts.
If you smell danger, stay away.
The problem, says Andreas Villarreal, editor of Riodoce, is that "breath is a feeling that will be cheated... and then something like Havel will happen."
He and others say that the old rules no longer apply to the state of Sinaloa - just as they no longer apply to the states of Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero, and others, where smuggling routes are lucrative and institutions are weak, government officials corrupt and smoky.
The situation is constantly changing.
In the room where rimodioce employees took part in security training, mobile phones were suddenly not allowed; a few days earlier, spyware allegedly sold only to the government had already been used in Mexico to spy on journalists and activists.
Outside, two police officers took shelter from the 104 degree (40c) heat in the shade of a tree.
They were sent by the state government to protect Rimodioce's offices, which are located in a four-storey building in the middle class block of Culiacan.
Some reporters half-jokingly quipped that they did not know whether the police would belong to the governor's own version of the incredible 50%.
Journalists have been going to the mountains for months, where drug cartels are under the control of a physical presence.
This week's "Riodioce" focuses on three big things.
Among them was the murder of the brother of the great former boxer Julio Cesar Chavez of the state of Sinaloa,
And the disclosure of government funding for the governor's home state,
As well as the kidnapping inside an expensive restaurant in Culiacan, which is just a block from the prosecutor's office.
Officials do not release information about the kidnap victims or the process, so it would be prudent to write down what the city knows: the restaurant is a popular destination for drug dealers and officials alike.
A journalist learned from a public file that the restaurant was registered in the name of a politician from the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), which has dominated the political classes for most of the last century.
More recently, several PRI governors have been accused of corruption in several high-profile cases.
Villarreal asked reporters to write about previous incidents at the site, including one in which a son of Guzman, Mexico's top drug lord, escaped a military attack.
If only a few months ago, readers would have checked Valdez's column for the most powerful message about the kidnapping.
"Before, we knew what was going on," said Villarreal, 46, known as "skinny" because of his thin body.
Now all of our information source communication channels have been cut off.
Valdez's office is now used to store signs and stickers protesting the killing of journalists, as employees become what they never wanted to be: activists representing the media.
The Next Morning reporter Miriam Ramirez casually grabbed a sign and walked out of the room, heading to the local prosecutor's office for a march related to another reporter.
Salvador Adame disappeared in the western state of Michoacan three days after he was killed in Valdez.
Officials found a charred body and said that according to DNA tests, this was his body.
Across the country, journalists have become more outspoken, organizing protests and painting the words "Save the Media" on sidewalks and buildings.
It was a day when director Bohoquin, who was not in Washington, was trying to get justice for the Valdez case and gain international support.
The day after Valdez was killed, during a meeting with the governor of the state of Sinaloa, Ramirez accused officials of spying on journalists and killing them for telling the truth.
Given that her anger has affected her objectivity, she has also asked to step down from her post covering government affairs.
Valdez has repeatedly reiterated that journalists in Mexico are "surrounded" by organized crime, complicit government officials and an indifferent society.
In his last book, Drug Journalism, he wrote that journalists were not just mutilated by drug cartels, but were on a list of politicians and security forces who co-operated with organized crime.
Media watchdog group Articulo 19 has blamed police and public officials for more than half of last year's attacks on journalists.
"In Mexico, they let you die just to shut you up," Ramirez said.
Clearly, these murders are chilling.
No one has forgotten that six years ago, blogger Maria Elizabeth Mathias died on the northern border of Tamaulipas.
Next to her body was a note allegedly signed by the Zetas cartel: "I'm here for my coverage."
Her head was cut off and a computer keyboard and headphones were placed next to her.
After Miloslava Breci was killed in March, some newspapers chose to close, such as the newspaper El Norte on the northern border of the state of Chihuahua.
Others continued, with the killing of the directors of El Manana of Nuevo Laredo in 2014, but they continued.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juarez spoke openly about drug cartels with a front page story, with the headline "What do you want from us?"
Some of the journalists fled their homeland, or even left the country.
It's a tough choice.
It is difficult to find work in exile, and they still need to be careful and alert to danger in the streets.
Sometimes they are arrested, allegedly after photographer Ruben Espinosa was killed along with four women in a Mexican city in 2015, three months after fleeing Veracruz.
For those who stay behind the scenes and continue to work, it's a daily dance step for high-risk decisions.
Mr Iwalla, who had wanted to be a poet, admitted that reporting on the drug trade had left him terrified.
"Mexico is turning into hell, so I became a journalist," he said.
In the middle of the night on a recent Friday, the latest issue of the paper had gone to press, and the editors of the Riodoce were sitting in the aisles outside their offices drinking beer when, suddenly, their phones rang.
Nineteen people have been confirmed dead in a series of gun battles between rival gangs and security forces near the beach resort city of Mazatlan.
The fighting has also escalated, as foreshadowed by a series of cartel messages found in the region.
Right by the side of the road, they uploaded the news to Rimodioce's website via their mobile phones.
The next day's headlines had to be changed.
Sirens blared nearby - and there was another shootout in the area in a duel between life and death.
Bohoquin glanced at the police officers standing guard to see if they were alert.
If they were a little scared, they didn't show it.
The founder of the newspaper had been killed, and on his large portrait, his middle finger pointed to where the entire state of Tinaro needed to look, and the entire staff of the Riodoce followed him.
"How could you even want to shut down? The same day that Havel was killed, the intern asked me to send her out on the street to participate in the coverage," Poholquin said.
China's self-driving car tourism 2020 market size or breakthrough trillion yuan
[abstract] against a backdrop of escalating consumption and free travel, self-driving is encouraged by state policies and enjoyed by a growing number of consumers.
But at the same time, the self-driving market, which is expected to break through the trillions, faces a double challenge.
Against the backdrop of escalating consumption and the prevalence of free travel, self-Driving Travel is encouraged by national policies and enjoyed by a growing number of consumers.
At the same time, however, the self-driving market, which is expected to break through the trillions, is facing a double challenge. On the one hand, the development of the self-driving industry is not in direct proportion to market demand, and the self-driving tour organisers such as self-driving clubs and travel agencies are facing a low profit margin.
Accounting for 60% of the total domestic tourism, the market size is expected to break trillion
With 4.44 billion domestic tourists in 2016, self-driving travel accounts for about 60 percent of the total domestic tourism, and the market is expected to exceed one trillion by 2020.
According to statistics on the number of self-driving trips conducted by the China Association of tourist coaches, the number of self-driving trips has continued to grow over the past five years, and the proportion of tourists in China is stable at more than half.
At the same time, more attention and support has been shown at the regional and national levels to the emerging field of self-driving tourism, with the intensive introduction of policies and regulations related to self-driving, caravan and camping tourism from 2016 to 2017.
In July 2017, eight departments, including the National Tourism Administration and the State Administration of Sports, jointly issued the "development plan for self-driving sports camps"; in the same month, the "action plan for promoting quality upgrading of rural tourism development (2017)" jointly issued by 14 departments, including the NDRC and the Ministry of Finance, the self-driving tour was highlighted.
The introduction of the policy provides opportunities and policy guidance for the development of domestic self-driving tourism.
Self-driving club profit is meager, the complete industrial chain is the key
Although the domestic self-driving market potential, national policy active guidance, but the industry is still in the primary stage.
There are thousands of self-driving clubs, auto clubs and car clubs in China, but the majority of self-driving trips are made by tourists, with only about 15 percent of visitors attending car clubs and self-driving clubs, according to the 2016-2017 Annual Development Report.
At the same time, there are only a handful of online travel companies and traditional travel agencies that have developed their own self-driving PRODUCTS. Many online travel platforms sell only self-driving products provided by some suppliers, and some self-driving clubs are also important suppliers.
From the Organization of self-driving activities, covering "eat, live, travel, travel, buy, entertainment" many aspects, a high degree of fragmentation, the upstream supply chain heavy, tourists consumption randomness.
Beijing World Automobile Club founder and CEO Li Guanjie believes that the self-driving Club is essentially similar to travel agencies, the main early profit models are mainly off-line activities, the core point is the self-driving line products and Tour Escort Services.
But now in the field of self-driving tour line product homogeneity is serious, the leader service level is uneven, the self-driving club is facing the need to transform again.
It can be seen that the self-driving tour itself is not an independent industry, but with its own displacement characteristics of the formation of a cross-regional, industry ecological circle, forming a complete industrial chain is very important.
Experts point out that in addition to basic tourism consumption, experience is the more important element of consumption.
Therefore, for the development of the self-driving tour industry, we should enhance the experience features, develop the "self-driving tour +" theme and the IP of the self-driving tour products.
Scenic byways are not only roads, car camps should not only meet accommodation and food
Facing the rise of self-driving tour, the basic supporting development of self-driving tour is also relatively elementary.
Li pointed out that Tourism Scenic Road is not just a road, but the need to integrate the elements of transport and tourism, but road repair and tourism itself is the responsibility of the two departments, the transport sector to increase tourism elements, but also stay in the construction of toilets, advisory centres, publicity bars and other facilities, and tourism integration is not high.
Compared with the well-known self-driving tour route "American Highway 66," the construction experience is worth learning from.
Scenic byway design is no longer the most direct route between the destination and the destination. It follows the concept of "fun driving experience" and provides the best way for self-driving tourists to enjoy the beautiful scenery along the road. It links the Point-shaped and face-shaped tourism landscape, retaining both the historical and cultural value of the ECO-tourism resources and thematic activities to enhance the participation and economic benefits of tourism.
In addition to the scenic road, the camp is also a self-driving tour of the important supporting facilities.
But among the self-driving tourists The Beijing News reporter knows, there are not many consumers who choose to stay at the camp.
They believe that many camps in favour of infrastructure, can only meet food and shelter, low-grade, single products, unable to meet the needs of self-Driving Travel, which contains many elements.
People in the industry who do not want to be named said that in previous years, many of the camp enterprises are to take land, after taking land, the late supporting infrastructure construction and services have not kept up, operating conditions are a lot of losses, and without the late injection of funds, it is difficult to do some matching products.
Consumer group
In terms of age, the self-driving group is concentrated in the 21-40 age group, especially the 31-40 age group, which has a certain economic base and a high demand for personalized travel and is often a child-friendly customer, according to 2017 data released by the China Travel and Transportation Association.
From the accommodation survey, the self-driving people prefer non-standard accommodation.
From the type of self-driving tour, peripheral self-driving is the most important type of self-driving tour, accounting for 84.32%.
Exit self-driving is the aspiration of many people, but the proportion is still small.
At the same time, with the rise of consumer demand, tourists used to like self-driving "tourist attractions" began to change the concept, no longer "get out of the car to take photos, get in the car and sleep," but to pay more attention to the experience and process of the journey.
Dinosaurs used camouflage to hide from enemies
At first glance, it looks terrible, but it looks like a statue.
Researchers have released the first results of research into the rhinocerose-like, incredible fossilized creature found by Canadian miners, pointing out that the fossil is so well preserved that experts have dubbed it the "Mona Lisa of the dinosaur world."
The fossil was so well preserved that it was able to determine that its scaly skin was reddish brown, suggesting it had had some "troubling experiences."
Related reports in the journal Current Biology describe it as "the most well-preserved armored dinosaur ever found, and one of the best dinosaur specimens in the world."
The fossil is a newly discovered species of Sarcoidosaurus that lived between 110 million and 112 million years ago in the middle of the Cretaceous period.
Its extremely well preserved condition shocked researchers, who described it as "truly breathtaking."
The herbivorous armored dinosaur fossil is the best preserved dinosaur of its kind ever found, according to National Geographic.
Shawn Funk found the fossil while digging at the Suncor Millennium mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011.
At that time, he came across something that seemed different from the rocks around him, so he decided to take a closer look.
After that, the fossils he found were sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology in Canada.
It took the researchers six years to reveal the beast, which was hidden inside 2,500 pounds (1,100 kg) of Earth.
After all this hard work, the final results have only now been made public.
"If you look at it, you almost believe it's sleeping," says Caleb Brown, a scientist and first author at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature is on display
"It's going to be one of the most beautiful and well-preserved dinosaur specimens in the history of science - the Mona Lisa in the dinosaur world." "
By studying its skin, the researchers found that the herbivore, though clad in armour like a walking tank, was at risk of a major threat from carnivorous dinosaurs.
The heavily armored dinosaur used a red-and-white camouflage to hide from predators and a covert technique known as "Anti-shade," which is also used by many modern animals.
In this way, it was able to better blend in with its surroundings and thus ward off enemies, suggesting it was preyed upon by larger dinosaurs, experts said.
The 110,000-year-old creature, which is part of the Sarcoidosaurus family, first made headlines in May and is currently on display at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.
After Mark Mitchell, a museum technician who was part of the team, spent 7,000 hours meticulously unveiling the behemoth, researchers have now studied it and named it "borealopelta Mark Mitchelli."
The samples are extremely well preserved, allowing Dr. Mitchell, and the international team of scientists, to record the patterns and shapes of scales and armor on their bodies.
They found "anti-shading," a common form of defense in the animal kingdom, which means the creature's back is darker than its side.
Although "anti-shading" was common, the findings were surprising because the dinosaur was much larger than the existing animals that used it.
Faced with the pressure of being hunted by meat-eating dinosaurs, this dinosaur evolved in a favorable direction, allowing it to hide in counterpoint as a means of survival.
But most of the existing animals that use anti-shading, such as deer, zebra or armadillo, are as small and vulnerable as prey, suggesting that the creature is under real pressure to survive.
"The fact that large, heavily armored dinosaurs were subjected to a feeding frenzy shows how dangerous the Cretaceous carnivorous dinosaurs were," Brown said.
Chemical analysis of the organic compounds in its scales also showed that the dinosaur's skin was reddish brown in color.
Scientists are continuing to study the creature's vital clues, including its preserved stomach contents, to find the last food to eat.
They believe the dinosaur fell into the river at the time of his death, was then swept into the sea and eventually sank to the bottom of the sea with his back down.
At the time, Alberta's climate was as warm as it is today in South Florida, and rivers and oceans may be further inland than they are now.
"This sarcoidosaurus is truly amazing because it is completely covered in preserved squamous skin and, to this day, is preserved in dimensional space, allowing its original shape to be preserved," Brown said.
"As a result, the creature is now almost the same shape as it was during the Cretaceous period.
You don't have to use much imagination to reconstruct it; if you look at it, you almost believe it's sleeping.
The Cretaceous period was the time when bipedal walking large theropod dinosaurs roamed the Earth.
Although Tyrannosaurus Rex was the king of the dinosaurs, it emerged millions of years after the armored dinosaurs, which may have been killed by some of the Tyrannosaurus Rex's ancestors.
They include the high Spinosaurus, a behemoth that weighs six tons and is 38 feet (11.5 meters) long.
Scientists whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology believe Sarcoidosaurus was washed into the sea after his death and later mummified in the soil.
Sean Fink excavates the creature at the Millennium Mine near Fort McMurray, Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011.
It is the world's best preserved armored dinosaur, complete with skin and armor in areas from the nose to the hips, according to the museum.
The creature is on average about 18ft (5m) long and weighs up to 3,000lbs (1,300kg).
It has two 20-inch-long spikes that protrude from the shoulder.
Researchers believe the herbivorous armored dinosaur was active in what is now western Canada before being washed into the sea by rivers that erupted in floods.
However, the dinosaur was buried at the bottom of the sea to allow its armour to be preserved intact.
The fossilized remains of this particular specimen were so well preserved that the remaining skin was still covered with jagged patches of the dinosaur's skull.
As Michael Greshko writes in National Geographic, this level of preservation, like Mid-Color, is rare.
The more I looked at it, the more I thought it was unbelievable.
The remaining skin fossils are still draped over the mottled armor on the dinosaur's skull.
Its right front palm is on its side, with its five toes spread upward.
I can count them out.
The reporter learned that adding natural or plant-derived alginate, humic acid and amino acid synergistic carriers to the urea production process can modify the traditional urea, the formation of alginate urea, Zinc rot urea, grain urea nitrogen utilization ratio of 5 to 10 percentage points higher than ordinary urea.
Environment friendly, crop yield potential is obvious, especially large particle value-added urea is the high quality raw material of BB fertilizer.
The total number of security personnel is more than double the number at the 2012 London Olympics.
To ensure the safety of the Rio Olympics, Brazil will launch its largest ever security linkage program.
Previously, the Brazilian government said a total of 85,000 people from the army and police would fight in concert, including 20,000 military personnel and 65,000 police officers.
Most of the military will be responsible for guarding the Olympic venues, while the 3,000 additional troops will be responsible for security at international airports, subway stations and streets.
Police officers patrol other parts of the city, including subways, buses and streets.
It is understood 6,000 troops have now arrived in Rio to provide security for the Games.
As well as being in charge of the four main competition areas for the Rio Games, they are also responsible for patrolling the airport as well as the main roads linking the airport to the Olympic venues.
The introduction of evaluation mechanisms in the service industry is not new. To make evaluation mechanisms effective, it is important to make regulation more effective and less formal.
How do activists learn to answer the question: "Whose Streets?"
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell was distraught.
On the first day of his trip to New York City, the St. Louis native sat in his rented bed in Epping and scrolled through Facebook on his phone.
She came across a post from a high school student.
It reads "Police just killed an 18-year-old and the child is still lying in the street."
She was baffled to find that no one else on the feed had posted the message, and she shut down Facebook and opened the tweet.
One @ TheePharoah user kept pushing her dynamic times.
The St. Louis area rapper Live tweeted the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old who was shot and killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri.
He posted a picture of Brown's lifeless body lying in the street, where his body lay for four hours.
"Crazy," Ferrell thought to himself.
But death is nothing new for her and her community.
She put down her phone and didn't turn on the tweet again until the same evening, reading the tweet about the gathering of people on Canfield Avenue.
There were police videos and pictures of people shouting, and a picture of a man claiming to be Brown's father, which read: "Ferguson police just killed my unarmed son!"
She saw a live feed of a police officer standing in front of a group of protesters with a barking dog.
In another video, she said, another officer raised his rifle and screamed, "I will kill all of you... the beast."
"It's not normal," Ferrell recalled.
"This is not what we are used to and can call a typical murder."
At that moment, I felt a shudder.
I was angry and I cried.
She booked a return flight and went home the next day.
After landing at 11 p.m., she picked up her 6-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided the two would head to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson over the next three years is the subject of a new documentary, "Whose Streets?," which opens in theaters on August 11.
It is a story of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and fortitude from the perspective of the people who live in this community and fill the streets demanding answers.
As Ferrell drove to Ferguson with her daughter (wearing a floral dress and crown accessories), the pair revisited the topic they had discussed countless times before that morning - "about the black experience and the black condition."
"Do you remember when I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe in?" she recalled.
'We're going to Ferguson now because it's not right that the police killed an 18-year-old boy.
I had to take her, "Ferrell said later.
"What happened today is the culmination of everything that has happened in the past...
She wants to know, see, and rise from this.
Not only does she need to develop well in terms of radicalism and organisation, but to understand the different dimensions of the black experience and the black condition, to understand what we have to do to be free and liberated.
Even if I had the privilege of providing her with experiences of racism that she had not experienced firsthand, she was no different from other black girls.
If I protect her in this matter, I feel like I'm hurting her. ""
Their first stop in Ferguson was at a venue opposite the South Florissant Road police station, which became their camp after activists waited until the outcome of Officer Darren Wilson's eventual failure to prosecute.
Ferrell and her daughter got in touch with a local business owner who made bagged lunches.
They prepared the bags and were responsible for passing them on to the protesters.
Slowly, Ferrell began to form a new type of activism.
"My radicalism changed completely after August 9," she says, as an undergraduate at Missouri State University in St. Louis, where she was president of the Minority Nurses Association and focused on food justice and health disparities in black communities.
"I have no organizational experience.
That's how it all came about. ""
A few weeks later, Ferrell met with the film's co-director, Sabah Fulyan, during a nighttime parade.
Fleyan said she and her director of photography, Lucas Alvarado Farrer, "Just wanted to document" what happened.
Ferrell had a question on his mind: "Do you want to record or do you want to find a story that you can exploit?"
This suspicion stems from a number of cases in which people - often white - enter a community to benefit from its pain and fortitude.
As Folijan explained in a recent interview, "We hear that native people in Ferguson don't concentrate their voices, and we want to do it in a different way."
Folijan has been in touch with co-director Damon Davis, a regional artist known for his activism against death row inmates.
His involvement led Ferrell to join the "Whose Streets?" project team, along with six other locals, for years after Brown's shooting.
"This documentary is not someone speaking for us or talking to us, this is our statement," Davis said.
"I mainly focus on how these characters are presented, because that's how I'm presented as well." "
While the goal is not to focus on Ferrell's experience - but to show that the movement is "not about messianic leaders, it's about community cohesion," Freyan said - she proved to be the most open-minded of the film's participants.
As a result, "Whose Streets?" surprisingly documents Ferrell's personal life, such as falling in love and getting married.
"I feel naked," Ferrell laughed when he first saw the finished product.
"But I understand that there has to be a degree of vulnerability to do this work and humanize black people." "
In addition, Ferrell's story reaffirms and repositions the role of black queer women in the broader Black Lives Matter movement.
Two of the movement's three founders - who created # BlackLivesMatter on social media in the wake of the 2012 shooting of black teenager Trevor Martin - have been identified as cool kids.
"The black queer women in the leadership have propped up the movement in general," Ferrell said, "and that's because we keep fighting on multiple fronts.
Black queer women have to bear it all. ""
Fleyan agreed and mentioned that "the movement really has the support of black women and a lot of black queer women."
Because of her identity, Ferrell was chosen to be at the heart of the film, however, she insists that "it's not an affirmative action for things."
"She's the one who inspires that energy," she said.
"Although she's on the front line, it's not a coincidence, because in life at these intersections, as a black queer woman, you have so much to do," she said.
You can feel her energy on the screen.
Meanwhile, in Ferguson, news cameras have long since disappeared, but strained race relations between the community and the police remain.
Ferrell was sentenced to more than two and a half years of probation for trying to block a highway during a parade.
She describes the sociopolitical climate of the area she calls home: "A mess."
Still, since taking to the streets of Ferguson three years ago, she has stuck to the chants she has worked so hard to remember.
"We have a duty to fight for our freedom.
We have a responsibility to win.
We must love each other and support each other.
We have nothing to lose but our chains.
In fact, online translation services were available on the web a decade ago, and the argument that "machines are about to take the place of humans" was heard long ago.
Similarities: the artist used Chelsea Manning's DNA to create the portrait
In the middle of the pavilion at the Friedman gallery in New York, there are multiple faces: white, black and brown, each with an almost imperceptible resemblance to each other, tied by strings dangling from the ceiling.
The 30 portraits were created by artist Heather Dewey Hagegborg using cheek swabs and hair detritus sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent hair detritus from the Fort Leavenworth prison, where the former intelligence analyst was sentenced to 35 years for leaking classified diplomatic cables through the WikiLeaks website.
The exhibition, which opens on August 2, is titled "Similarities."
It was the culmination of two years of correspondence between Dewey Harburg and Manning, who combined his discipline with himself in technology, computer science and art, while Manning, a prominent dissident who went to prison and completed gender reassignment surgery while in prison, and former U.S. President Barack Obama, three days before the end of his term, pardoned the remainder of her sentence.
Using an algorithmic analysis of Manning's DNA to create 30 portraits of the "likely appearance," Heather Dewey Harburg made a scathing and slightly unkind comment, both about the polysemousness of DNA and about the very concept of identity.
Manning, who was born under the name Bradley Edward and had publicly admitted to thinking of herself as a woman during her adolescence, was convicted in 2013 on 20 charges, including six Espionage Act violations, computer fraud and theft.
While in prison, her image was suppressed, with only one photograph, grainy black and white selfie, looking visibly upset, sitting in the driver's seat, wearing a platinum blonde wig.
In 2015, Heather Dewey Haberger was a huge success with her 2012 project, "The Faces of Strangers."
In that work, she used DNA extracted from the detritus from cigarette butts and chewing gum to create 3D portraits of people who might look similar.
That's when she happened to receive an email from Paper magazine.
"They want to interview Chelsea Manning in prison, and they need a portrait," Heather Dewey Harberg told the media at the opening of the exhibition.
Chelsea Manning was unable to visit or take photographs at the time, so they contacted Chelsea to ask if she would be interested in making a DNA portrait.
So the artist and her imprisoned muse became unlikely pen pals, exchanging a number of letters with each other over the course of two years.
They even created a comic book, "The Repressed Head," by Shoili Kanungo, which envisioned that the president would grant privileges to Manning in the future, and that she would be able to see an exhibit in prison.
Obama asked for her release just days after the book was published, perhaps by chance, when Manning was in his seventh year in a Kansas military prison.
And there's another layer of depth to the show, because in contemporary America, the Trump administration is constantly declaring war on government leakers and transgender servicemen, while looking for new ways that can be hyped up on Twitter to nakedly foment division, which the show is meant to bridge.
Asked about the peculiar timing of it all, Heather Dewey Haberger said, "Anything happens for a reason."
In the artist's statement written on the gallery wall, Manning's oversized signature is below (the "i" in the name is drawn with a heart), calling for an end to "partisan mudslinging based on gender, sexual orientation and culture."
On the opposite wall was her mitochondrial DNA sequence, written in pencil zigzags with Cs, Gs, and as symbols.
By containing 200 letters (or nucleotides, each artist's complex scientific dictionary), Heather Dewey haberger hopes to express how everyone is, at least in terms of their physiological structure, by portraying these eerily similar portraits.
"I want people to get out of this, that our genome doesn't care about who we are, how publicly available genetic data is interpreted, how subjective it is," said Heather Dewey Haberger, whose 2007 video work, "False Memories," is also on display.
"DNA data can tell us a lot of different stories, so that's 30 of them." "
The final work in the exhibition, In a Room, comes from a page in the previously illustrated novella.
Shows the flamboyant, King Kong-shaped Manning under a megaphone held by soldiers in the United States.
"When they make your speech stop, they win," reads the wall.
"So, don't shut up."
"The content came directly from a letter she wrote to me," said the Philadelphia-based artist.
"I am afraid again, I still have to say."
Manning has yet to see the exhibition in person, as is so foreseen in the comics, but when she does, she will be masked by her own DNA portrait, like a group of protesters getting a cheer at the Pavilion Center.
It also serves a purpose, as do all the items in the exhibition, reaching the height of the genetic single-group information she wrote in pencil (5.2 feet, Manning's height).
"In the past, I hung them on the wall, but I wanted them to feel like a group of people," Dewey Harburg said of the portraits.
"But I wanted them to feel like a group of protesters following Chelsea, just as people were protesting to release her at the time." "
Northwestern University professor and Oxford University employee wanted in homicide case
A man was found fatally stabbed inside a luxury Chicago apartment, a Northwestern University professor and an Oxford University employee were subsequently wanted and are on a nationwide hunt for suspects, police said.
On Monday, Wentwom Lessem, 42, and Andrew Warren, 56, were ordered held without bail on a first degree murder warrant in connection with the death of Trenton H. James Cornell Duralo, Cook County court records show.
Cornell Duraolo, 26, died from multiple stab wounds, according to the documents.
A community alert issued by the Chicago Police Department said the body was found on July 27.
Officers arrived at the Grand Plaza apartment after receiving the call and found the victim with multiple lacerations to his body.
Cornell Duralo died at the scene and detectives are investigating the killing, while police are actively searching for two suspects, police said.
Leissem has been an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Allen K. cowbage, the deputy director of campus relations, said in an emailed statement that Lathem has now been removed from his post and has been barred from the Northwestern University campus.
Mr cowbegich said that "now this is a criminal case, the authorities are investigating and Northwestern University is actively cooperating with the investigation."
Warren is a senior finance assistant at the University of Oxford.
"We have been in contact with the UK police and stand ready to assist US investigative agencies as required," a spokesman for Oxford University's Somerville College said in an emailed statement.
The statement added that Warren's colleagues are deeply shocked and hope that he will be able to turn himself in.
Anthony Guglielmi, the Chicago Police Department's chief liaison officer, expressed strong encouragement for the suspect to turn himself in to authorities.
Mr Guglielmi said that "the police already have a general idea of their whereabouts and we are working to locate possible locations."
Mr Guglielmi said local, regional and national authorities were fully assisting in the search for the suspects.
Mr Guglielmi said police received a call from the Grand Plaza apartment manager, who had just received a secret tip that something was going on at Apartment 1008.
Police described the situation as dire at the time.
Mr Guglielmi said it was still unclear whether the incident also took place on July 27.
He said that based on security cameras, it was confirmed that Lathem and Warren were in the building at the time.
"We believe that Professor Lessem had something to do with the victims," Guglielmi said.
"The police are currently studying the victim's timeline and background, and are investigating a variety of motives, including a possible domestic incident," Grand Plaza's management team said in a statement to residents.
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mutko said "we will complete the World Anti-Doping Agency road map in the near future"
Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said it would not take too long to implement the remaining standards set by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) for the restoration of the rights of the Russian anti-doping agency (RUSADA).
"The implementation of the roadmap standards has reached a certain stage and RUSADA has been given the right to work with UKAD [the UK Anti-Doping Agency] on planning and testing," he said.
The WADA road map has been updated in this regard, "Mutko said on Thursday.
Deputy Prime Minister Mutko made the remarks while commenting on the second part of the World Anti-Doping Agency's roadmap, compliance, which sets out the criteria for restoring RUSADA's rights and was recently posted on the organisation's website.
According to Mutko, the standards do not contain anything that could be of concern to Russia.
He added, "Everything has to be declared and everything will be implemented.
And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee [IOC] and WADA in the near future. "
However, one of the criteria mentioned in the list is that the Russian Anti-Doping Agency must publicly accept the findings of an investigation approved by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren in relation to WADA into Russian state support for doping in its own sport.
Speaking about the incident, Mutko said: "we are investigating and there is no doubt that our anti-doping system has failed.
All measures have been implemented.
But there's no national plan behind it, we're not going to acknowledge what doesn't exist. ""
Mutko's words echoed those of Vitaly Smirnov, head of Russia's independent public anti-doping commission.
Smirnov acknowledged problems with the Russian anti-doping agency in the past during a visit to the media's Russian outlet RSport earlier in the day, but added: "we have said on numerous occasions that the report contains controversial positions and regulations.
No one plans to accept the report unconditionally, "Smirnov said.
Following the doping scandal in November 2015, WADA suspended RUSADA's right to conduct doping tests inside Russia.
But in June, RUSADA was granted permission to plan and coordinate testing this year under the supervision of international experts and Ukad.
WADA director general Olivia Nagli said during a visit to the organisation's headquarters in Moscow in July that Rusada was "moving in the right direction" in an effort to restore its rights.

You don't have to find a substitute anymore! There are zero tariffs on more than 8000 products
So far, China has 15 FTAs in force, involving 23 countries and regions, covering more than 8,000 import products with zero tariffs, Gao Feng, a spokesman for the Ministry of Commerce, said at a regular press conference held by the Ministry of Commerce on January 11.
At the same time, imported cosmetics, Icelandic salmon, Chilean red wine, tropical fruits of Asean... you don't have to pay a lot of money for these products.
At present, we have signed 16 free trade agreements with 24 countries and regions, and 15 have entered into force, covering more than 8,000 import products with zero tariffs.
In the case of agricultural products, with the implementation of the FTA, consumers can taste the produce from different places of origin, high quality and low price all year round.
For example, Asean's tropical fruits, such as durian, lychee, and fire dragon fruit, have zero import tariffs from 15% to 30%.
The import tariff on Icelandic salmon is reduced from 10% to 12% to zero tariff;
Red wine in Georgia and Chile, with import duty reduced from 14% to 30% to zero tariff;
There are also New Zealand beef and milk powder and other characteristics of agricultural products, such as a larger tax cut.
In the case of industrial goods, for example, the import tariff on some cosmetics in Switzerland has been reduced to zero;
Import tariffs on some watches have been reduced by 50 per cent and will be reduced to zero after a few years;
South Korea's refrigerators, rice cookers, massagers, beauticians and other products import tariffs reduced by 40%, and will be reduced to zero tariffs in a few years;
There are also consumer electronics products, such as a larger reduction in taxes.
At the same time, zero-tariff products under the free trade area also include intermediate products and raw materials needed for the manufacture of many domestic end consumer goods, and to some extent promote the structural upgrading of domestic consumer goods.
Nearly a third of China's total imports can enjoy FTA preferential tariffs, most of which are end consumer goods, bringing tangible benefits to consumers, said Gao Feng, a spokesman for the Ministry of Commerce.
Further reduction of import tariffs on consumer goods
Since December 1, 2017, China has adjusted import tariffs on some consumer goods and further reduced tariffs on imports of consumer goods, covering food, health care products, pharmaceuticals, daily chemical products, clothing, shoes and hats, household equipment, culture and entertainment, department stores and other consumer goods, involving a total of 187 8-digit tariff codes.
The average tax rate of this batch of consumer goods will be cut from 17.3% to 7.7%, almost "cut in half"!
We have also made partial adjustments to other import and export tariffs from January 1, 2018.
The import duty on some cosmetics, such as lip balm, eye shadow and perfume, was reduced from 10% to 5%.
Lower tariffs mean that consumers do not have to buy on their behalf, much less travel abroad to buy foreign products they like.

Foreign report: year-end U.S. malls rule differences in big shopping returns to be cautious
CNN.com, December 29, 2015 / PRNewswire / --
Just after Christmas, there was a wave of withdrawals, according to the US daily Le Monde.
More than half of the items sold last Christmas were returned, ABC reported.
In addition, readers have repeatedly reported that online shopping has been cheated, consumers need to be more careful when shopping in the informal website.
In general, large shopping companies have formal, reasonable return procedures, but if you buy gifts or electricity from some small shops, you must be careful.
Ms. Hou, of Rowland, bought a coat for more than 60 yuan (us $) at an online shop selling printed coats on December 1, local time, and it has not arrived yet.
She sent an email to customer service and did not reply.
Another netizen, last year to travel to the United States, a third-party seller to buy a mobile phone, sent to find it is a box of rubber mud.
When you know you've been cheated, apply for a refund from the website and get a full refund.
But there are also customers who believe that the website refund service is not 100 per cent perfect.
Mr. Wang, a Chinese resident of Northern California, said he had purchased emergency distribution services for a Web site twice, once for four yuan, but neither was delivered on time.
It then applied for a refund and was not returned.
Large shopping malls or shopping malls have a better return policy.
Macy's has a full refund for most items within 180 days.
But the goods must maintain the "original" appearance, and must have proof of purchase such as a receipt or a bank purchase record.
If there are no vouchers, customers can also get mall points that can be used to buy other goods.
Target typically has a 90-day return period for general merchandise and 15 days for electronic items.
But the return period for electronic, entertainment items purchased between November 1 and December 25, 2017 has been extended to 30 days.
It's important to note that the 30-day refund period is calculated from December 25, which is to return the goods by January 25, 2018.
The ultimate shopping experience, the advent of a new era of shopping development in business circles
More than a decade ago, our country as a whole is still in the seller's market, people's choice is limited and demand is limited.
But after a decade in which the market has shifted from a seller's market to a buyer's market, consumer tastes have become more sophisticated, and they are no longer content with simple "hand-to-hand" purchases.
Therefore, how to let consumers get an extreme shopping experience has become the next competition point for real estate developers.
Among the many factors that affect the consumer's shopping experience, the shopping center in the business circle is the most important.
See how city builders everywhere pay attention to the shopping experience.
There are no two identical leaves in the world, let alone two identical shopping centers, a famous shopping center must have its own characteristics.
For example, Turkey's world-famous Kanyon shopping center, with its unique wavy architectural design inspired by the Grand Canyon, so named the homonym Kanyon, walks the Kanyon middle MINISTER'S 200-meter walk as if inside the Grand Canyon.
In addition to the isthmus design, there is a large oval performance venue with an inward fovea in the middle of the shopping centre, which is unique in shape and often features performances.
Because of the open platform design, visitors can walk on each floor to see the activities in the "canyon", and has the effect of shifting scenery.
At home, the Nanjing forest Moore Street, known as China's first forest-walk consumer market, combines shopping with ecology and fairy tales.
7,000 square meters Green Square, 3,000 square meters rooftop water platform, the project consists of nine single buildings, the air link between the buildings, the overall sinking courtyard design, take the geographical area above the French sycamore tree for the building surface, the roof of the water roof to create a forest-like feel.
Walking into the forest Moore, like accidentally falling into the rabbit hole in Alice's Adventures, climbs along the tree trunk to surround the building, grass, clear water, and bring people into the forest full of life and vitality.
Also in Chongqing, Longhu built a ring of Leijiabin water merchants, planning a hundred square commerce, planning to introduce more than 50 international top Monopoly flagship stores in the future, more than 100 international top brands and more than 500 domestic and foreign famous brands, to create a service industry agglomeration, the theme of distinctive business center.
Not only that, the Leijia waterfront business circle integrates ecology into architecture and tod public transportation, integrating fashion shopping, life service, dining, entertainment, education and sports. It also brings consumers the ultimate shopping experience while leading them to enjoy Chongqing's unique "waterfront culture," which combines shopping with water entertainment and leisure.
It can be found that, at present, a number of housing companies have an insight into the trajectory of this new urban commerce, and industry insiders say that this focus on consumer experience, how to combine shopping with experience will also be the mainstream of urban development in the future.
Now the business circle is not only the distribution center of goods, more is the integration of arts and culture, creative themes, but also carries the responsibility of people to live in the city.
Therefore, while satisfying the needs of consumers to eat, drink and buy one-stop material, maximizing the transmission of cultural and artistic multi-level spiritual needs, play a livable residential needs, is bound to be the commanding heights of the future development of the business circle.
In Chongqing, the North Shore of Guoxing, located in the north of the river, near Guanyin Bridge, the world's business elite, international giants around the ring, first-class brands gathered, and international fashion close connection.
Here step by step bustling, gathering the essence of the world;
Dongyuan jinyue has a better shopping environment, Dongyuan jinyue near Nanping Business Circle, enjoy the West and even the country's leading four-Storey three-dimensional transportation system, enhance the shopping comfort.
In addition, the landscaping and landscaping of the two pedestrian streets of huigong Road and Wanda Square were upgraded, and about 300 trees were planted, and 40,000 square meters of land were renovated to enhance the image of Nanping Business circle;
And Longhu Yu Lake, near Chongqing's first low-density waterfront business circle, surrounded by nine parks, the low density of commercial blocks, high degree of openness, so that people are more willing to stay, stop, slowly enjoy the fun of shopping, rather than the people behind the rush forward to achieve "scattered shopping."
Today's commercial competition will only become more and more fierce, how to kill a blood road in a homogenous market, to capture the future consumers in the heart of the "shopping mecca" reputation, it is worth all real estate developers to think seriously.
Differentiation strategy alone is not enough, only those who really put consumers in the heart, anxious consumers, want to consumers, to provide consumers with the ultimate and simple shopping experience developers can be proud of the storm in the market.
Of course, in the end I think the most happy is Chongqing's people, have such a good shopping experience and business circle, put in 10 years ago no one can imagine the prosperity of today.

No one would have thought a decade ago that the self-deprecating "Singles Day" subculture created by single young people on Nov. 11 would be picked up by the Telegraph as the now-phenomenal "Double 11" Shopping Carnival.
On November 11, 2009, Alibaba used the "Singles Day promotion" marketing gimmick for the first time: no one is in love with you, so "single dogs" come online.
The result was a surprise, the day Taobao Mall (the predecessor of "Skycat") turnover exceeded 52 million yuan, 10 times the daily turnover of the time.
Since then, "Double 11" has become Alibaba's shopping carnival, from the beginning of the domestic buyer sellers amuse themselves, to the current influx of global merchants, nine years later, the cat "Double 11" 100 billion transactions have been more than 3,200 times that year, making "Black Friday" out of reach.
With the Wind Sky Cat "Double Eleven" promotion, there are many electric business, among which "Jingdong" is the strongest.
"Jingdong" has its own shopping festival, "6.18," but no "Double 11" has a big impact, this year from November 1 to 11, "Jingdong" cumulative sales reached 12.71 billion yuan.
And "Double 11", followed by a similar "Double 12" discount carnival, Christmas New Year shopping period.
Across the new year, waiting for Chinese consumers are the spring festival before the annual shopping period, Valentine's Day shopping period, consumption, will not be a holiday.
The environmental problems brought about by the mass consumption of instantaneous time have attracted the attention of professionals and institutions.
By the usual standard conservative estimate of 0.2 kg per packing box in the industry, at least 300,000 tonnes of waste were generated during the "double 11" period this year, the Xinhua Daily Telegraph reported.
Liu Hua, director of the pollution prevention and control program at Greenpeace East Asia Division, told China Dialogue that this year's "double 11" orders alone will generate 160,000 tons of packaging waste.
The National Post Office issued a report in 2016 stating that during the 2015 "Double 11" period (november 11-16) there were about 780 million express pieces, using more than 3 billion woven bags, 99.22 billion packing boxes, 169.85 million meters of tape, which can wrap around the Earth's equator 425 times in length.
And this year, the National Post Office is expected to "double 11" express business volume of more than 1.5 billion pieces.
Wang Shi, manager of a waste incineration center in Beijing, told Xinhua that "double 11" after the daily entry of more than 2,000 tons of garbage, also exceeded the incineration station's capacity.
Express delivery companies have realized that the environmental pollution caused by the express delivery industry is not negligible.
Including Suning, a number of electric logistics enterprises, "Double 11" before the introduction of reusable plastic delivery boxes, recycling bags can be re-used as shopping bags and garbage bags, but the acceptance of troublesome consumers is not high.
Ma also called on the logistics industry to support "green packaging" and "green logistics" in a tweet.
The tweet garnered more than 68,000 "likes."
What kind of mobile payments do the Germans want?
Zhang dongfang: the mobile payment war started in Germany is not expected.
Micro-Payment and Alipay but moved the battlefield to Europe, competitors have not changed, snatch position has not changed - the Chinese, this is also global?
Where there is a treasure to pay, there must be a micro-letter to pay.
Under an agreement with Wirecard, the German E-payment service, micro-payment officially began landing in Germany in November and is gradually being distributed to businesses across Europe.
This exotic reunion of the two "villagers" took place in Europe.
All along, Alipay and micro-credit payments have been high on the road to globalization.
For the globalization of China's mobile payment, Arie consulting "China third party mobile payment industry research report 2017" is divided into two categories: first, through strategic investment, experience export, take a stake in and support foreign domestic mobile payment companies.
Second, through the Chinese tourists abroad consumption behavior, to promote mobile payment services to foreign businesses, and then change the foreign local awareness and acceptance of China mobile payment.
Indeed, the Chinese have the world.
China's rapid economic growth, coupled with a large population base, the amount of money Chinese tourists spend in Europe is an attractive figure.
But it is also doomed, this time in Germany, the opening of the China Mobile Payment War is not expected.
Micro-Payment and Alipay just moved the battlefield to Europe, the competitors have not changed, the snatch position has not changed - or the Chinese, which is also global?
A more pioneering discussion is whether China's mobile payments can expand in Europe's own territory?
Take Germany, for example.
The bewitched "new retail"
Chen Xin-Lei, Yang kaihan: Amazon announced its foray into bookstores and grocery stores as it squeezed into the world's top 10 retailers. Both the timing and the motivation are interesting.
In November 2015, Amazon opened its first physical bookstore in Seattle, followed by two in Portland and San Diego.
At the start of 2017, Amazon is opening storefronts in New York and plans to have at least eight by the end of the year.
Almost the same time, Amazon announced that its no-one supermarket (amazon go) trial operation, customers to the store do not need to line up, do not need to check out, enter the door, take the desired items to leave, the amount of shopping will automatically be deducted from the customer's Amazon account.
In the case of Amazon, in recent years suddenly in the physical shop above the action is a very unexpected thing.
Because in his open letter to shareholders back in 2007, CEO Jeff Bezos stressed that Amazon will not easily open a physical store unless the following four conditions are met:
1. We must be sure that this new opportunity will give shareholders a return on their investment;
We must be sure that this new opportunity is of great significance to the whole company;
3. We must be convinced that this new opportunity is being ignored by the market;
We must be sure that we have enough resources to make customer-oriented differentiation in this market.
Bookstores and groceries, the most ramshackle of the two physical retail categories, were among the first to fall after the rise of Amazon.
Amazon's announcement of a move into these two physical markets at a time when it is squeezing into the world's top 10 retailers is interesting both in terms of timing and motivation.
Does Amazon's approach run counter to the assurances contained in the shareholder letter?
A similar voice is heard on the other side of the globe, as Jack Ma, chairman of Alibaba's board of directors, delivers a keynote speech at the 2016 Hangzhou ‚Ä¢ Cloud conference on the morning of October 13, 2016.
"From next year, Alibaba will stop saying 'ecommerce,'" he said.
The era of pure electrics will soon be over, and there will be no e-commerce in the next decade or two, replaced by 'new retail'.
The combination of online and offline and logistics will lead to new retail.
For a while, "New retail" three words as if by magic, by the industry people frequently hang in the mouth.
But what exactly does "new retail" mean?
If it only refers to the combination of online and offline, then the concept is not new.
In 2016, after tracking 180 of the largest electricity providers, eMarketer estimated total sales at about $200 billion, while the top 25 accounted for more than $15.90 billion.
Of these 25, 18 are traditional retailers that have been online only in the past five years (such as Macy's, Nordstrom, Target, Gap, etc.).
And Alibaba Group 28.3 billion yuan to take a stake in Suning Yunshang, also vividly.
Globally, retailers and distributors are moving from a single channel to a full-channel retail system covering physical stores, electronics, mobile and social media.
Is Ma's "new retail" more of a summary than a vision of the future?
If not, what is the difference between the concept of full channel, and "new retail"?
Perhaps the question is not whether online and offline will fuse, but how.
Looking back at the retail sector over the past 20 years, the rise of electricity retailers, like the rise of discount retailers in the early years, has focused on price and convenience.
Relying on these two pain points, electricity merchants have moved highly standardized products, such as books and CDs, from offline to online.
With the development of online consumption habits and the continuous improvement of customer experience, electrical manufacturers have extended their tentacles to other categories, and began to improve efficiency.
In the words of Alibaba CEO Zhang Yong, "Use the ideas and technology of the Internet to comprehensively reform and upgrade the existing total of about 30 trillion social retailers, so that the escalating consumer demand of Chinese consumers can be effectively met, making the whole process of commodity production, circulation, and services more efficient because of the extensive use of the Internet and big data."
Therefore, the electricity business of the road, is a surface light assets, the actual heavy assets of the road.
"Light" refers to the fixed assets, staffing, management processes and other burdens are not as large as the traditional retail industry; "heavy" refers to the need for huge investment in logistics, warehousing and so on.
The change of the way of logistics ensures the high efficiency of the electricity business.
Premier Li Keqiang chaired an executive meeting of the State Council on April 28, which concluded that expanding domestic consumption demand is an important measure to stabilize growth and adjust the structure, according to a Chinese government website.
The meeting determined that the departments concerned should come up with concrete plans on the basis of scientific assessment.
Some foreign consumer goods with a large demand for domestic consumers will be tested to reduce import tariffs by the end of June this year, gradually expanding the range of goods subject to tax reduction;
In the light of the tax reform, we will improve the consumption tax policy for public consumption goods such as clothing and cosmetics, and adjust the scope of taxation, tax rates and collection links in an integrated manner;
The establishment and restoration of duty-free shops at ports of entry, the reasonable expansion of duty-free varieties, the increase of a certain amount of duty-free shopping, and the convenience of domestic consumers to purchase foreign products within the territory;
We will further promote the facilitation of customs and tax rebates for overseas passengers, and strictly implement the requirements for voluntary declaration and payment of tax on imported articles in accordance with the law.
To formulate inspection and quarantine policies to support the import of cross-border electricity suppliers, and to clean up the unreasonable charges of import links;
We will accelerate the project of brand upgrading of Chinese products, support the development of physical stores, and realize online and offline interaction.
Standardize market order, crack down on fake and inferior products, and promote the survival of the fittest.
So that consumers can be close to comfortable, convenient shopping.

On January 18, Alibaba held an e-Commerce summit in Chongqing, announcing that it would help boost precision poverty alleviation and rural revitalization by exploring a new model of "Internet + poverty reduction."
This is another "addition" to Ali's efforts to lift people out of poverty, following the introduction of the rural strategy, the launch of the Rural Taobao project, The on-line anti-poverty platform for farmers, and the establishment of Alibaba anti-poverty fund.
The fight against poverty is now one of China's most important national strategies.
Total poverty reduction has not been achieved in China for thousands of years.
"E-commerce poverty alleviation is a new round of innovative measures for poverty alleviation and development, and an important key to achieving precision poverty reduction and precision poverty reduction.
The central government attaches great importance and points out that it can give play to the role of the internet in helping to lift people out of poverty, accurately lift people out of poverty, and get agricultural products out of the countryside through the internet. "
As a result, Ali proposed a rural strategy as early as 2014, alongside big data cloud computing and globalization as Ali's three core strategies for the next 20 years.
In the same year, Ali launched the Rural Taobao (village amoy) project to recruit "village junior" in the countryside, leading farmers through the electricity business out of poverty.
In 2017, Ali worked with the commercial sector to create a poverty-relief channel for farmers, and now has a total of 13 provinces and 120 state-level poverty-stricken counties.
Ali Platform spawned Taobao Village, there have been 2118.
Of these, nearly 400 appeared in the provincial poverty-stricken counties and 33 in the 13 national poverty-stricken counties.
In 2017, nationwide Taobao Village sales reached 120 billion yuan on Alibaba's China retail platform.
Zhang said that in the face of a national strategy to combat poverty, Ali has been thinking about how to use the technological, big data, cloud computing and other innovative capabilities of Ali's economy to take a new path out of poverty.
Among them, the village Amoy is Ali Power business out of poverty the main load platform, and through a direct sale of the internet out of poverty the new link.
In the planting link, the village Amoy And The Ant gold clothing jointly carry out agricultural-funded agricultural tools and small loan support.
In 2017, Ant suits served 795 of the 832 state-level impoverished counties, providing them with convenient payment, credit and other services.
Rookie solve warehousing and logistics, Tiancat is responsible for sales, Ariyun's big data feedback guide agricultural production, further improve the supply standards, quality and market competitiveness of agricultural products.
The development of the electricity business out of poverty requires not only products, sales channels, industrial planning, but also talent.
Ali, through the Taobao university of electricity business courses, to teach farmers standardization, quality and large-scale cultivation methods, to achieve a "poverty alleviation + support wisdom" combination, so that farmers can be sustained out of poverty.
These courses already cover about 92 per cent of the poverty-stricken counties at the national level.
And the "public welfare mentality, commercial means" out of poverty thinking, can also guarantee Ali to do "really help the poor" when helping the poor.
Jack Ma, chairman of Alibaba's board of directors, has said that poverty eradication should be divided into three stages: poverty alleviation, poverty alleviation and enrichment.
Poverty alleviation is to teach people to fish, poverty eradication is to teach people to fish, to get rich is to create a "fish pond" for farmers, so that farmers have fish to feed.
Electricity business-led industries to help the poor, is to make fish ponds.
In the industry poverty alleviation, Ali and Shaanxi Luochuan cooperation to create the Luochuan apple industry poverty alleviation model, has been used by the relevant departments as an example in the national replication and promotion.
Ali electric business poverty relief work has also been recognized by the decision-making level.
Alibaba as the representative of the electricity business enterprises have been sent a message, through online and offline channels, to ensure that farmers increase production and increase income.
Some Murakami and Ant gold-clad employees have also been invited to the United Nations and Africa to share their experiences in poverty alleviation.
At present, the China office of the United Nations world food programme (WFP) has been working with Village Amoy to help alleviate poverty in the electricity business industry in places such as Anhui.
Sina Financial News, co-sponsored by Ali Research Institute, the Third Congress of the new economic think tank, was held on January 16. Zhang Li, director of the Research Institute of the Ministry of Commerce, attended and made a statement.
She believes that our globalization has in fact neglected the most important issue, which is the issue of the body and use of globalization, as well as the phase of globalization.
In this way, many people believe that globalization has stalled, and that many developed and developing countries, in the new stage, have different attitudes towards globalization and different models.
The second concept is the question of the intermediate stage of globalization. What are the constraints on the intermediate stage of globalization?
Restricted by the Economic Environment Foundation, it is precisely because the economic base has changed the globalization has taken place the restriction.
Zhang believes that the global economic adjustment will basically end at the end of 2017, after 2018 will enter a new period of growth, the next round of growth must be production-led.
7Fresh, the first fresh supermarket in Beijing East, opened recently, with plans to open more than 1,000 stores across the country over the next three to five years.
Add Ali's boxed horse fresh, Yonghui's super species, Suning's Su Xiansheng, Meituan's palm fish raw and so on, and "new retail stores" are starting to pile up and "bark" at each other on innovative models and even prices.
Fresh supermarket battle to upgrade, has become a new retail area of the phenomenon-level topic, new retail in the end where?
"In 2018 we will quickly enter the whole country, and there will be a lot of shops in Beijing, Shanghai and Hangzhou before the Spring Festival."
Box Ma Xiansheng CEO Hou Yi 10 at the second new retail summit revealed the "new style of play" in 2018.
"Starting in 2018, Box horse is not just a fresh electricity provider, but a quality-of-life business that provides instant service to consumers," he said.
Under the core model line is the drainage, the experience, the line is the real sales.
Different from the traditional large stores, supermarkets, box horse fresh in the eyes of many consumers is a playful and delicious "net red shop," even intermediary agencies hit out the concept of "box room".
Online business platforms and offline retailers have their own advantages and disadvantages, but consumers appear in a variety of channels, so both sides are trying the full-channel model.
The industry believes there will be more and more "box horse" stores in 2018, against the backdrop of a consumer upgrade.
And the box horse from the original fresh constantly explored to more consumer areas, foreshadowed in the new year, the retail market will be more innovation.
"For example, the combination of online and offline business model, attracted the attention of consumers, all over the opening of fresh supermarkets called and applauded."
"But it doesn't matter how much you talk about these relationships, it doesn't matter how flashy they are, until you have a great experience for the consumer, and I'm willing to pay for it."
In the big run Feiniu net Co-CEO Yuan Bin, the new retail environment, consumer habits changed, the purchase demand also changed.
The original pure line, the line is split, under the line to beat the line, the line to counter-offensive line, now is a hand, because the consumer has no line on the line under the distinction.
Capital of the scramble to enter the bureau, so that the current fresh supermarket represented by the new retail powder flavor.
Analysis that, at present, the new retail competition in the first-tier cities is far from the pattern of the Red Sea, and there are large areas of second-tier cities yet to be tapped, the market is still a great opportunity and space.
Different types of industries for the layout of new retail, will bring the development of new retail into a diversified state of development.
CCTV financial channel, together with the Institute of Financial Strategy of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, combed out a dry goods, is this heavy annual development report of China's electricity business.

Record sales growth back on track
Since 2006, China's online retail sales can be said to have been showing Super-high growth, estimated at that time that online shopping is very fresh, do not go out can buy things, too cool!
But starting in 2013, online retail growth began to fall below 50%, and in 2015 it grew below 40% for the first time, to 26.2% in 2016.
But things are different this year, with online retail sales accelerating again, rising to 34.2% in January and September.

The start-up that helps you avoid the company becoming the next Uber
Amy Elliott once wanted to investigate employee happiness at her e-commerce startup, but the survey didn't help.
The responses are often vague, unhelpful, and even worse, deceptive.
Even though she promised anonymity, some employees still don't trust the process.
Madison Reed, a San Francisco-based ecommerce hair care company that manages 75 people, said "the responses received lacked consistency and objectivity."
So she called for help.
A new crop of human resources start-ups have sprung up to help companies understand how their employees feel.
They build and authorize software specifically designed to measure employee engagement, allowing companies to quickly poll specific teams and demographic groups, provide anonymous and complaints hotlines for employees, and in some cases allow whistleblowers to bypass executives and report directly to the board.
"Right now, you can track your health with tools like Strava and Fitbit, but where is the company's FitBit?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and chief executive of glint, a Redwood City start-up whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement.
Ms Eilett said that within three years, she had used glint to gain more insight into what employees thought and felt.
In addition to quick surveys and polls by specific teams, glint also provides company heat maps, which units complain the most, and which managers approve low scores, at a glance - giving her an insight into why.
Companies are beginning to realize that they must master the company's workplace culture so as not to become the next Uber.Uber has been mired in scandal after former employees of Uber published a blog post describing the harassment environment in which the speakers were punished by the company.
For startups like glint, the company's desire for oversight is a lucrative business opportunity.
The global governance, regulatory and compliance industry could be worth more than $187 billion by 2020, according to financial technology analytics website LeT 's Talk Payments.
Convert, a startup based in Denver, Colorado, which works to help companies prevent and detect bad behavior, saw an increase in interest and activity during the damage to Uber's reputation earlier this year.
Convergent has nearly 600 customers, including Epping, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber recently signed up as a customer.
Like glint, convergent allows companies to send customized "diagnostic" surveys, collect confidential responses in real time, and view heat maps of their problem areas.
Convenent also offers an anonymous text message hotline for employees to report bad behavior.
If the chairman is implicated, then the complaint will go directly to the board.
Patrick Quinlan, founder and chief executive of convenent, said: "the court of public opinion has usurped the powers of the regulator.
If a company is found to be treating its employees poorly or behaving unethically towards them, even if regulators don't step in, the company could face high consequences from consumer boycotts, staff turnover and being embroiled in litigation, Mr Quinlan said.
Ruby Tuesday, a restaurant chain that spans more than 500 locations and employs more than 25,000 people, has been using convergent for more than a year to ensure employees understand work guidelines and procedures and provide easy access to the company's headquarters.
Until then, if employees want to report a problem, they must find the company's headquarters phone number or email, file a formal complaint, and hope that headquarters will take it seriously.
It's often a daunting and unsettling experience, says Ruby Tuesday's general counsel, James Vetrano, who doesn't think there's a good way to track employee complaints.
But now that the company uses convert, it can more quickly identify and address issues previously unknown to executives in distant offices, cities or states - such as discrimination, harassment or unfair wage practices.
"I can get a closer, 360-degree view of the work experience," said Vetrano, who heads Ruby Tuesday's risk management team.
"We are protecting our shareholders from employment litigation." "
Mr Quinlan said companies had put more emphasis on ethics, values and employee engagement since 2002, following the collapse of the Andorra accountancy firm over ethics violations in the Enron scandal.
But it wasn't until "social media came into its own" that companies realised they couldn't stop their explosive material going viral online.
"Before using technology to monitor ethics, people see hope as a strategy," he said.
Glint and convenent both offer their software as a service and charge companies a recurring fee for the use of their products.
This business model and business opportunities are backed by venture investors, who are already providing support to the two start-ups.
In February, convergent raised $10 million from companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, and its total capital rose to $47 million.
In November, glint received $10 million from Bessemer Venture Partners, bringing its total funding to $60 million.
Given the interconnectedness between companies, culture and venture capital, these investments will hardly come as a surprise.
A growing body of research shows that today's employees expect more from the workplace than ever before.
In a competitive market like Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are just bets.
Employees want to feel that they are accepted and valued and that their time is spent in a company with a positive mission.
"When people are happy to join the company and feel that their voices are being heard and that the work they do is beneficial, they are more committed to making the company successful," said Nina McCartney, vice president of global wellbeing and employee experience at LinkedIn, which uses both convergent and glint.
Investors achieve returns when their portfolio companies do well; companies do well when employees are loyal and dedicated.
If third-party analysis tools promise to increase employee loyalty and engagement, it is not surprising that they will look for financial support.
Workplace culture experts say it's important to have data on employee engagement.
But the data is useless unless the company's administrators take action.
In fact, if a company asks for feedback from its employees, it can be expected that the company is making changes.
If change is not moving fast enough, or if there is no progress at all, it can lead to disappointment and lead to employees leaving the company.
"If you're looking for 4,000 pieces of advice, then you need to be prepared to have 4,000 conversations," said Russell Rath, head of consulting practice at business management firm Cote International, who has seen some mistakes in companies relying too heavily on data collection.
"Because if you don't follow it all the way, the employee thinks, 'Did you really hear me?
Do you care?
If you don't care, why should I care?
Mr Ellett said Madison Reed, who now conducts monthly staff surveys, had been able to take action on the day glint reported the problem.
After gathering feedback from employees that they were frustrated by the speed of decision-making and the quality of communication, she was able to solve the problem by reorganizing the company's internal team and increasing communication training.
Ruby Tuesday is gaining new insights into its employees, and in the long run, they hope to make the transition to better retention in an industry known for its high turnover rates.
"If you don't commit to creating a culture of transparency, you lose talent," Vitrano said.
"If you lose talent, you're going to lose clients.
And when you lose customers, you lose the company, "he said.

NCAA cancels two-hour daily practice to extend Bears' day-to-day practice
As the hour approached 11 p.m., members of the UCLA football team lingered for a chat next to the team's new campus practice field.

The NCAA canceled two practice sessions a day (designed to ease the burden on players), but actually extended their day-to-day workouts - at least until the end of Friday.
That's why UCLA's first three practices are scheduled to begin at 7: 15 p.m. to accommodate the player's already congested schedule.
From canceling two workouts a day to more one-day workouts, the Bears started nearly a week before last season, and Mora trained at summer school for the first time in six seasons at Westwood.
They plan to start 18 workouts from August 20 before they begin pregame preparations for the first game of the season against the Texas farmworkers in September.
Mora said he supports the NCAA's rule changes, though that would add another item to a player's busy schedule.
"In three or four days, we're going to put a huge amount of training on them, very challenging," Mora said.
"They've just passed, too. They're honing, they're all great kids.
I thought about Saturday and we'll have more time, it's really great. ""
UCLA will stop training as soon as the camp is over, not an easy task given the clear view of the adjacent parking lot and Luskin Center, which has been battered and bruised by footballs thrown through the protective netting behind the goal posts.
Bears players will be staying at the hotel starting this weekend, but Mora acknowledged there could be problems once those rooms become vacant during the season.
"We'll take security measures," Mora said.
"It's a real concern, and the idea that someone might rent a room and sit in a room and record a training scene is not a strong one.
If you have a training tape, it's pretty good, too.
But we'll have security there, and we'll have security in Car Park 8.
We will make the best use of available resources.
I wouldn't worry too much about that.
We've got plans in place. ""

Facebook to launch fact-checking feature to crack down on fake news
Facebook, the world's largest online social network, is trying to crack down on so-called fake news after it announced on Thursday that it would send more potential hoax articles to third-party detection agencies and display the results below the original posts.
Facebook will start using newer machines to learn to detect possible hoaxes and send them to The Fact Checker, and possibly display Fact Check results below the original post, the company said in a statement on its Web site.
Facebook has been criticized as one of the main transmission points for so-called fake news, and many believe it influenced the 2016 U.S. presidential election.
The issue has also become a major political topic in Europe, with voters suffering a deluge of false stories in the run-up to France's presidential election in May, and Germany taking the lead in passing support for the fines scheme ahead of the September election, with fines if social media networks fail to remove hate posts in time.
In a separate statement from Germany on Thursday, Facebook said it was launching a new fact-checking function test in the United States, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
"In addition to seeing which stories are being questioned by third party fact checkers, people want more context to help them make informed decisions about what they read and share," Facebook news feed product manager Sarah Su said in a blog post.
She added that Facebook would continue to test its "related articles" feature and make other changes to its news feed to cut down on fake news.
Creating a graphic novel: the story of the castle in England
Recently, the diminutive Scotney Castle was featured in the compressed version of the music film, and at one point became a refuge for Margaret Thatcher during the Seventies and Eighties.
But Skrtney, who has seen 700 years of turbulent history in the comfortable position of the Belle River Gorge in Kent, is now the inspiration for graphic novels written by Jamie Rhodes, a Yorkshireman with a particular fondness for historical documents and a mop head.
"I can see the handwriting of the ancients 300 years ago, and I find it really beautiful," he said wistfully.
"This is what kind of interpersonal fate can let this letter fall on my hand."
Spanning the Middle Ages to the Edwardian era, the "An English Castle" readings record the various families living in Scotney, with each story written by different, British future artists such as Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer, and Isabel Greenberg.
This is not Rhodes's first book to use the archive as raw material: he also wrote "The Teeth And Other Stories of the dead in 2014," a book inspired by British Library literature, a work he completed by an uncontrollable creative passion.
"I could not resist the urge to write from the moment I saw the thumbprint on the side of the letter, written by a double agent working for the Jacobites in the 18th century," he said.
"That's his fingerprints!
And the letters smell like smoke all the time, because at that time, you need to start a fire to have light.
For us 300 years later, the smell makes it feel like they're with us, too.
Oh, I love the archives!
For those struck by the old paper, to have the support of the National Trust and Arts Council of England and have lived in the castle for almost four months ("to be honest, I've been around a bit long") seems too great to believe it to be true.
Rhodes spent days visiting Victoria's "new" castle, poring over archives, researching the estate's many treasures and antiques, such as the head of an iguana hanging on the wall, and bottles that had spent centuries in the moat.
He roamed the land and ruins of the old castle, chatting with wanderers, gardeners, and sometimes with the artists who painted the illustrations for his books.
Then in the evening, he would "drink some whiskey and write."
Scortney's hidden history is not yet clear, as the "National Trust" only fully entered after the death of its last heir, Elizabeth Hersey, in 2006.
It was only when Rhodes arrived a decade later that staff began working on the files, which he described as "hundreds of years ago the aristocracy were going:" Oh, put it in the attic '. "
Diaries, letters from the days of the British Empire, maps of national boundaries: "you'd think a land dispute would be boring," says Rhodes, "but there would be two families fighting over a silver birch.
Let it go, guys! ""
Some of the stories in the work take the castle as a starting point and go on to study British history at a wider level, including the labourer, which takes the artificial lead of a man who left a newly built castle to take part in the peasant uprising of 1381.
"The story in the book," The Knightly Family of Kent and Sussex, "Chronicles a riot in the castle in 1380," says Rhodes.
"The peasant uprising began in that area, and I thought it was a good place to start it.
Perhaps there is a connection between the two?
Other stories are deeply rooted in the history of the castle, such as the priest, which tells the story of the Darrells who hid a Jesuit priest for seven years during the Reformation in England.
Or "the smuggler," the story of the 18th century smuggler Arthur Darrell, who is thought to have given himself a funeral by filling his coffin with Stones (it was discovered years later when his coffin came to the surface).
"The Darrells" is Rhodes's favourite scottynecastle family: "these gentlemen seem to be going rogue, constantly borrowing and spending money on things they can't afford.
Generation after generation of Darrell men solve their debt problems by marrying rich older women and I think they should be a handsome bunch of lads who know how to go after women. ""
As his mission in the castle came to an end, Rhodes began to look for other bizarre writing experiences.
He spent two weeks in the wilds of Finland working on a graphic novel about "El Segundo," a nursing home in the early 20th century that was slowly abandoned.
But Scortney has a special place for him.
"I was sad to leave," he said.
"It's like: 'Oh, I've got to go face the trough in real life.'"

Big energy companies are all "rich and powerful," so which of the world's many energy companies take advantage of the money?
Yesterday, the famous PFC energy company released its top 50 list of energy companies listed in 2011, with US oil and gas producer Exxon Mobil topping the list with a market capitalisation of $406.3bn, followed by PetroChina and Royal Dutch Shell.
In the PFC's list, PetroChina topped the table twice in 2007 and 2009, with Exxon Mobil taking the top spot in all other years.
In the 2011 Top 50 list, three companies from mainland China were shortlisted, along with PetroChina at No 2, Sinopec at No 9, and PetroChina at No 15.
According to PFC, however, while current oil prices are much higher than they were four years ago, the CEO of PFC Energy points out that there are a number of reasons for the low total market capitalisation, mainly including lower gas prices in North America and low activity in global equity markets.

US changes green card rules
The United States will launch a new immigration program with changes to green card rules, media said, citing remarks by President Donald Trump.
The plan aims to reduce legal immigration to 50,000 a year, with tighter restrictions on temporary work visas and visa applications for families.
The new rules were proposed by Republicans and supported by the president.
The draft law will be discussed in both chambers.
Trump was quoted in US media as saying that "this law will reduce poverty, raise wages, save taxpayers billions of dollars and achieve the above benefits by changing the way the US gives green cards to citizens of other countries."
The law would replace the current programme and reduce chain migration.
This new application process benefits applicants who speak English, have financial support and have skills that are conducive to economic development. "

To optimize the scenic environment and build a beautiful Nanyue, recently, Nanyue district tobacco Special Bureau (BRANCH) "636" Voluntary Service Brigade carried out "mountaineering to protect the forest, take care of the homeland" environmental protection activities.
The activities not only received the support of all the cadres and staff of the district tobacco bureau, but also attracted old and retired cadres and their family members to participate in environmental protection practices. The three generations made concerted efforts to climb the mountains, protect the forest, clean up the garbage, and devote themselves to the construction of the "beautiful Nanyue."
This voluntary service aims to protect the scenic resources of Nanyue, to promote the concept of "caring for others, society and nature," and to inspire the next generation to pass on the virtues of voluntary service from an early age.
It is reported that since its establishment in early April this year, the "636" voluntary service brigade, with a total of 16 members, has carried out a series of voluntary service activities, such as visiting disabled retail customers, helping tobacco farmers take care of leaf tobacco and Ya'an earthquake donation. It has become a volunteer force dedicated to the transmission of positive energy.

Sex robots are on the rise, but we should be cautious
Just when you thought 2017 couldn't be more bizarre, the field of sex robots has released a new technology development report.
Yes.
Sex robots are a big deal these days.
Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) released a report looking ahead to the development of sex robots over the next five to 10 years.
According to Noel Sharkey, emeritus professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of the FRR, we need to start taking the rise of sex robots seriously.
Customers will be able to choose the robot's eye colour, nipple shape and nail type.
"People laugh behind their backs, but companies do put out a lot of sex robots, and we're going to see a lot more of them," Sharkey said at the launch of the new report.
Modernity love dolls have evolved from inflatable dolls to robots, with silicone skin, warm to the touch, and purposely using artificial intelligence to set up human-like sexual responses.
Users can also "customize" their robots to suit their preferences, with options ranging from eye colour and nipple shape to nail type or colour.
But what's even more disturbing is that many robots with a "personality" will make "replicating the pampered wife" look advanced.
Modern love toys have evolved into robots with silicone skin.
Realbotix robots, for example, are able to come from definitions, such as shyness, based on features that users find attractive.
There's also the Roxxy gold sex robot, developed by True Companion, that anticipates character traits, including the slightly shy "Cool Farah" and "Adventurous" "Wild Wendy."
"The Roxxy Gold Robot has the personality to match you as much as possible," the True Companion Company website boasts.
So she loves what you love and hates what you hate.
She also had small emotions in those days just like normal people!
She can be lazy, she can be talkative, she can be 'sexually active'!
The rise of sex robots has brought a lot of unease - not just in place of real human relationships - and the cringing femininity and the suggestion of rape twitching in the cold (read: resisting) Farah is the most worrying.
True Companion compares Roxxy to a man's shock stick on its website.
"If women have vibrators, then why can't men have Roxxy?" the website says.
Yet these sex robots are not simply a fetish, or just a sex toy.
Their presence and growing maturity point to the darker, deeper parts of our culture: The Flight from perfect gender equality to sex with submission as an added option.
Of course, most men don't keep sex robots, and while FRR points out that sex robots are becoming more popular, they are still on the verge of consumer culture.
But what seeps through the edges allows us to see the course of the age we live in.
Many people are not weird or aggressive, until the free market gives them a chance to become so.
These elaborate sex robots come at a time when global women's rights are at stake, and it's no coincidence that the White House also has a president bragging about sexual violence against women.
The most chilling part of the TV drama "The Story of the Woman" lies not in the lifelike picture, not in the hanging corpse, nor in the gouged eyes, but in the overly real imagination.
The Republic of Gilead was a jump, but now it doesn't seem that far away.
The goal behind these sex robots is to do everything technically possible to create the body that most resembles a real woman (albeit in the proportions of a porn star).
The creators of these robots want them to have the human touch and mimic real human movements.
But to put it bluntly, their "personalities" do not represent real women.
They can't break up, they can't run away.
They have no recourse agencies or follow-up stories, no independence at all, and no prospect of shattering the illusion of total slavery.
In other words, they are sex slaves.
Or in the popular parlance of 2017: make a woman.

Trump's great exploits?
Making Mitt Romney the epitome of common sense
The political divide that has polarized American voters and, in microcosm, damaged American family harmony is no stranger to the Trump era.
Around Christmas and Thanksgiving, the nation's major newspapers were filled with comments columns about how to deal with the fear of voting for Trump's relatives.
It is often assumed that we are doing everything we can to puncture our "filter bubble."
Less vocal is Trump's power to bring his family together.
I mention this because my cousin, a left-wing poet living in Chicago who has had a long-running feud with the Republicans in our family, is coming to visit me in New York this week.
She reminded me that uniting against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.
As a result of working with Trump in the White House, everyone she knows, even relatives of Republicans who have been engaged in political bickering for decades, are now suddenly and strangely on the same line.
It's certainly a good thing if it's all at the table, but what strikes me is that it raises significant risks from a wider perspective.
While figures on the left have long been egged on by Trump, the warping effect of his presidency has pushed us all to the right.
When we talk about "normalization" and Trump, we are referring to the possibility of concern that his erratic behavior might one day stop.
There is, however, an even more worrying long-term scenario in which Mr. Trump is to "normalize" relations with right-wing Republicans who had previously opposed Mr. President's standards and now suddenly look like symbols of reason.
I recently found myself feeling a little nostalgic for Mitt Romney's version of mania: putting the dog in the car, a 14 percent income tax (but at least we know his tax returns), the crimes of those two moves really do seem too minor compared to Trump.
After the Trump era has passed, the next Republican candidate needs only to sensibly qualify for immeasurable improvement.
When my cousin lived in town, we took the kids to the carousel in New York Park, the largest carousel run by New York's Central Park Administration, and if you don't need coffee, these $3 tickets are your most consumer-friendly in the city.
The Trojans are thunderously loud, the central columns are designed for fiberglass, all clowns and animals twist their heads, looking horrifically and menacingly over their shoulders, while the clanging music rings strangely.
Too many vulgar cities are disappointing: the view from the high-rise has become clich√©d, the skyline has become too familiar to provide much excitement, and the reality of the city has not propped up the dream.
I hadn't quite forgotten the day when, 35 years later, I discovered that this "Swiss chalet" wasn't actually a Swiss chalet, but one of the old Swiss cottages, a themed pub, I can't remember, but near an intersection in north London.
However, the Central Park carousel is still a magical experience, with everyone having a good time for an event that two 2-year-olds, an 11-year-old, and four two girls in their 40s can join in.
If I could evaluate the carousel, I would give it full marks, but fortunately no one asked.
But this week at a department store, before swiping my credit card, I was asked to rate my trading "experience" by one to five stars.
It's the same at the coffee shop in the corner of my street, with the option to rate it with a 15 per cent tip in order to buy something over the counter.
The effect of this is not only to slow down what should have been a neutral transaction, but to put pressure on the waiter to add a personal element to the much-needed scenario.
The poor woman in the department store smiled apologetically while I was exhausted and the credit card experience gave her a five star rating.
Oscar Pistorius transferred from prison to hospital with chest pains
It was the second time Pistorius had left prison and transferred to a hospital.
Last year he was taken to hospital to be treated for a cut to his wrist, which prison officials said was caused by a fall in his cell.
Pistorius was convicted of murder after prosecutors appealed the initial manslaughter verdict.
He shot Steenkamp multiple times through a toilet cubicle door at his Pretoria home in the early hours of Valentine's Day 2013, to his death.
Pistorius claims to have mistaken his girlfriend for an intruder hiding in a cubicle at night.
Prosecutors have announced their intention to appeal again, this time for Pistorius' six-year sentence, which they believe is too lenient.
The state prosecutor's office said it would appeal to South Africa's Supreme Court, and the appeal could be heard this year.
If prosecutors win, Pistorius faces a sentence of up to 15 years.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.

On May 18, the Ministry of Finance promulgated the "Measures on the Administration of Supplementary Funds for Special Awards for Structural Adjustment of Industrial Enterprises," which will arrange special awards to help resolve overcapacity in the coal and steel industries, with a total amount of 100 billion yuan.
Recently, a number of local governments, including Shanghai, Shanxi, Shandong, Jiangsu and Heilongjiang, have put forward reform proposals on the elimination of excess capacity.
Among them, many provinces have even proposed to actively seek the central government's financial support for the De-production capacity of their provinces.
One piece of evidence is that the coal-to-capacity target announced by just eight provinces stands at 90% of the national plan to cut coal production.
Lin Boqiang, director of the China Energy Policy Research Institute at Xiamen University, told reporters that the "de-capacity" of the steel and coal industries is not enough to rely on the central government's 100 billion yuan.
The coal de-capacity implementation rules, recently published in Shanxi Province, proposes to reorganize the Shanxi Coking Coal Group into a state-owned capital investment company, restructure and consolidate the company's assets and operations, and build a new business model.
The actual shortfall could be three times larger than the subsidy, according to Yin Weimin, the Minister of Human Resources and Social Security, who said the initial tally of "de-capacity" to be relocated was 1.3 million workers in the coal system and 500,000 in the steel system.
The Southern Daily News (reporter / Xie qingyu) today learned from the provincial Environmental Protection Agency that the results of the Environmental Protection credit rating of key pollution sources in Guangdong Province in 2012 are being made public.
As a result of the assessment, 134 of the 1,251 Enterprises listed on the Environmental Protection Credit Management list were temporarily not graded for reasons such as suspension of production, non-acceptance, closure and so on.
In the proposed red card enterprises, mainly electroplating, printing and dyeing, prevention and treatment of heavy pollution enterprises, some sewage treatment plants also on the list.
The provincial Environmental Protection Agency said that in order to reflect the principles of openness, fairness and impartiality and accept public scrutiny, the rating results are now published on the website of the Environmental Protection Agency.
During the public announcement period, the Environmental Protection Department will accept calls, letters, visits and other forms to reflect the problems, and the Environmental Protection Department will investigate, verify and deal with the problems.

The incurable disease affects the lives of about 1.3 million Americans and about 300,000 Britons, causing stomach cramps and bloating, recurrent or hemorrhagic diarrhea, weight loss and extreme tiredness.
Researchers at the University of Washington typically advise patients to avoid eating meat and dairy products to ease their symptoms, but the researchers found that the protein's key amino acid, tryptophan, helps boost the growth of immune cells, which increase tolerance in the gut.
Lead researcher Dr Marco Colonna explained that immune cells patrol the gut to ensure that harmful microbes hidden in food do not sneak into the body.
A balance is maintained between the cells that trigger inflammation and those that increase tolerance, protecting the body without damaging a variety of sensitive and delicate tissues.
Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) can occur when the equilibrium state is too biased towards inflammation.
In the experiment, a cell that promotes immunity was found in mice carrying specific bacteria.
Bacteria need tryptophan (one of the building blocks of proteins) to form the appearance of cells.
Professor Colonna said: 'we established a link between a population of bacteria (royce Lactobacillus, which is a normal part of the gut microbiota) and the development of cell populations that can promote tolerance.
The more tryptophan the mice consumed in their diet, the more immune cells they had.
He suggested that if humans used the same method, a combination of lactobacilli and a diet rich in tryptophan, it might create a more tolerant, less inflammatory gut environment.
Luisa Cervantes Barraganwas, a postdoctoral researcher, studied a type of immune cell that increases tolerance when she found that one group of study mice had such cells, but the other group of the same strains were not reared separately.
She suspected the difference was related to the mice's gut microbiome, a community of bacteria, viruses and fungi that normally live in the gastrointestinal tract.
DNA sequencing of cholesterol in mice showed that six species of bacteria were present in mice with immune cells, but not in mice without immune cells.
The mice were raised in a sterile environment, so they lacked the gut microbiome and could not develop such immune cells, and the presence of Lactobacillus reuteri produced immune cells.
To understand how bacteria affect the immune system, the researchers cultured Lactobacillus reuteri in a liquid and then transferred a small amount of the bacteria-free liquid into immature immune cells isolated from mice.
The immune cells develop into cells that are resistant to stress.
When the active ingredient is purified from the liquid, it can be proved that the active ingredient is a byproduct of tryptophan metabolism, called indole-3-lactic acid.
When the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the mice feed, the number of these cells increased by about 50 percent, but halved when tryptophan levels decreased by half.
'People have the same tolerance-enhancing cells as mice, and most of us have Lactobacillus reuteri in our gut,' explains Dr Cervantes Barragan.
Whether humans can induce cell development with tryptophan byproducts from Lactobacillus reuteri in their bodies, like mice in experiments, is unknown, but genetic defects linked to tryptophan have been found in patients with inflammatory bowel disease.
She said: "the development of these cells may be exactly what we want to get because these cells can control the inflammatory response on the inner surface of the gut.
It is not safe to say that the presence of high levels of tryptophan in Lactobacillus lucerne may lead to an increase in the number of this strain.
Jose Mourinho believes Manchester United have signed 'talented' Nemanja Matiƒá
After Nemanja Matiƒá made his debut against Sampdoria on Wednesday night, Mourinho decided that United had signed a "talented" midfielder.
Mathieu Debuchy, a ¬£40m signing from Chelsea, played 2-1 in the league's final pre-season match before the UEFA Super Cup against Real Madrid in Dublin on Tuesday, earning the likes of Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira.
However, Mathieu Debuchy was woefully short of match fitness during Bruce's pre-season tour of Asia, completing just 45 minutes, and Mourinho admitted that improvements were needed before the start of the Premier League season.
"He needs time, but he has experience, intelligence and a genius way of thinking - he thinks about football," Mourinho said.
"We'll help him get ready as soon as possible." "
Mourinho began lining up his starting line-up at the start of the season and, like Martic, new signings Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku started the game at the Aviva Stadium.
The Independent reported this week that Mourinho still wants to bring in three more signings, but insists the club is "doing a fantastic job" with four preferred signings in his heart and the club has brought in three of them.
"I am very grateful to the club for bringing in three of the contracted players," he added.
"I would have been happier if the club had been able to bring in all four players but they have worked very hard for me." "
Will China be left behind if it does not build this type of warship?
As recently the world's major naval powers have announced the construction of new frigates, as if overnight the frigate has become the focus of naval attention, first Japan decided in the 2018 defense budget to purchase two new frigates, Japan DEX frigate plan finally have a substantial breakthrough, then the US Lockheed Martin recently announced the US FFG frigate plan, what is China's new frigate plan?
With the launch of a new type 054A frigate in late 2017, the 054A frigate has already built as many as 29 frigates, approaching the total of the series 053h, and it has been 12 years since the first 054A was launched in 2006. Even in the world, such a number of high-performance frigates were built in China in the 1980s.
And the reason why so many 054A were built is simple: affordable, easy to use, and supplemented by years of naval arrears.
The 054A frigate has been favored by the Chinese navy for many years because of its high cost-effective performance and good fighting capacity. It has a displacement capacity of about 4000 tons, carries a 76 mm main gun, 32-unit Red Flag 16 and fish 8 antisubmarine missile Co-launch droop System, 8 Eagle strike 83 and a direct 9 helicopter, although it was built earlier in 2006.
But this is a type of ships designed in the early 2000s, with weapons set to one side, with large gaps in their power systems and electronic radar equipment compared with the world's mainstream frigates, and with the same type of frigates in Europe already equipped with all-electric propulsion, small multifunctional phased array radars, and large helicopter decks, it is time to develop new models.
So how China's new frigates should be developed is directly related to its future positioning and the strategic approach of our Chinese navy.
The future development of the Chinese navy will certainly be a blue-water navy, and the future will be an ocean, with rapid deployment in areas where China's vital interests are closely linked, a show of force and, if necessary, a strong combat capability to ensure that China's vital interests in the region are not damaged, so the new Hu Weijiang will be developed to a large and distant future.
Looking at the positioning of the new frigates in the future Chinese naval sequence, the future Chinese navy should be similar to the United States navy, except for the necessary offshore defense vessels, other major ships will form aircraft carrier battle groups or amphibious assault ships as the situation requires.
The role of the new frigate in the future carrier battle group should be as the main anti-submarine and near-air positioning, in the amphibious assault ship group should serve as the escort ship class, then according to the requirements of the new frigate must have a strong anti-submarine capability and a good mid-range space capability.
Based on the above positioning, it can be bold to envisage the general appearance of the domestic frigate in the future.
First, there will be a substantial increase in the displacement of the new type of frigate compared to the current Type 054A frigate. It is estimated that the displacement of the new type of frigate will reach about 5000rp6000 tons; the power system will have a qc280 modified gas turbine and two diesel engines integrated electric propulsion system.
As a result, the overall standard of the new frigates will be the best in the world, even compared to the FFG in the United States.
Of course, the above concept is only the author of the new type of frigate speculation, how we can only wait until the new type of frigate into the water, let us look forward to it.

In recent years, the city has encouraged enterprises to take an active part in the construction of national, industrial and regional organization standards, given 300,000 yuan to enterprises that are primarily or involved in the formulation of Zhejiang manufacturing group standards, and 500,000 yuan to enterprises that have passed Zhejiang manufacturing brand certification, the highest amount of the award in the province, which has stimulated the enthusiasm of enterprises to participate in the target.
A few days ago, Wang Li group production workshop, the head of the group system Gao Jian and staff are packing a combined anti-theft security door seal box, so as to participate in the Zhejiang manufacturing group standard work samples, ready to be sent to the Shaoxing Quality Testing Center.
Just two days ago, Wang Li has passed the "Made in Zhejiang" certification Expert Group on-site audit.
Gao Jian said the professional team, composed of industry technical experts and quality certification organizations, praised the group's performance in core areas such as quality excellence and independent innovation, and agreed that it was fully compliant, and that as long as the product passed the test, Wang Li would be one of the first companies to adopt the standard.
Wang Li Group is just a microcosm of the transformation and upgrading of the standard crowbar industry.
Our city and its simultaneous development of Zhejiang manufacturing group standards and standards of the work of Step-Yang, Qusheng group.

China's household debt ratio close to that of the US is worse than not being able to afford it?
Recently, there has been much discussion about the recent changes in real estate policy, whether the real estate policy should be loosened, and whether the diversification of the supply of land policy will lead to a decline in house prices?
But at a time when we are worried about real estate prices, about macroeconomic regulation, and about the future of the real estate market, the People's Daily has written again. Last time we wrote about the tone of the People's Daily commentary on real estate regulation, and now the People's Daily is talking about a more serious issue than not being able to buy a house, even if you can afford it?
Today, we are going to talk about a more serious problem than buying a house: repaying the loan.
1. China's growing housing debt crisis
In November 2017, the third-quarter China deleveraging report, issued by the National Finance and Development Laboratory of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences and the national balance sheet Research Center, showed that the leverage ratio in the residential sector continued its upward trend, rising from 47.4 percent in the second quarter of 2017 to 48.3 percentage points in the first three quarters of 2017.
The household sector's share of debt in the real economy as a whole has increased, and its leverage ratio has increased at a faster pace.
Studies show that Chinese households' Debt in financial institutions is dominated by consumer loans, accounting for about two-thirds of residents' debt, about twice as much as business loans.
Among the consumer loans, housing loans account for about 80% of medium- and long-term loans, but in incremental terms, short-term consumer loans are growing faster than medium- and long-term loans.
On top of that, China's household debt ratio only tallies the total amount of credit that the household sector receives from financial institutions, while Chinese households have many private loans, including borrowing from relatives and friends, with large hidden debts.
According to the Suning Institute of Finance, China's resident leverage ratio was only 3% in 1996 and 18% in 2008, but it has grown rapidly since 2008, doubling to 36.4% in just six years.by the third quarter of 2017, it was 48.6%.
In May of last year, HSBC released a survey of nearly tens of thousands of people across nine countries.
The report interviewed "millennial" young people in nine countries (born between 1980 and 2000).
According to the report, China has a 70% homeownership rate among young people after 80 and 90, well ahead of second-place Mexico (46%) and twice that of the United States (35%).
These figures tell us that the most likely problem is that the biggest potential "grey rhino" of the Chinese population is estimated to be out of debt, compared to not being able to afford a home.
Second, why is the housing debt crisis the most serious problem?
As in our previous analysis, although we have been saying that house prices are higher in China, the rate of home ownership in China is actually quite high compared to the rest of the world.
We look at the world's real estate market, China's real estate market due to a late start, other than we said Hainan, there has not been a major real estate crisis, but just a decade ago the origin of the world financial tsunami in 2008 was the real estate crisis in the United States.
The US housing crisis has been blamed on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
During the golden age of the United States, when real estate companies sold homes for very low down payments in order to expand sales, the housing market was booming at a good time, but not for long. As the U.S. economy stagnated, leading to a drop in income for home buyers, large household spending began to fall.
However, the current situation in the United States was one in which financial and real estate assets were a component of household assets in the United States, where almost all household assets in the low-income group were real estate, while most of the assets in the top 20 per cent of the high-income group were financial assets, resulting in higher debt ratios for the poorer households in the United States.
A serious fact is that these people bought their homes in better times, so the money to pay their mortgages was calculated on their better incomes. When incomes fell, mortgage stress did not abate even as some subprime mortgage programs became more volatile, so the housing problems of these American families gradually became a real estate crisis.
As a result, banks began to repossess homes because their incomes were too low to pay for them, and when they repossessed homes from delinquent buyers, they sold them at Rock-bottom prices, leading to further declines in home prices in the region, creating a vicious circle in which more and more homeowners found their homes were worth less than their mortgages.
Thus, a huge vicious circle is formed:
"The economy is bad - incomes are falling - some people can't afford a mortgage - banks are selling their debtors' homes at low prices - house prices are falling - more people have stopped paying their mortgages - banks are selling again - house prices are falling again..."
The problem is more than that, because house prices keep falling, you don't have debt after you stop repaying your house to the bank, and if you don't get the money you owe the bank by auctioning the house, then you still have to pay back the money.
Thus, in one vicious circle after another, the US economy gradually collapsed, eventually triggering the US financial crisis of 2008.
So, the fact that China's household-debt ratio is now at a high of 46.8% is a matter of great alarm. This figure is still below developed-country levels, but signs of trouble are starting to emerge, and the country's repeated emphasis on deleveraging from last year is a very prescient judgment that household-debt ratios, if allowed to rise, are bound to pose significant financial risks.
So after the house is used to live, not to fry the positioning, the state has accelerated the establishment of multi-Agent Supply, multi-Channel security, rent and purchase, and other multiple measures to further defuse potential risks.
For our individual families, we must give up the thinking of real estate speculation, buy a house when the capacity to do so, to avoid their own families into a huge burden, only a reasonable assessment of their income and debt levels is a healthy path of family wealth development.

British inventor implants chip in his own body and waves his hand into his car
A British inventor has become the first person in the country to install a chip that can open his front door, enter his office and even start his car with a wave of his hand.
Steven Northam, 33, implanted a tiny chip between his thumb and forefinger and is now offering the service to companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives, achieved through technology by his company, Biometeq.
He has joined forces with Dr Jeff Watson, a senior consultant anaesthetist at the Royal Hampshire Hospital in Winchester, Hampshire, to ensure the implant process meets medical standards.
The technique is similar to a cat and dog chip implant and takes as little as 30 seconds.
Mr Northam's company will also replace locks on rooms and vehicles to be compatible with the chip, which costs ¬£300 per lock.

White House props cost thousands
Last month, the White House decided to transport a Marine Corps helicopter to the South Lawn to highlight the great glory of American manufacturing, at a cost of up to $24,000, according to military records released by Time magazine.
The green and white Sikorsky vh3d (also known as Marine One when the president was on the ride) was a key exhibit in the white house's July 17 campaign to highlight American construction projects.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and top White House officials toured manufacturing products from all 50 states.
Among the exhibits are helicopters made in Connecticut, a Maine yacht, a Wisconsin fire truck and a Mississippi forklift truck.
The white House Military Office asked the helicopter to appear on a daily order (FRAGO), just 36 hours before it landed on the South Lawn for the "special" event, according to records from the force's Marine Corps helicopter first flight team (hmx1), which operates the helicopter.
The day before the event, Commander HMX1 said in an email to his superior Marine Corps Flight Lieutenant Commander, "I just want to make sure you know because this event is highly valued."
The information indicated that the helicopter would arrive on the South Lawn at about 7am on July 17 for the 3pm event, leaving only after the lawn had emptied between 6pm and 9pm that evening.
The message also said that in the event of a delay in departure from the White House, the return flight would require a second crew because of the duty time limit.
The original crew members were on standby at the side of the helicopter during the event, while security forces personnel were on standby nearby when the aircraft was on the ground.
The records obtained by Time magazine did not clearly indicate whether a second crew was ultimately needed.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using government property for political purposes.
The records state that HMX1 had asked whether the event was in breach of the act.
The commander wrote that "one of the questions we asked was whether this was a violation of the Hatch Act and was told there was no violation."
"Sounds like you're locked up," replied the deputy commander.
The White House defines the "Made in America" event as an official event and is therefore not subject to the Hatch Act.
But even official events have political overtones.
At the event, the president pushed the Senate issue of The day: health care reform, and touted control of government regulations.
The use of Marine One or Air Force One aircraft for political propaganda purposes is nothing new.
Successive presidents have been required to travel on these planes.
However, it is not common for them to be requisitioned for the sole purpose of taking photographs.
Trump came under the spotlight in February, when it was in Melbourne, Florida, that the presidential jet slowly taxied to the background cloth of his first campaign rally, and his Twitter account was flooded with complaints about the former president's use of the presidential jet.
"The White House is thrilled with the 'Made in America' exhibition, which showcases products from all 50 states made by American workers using American materials," said White House Deputy Press Secretary Lindsay Walters.
The HMX1 crew regularly conducts flight training near the Washington area and on the South Lawn, practicing the precise placement of the US president in the White House.
During Trump's visit to the G20 summit in Germany in early July, HMX1 practiced 58 landings at the White House.
The U.S. manufacturing activity flight was included in this month's crew training requirements, an official said.
The helicopter unit also flew an extra 11 hours of "non-presidential support missions" that day.
The White House said taxpayers did not cover the cost of any other props at the event.
A Sikorsky spokesman said the company was not involved in arranging the South Lawn helicopter display.
HMX1 does not keep a budget record of the presidential flight, so it is very difficult to determine the exact costs incurred by the event.
But according to the Defense Department's hourly expense records for fiscal 2017, VHA 3D's Defense Department is eligible for reimbursement of $24,380 per flight hour.
The force recorded a time of 30 minutes for each flight of the aircraft from its base at Quantico Marine Corps Airport in Virginia.
The White House says the cost of operating the helicopter is far less than that.
"Estimating the cost to the taxpayer on the basis of reportable expense is very misleading," Walters said.
These estimated costs include personnel costs, maintenance costs and many other sunk costs included in the annual appropriations.
A 2015 RAND study showed that the Department of Defense's reimbursable expenses did not include personnel costs, but did include oil costs, maintenance costs and contracting costs.
At the time, former White House press spokesman Sean Spicer defended the use of the helicopter for the event,
"The idea is to show something made in America this week," he said.
And I know that Sikorsky and Connecticut are proud of this, and they both contribute to our national security, and I suspect that hundreds, if not thousands, of jobs depend on it.
And I feel that, like most Americans, we are all proud of this helicopter and other military equipment, the result of the painstaking efforts of countless Americans.
So it's certainly not out of place to highlight that, "he said.
We don't know if Trump interacted with the helicopter while touring the South Lawn at the event, but he did get in the driver's seat of a fire engine.
Inside the White House, Trump addressed Sikorsky company representatives, joking with the media about the company plane he owns.
"I know Sikorsky Aircraft very well. I have three," he said.

It is reported that Chongqing currently has 18 shale gas exploration rights set up by the Ministry of Land and Resources and the first domestic shale gas mining rights - China Petrochemical Fuling shale gas field.
As of January 2017, the city of Chongqing has completed 368 drilling shale gas wells (excluding parameter wells) and put into operation 261. Recently, with the good news that four shale gas exploration wells in the south Pingqiao area of Sinopec's Nanchuan district are each producing more than 200,000 cubic meters per day, the first commercially exploited large shale gas field outside North America, China's Fuling shale gas field, is expected to be completed by 10 billion cubic meters this year.
The 10 billion cubic meters of shale gas field is understood to be the equivalent of a large 10-billion-tonne field.
It is understood that shale gas as a clean energy source, 10 billion square shale gas fields can reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 12 million tons per year when completed.

According to Market Star report, from 2005 to 2011, the province's GDP from the central juxtaposition of the "bottom" to the next seat.
However, the economic growth of our province still suffers from low investment efficiency and lack of core competitiveness of industrial economy, so the latest issue of the economic blue pages of the Provincial Economic Information Center suggests improving the quality and efficiency of economic growth.
Based on some representative indicators of the economy of our province in 2005 and 2011, it is compared with the whole country and the central region.
In terms of industrial economic efficiency, in 2011, the province accounted for a considerable proportion of industries with high energy consumption, such as industrial energy and raw materials, which were heavily affected by market fluctuations and under "double pressure" from overcapacity. At the same time, the leading industries, such as home appliances and automobiles, were not innovative enough, resulting in meagre profits.
But a large amount of investment did not bring corresponding economic benefits, which is an important reason for the poor quality and efficiency of economic growth in our province.
In this regard, experts suggest that effective measures should be taken to encourage enterprises to innovate, and the scientific and technological achievements of universities and research institutes should be "transferred" to enterprises in time.
For industrial economic efficiency is not high, experts say, should also actively promote industrial merger and reorganization, optimize industrial layout, extend the industrial chain.

GMB to focus on investment in McVitie's Glasgow plant
The union wants the management of biscuit maker McVeigh to pledge a long-term commitment to production at the lasgo plant.
The Scottish branch of the Federation of Trade Unions said it had been silent on the future of investment in the Tolcross plant.
The factory, which has more than 500 employees, makes oatmeal biscuits, rich tea biscuits and other products.
Pladis, owner of McVitie's, said it had invested more than ¬£5m in the plant over the past few years.
If there are changes in plant operations, staff and union representatives "will be the first to know," he added.
In a letter to the company's director, the Scottish branch of the Federation of Trade Unions called on McVitie to "address the problem of funds not being carried over to the modernization of the production line."
Drew Duffy, a veteran sponsor of the ACFTU, said: 'our members are deeply concerned by our inability to get a clear picture of Tolcross's future business needs and investment plans from the plant's general manager.
Generations of families work here, and the high concentration of labour in the local community and the Greater Glasgow area is an important pillar of decent employment in areas with high unemployment and severe social deprivation.
So in terms of jobs, pay and economic prosperity, the east of Glasgow is in desperate need of McVeigh's ever-expanding production network against the backdrop of Brexit, rising living costs and a prolonged slump in manufacturing. ""
A spokesman for pradis said: "the director of Tollcross has just received a letter from the Scottish branch of the TUC yesterday and the company will respond immediately as we value continued engagement with employees and union representatives.
Two months ago we held a regular meeting in Tollcross with staff and ACFTU representatives to publicly discuss a number of issues.
We had discussions with staff and then, like all other companies operating in a highly competitive and economically uncertain environment, we conducted a review of the continuing operating model we applied to businesses and factories in order to remain competitive.
She added: "we have invested more than ¬£5m in the Tollcross plant in recent years, particularly in production lines and operational improvements.
We fully recognise the historic position of Tollcross as a production base and if there are any changes to our operations at the plant, staff and union representatives will be the first to know. ""

Paris Saint-Germain warned Barcelona three years ago to sign Neymar?
La Liga may regret throwing an olive branch to Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain will not give up on signing Neymar after making a ¬£189m offer to try to get him to exercise the exemption clause, but did they warn Barcelona three years ago about launching an attack on the world-record Raider?

Barcelona are furious with Neymar for his attacking approach and for breaking out of the way, with sources close to the Catalan board insisting that the club have done everything in their power to look after him since his arrival from Santos in 2013.
But did the president of Paris Saint-Germain make such a prediction about the world of football three years ago?
When Manchester City expressed an interest in signing Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi issued a stern warning to any club that wanted to sign Paris Saint-Germain's best player.
"I'm not worried because they know that if they touch any of our players, we will have to go up against them and we will contact their players as well," Al-Khelaifi said.
"We respect all clubs.
But if they try to sign our players, they will have to fend for themselves.
The Spanish club appeared to cross the line earlier this summer, with Barcelona offering an olive branch to Paris Saint-Germain midfielder Marco Verratti.
