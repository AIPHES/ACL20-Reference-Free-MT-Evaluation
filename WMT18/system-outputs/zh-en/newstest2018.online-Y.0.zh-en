Civil rights groups issue travel warnings against Missouri
As a result of discriminatory policies and racist attacks in Missouri, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) issued travel warnings to people of colour preparing to travel to Missouri.
“The NAACP Missouri Travel Consulting, which came into effect on August 28, 2017, called for special attention and extreme caution on the part of all African-American travellers, tourists and Missouri people when travelling in Missouri, as a result of a series of suspected ethnic incidents in Missouri,” the statement of the group states.
NAACP noted that the recent adoption of a Missouri law had made it more difficult to win discrimination suits and that State law enforcement was directed to minorities to some extent, prompting the organization to issue travel warnings.
Violations of the rights of citizens are taking place.
They were interrogated by parking because of their skin colour, beaten or killed,” Rhode Chapel, chairman of NAACP, Missouri, told The Kansas City Star.
“We have received an unprecedented number of complaints.”
This is the organization's first such warning to a state in the United States.
The organization cited the racial defamation of black students by the University of Missouri and the death of a 28-year-old black Tennessee male, Tolly Sanders.
Earlier this year, Sanders died under suspicious circumstances. He was detained without charge by the Missouri police when he was travelling with depleted fuel.
The consultation also pointed out that a recent report by the Missouri Attorney General's Office indicated that “black drivers in the state are 75% more likely to be checked for parking than white people”.
“This consultation is intended to raise people's awareness and warn their families, friends and colleagues about what might happen in Missouri,” said Chapel.
“People need to be prepared to travel to Missouri with bail money or to let relatives know they're traveling in the state.”
According to the latest data from the FBI Hate Crime Reporting Program, Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015; according to the amount of crimes, it ranked 16th in the country.
Travel warnings are also a response to the new Missouri law, which will make it more difficult to prosecute businesses that discriminate in housing or employment.
Previously, United States states passed immigration law enforcement laws requiring local law enforcement authorities to detain immigration offenders, and the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) indicated that this would increase the number of race litigation and issued travel advisories for Texas and Arizona.
Travel warnings are usually issued by the United States Government against other countries, but more recently, advisory groups have adopted this approach in response to certain laws and trends in the United States.

BBC called Beijing the most exciting city: let the outsider feel “living in a new era”
The reference news network reported on January 18 that the British media said that Beijing may have a long history of 3,000 years, but it is also rapidly becoming today's modern charm city.
With a staggering speed of internet, sophisticated technologies such as face recognition software, the Chinese capital has invested in artificial intelligence and has unrivaled internationalization power. It is one of the most exciting cities for foreigners with a spirit of exploration.
According to a report from the BBC website on January 16, German expatriate Clemens Seshi said: “If I can succeed there, I can succeed anywhere in the future.” He quoted the lyrics of the singer Frank Sinatra glorifying New York City.
“If Sinatra lives to this day, he will probably sing a city like Beijing,” said Sehi, who is the creative director of the Traveller Archives magazine. He said that living in this city will make you feel “living in a new era”, always keeping up with the trend.
“People generally have a feeling of being at the center of something magnificent, which is hard to say, but it keeps many foreigners there long,” said Simon Norton, who lives in Beijing recently, in an article published on the personal blog site, 4Corners7Seas. They want to see what it will look like, and they want to see it for themselves.”
The report said that the city's high-quality high-speed Internet and technology-friendly environment make daily life easier than ever.
“Beijing is rapidly turning into a cash-free society, and the Internet has integrated the functionality of traditional wallets into smartphones, making it easier for everyone to make many transactions,” said Andy Peñafuerte from Manila, who is currently deputy editor-in-chief of the Beijing Children website.
According to the report, however, smartphones are only the beginning of Beijing's technical ambition. Facial recognition software has become widely available. Many mobile phone applications use this technology to carry out bank transfers and payments, allow people to enter apartments and offices, and even use it to verify the identity of the motorcycle driver.
Beijing also recently announced plans to invest RMB 13.8 billion in the construction of an artificial intelligence science park. After its completion, more than 400 enterprises will be set up there. They will focus on the development of various artificial intelligence technologies from biometrics to autonomous driving cars.
Food is also at the core of many major festivals in China's calendar years, and participation in these festivals is admired by foreigners. Spring Festival is the most important social and economic festival and one of the most accessible festivals for foreigners.
Seshi said: “I suggest helping Chinese friends prepare for the New Year, clean up apartments and put a red spring union with a new year blessing on their doorstep. On the New Year's Eve day, all family members will gather together to eat a rich meal, and then stay till midnight and greet the new year with a brilliant fireworks. For foreigners, having a night with friends and family is indeed an opportunity for integration.”
According to the report, the number of foreigners in Beijing is large and growing, but language barriers in China and the ease of communication between the diaspora can easily be used as an excuse for not being fully integrated into local culture.
Seshi said: “Some foreigners have lived in China for many years, but have little experience with their host country. If your first attempt to reach the Chinese is not successful, then it's easy for you to feel more comfortable with other foreigners.
“In these so-called “old foreign bubbles” (“old foreign bubbles” means that foreigners are only mixed up among foreigners without contact with local people and local culture - translators), foreigners are holding groups in their own communities, eating in Western restaurants, and only foreigners are among friends.
The easiest way to overcome this is to learn a little Mandarin - that's easier than one might imagine.
Seshi said: “Every week, the first two hours of private instruction in Chinese or the start-up radio drama should suit everyone's busy schedule.”
Even a few classic phrases can help shopping, dining in restaurants, or chatting in a taxi.
According to reports, stubborn air pollution is also a fact of everyday life, but in recent years the government has tried to contain some problems.
Residents stressed the importance of outdoor activities during warmer months, where pollution tends to be lighter, using blue days as an opportunity to wander in a historic alley or explore popular solar parks.
Norton said: “Beijing is the Chinese city where the most things can be found below the surface, and you can discover great artistic and musical activities, passionate nightlife, historical wonders, ultra-modern business areas and ancient alley areas.”
The report argues that the disincentives to human capital growth are increasingly evident from ageing, especially in the north-east, where the average annual contribution of ageing to human capital growth is -1.28 per cent.
Pan Kung-sheng pointed out that the risk of cross-border capital flows is now manageable, and the underlying factors underpinning the balance of payments are still long-term.

The European Commission in April of this year accused Google of forcing mobile phone manufacturers to preinstall software such as Google Search and Chrome Browser, otherwise they would not be allowed to use other Google apps.
The European Commission considers this to be detrimental to the interests of consumers and to the detriment of competition.
EU regulators initially requested Google to respond by 27 July.
If antimonopoly charges are established, Google faces a fine of up to 10 per cent of its global revenue, approximately $7.4 billion.
Google has not immediately commented on this.
Google also faces EU surveys because of its preference for its own shopping services in search results.

A picture of the legal status of Bitcoin around the world
Summary: In addition to the price rebates that are naturally triggered by speculative properties, this round of digital currency plunge is also related to the “enemy” - regulatory risk.
From the visualization map, the attitude of Eastern countries towards Bitcoin is more conservative than that of the West, and the countries that are the main global subjects are still watching digital currency legitimacy, representing the “risk of black swans” is still very large.

With regulatory storms in major Bitcoin markets such as China, South Korea and the European Union, Bitcoin-led global digital currency has been bloody washed since this week, and Bitcoin prices have fallen below $10,000 psychological integer on Tuesday, and have hit the largest single-day decline in three years.
In addition to the price rebates that are naturally triggered by speculative properties, this round of digital currency plunge is also related to the long-standing “enemy” - regulatory risk.
At this important juncture, HowMuch.net, the big data visualization website, has produced a diagram showing Bitcoin's legitimacy and regulatory level in all countries of the world.
As shown in the figure below, green represents the legitimate Bitcoin market; orange represents the neutral market, although not yet publicly legalized Bitcoin status, but there are no major restrictions on its use; pink represents the restricted market, that is, the local government tries to use digital currency through red line policy or regulation; dark pink represents the country where Bitcoin is defined as illegal; gray is the country that has not yet been evaluated.
(Figure above from HowMuch.Net Visual Team on January 15)
The article pointed out that from the distribution of green blocks in the figure, it can be seen that the attitude of the Eastern countries in the traditional sense of Bitcoin is more conservative than that of the West.
Russia is currently the largest country that defines Bitcoin as illegal, China is one of the biggest restricted markets for Bitcoin, India is one of the largest countries that has not yet put in place relevant policies for Bitcoin without comment.
North America and Western Europe are the regions with the highest Bitcoin acceptance, i.e. the green block distribution is more concentrated.
The views of the countries of the Middle East and Latin America on Bitcoin are clearly divided, and the color distribution of the above areas is more mixed.
Among them, Iraq, Iran, Turkey and Brazil are all legal Bitcoin markets. Afghanistan, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Bolivia and other countries have some restrictions on their trade and use. More Latin American countries have not yet voiced Bitcoin.
Combining the above data, a total of 99 countries (or 40 per cent of the total) out of 246 countries in the world have no restrictions on Bitcoin trading and use, i.e. green and orange yellow areas.
Seven countries (or 3 per cent) were restricted markets (pink), 10 countries (or 4 per cent) defined Bitcoin as illegal (dark pink), and 130 countries (or 53 per cent) did not have more information on digital currencies (gray).
This means that countries that account for the majority of the world (53%, more than half) are still watching the legality of Bitcoin-led digital currencies within their borders, and also represent Bitcoin's “black swan risk” is still very high, as some of them may eventually take legislative decisions limiting digital currencies.
According to the article, global regulators have not fully understood the emerging category of digital currencies, which may be the main reason why most countries have not made a pronouncements.
Although Bitcoin's “popularity” has increased exponentially since last year, it does not represent the interest of all countries. Some countries may fear that local currency will be threatened as a result or that digital currency will be used by criminal organizations.
Wall Street News has written a detailed summary of international regulatory news about Bitcoin since last week, including China's start to crack down on the online platform of centralized services and mobile apps for off-site exchanges, Korea is still considering closing the digital currency exchange, the EU believes Bitcoin has not been widely accepted and warns investors about the risk of “losing blood”.
Wall Street Witnesses Editor Selected Reading Highlights|2018: Global Central Mom Opens Digital Currency Year?” It has been mentioned that 2018 will become the year of the global central bank's digital currency from the point of view of regulation, acceptance/criticism and adoption.
Major countries such as Russia criticized the Bitcoin's legal status, but in fact it was also intended to give way to official issuance of digital currency.
Xinhua News Agency report of January 8 from Madrid (by staff reporter Xie Yu Zi) - Barcelona's new aid Cutiño debut on the 8th in Norkampo for the first time in a pizza jersey.
Cutiño passed a medical examination in Basa this morning and signed a contract with Bartha Chairman Bator Meu, which expires in the summer of 2023.
He then appeared as a Basa player in front of nearly 7,000 fans in Norkampo.
According to the Spanish media, the total transfer dues of Cutiño, or Euro160 million (Euro1 or RMB 7.77), are the first price in the history of the Basa Club and Sicia.
As Cutiño is still wounded, he still needs to rest for nearly 20 days before he can meet his own pizza dress show.
What else is sacred?
Now Trump's White House is targeting the Statue of Liberty.
The most definite sign of regime change is when they start attacking statues.
Americans, like anyone else, agree with this. So, 2003, Saddam at Paradise Square in Baghdad? Hussein was meticulously overthrown.
Stephen? Stephen Miller, one of the key think tanks of Trump's government, is Jim with CNN? When Jim Acosta was fiercely debating the President's proposal to severely restrict legal immigration, he certainly knew what would happen when he cut a symbolic ax on the Statue of Liberty.
It is fair to say that Miller did not attack the statue itself.
If he did, then a group of boat owners and liberal followers would have swallowed him alive.
But he did attack the significance of the statue, especially in 1903 Emma? The significance of the famous poetry of Lazarus, which was built 17 years after it was engraved on the base.
As Miller rebuts Acosta, “I don't want to talk about all the facts of history here, but the Statue of Liberty is a symbol of America's freedom to illuminate the world...
The poem you're referring to, which was added later, is not part of the original Statue of Liberty.”
In fact, Miller is right, but as he himself said, this is not really about history.
This involves the modern echo of the horrible words of Lazarus, and the only country seems to invite not only any old immigrants, but also the poorest of the poor: “Your fatigue, your poverty, or your crowded people are eager to breathe freely,/suffering people reject your crowded beaches.”
There is no “suffering people refuse” at a moment when our screen becomes even more staggering.
Miller did not engage in literary critics, and he made it clear that these people would not be welcomed in the United States during the Trump era.
This conflict over the significance of statues is part of a broader political and cultural war: it is actually a conflict with the spirit of the United States.
Lazarus, as well as her friends, who engraved her poetry on the docks after her death, are well aware of the highly political nature of the acts in which they are engaged.
The purpose of the sculpture is to express the link between French and American republicism through the ancient classic metaphor of the feminine incarnation of the goddess of freedom.
Lazarus changed the meaning: in her poetry, the female image is no longer abstract, and she wants to sound.
She gave herself a very different name: the mother of exile.
The combination of the poem and the painting was a successful feminist coup and a devastating blow to American homogenism.
Just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, the right-wing always wanted to change it back.
Great speaker Rash? Rush Limbaugh, a makeshift Baptist from Trump, believed in 2010 that liberalism was not an invitation to anyone, and that he was now an early, neo-conservative, bringing the flame of American wisdom to the world of ignorance: “The goddess of freedom was unparalleled.
She intended to bring the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
The torch is not lighting America's path.”
Unusually, Limpo was actually moved by something.
The significance of statues depends entirely on the perspective of perception.
Lazarus's imaginative approach is to see it. When tired, poor, but hopeful, people will be able to see it on the deck after a long and often terrible journey.
On the face of it, it involves the perspective of those who seek refuge and have the opportunity to improve their lives.
Her statues convey to them and require the hope and welcome of their hearts.
Of course, this is not the point that Miller and Trump had wanted to admit.
Their torch is not intended to illuminate the road, but rather to ignite the hatred of their sole source of power.

2017 World Championships: Neil? Neil Black highly praised Scottish players in the British National Team.
Eric? Eilidh Doyle recalled that there were only two Scots in the British national team.
Neil, Executive Director of the British Athletics Association? Blake said that the team of 16 strong Scots in the World Championship team will make a great contribution to the national team.
Scottish athletes selected for the 2017 London Athletics World Championships, which opened on Friday, are the largest in history.
Blake believes that “Scotland is making extraordinary progress,” and British athletes must learn from it.
“We accept and try to understand this, and we will persevere until we succeed,” said Blake.
“I talked to someone at Scottish Sports College. They think this is related to their actions.
Scottish athletes think this is related to their actions.
The British Athletics Association considers this to be relevant to their actions.
Even street people think so.
Whatever the circumstances, this is extremely brilliant. “”
Scottish athletes are medal players, including Laura? Laura Muir and Andrew? Andrew Butchart, they will be in 5,000 meters with Mu? Mo Farah one-to-one ratio, and Eric? Eilidh Doyle was selected as the team leader.
“Erid was a bit modest.
Her captain's speech was incredible,” said Blake.
“Many athletes, whether Scottish or not, and wherever they live or train, come out of the house with pride and energy.
Erid naturally put in a great passion and true feelings.”
The winner of the Commonwealth silver medal, who will participate in the 400-meter cross-column at its fifth World Championship, said that the British national team has 16 Scots, which is “incredible.”
Previously, the number of Scottish athletes participating in the World Championships was up to seven, i.e. the number of participants in 1983 and 2015.
The middle runner, Mur, is the leader. She has set five British and two European records in the past year.
She will compete in 1500 meters and 5000 meters.
Chris in the 1500 meter project competition? O'Hare was another Scottish athlete of interest who had previously made good results during the season, winning the qualifying and Olympic Anniversary competitions in the United Kingdom.
Doyle remembers her participation in the first world championships when the only other Scottish on the team was Lee? Lee McConnell.
The captain said she was proud that so many of her compatriots had joined the team and, in some cases, would challenge the medals and compete for the final.
“The special feature of being a national team leader is that it is elected by other national team members. Therefore, knowing that your teammates voted for you to fight for the most extraordinary achievement, in any case, is a great pleasure for me”, she added.
“Of course, I am very proud of all Scottish players.
It just shows how far we have come.
And they are all old track and field athletes here, who are about to move towards the goal of winning the podium.
How was my captain?
Well, I think it's great.
I just referred to the fact that, in this case, we were very lucky because we held the world championships on the home.
It is therefore truly important that we build on home support and that we grow up by returning to the Olympic stadium.
I will be given a second chance to compete, and the atmosphere there will be undeniable.”

Shield critics from Facebook: If you can't stand the blame of voters, don't run for office.
Our Father knows the style of bad media.
Americans loved Washington, but soon afterwards, major newspapers began to criticize him for everything, from domestic policy to political principles.
He was annoyed by those criticisms, and there was no doubt.
But he did not silence those critics.
Because as early as 1783, Washington said, “Freedom of expression is being denied - we will be slaughtered like a lamb in silence and ignorance.”
This reminds me of Governor Larry Hogan of Maryland, who needs to learn from Washington.
Hogan's staff blocked and removed at least 450 posts because they posted their views on his official Facebook home page.
The United States Civil Liberties Union initiated a lawsuit against him earlier this week.
The governor's staff considered the lawsuit to be hasty, and the online report was full of their strong resistance: “Who cares?”
Many people say, “It's just Facebook.”
But this is important.
This is particularly important because people like Hogan are being confronted.
This is a Republican governor in a democracy-majority state, and he was surprisingly popular.
Of the 50 governors in the country, he received the second highest rating.
Hogen is not a reactionary impatient.
He took control of the state of Maryland smoothly and strictly observed the rules.
He was also very good at using Facebook as the main way to communicate with voters, showing his bald after chemotherapy for the first time on his homepage.
So the person who shielded the comments to the Governor's home page was completely unnecessary and ultimately dangerous. This homepage is a public forum, an official management platform marked by publicly funded employees.
In an interview with the Washington Post, Hogan's spokesman, Amelia Shath, defended the Governor's conduct by saying that she believed that shielding their comments was merely an attempt to restrain them.
But they hasten to describe it as a flood beast or cynical.
The Washington Post had a face-to-face conversation with someone who was blocked by Hogan.
They are just ordinary people talking to their elected leaders: they are teachers, small business owners and pastors, not a flood beast.
They said that their comments were deep and respectful and that they were not downstream.
The priest quoted the Bible in his post and called on Hogan to remember his Catholic faith.
Lakshmi Salma Lamani, the barrister of Boy, Maryland, was not cynical, but she asked about hate crimes.
She wrote in the News Story Review section of the Washington Post, “I politely commented that I was disappointed that he had not responded to hate crimes and other recent news events.
I also do not like a group of people commenting on the same topic, because these people will be directly ignored by some people who think that they are so-called psychology of the crowd rather than treating them as a group of citizens who are worried about the country.”
What the governor's staff called “intensive spam bombing” may appear to others to be “insistence.”
The Facebook era makes it easy to modify a message, just block a critic or delete a negative comment.
It was also much cleaner than in the past, when the same effect had to be achieved by sending staff out to collect and burn newspapers with critical statements or by arresting or silencing protesters.
But that is really what is happening now, but at the digital level.
Hogan was not the first public official to be accused of silencing others on Facebook and other social media.
President Trump is being prosecuted by Twitter users because he shielded them on Twitter.
There was a landmark ruling last week in Virginia on such issues.
According to James C. Kataris, District Judge in Alexandria, United States, the Chairman of the Laudon County Supervisory Commission had violated the First Amendment by blocking voters from her Facebook home page.
Kentucky Governor Matt Bevin (R) was also seen by the United States Civil Liberties Alliance for his use of Facebook and Twitter.
It shouldn't be so hard.
In the era of Washington, affordable postage and the Internet have a similar impact.
The number of newspapers quadrupled between 1776 and 1800, and there were anonymous letters critical of his leadership.
And even then, there was an anonymous flood beast against him in Washington.
The pseudonyms of Yuri Kra, Valerius, Belisaru and Podjus were used to write to the press critically criticizing Washington's decision-making.
According to historical documents collected by the George Washington newspaper online project, his office was submerged by petitions, all criticizing his attitude on the Treaty of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation between His Majesty the British King and the United States of America, signed with the United Kingdom.
But he didn't silence them.
Freedom of expression, political dissent and speech were fundamental to the country.
And true leaders need to accept this.
A slightest wind and grass movement in the building market all dragged people's sensitive nerves.
Limited purchase is a hard lever for many urban real estate management policies.
In May 2017, Jinan introduced regulations that undergraduate students can pay for six consecutive months of social security and enjoy the same housing purchase policy for residents of local permanent residents;
In June, Wuhan issued a policy stipulating that university students can settle in their homes within three years with a diploma and an employment permit.
Then the policy added, the official said, “college students can buy a house at a price lower than 20% of the market price”;
In July, Chengdu introduced regulations that young people with undergraduate or higher degrees in overseas universities can apply for admission to Chengdu on the basis of a diploma.
In addition, other cities or regions, such as Kunshan and Shanghai Lingang, have also introduced policies related to the “introduction of talent”, lowering the threshold for the acquisition of housing by talent.
Zhang Hongwei believes that this is actually the competition of major cities for the population, especially talent. Only by retaining the population, especially talent, can cities become competitive. This is the most important significance of these real estate policies.
Some people even think that this means that the time has come for the “limited purchase” cancellation of the property market.

Zou Chunmin, director of the Environmental Inspection Bureau of the Ministry of Environmental Protection of China, introduced in Beijing on the 22nd. In August, a total of 57 cases of daily punishment were carried out throughout the country. The newly revised Law on Environmental Protection introduced at the beginning of this year clearly added to China's environmental enforcement efforts.
At present, environmental protection agencies in various parts of China can use penalties such as continuous daily punishment, seizure and seizure, cut off of production, and transfer to administrative detention to investigate and punish environmental violations and cooperate with the judicial authorities in punishing environmental crimes.
Zou Chunmin explained that in August, a total of 335 cases of seizure and seizure were carried out in various parts of China; 177 cases of limited and cut-off were carried out; 189 cases of administrative detention were transferred and 166 cases of suspected environmental pollution crimes were transferred.
Among them, Henan has imposed a continuous penalty of seven per day. Currently, China is in the process of embedding from end-of-pipe control to full-scale, and is fully strengthening environmental pollution control.
Although downward pressure on the economy has appeared, the Chinese Ministry of Environmental Protection has clearly stated before that China should properly handle the positioning of environmental protection in economic development and enhance its “green positioning”. The more the economy is growing downward, the more it cannot relax environmental protection and play its role of environmental protection optimizing the economy.

Half an hour later, the burnt sweet potatoes were eaten by a pair of hands that had not been washed.
Dai Jie sat on the mud - she had no furniture, and it was her place to do everyday household chores, such as washing clothes, and the washing water was turbulent, all from nearby swamps.
A room without a roof holds a bucket, which is an outdoor toilet.
She was the youngest of her husband's four wives, so she was not assigned to the fields.
Polygamy is common here.
Of course it's dangerous to work late: most men in the village don't work, and many are drunk, plus there are many soldiers here.
She said, “No one dares to walk in the village after 5 pm.”
This is a rare glimpse of the daily life of the Papuan Highlands, which was once a Dutch colony and incorporated into Indonesia after the referendum of 1969, but which was also controversial when only 1026 elders were forced to vote by show of hands before the army occupying the land.
The current campaign for independence and opposition to Dutch rule had soon again targeted the Jakarta Government, which had oppressed the region and isolated foreign journalists and defenders.
In 2003, the province was formally divided into Papua and West Papua, while Papua New Guinea took independent control of the eastern part of the island.
Enarotti is remotely located and deserted; it takes a 90-minute flight from the provincial capital of Jayapura to Nabil, then rented a car for 5 hours and overturned the sea in the stomach.
There is no public transport here.
In this town of approximately 19,000 people, the chalets are surrounded by bamboo fences and the ruffled iron roofs are covered with a variety of brown pieces made of iron rust.
Very few Indonesians come, let alone journalists, and there are few foreigners.
Before the Christian preacher came, the Mee Pago Papuans believed in a god called Uga Tamee.
There are other changes here.
Dai Jie said, “We can't get used to these clothes.” She refers to her brilliant hand-woven turban, dark shirt and bright half-skirt.
“We used to only cover our bodies with leaves.”
Papua is the poorest province in Indonesia, where 28 per cent of the population lives below the poverty line and is the region with the highest infant mortality rate and the lowest literacy rate in Asia.
But this is also Indonesia's Jinzhou.
Paniai County is high and is approximately the same size as New Jersey, with 153,000 people. The world's largest and most profitable gold mine, Glasberg, is only 60 miles away and is owned by Filip McMolan Copper Gold, headquartered in Phoenix.
In 2015 alone, Phillips mined about $3.1 billion worth of gold and copper mines.
In addition, Papua is rich in timber resources, estimated at $78 billion.
However, these rich resources are also the source of the tragedy of the Papuans, and that is why powerful Indonesian military forces have been able to suppress them.
A 2005 New York Times investigation revealed that Phillips paid nearly $20 million to local military personnel and troops between 1998 and 2004, up to $150,000 for a single official.
The increasingly strong demands of the Papuans for independence threatened the golden lord and subjected them to cruel treatment.
According to defenders, more than half a million Papuans have been killed since 1969 and thousands have been raped, tortured and detained by the Indonesian army.
According to AHRC, the mass killings in the Papuan tribal highlands in the 1970s had escalated to genocide.
Last year alone, Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful protesters.
A report by the Catholic Archdiocese of Brisbane in 2016, “We will lose everything”, includes evidence of the most notorious acts of the previous year, such as extrajudicial executions, torture - and, according to another, rapes and xing - and brutal repression of peaceful demonstrations.
Andrias Harsono, Indonesian researcher for Human Rights Watch, said, “Violence occurs every day, making it difficult to calculate the number of victims.”
Papuan's resources attracted large numbers of immigrants outside Indonesia, and oppression began.
Eighty-three per cent of the 3.5 million people in the province are Christians, but the demographic structure of Muslim economic migrants has changed since their arrival from densely populated Java, Kalimantan, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Javanese snack stalls sell fried chicken and vegetables mixed with Gadodo, with peanut butter.
The locals worked hard to fight.
The 24-year-old Paniai locals, Aposi Yu, moved to the provincial capital of Jayapura to find work, explaining that “those immigrants began selling chicken and vegetables in traditional markets at lower prices than the local Papuans.
This left local Papuans - the Papuans (mama-mama) - without their markets.”
Indonesian President Zoko Widodo (often referred to as Zokovi) vowed at his 2014 campaign to address inequalities and abuses in Papua.
The former carpenter's road to the Jakarta presidential palace is supported in 27 of all 29 districts - including Paniai.
But Papua has not changed anything, and today the locals feel betrayed.
Yu said, “We have broken our hearts and we voted for Zokovic in 2014, hoping that he will fulfill our wish to restore fairness.”
In fact, just two months after Zokovi took office in October, Paniai had the worst nightmare.
On December 7, 2014, 11 children from Ernalotali sang Christmas in front of an outside bonfire, and two Indonesian soldiers suddenly rushed over on a motorcycle.
The shocked kids told them they should turn on the headlamp.
According to the local priest, Avette Tibaie, one of the soldiers was dissatisfied with their tone and then returned with four soldiers.
The victims and witnesses claimed that the drunk soldiers had chased the children with their guns.
One of the soldiers then opened fire on the children.
16-year-old Yuliannus Yemon was unconscious because he was severely beaten.
A few hours later, a fire broke out in the electoral commission building of the nearby government agency, and the incident escalated the following day.
Approximately 1,000 young Papuan men, women and children gathered in a football field in front of the local police and military command centres to demand justice.
With a ritual hunting bow, they danced the waita dance of the Babua Mee Pago tribe - running around and imitating birds.
Some protesters began throwing stones at regular military posts.
According to an official document seen by Time magazine, when emotions continue to intensify, soldiers receive orders via internal radio: “If the crowd resists more than three times, shoot immediately.” However, the document was not published to the local media.
56-year-old Yérémias Kayamu, the leader of the Kego Koto neighbourhood of Ernalotali, felt the imminent danger, and called on the crowd to calm down and pleaded for them to return home.
But nobody hears him.
He stood on the porch of his bright chalet and told Time magazine, “When I came back, my left wrist suddenly got shot.”
Kayamu still does not know who fired the gun, but he said the bullets came from a group of soldiers.
He added, “It was very crowded, they fired a lot of guns.”
According to the cousin of the locals, Wolfyus Juul, he witnessed the shooting and saw Wolfyus Juul shot three times.
Juhanes sadly told Time magazine, “I ran over to check his body to see if he wasn't.
I found him dead... and I kissed him.”
Inspector General of the Papua Police, Chuoje Mendé, told reporters that his subordinates were only in the “protection” police station because the police station had been attacked.
In 2015, Phuket Sulistio, the spokesman for the Papua police, said, “When someone threatens to kill us, we must defend ourselves.
This is about life and death.”
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and many more injured.
The news of the killing the next day only slowly spread in Jakarta.
Three weeks later, Zokovi gave a loud speech in Jayapura, expressing deep sympathy to the families of the victims and pledging to address the abusive legacy of Papua.
He said, “I hope this case can be resolved as soon as possible so that this will not happen again in the future.”
In October 2016, Security Minister Vilando said he wanted to establish a non-judicial mechanism to address the historical legacy of human rights violations.
But the excuses for extrapolation were almost immediately sounded.
He said, “Most of the violations occurred a long time ago.
Some were in the 1990s and early 2000s.
The point is that we are committed to addressing these violations, but this will require a process.”
Then, on June 5 in Jakarta, Vilando remarked in his conversation with Time magazine, saying he had no plans to establish a complaints mechanism in Papua.
Instead, he said, “Everything will be resolved in accordance with the law.”
The United Nations had filed a complaint against Vilando for “human rights crimes” in the 1999 bloody independence poll in East Timor, but he said 11 human rights violations had been resolved in the Papua region, including the Paniai incident.
The families of the victims of the Paniai incident scorned these statements.
“In the past three years, I have been interviewed four times, but things have not progressed at all,” said Juhanes.
Years later, he said, “I'm tired.”
He still lives in fear.
He said, “I am afraid.
I was afraid of being arrested by the army and of being shot.”
His brother Yukabus also believed that the people of Paniai were afraid to talk about the incident.
He stated that he had been beaten by the military after helping to bury the four victims.
He said, “After the body was buried, the military came to me.”
The shooting did not stop.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police shot villagers in Deye County, Pani Neighbor County.
A manager of a construction company refused to help transport a coma man to the hospital, and clashes broke out between the two sides, one person was killed and 17 others were injured, including children.
A 24-year-old man, Vianus Doviu, drowned while fishing near the river and died on his way to the hospital.
Angry villagers protested in front of the company's live office.
The police said the villagers threw stones at the police, so the police fired warning shots.
However, riot control mobile units (Indonesian paramilitary police) began shooting at the crowd and one person was killed.
The 29-year-old Domingo Badi told Time magazine, “We were all panicked, and now we're afraid they'll retaliate.” He lived near the hospital when he saw the wounded being rushed to hospital.
“I was hiding at home for two days.”
The Deyayi Parliament has called for the police involved to be brought to justice and for riot control mobile units to be withdrawn from the area.
Paniai has always been a place for the Indonesian government.
The lack of effective development has fuelled the discontent of the people of the Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal tribes, which are scattered in the lush central highlands of Paniai.
Many joined the Free Papua Movement (OPM), a rebel army claiming to protect the rights of Papuans through scattered attacks and raids on Indonesian soldiers.
The senior leadership of the Partial Free Papua Movement was born in Paniai, including Tadius Yugi and Daniel Yudas Kogaya.
As a result, in recent years thousands of Paniai have been arrested by the military under the guise of “defending national sovereignty” and deliberately detained.
Some have never appeared again.
In the eyes of Papuans, Paniai is a “forgotten tragedy.”
Poverty breeds dissatisfaction.
The rice sold by Ernalotti is so poor that the locals cannot afford it.
The bread is simply out of reach.
People here grow everything they can eat: mainly sweet potatoes and some fruit and leaf vegetables.
Farming is a woman's job, and each woman can take care of four or five cassava plots.
They usually keep most of the harvest for their own use and the rest for sale on the local market.
Ten pieces of sweet potatoes are worth only 10 thousand Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Over time, economic inequality has been unfolding among local Papuans and new immigrants, and the number of these immigrants has increased significantly since the opening of the new route to Nabirai airport.
The few jobs available are usually in the hands of better educated and wealthier migrants.
Papuans seldom have the capital or the necessary skills to run competitive companies.
“Young people do not want to stay in this village... because there is no job and no money.”
Papua is isolated from the world.
In addition, restrictions on international media coverage remain tight.
Earlier this year, French journalists Frank Escudy and Basel Longchamp were expelled from Papua because they “did not cooperate with the relevant agencies”, even though they had rarely been authorized to shoot.
According to Felim Kane, Deputy Director of Human Rights Watch Asia, Zokovi's election pledge to lift reporting restrictions to promote transparency and development was not fulfilled.
In a statement, he said, “If foreign reporters try to report on Papua and West Papua, the most disaffected province in Indonesia, they are at new risk: denial of visas and blacklisting.”
The absence of media supervision meant that international pressure on the Indonesian Government was largely confined to Papua's neighbours.
In March, six Pacific countries - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands, Solomon Islands - called on the United Nations Human Rights Council to investigate “widespread human rights violations” in Papua, including the Paniai shooting.
These countries have also supported the Free Papua Movement.
Indonesian Foreign Ministry Spokesman Almanata Nassir cares nothing about the charges against the group, telling Jakarta's reporter that “Indonesia is still democratic and free of the media, so evidence of human rights violations is difficult to hide.”
The locals want more attention from foreign governments.
According to an informed source, on May 4, during a delegation of officials led by Dutch human rights ambassador Kais Van Bar, the local people broke the silence and plead “We want freedom.” He also attended the meeting, but asked for anonymity.
Indonesia will hold the next presidential election in 2019, but Papuans say they are unlikely to return to Zokovi.
“Zokovi's intentions were good, but he was surrounded by people involved in the Paniai shooting,” said Gobai, chairman of the Tribal Council.
He wanted Zokovi to know that the people of Paniai were not only living under the threat of greedy armies, but were also destitute, a region with little education and a lack of public health services.
Gobai said that the Paniai people, like other Papuans, believed that their vote for Zokovi was a debt that he had to pay.
He said, “They don't need money, they need justice.”
Even under threat and intimidation, the families of the victims of the Paniai shooting made their last symbolic resistance: the body of a victim was buried opposite the military police post.
They know that justice may never come, but at least they will not let those responsible forget their crimes.
Yuca Bus bow up and said, “My family was killed.
What else can we do?”

According to Reuters, Beijing time, Samsung Electronics announced on Tuesday the first auto-car components developed jointly with Harman International, as well as infotainment solutions, which are important initiatives for the company to enter the electronic market for vehicles.
Samsung Electronics acquired HARMAN International about a year ago.
At the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas this week, Samsung released car cameras with collision alerts, driveway offset alerts, cruise control functions, which were developed in collaboration with Haman.
Samsung plans to start shipping this year this camera system, which is built in machine automatic learning and augmentation realm and other technologies.
Samsung also shows the “digital cockpit”, even if the driver is not the owner of the car, it can also make the vehicle more personalized, because the system allows users to download the driver's profile from mobile devices and the cloud.
Tonight, the 20th round of CBA's regular tournament is about to start, which also means the second half of the 2016 - 2017 season's CBA League.
The torch swallowed Dubai's Torch Tower again.
On Friday, a fire broke out in one of Dubai's highest residential buildings in the world, forcing hundreds of residents to flee the high-rise building, 337 meters tall and 79 floors.
This is the second fire that sweeps through high-rise buildings in just two years, and it happens to be the skyscraper called the Torch.
The building has been evacuated and no injuries have been reported. The cause of the fire has not yet been identified.
“We were sleeping, and then we were awakened by fire, and people started screaming.
We ran down the stairs and it took about 10 minutes to get down from the 50th floor,” a resident named George told Reuters.
According to the civil defence authorities in Dubai, the fire brigade extinguished the fire around 4 p.m. local time (GMT 0000) and was in the process of cooling the building.
The Government indicated that efforts were being made to provide safe haven for those affected.
The accident could once again raise worldwide concerns about the safety of the use of exterior materials in high-rise buildings.
A survey conducted by the management of the Torch Skyscraper in the aftermath of its 2015 fire found that most of the damaged objects were covered with overlay panels for decoration and insulation.
The British police have indicated that they believe that the problem of insulation and overlay systems in the London Glenfield building may be the cause of the rapid spread of the June fire, which killed about 80 people.
The Williams convoy also suggested that Massa might return, even though he had announced his retirement.
On January 9, just one month away from the opening of the PyeongChang Winter Olympic Games in Korea, Korea's domestic Winter Olympic atmosphere is becoming more and more intense with the warm-up and preparations for the Olympic torch from the south to the north.
South Korean public opinion looks forward to this long-running inter-Korean talks, which will bring an “egg” to PyeongChang for a month in the countdown to the Olympic Winter Games.
On November 1 last year, PyeongChang Olympic torch arrived in South Korea.
The heat of the fire was directly reflected in the sale of tickets at the PyeongChang Winter Olympic Games.
Just over two months ago, the ticket sales rate for the PyeongChang Winter Olympic Games remained only hovering at 32%. The ticket sales rate for the Winter Paralympic Games was only 4.3%. The low ticket sales rate once worried the popularity of the PyeongChang Olympic Games.
However, as Chairman Li Xipan of the Organizing Committee of the PyeongChang Winter Olympic Games predicted to reporters a while ago, “With the torch of the Winter Olympic Games passing across South Korea, the heat of the Winter Olympic Games is increasing, and I believe that ticket sales will soon improve.”
According to South Korean media reports, as of January 3, the ticket sales for the PyeongChang Winter Olympic Games had reached 64% and the ticket sales for the Winter Paralympic Games exceeded 50%.
To encourage foreigners to go to Korea to watch the tournament, the South Korean Ministry of Justice also announced on the 8th that foreigners visiting South Korea to watch the PyeongChang Winter Olympics will be allowed to stay in South Korea for up to 120 days.
The investigation found that more than one fifth of U.S. travelers boarded with prohibited items
A survey of aircraft passengers found that more than 20 per cent of passengers had boarded, intentionally or inadvertently, with illegal items through United States Transportation Security Service checkpoints, and at least 6 per cent of them had boarded the aircraft unintentionally with prohibited knives or other blades.
Less than 1 per cent of passengers declared that they had discovered a trip with firearms, ammunition or explosives after the fact.
This survey of over 1000 people was conducted by the charter services company Stratos Jet Charters Inc. The survey also found that young travellers were more likely to blatantly disregard regulations.
Of the respondents who admitted that they had attempted to board with TSA contraband on purpose, 19.7% were Millenium, compared to less than 15% of the X-generation population.
The most common items that deliberately slipped through TSA security agents were food and beverages.
More than 3% of the respondents admitted that they had knowingly carried blade, while 2.2% of the female respondents and 3.7% of the male respondents also indicated that they had knowingly carried prohibited drugs on board.
The company stated that the purpose of the survey was to obtain information on the number of people who accidentally carried and knowingly carried embargoed goods across the aircraft.
It is not surprising that those most likely to carry embargoed goods through security - intentionally or unintentionally - are those who fly most frequently.
However, the company notes that the TSA Guide is a bit complicated and difficult to understand.
It is often uncertain what kind and how many liquids can be carried.
Therefore, it is not surprising that TSA has seized the most contraband liquid.
It was thought at one point that TSA might have used books as embargoed.
Liquids are permitted on domestic flights, but not on international flights.
US Environmental Protection Agency Director Prutt changed his mind about the abatement regulations of the Obama era
One day after being indicted by 15 states, Environmental Protection Agency Director Scott Pruter changed his earlier decision to postpone the implementation of the Obama-era regulation to reduce emissions of smoke air pollutants.
Pruter proposed this change because the Environmental Protection Agency was able to respond more quickly than the previous Government to the needs of the environmental regulatory state bodies.
He did not mention the legal challenges raised by the Federal Court of Appeal against his predecessor.
The controversy focused on setting the October 1 deadline for states to start meeting the 2015 ground ozone standards.
In June, Prudt announced that he would delay compliance for one year in order to give the Environmental Protection Agency more time to study the plan and avoid “interfering with local decision-making or impeding economic growth”.
Prior to his appointment by President Donald Trump, Prudt was the Attorney General of Oklahoma and had long opposed the tightening of environmental regulations.
Since arriving in Washington, Prudt has repeatedly shifted to prevent or delay the chemical and fossil fuel industry's opposition to the regulations.
The sudden turnaround on Wednesday was one of the most recent legal obstacles on the Prut regulatory rollover agenda.
Last month, the Federal Court of Appeal in Washington ruled that the Director of the Environmental Protection Agency had exceeded his authority in an attempt to delay the implementation of the Obama Administration's request to oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce the leakage of methane.
In a statement released on Wednesday night, Prudt made a big shift in his attitude towards ozone standards, expressing his commitment to strengthening the Environmental Protection Agency, working with the states and adopting complex procedures to reach new standards.
Prout said, “Under the previous government administration, the EPA usually does not meet the specified deadline, and then wait for radical groups and others to sue before agreeing to set the specified timetable by agreement.” In his previous work, he had initiated more than a dozen prosecutions against the Environmental Protection Agency.
“We do not believe in regulation through litigation, and we take deadlines seriously.
We also take regulations and authorities seriously.”
Nevertheless, the EPA statement said that Prudt may again use his “extension authorization and all other legally available authorizations” to ensure that the regulations comply with “good policies and best available information”.
Republicans in Congress are pushing for wide-scale redrafting of ozone regulations.
The House Bill approved last month is intended to delay the implementation of the 2015 rule by at least eight years.
This measure has not yet been voted on in the Senate.
New York State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman led state alliances this week to sue US EPA for its intention to maintain legal pressure.
Schneiderman said: “The reversal of the US EPA - after we filed a lawsuit - is a significant victory for the health and safety of 67,000 New Yorkers, with communities of over 115 million Americans directly affected by smoke emissions.”
The States of California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington, as well as the District of Columbia joined the state of New York in this case.
Ground ozone is formed by the reaction of common pollutants from automobiles, power plants, refineries, chemical plants and other sources in the atmosphere under sunlight.
The resulting smoke can cause severe respiratory problems for sensitive populations, causing thousands of premature deaths each year.
Of course, public health advocates and environmentalists hail the surprising transformation of Prudt.
“It is disturbing that this common sense measure has come under great pressure from the head of the department that protects the air we need to breathe,” said Lori Ann Bird of the Biodiversity Center.
“We have to fight the Trump government for the ideological movement that caters to the polluters and special interest groups.”
In addition to the external factors of steel price recovery, enterprises are also struggling to reduce costs.

Since the second half of 2009, Xiaoshan Flower Wood sales (volume) have maintained a high trend, especially this spring, Xiaoshan Miao Wood sales have reached a record high, sales have increased significantly and prices have risen sharply. According to statistics, the revenue from Miao Wood sales in the Xiaoshan District in January-June this year increased 48% over the same period last year, with an increase of nearly 20 years.
Xiaoshan Forestry Bureau Deputy Director Shi Hai-yong said that with the good sales situation, Xiaoshan flower wood production has also made faster progress.
In the past two years, Xiaoshan Flower Wood has grown by 30,000 acres, with a total area of 180,000 acres. At the same time, Xiaoshan Miao Fong has actively developed outside the region, and has established a flower-wood base in various parts of the country to 80,000 acres, an increase of 30,000 acres over 2008.
While growing areas, the quality of seedlings is constantly improving, the value of nursery storage is constantly increasing, large-scale and high-quality seedlings are retained more, and some seedlings are sold.
Shi Hai-yong also warned that in the face of the current boom in production and sales, producers should be cool-headed and objective in their analysis, both to see that society's demand for flowers will be long-term and increasing, and also to realize that market competition will be more intense.
On the morning of July 13, Beijing time, Somaltus filed a lawsuit with the Eastern Texas District Court alleging that Apple had violated a battery technology patent it had applied for in 2010.
The company had previously sued ASUS, Lenovo, Samsung, Sony and Toshiba with the same patent.
The action claimed that iPhone 6s and similar appliances violated US patent No. 7,657,386, entitled Integrated Battery Service System.
The plaintiff sought cash compensation or a patent fee was charged for the tort equipment after the judgement was pronounced.
Judging from the indictment, the plaintiff appeared to believe that iPhone's fast-filling function violated the company's patent.
The fast-charging iPhone quickly charges up to 80% of the power before it trickle down.
Somaltus is a so-called “patent hooligan” because the company does not offer obvious products and services and it is difficult to find information online.
However, they have successfully settled the patent out of court with automobile manufacturers such as Ford and Nissan.
The conference held that it is important to accelerate the development of informatization, promote the integration and efficient use of resources, increase the digital and intelligent level of industry, promote “China Manufacturing 2025” and mass entrepreneurship and innovation, and foster new dynamic energy and improve the quality of life of the people.

According to the leaked telephone records, Trump put pressure on Mexico to pay for the construction of the border wall
The Washington Post leaked US President Donald? Record of calls between Trump and Mexican and Australian leaders.
On 27 January, in a call to the President of Mexico, Henrique Pena Nieto, Trump urged him to stop publicly stating that he would not pay for the proposed border wall.
According to reports, the President of the United States expressed his dissatisfaction with his public criticism of the wall, and it was alleged that Pratran had said to him, “Do not tell the media.”
Trump made a commitment during the presidential campaign to build the wall along the southern border of the United States and solemnly announced that Mexico would pay for the project.
A record of the conversation between him and Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull was also published, which showed a tense exchange between them.
Trump told Turnbull that it was “ridiculous”, “annoying” and “foolish” for the United States to assume the deal for the repatriation of refugees to Australia. He had suggested that the United States ban the resettlement of refugees, and now insisted on the deal under Obama's good offices, which would make him look like a “fool”.
Trump hung up after telling Turnbull that it was the most unpleasant call today.

Xinhua News Agency report of January 9 from Seoul (by staff reporter Lu Rui Geng Xuepeng) - South Korea and North Korea concluded high-level talks at Panmunjom on the evening of the 9th. Both sides issued a joint statement to reach agreement on North Korea's participation in the PyeongChang Winter Olympic Games and the holding of military sector talks between the two sides.
According to a joint statement issued by the two sides, the DPRK will send a high-level delegation and a delegation from the National Olympic Committee to participate in the PyeongChang Winter Olympics.
In addition, the North Korean side will dispatch teams of athletes, cheerleaders, art groups and journalists to visit South Korea; the South Korean side will provide necessary facilities for this.

Moorbeach tragedy: activists reproduce racist lynchings and justice
A Ford Mercury car in 1948 crossed a crowd of spectators across the town of Monroe, Georgia, heading towards the little Moore Beach Bridge.
Four black passengers and a white driver were on board, and before the vehicle arrived at the bridge, a group of white men with guns went forward and blocked the way forward.
The head of the mob - a middle-aged man in a fine striped suit - sucked a cigar deep and glimpsed into the windshield.
The passengers in the car are full of fear.
“We want - Roger!” The man shouted.
“Drag him out of the car!”
A young black man was dragged down from the front passenger seat and screamed in silence.
Fortunately, this terrible scene on July 22 is just a repetition.
But when “Roger”'s neck was covered, almost all of the spectators were really breathing.
Since 2005, civil rights activists have returned to the Moore Beach Bridge to recreate the scenes of two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcoln and George and Méré Dossi - hanged by three K parties in 1946.
No one has ever been accused of murder.
“Although we know who they are, and we have seen them in the community, it is incredible that none of them have been arrested over the years,” said Tyron Brooks, who helped organize this replay.
“This is a stain on history, a burden on our souls.”
Brooks, 71, is a former member of Parliament and a lifelong defender in Georgia.
For him, repetition was a remarkable call to action, reminding the people of the Monroe community every year that injustice had never been corrected.
“We want to prosecute, we want to close the case, we want to heal, we want to reconcile, but we have to get justice first,” he says.
“Unless we get justice, we will not be cured and reconciled.”
On July 27, 1946, the coroner placed sheets on the body of a mob victim.
According to FBI files obtained by NBC News, more than 50 men from Monroe and surrounding counties are suspected of involvement in lynching.
None of them, however, has been prosecuted.
Although the number of suspects has remained at large for 10 years, civil rights activists have stated that the dual motive for lynching is well known throughout the town: political and sexual.
In April 1946, a Supreme Court decision allowed black citizens of Georgia to vote for the first time in a preliminary election later that summer.
According to the FBI, at about the same time, the black tenant Roger Malcolm stabbed the white landlord Barnett Hestt in a struggle - looks like it was for a woman.
Brooks said the rumors in town were that Herst slept with Malcolm's wife Dorothy, and her baby was not her husband's.
According to the FBI, on July 25, 1946, the prominent white landlord, Loi Harrison, spent $600 to release Malcolm on bail.
Dorothy and his cousin, Mike Merry and George Dorsi, accompanied him to prison.
However, as they came back from the prison to the Moore Beach Bridge, a group of mob mob surrounded the car.
“It turns out that Harrison organized and ordered the murder,” a FBI report came to this conclusion.
“It is clear that there is a conspiracy between state and local law enforcement authorities, who not only participated in the murder, destroyed evidence, but also concealed the identity of witnesses.”
Brooks is very succinct.
He said, “This is a vote tragedy.”
“They were murdered, and the killer sent a message to the black people in this community: 'If you register and vote, you will suffer the same ending.”'
For nearly a decade, Cassandra Green has been in charge of leading the annual resurrection of the mob crime at the Moore Beach Bridge.
Her expressive modus operandi is well-known and dehumanizing, with a deep racist background. Many hoped that such racism would cease to exist in the United States.
It's hard to see, not to look harder, but Green says that's the key.
“We don't want to talk about lynchings, because lynchings make us face the ugly face of all,” she says.
“But I can't have a relationship with you if you don't listen to me or hear me tell my story.”
This year's performance started in June with nearly 30 actors on the first day - dozens of white and the rest black - squeezing into a room and listening to Greene's rehearsal show overview.
Wade Malbaud was co-director of Green.
He has been playing the role of the Three K Party for many years, but he says this role is never easy.
“I feel dirty because I'm not such a person,” said Malbauer.
“But I think it's important to keep this history alive because we don't want to go back to that era.”
In the room, playing Roger Malcolm and Barnett Hurst actors Darius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona rehearsed their lines.
At the beginning of the play, Malcolm shouted and pushed Herst out, and was angry that he slept with his wife Dorothy.
“I said, get out of my land!”
Las Kona responded.
Then they beat up.
Then everyone (at least all black actors) erupted laughter.
Greene smiled the most.
“What happened?! ,” said Laskona.
He was panicked and confused.
Am I too much?
“No,” said Green laughing.
“I just don't think white people would say 'ah' when they hit back.”
“Yes,” another black actor playing fun.
“Your tone must be tough.”
So the energy in the room changes; the feeling of love drives away the feeling of discomfort.
Everyone tried to do so not only to perform the show, but also to honour the four victims.
The scene starts again.
This time, when Laskona said the word “ah”, the tone was sharp and strong.
No one laughs.
It has come to an end with vigor and speed.
Screams, gunshots, then, a silence.
A woman in a funeral black dress stood next to the actor, singing Billy Harudé's mourning words “strange fruit”.
Her voice pressed over other words.
A hundred yards away, about 40 viewers wipe sweat and tears constantly.
Black and white people make up almost half of the audience.
There was a couple of special shows from Ithaca, New York, and many people lived near the road.
Brooks took them to Marcom and Dorothy's cemetery to worship for nearly eight hours, and everyone was enduring Georgia's unpleasant moisture.
Until then, the murderer remained a fan. But now, standing on the same land where lynching occurs, the air is filled with anxiety.
When the final notes of the song disappeared, Greene invited people to come closer to examine the bodies played by the actor.
The children leaned down and watched fake blood and bodies, whispering each other.
“They're not really dead,” a little boy mumbled as if he was reminding himself.
A few minutes later, Greene thanked the crowd, and then the show ended.
Actors shake off the lynchings and wipe out tears.
Bradshaw embraced the suit man Malbao, who played three K party leaders.
Nick Lascona embraced his two colleagues and cried in their arms; the emotions of the show eventually infected him.
“It's okay,” one of the women whisper.
“We know that your heart is not like this.
You do this for a reason.”
After that, the audience sat down and had dinner with the actors.
At the same table, a white couple from Atlanta had a close conversation with a black couple they had just met and talked about replay.
Dennis Dopinski was hard to find words to describe how she felt after watching.
“It's hard to imagine those horrible words and acts... that people like you say and do, because they look like you,” she says.
“For me, it really makes me think that lynchings are still going on,” she added. “Now this kind of thing is called police shootings.”
In the room, Tyron Brooks sat at the table to watch, taste and taste the rights of citizens.
He said he had already started planning next year's performance.
“Replay is an inspiring way, because it describes the horror we have experienced, but it is also very educational,” he says.
“If you don't learn from it, this may happen again.
Those who do not study, do not know their history are doomed to repeat it.”
For gas market reform, the importance of reform in the area of “network independence” is self-evident, but resistance and controversy are also high.
The reporter learned on the 7th from the Hebei Kailang Group that at 11.25 a.m. on the 7th there was an explosion in the emulsification workshop of Kailin Group Chemical Co., Ltd., located in Tangshan City, Hebei Province, where 13 operators were trapped.
To date, one of the 13 people stranded has been rescued by first aid to the hospital, while the remaining 12 are under intense search and rescue.
It is understood that at present the scene has been blocked, local public security, fire protection, medical and other departments are on site rescue.
According to eyewitnesses, the incident occurred with a loud noise, and a mushroom clouds became empty in an instant.
According to Kailun Group personnel who organised the search and rescue on the site, Tangshan Kaifeng Chemical Co., Ltd. is located in Zhao Guozhuang, Guyi District, Tangshan City, Hebei Province. It is a state-approved civilian explosive device targeting production enterprise, which was established in 1958 and originally named Kailun Mining Bureau No. 62 factory.

US media: Chinese Air Force Engineering University scientists study laser satellites for the removal of space debris
The reference news network reported on January 18 that the US media said that Chinese scientists had made a bold and innovative proposal to clean up the chaotic Earth orbit using large lasers, destroying old satellites and their skyscrapers.
As reported on January 15 on the website of the United States Newsweek, researchers at the Chinese Air Force Engineering University wrote a paper entitled “Space-based laser clearance small-scale space debris deorbit modelling”, which describes how space debris can be irradiated by lasers into smaller, less hazardous debris through the use of space-based platform lasers.
According to the report, space debris has been a concern of international space agencies for many years, and NASA has considered various options for tracking, detecting and removing artificial debris.
Modalities for clearing large-scale space debris include mega-nets for cleaning and collecting waste and magnets that can be used to suck them out of orbit. Chinese scientists conducted a laser simulation study and concluded that this would be an effective way to clean up the Earth's orbit.
“(simulation studies) provide the necessary theoretical basis for the application of space debris laser removal technologies for space-based platforms,” said a summary of the paper.
A 2014 study by the United States defence giant Lockheed-Martin found that there were approximately 200 threats per day for satellites in orbit.
High-velocity debris moving along Earth orbit is considered a serious threat to future space missions, described by ESA experts as a “deadly chain of threats”. Every year in the past, high-speed debris has been increasing.
In addition, according to a report from the website of the American monthly Volkswagen Machinery on January 17, space is basically empty, but space adjacent to the Earth is becoming increasingly crowded. Every satellite we send into space will eventually become another piece of debris that runs around the Earth and that will accumulate over time.
The more fragments there are, the higher the probability that a satellite still in normal operation will be hit by fragments, thus damaging or destroying an investment worth millions of dollars.
The report said that all space agencies have plans to remove space debris in the future.
NASA is considering reducing the rate of debris by injecting gas and deorbiting it, and Europe is considering launching a satellite with a large net, capturing debris and bringing it back to Earth. Japan's idea is to capture debris with an electric chain.
At present, China has also proposed a solution to space debris, namely, using a large laser to strike floating space debris into less harmful small debris.
According to a paper published by a group of researchers from the Chinese Air Force Engineering University in the German monthly Optical Journal, installing such a laser on a satellite would be sufficient to clean up space efficiently, at least as a result of simulations.
It was reported that the only way to confirm effectiveness was through testing, which was not currently scheduled, but perhaps sooner or later a laser would be installed on a satellite and then sent into space.
Once that has been done, we can finally begin to eliminate space debris once and for all.

United States National Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) litigation to overturn resolution and delay smoke regulation
At the time of his tenure, Obama had made provision for the states to contain all types of smoke emissions, and 15 states had prosecuted the United States National Environmental Protection Agency for that provision. One day after the indictment, the EPA overturned the provision.
The US EPA announced on Wednesday its decision to continue the so-called “2015 ozone compliance zone” and promised that EPA would work with the states.
“We are confident in dialogue with our national partners and are committed to responding to it,” said Scott Pruit, director of the US EPA.
In June, Pruit announced that EPA plans to postpone the implementation of the ozone-compliant zone standard for one year, until October 2018 - according to which existing smoke contamination in some areas is measured to determine which areas should be reduced to meet air quality standards.
The 15 major Democrat states and the District of Columbia filed a lawsuit on Tuesday, claiming that the act was illegal.
As part of a broader agenda, the authorities of President Donald Trump have been working to revive environmental regulations introduced by former President Barack Obama to stimulate economic growth.
However, these efforts triggered opposition from the Democratic Party and conservative groups. They fear that more emissions will affect public health.
The US EPA website claims that breathing ozone-containing air “reduces lung function and increases respiratory symptoms” such as asthma.

Mackie García and Vasily Lomachenko met for the first time to explore a possible future duel
The most striking boxing match of less than 147 pounds will be held shortly, and Vasily Lomachenko and Mackie García, currently in a potentially conflicting state, meet for the first time on Thursday.
In separate rooms at the ESPN office in Los Angeles, Garcia, the unbeaten World Boxing Council lightweight champion, spearheaded the corridor and paid tribute to Lomachenko, the world champion of boxing.
At the Showtime boxing tournament held on Saturday, the referees unanimously determined that Garcia defeated the quartile world champion Adrian Brona, and both boxers have become the top five players on the same heavyweight list.
Garcia stretched out his right hand and said, “Champion, how are you?
Good luck.”
On Saturday night at 7:00 p.m. in the ESPN competition, Lomachenko won over Miguel Mariaga and preserved his position.
When both of them took pictures, the Lomachenko agent, Eghis Climas, pointed out that the potential clash between the two players depended on “perfect size”.
“I was lightweight before,” said García.
“I raised the level against Battle Brona (140 pounds), but I did not weigh that much.
My weight is a little less than 140 pounds.
I want to go back to lightweight.
And he must be lightweight (135 pounds) before we can fight.
That's what fans want.
Then we meet them.”
Lomachenko agreed.
“The boxing industry needs this battle.”
Klimas asked if he should pay per view, part of his strategy was to have Lomachenko play a premiere contest with a 135-pound player later this year to set a date for next summer with Garcia (37-0,30). Garcia is also interested in fighting the winners of the war with Jorge Linares-Luke Campbell after the September 23 Forum Lightweight Fighting.
“Since all fans are asking this question, this fight may be pay-per-view,” said Garcia. After that, he was open to contest on the web offering the best financial solutions.
“We are the main characters.
Others are unlikely to generate such a level of attention.
As long as they're ready...”
Garcia appreciates that Lomachenko is a “great player” and may watch his Saturday boxing game live.
However, Lomachenko hesitated about García's praise, saying he believed that the three-part champion from Riverside looked “slow. Sorry, Mackie... you will be eliminated.”
García said the focus is to show the strength of the fist before boxing.
They all said they could feel the momentum of their boxing games.
“This is a necessary battle,
Attention and ratings are beyond the reach of other boxing competitions.
I'm very happy to participate,” said Garcia.
Lomachenko said: “I've been waiting for top fighters, and this time it's McGay.
This will be a great battle.”

The statement made by officials of the China Development and Reform Commission on the early completion of the 11th Five-Year Plan emission reduction target has given a strong expectation of reproduction to the steel industry, which is limited to electricity production.
Although the steel plant has not received a clear notification from the local government that the energy saving and emission reduction work has been completed, the industry estimates that around 15 December 2010, steel plants that were originally restricted in production will be re-produced and steel prices will begin to be pressurized.
No notice has yet been received of the end of the limited electricity production limit, but in fact the pressure of individual enterprises has been considerably smaller than in September and October, a private steel enterprise in Hebei Province told reporters.
Some parts of Hebei have repeatedly issued limited electricity production documents, and at one time used the method of forced zipping to restrict enterprise production.
The reporter learned from local enterprises that at present, steel factories in most parts of Hebei have resurrected their work, and the pressure to limit production has eased.
My steel mesh analyst Zhang Tishan predicts that the end demand for construction steel will gradually weaken from strength to strength due to the winter in the north.
In addition to the gradual end of energy saving and emission reduction, by December 15, most steel plants will basically reproduce, and products will arrive in various markets before New Year's Day.
The increase in the supply of resources will put pressure on steel prices, which are currently on the right track.

International Online News (Reporter Liu Zhao): On the 18th, the Economic and Commercial Department of the Italian Embassy in China held a China-Italy Environmental Fair, where people from enterprises and scientific institutions from both countries exchanged views on the new situation and reached a positive consensus on cooperation between the two countries in the field of renewable resources.
It is reported that the Chinese side is represented mainly by China Renewable Resources Development Co., Ltd., China International Technology Transfer Collaboration Network, and Italy is composed of institutions such as the Global Energy Environment Exchange and the Bologna Enterprise Federation of Italy.
The representative of Italy said that Italy has a variety of environmental protection technologies and solutions in the field of renewable resources. Italy proposes to carry out pilot projects with China in the areas of industrial waste disposal, waste oil treatment and waste incineration equipment, while looking forward to extending its environmental cooperation experience with China to other regions of the world.
Newly released results of the Swedish Asylum Assessment Test
Swedish asylum seekers tested using the latest methodology to assess their age medically, and the latest results showed that more than 80 per cent of the respondents were judged to be over 18 years of age, but not all believed in their accuracy.
Swedish National Centre for Forensic Medicine (R) ttsmedicinalverket) started this test earlier this year.
After being accused of failing to accurately assess the age of some of the refugees who claim to be minors, the Swedish Migration Board (Migrationsverket) designed these tests with a view to making a more accurate age assessment during the asylum process.
To date, the Swedish Immigration Service has sent 6880 testers, and the Forensic Centre has published the results of a total of 2481 testers for the period from mid-March to 31 July 2017.
80% (2002) were judged to be 18 years or older, but in another 25 tests, the Swedish National Forensic Centre determined that the subject “may be 18 years or older”.
In 432 tests, the result is that the person may be under 18 years of age.
The test is for people with questionable age only.
According to John Glansen of the Forensic Science Center, these results are consistent with those of the previous months.
He told The Local: “These data are not very different from the data of the previous months, and the figures are very consistent.”
The high proportion of cases where the age of conviction is 18 years or older does not necessarily mean that the asylum-seeker falsely reported his age.
In May, the Center published 581 test results and reported 442 “indicating that the subject is 18 years or older”.
The news newspaper Svenska Dagbladet surveyed the 581 test results released on this occasion and found that 243 of the respondents had publicly indicated that they would be 18 years or older this year.
An X-ray examination of the intelligence teeth, a nuclear magnetic resonance scan of the joints, followed by an analysis of the results by dentists and radiologists, was also questioned in some areas.
One of the skeptics was Claude Marcus, an endocrine at Caroline College, whose work included assessing people's biological maturity to determine whether they had undergone puberty earlier or later than their normal age.
He told the news newspaper Metro: “I have reason to think so, and I don't think the measurement used should be that way.
It is inaccurate to judge the biological age in such a way.
If we cannot guarantee accuracy, we should not pretend that we can.”
However, Granson of the Forensic Science Center defends the accuracy of these tests: “It is generally possible to say that there is little uncertainty about a child being an adult.”
The greatest risk is that the person is just under 18 years of age, which accounts for about 10 per cent.
Governor of West Virginia announces change of party
On Thursday night, West Virginia Democratic Governor Jim Justis announced at President Trump's rally that he would change the party.
“Like it or not, and the Democratic Party has left me,” said the governor's judge.
“Today, after a lot of prayers and a lot of thought, I want to tell you... today I will tell you in my West Virginia capacity that I can no longer help you as Democrat governor.”
The rally broke out with cheers.
“So tomorrow, I will change my membership to Republican,” Justis added.
“As a coach, I have to tell you it's time to start another game.”
Trump earlier promised to make a major announcement at a rally in West Virginia.
Mr. Trump won a 42% vote in West Virginia, and Justis didn't support Democratic candidate Hillary? Clinton.
According to Forbes, Justis was selected as the only billionaire in the state in 2016.
Forbes noted that he inherited his father's coal industry and owned coal mines in all five states.
His current price is approximately $1.59 billion.
Meanwhile, the Republican National Committee issued a statement on Thursday night, saying: “The change of Governor Justis is another blow to the Democratic Party, which will not prevent our country from becoming great again, but will make our country great again.”
“The Democratic Party currently has only 15 governors and has the lowest number of state assemblies in history, and the statement by the Governor of Justis is the latest rejection of such a political party that has lost leadership from top to bottom and cannot find a positive unified slogan”, Rona, female president of the Republican National Committee? McDaniel said in a statement to CBS news.

Sebastian Koh praised Russia's “frank” apology for the doping scandal
On Thursday, Sebastian Ko, president of the International Athletics Federation, expressed his appreciation for Russia's apology for the doping scandal and called it “frank”, but he reiterated that it was not the time for Russia to rejoin the campaign.
The President of the Russian Athletics Federation, Mitri Hilakdin, stated at the IAAF General Assembly on the eve of the World Athletics Championships that his country had been banned from participating in the campaign, and that he was determined to fight against stimulants.
“All athletes who won gold and silver medals in the tournament were deprived of their medals,” he said.
Despite his comments, the IAAF Assembly voted in favour of maintaining the ban. Previously, the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) reported the discovery of evidence of Russian State-sponsored doping, which was banned in November 2015.
“I think today's response was very candid and frank,” IAAF President Section told the reporter.
“The whole Council and the IAF General Assembly are very happy... The Russian Federation acknowledges that it has been through a period of great anxiety and is doing everything possible to ensure that Russia can rejoin the competition.”
Ko said he was also “happy” that Russia accepted the criteria for re-entry.
“I think this is a very constructive day, and I think we have made some progress, but the IAAF Assembly supports the recommendations of the panel, and this is not yet the time to reinstate Russia's candidacy,” Koh said.
“We need to do everything we can in the coming months to normalize this situation.
Our guiding principle has been the desire to separate clean athletes from contaminated systems,” he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes meet the strict IAAF standards and will participate as neutral players in the World Athletics Championships to be held in London on Friday.
Von Anderson, head of the IAAF panel, said on Monday that Russia has not yet met a number of criteria to resume its participation.
After speaking to the IAAF Council in London, he told reporters that drug testing was still inadequate and that banned coaches were still teaching.
At a publicity campaign held this morning on the first anniversary of the implementation of the Beijing Tobacco Control Regulations, youth student representatives who received the award for the “My Tobacco Control Declaration” national youth tobacco control microvideo interacted with the national tobacco control publicity ambassador, Huang Xuan, and reviewed the video of the solicitation event and the exhibition of the award-winning outstanding works.
The reporter learned from the event that the young actor Huang Xuan was hired as the national ambassador for tobacco control publicity.
Huang Xuan, who smoked since exposure to the university, successfully quit smoking after fully understanding the dangers of smoke. This time, he took on the role of the anti-smoking ambassador, calling on young people to stay away from tobacco.
The spectators wear the mask and become the general presence of ghosts in the story, which is the biggest game rule of “sleepless night”.
RMB middlevy 6.4401 depreciates at 66 base points, continuously rising temporarily
Macroeconomics Tencent Finance 2018-01-18 09:50 Share
Tencent Financial and Economic News on January 18, the RMB's median against the US dollar was 6.4401, and the median price depreciated 66 basis points on the previous trading day, ending the previous five consecutive increases.
The overnight market, the dollar warming, the dollar index came out of the V-word pattern, as at 07:30 Beijing time 90.8900.
The Fed released an economic brown book showing that almost all 12 Fed regions reported moderate to moderate growth in economic activity in early 2018, and remained optimistic about this year's prospects.
At the same time, unemployment in the United States remained at 4.1 per cent in December, the lowest since 2000, with enterprises expected to raise their wages in the coming months.
Fed officials generally consider tax reform to be a factor supporting this moderate economic outlook. The Fed forecasts an economic growth of 2.5% in 2018, with interest rates rising three times.
Market sources pointed out that in recent times, the European Central Bank's monetary policy tightened its expectations of pushing up the euro exchange rate. The US dollar index continued to decline.

After short-term fluctuations in the foreign exchange market, the RMB exchange rate will eventually return to the basic level.

How does the financial rules of the football community affect the transfer of Neymar to Paris?
The rules designed to prevent unrestricted spending by the European Jorge Club do not prevent Nemar from transferring from the Barcelona Club in Spain to the Paris San Germain Football Club (PSG) in France at record prices.
As a result, the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) further downgraded the Paris San Germain Football Club. The Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) is the governing body of European football matches and has the right to ban teams from participating in the popular UEFA Championship.
The Financial Fair Competition Rules (FFP) introduced by UEFA in 2011 meant that the Paris Saint-Germain Football Club had to prove that Nemal's transfer would be funded without a huge loss.
The Barcelona Club has already paid 222 million euros ($262 million) just to cover the cost of the Brazilian player's dissolution, while Nemal's salary will be tens of millions of dollars a year.
Below are some of the financial implications of Nemal's transfer to France.
Taking into account that the team is funded by the wealthy Qatari ruling family, the Paris St. Germain Football Club can, of course, contract Nemal in cash and integrate him into other star clouds.
Clubs can buy players with huge sums of money, but they must use legitimate sources of income to make up for the huge sums spent to balance their earnings and losses in football-related business.
The Financial Fair Competition Rules are made by Michelle? The idea presented by Michel Platini after his election as president of UEFA in 2007.
The former French player believes that for clubs that are heavily indebted for their success, if banks or owners withdraw their support funds, they are actually deceiving the club and putting it at risk of destruction.
In 2011, the focus of the Rules shifted from club debt to club loss monitoring.
This change means Rome? The business model used by Roman Abramovich to acquire the Chelsea Club in 2003, that is to say, buying a potential club, then spending a lot of money to improve the team and build a global brand, now faces a more demanding situation.
The club may lose Euro30 million in the three-year rule assessment period up to 2018.
Although Abu was devalued by the then president in 2015, the UEFA successor Alexander? Aleksander Ceferin remains committed to stopping excessive spending.
“Of course the Rules have not expired, and we will certainly strengthen the future regulations”, FIFA Andrew on Rules-related matters? Andrea Traverso told Associated Press last week.
Although the Paris San Germain Club will pay Nemal's buyout terms in a lump sum, it can also distribute amounts for accounting purposes during the contract period.
Nemal has signed a five-year agreement, so the transfer of dues may appear in the annual accounts for the next five years at a cost of EUR 44.4 million.
The first wave of rules sanctions imposed in 2014 resulted in the most severe sanctions being imposed on the Paris Saint Germain Football Club and the Manchester City Club of Abu Dhabi.
Paris Saint-Germain Football Club was fined 60 million euros ($82 million at the current rate), later reduced to 20 million euros and asked the team to reduce the number of players to 21 in the Champions League in the 2014-15 season instead of the normal 25 players.
UEFA is staring at clubs that try to increase income by linking up with club owners and deceiving financial regulators.
Although Qatari companies can sponsor the Paris Saint Germain Football Club, the UEFA does not consider it a legitimate income if the amount of the sponsorship is considered to exceed the standard market price.
This was what happened in 2014, when UEFA decided that the amount of Qatar Tourism's sponsorship of the Paris Saint Germain Football Club had been exaggerated.
It is reported that part of Nemal's income at the Paris Saint Germain Football Club may come from payments made by the Qatar World Cup Organizing Committee in 2022.
However, both the Paris Saint Germain Football Club and the organizing committee denied that Nemal would be World Cup ambassador and that it would be easy for the UEFA regulator to do so.
The recent sanctions imposed on the Paris Saint Germain Football Club mean that UEFA will be more vigilant against any attempt to circumvent the rules.
According to sources on Thursday, UEFA did not hold a pre-discussion with the Paris San Germain Football Club about Nemal's transfer.
All of the above-mentioned persons had contact with the Associated Press only in an unnamed capacity, as they were not authorized to discuss the status of the Paris San Germain Football Club.
The last published accounts show that the Paris San Germain Club earned 542.4 million euros in 2015-16 and earned more than 10 million euros.
The accounts for the previous fiscal year have not been disclosed.
The Paris Saint Germain Football Club anticipates that Nemal's membership will provide a gospel for sponsorship, franchise and jersey sales.
The club is expected to increase revenue by at least 30 per cent after signing Nemal.
Obviously, the Spanish League was outraged by the departure of the most famous players, trying to block that move by Nemal and claiming that the Paris San Germain Football Club violated the Rules.
Javier, president of the Spanish League? Tebas told the Spanish newspaper AS that “this is a clear example of a 'financial doping', the club and the country are the same”, referring to Qatar, which has ultimate ownership of the Paris San Germain Football Club.
Arsenal, coach of the Arsenal team (the club owner is the American sports tycoon)? Arsene Wenger has reservations about the state-funded clubs and the Spanish League.
“This is the consequence of ownership, which has completely changed the whole ecology of football over the past 15 years,” said Winger Thursday.
“Once the country has a club, everything will happen.
This will make it very difficult to comply with the Rules, because for a country there are many different ways or interests to ask big players to represent a country.”

The 3D co-animated film “Bean Fuji” held its premiere in Wuhan on the 25th. Zou Yu, director of “Bean Fuji”, and animated director of “Bean Fuji” Meng Wisdom.
The “legend of beans” is drawn from the story of Wang Liu An of the Han Dynasty and Huainan in China's traditional culture. The story of “Liu An as tofu, made by mistake”, tells the story of the owner's “beans fu” by a beans fantasy adult form, overcome serious difficulties and adhere to the dream of the fairies.

Director Zou Zheng disclosed that in the pre-film period, he had travelled to Wudang Mountain with the team of startups to introduce wind.
He said that the story of the “legend of beans” occurred during the years of the Wudi in West Han, against the backdrop of Huainan Wang Liu An Qian Dan Xixian, the film owner, “Bean Fu”, was an unexpectedly hallucinating adult-shaped beans when Liu An Shandan was present.

Nostalgic Infection Fluent Market - Harry Summer Camp and Detective Twin Hsiung
The story is remembered for the fantastic years of the '80s and the' 90s of garbage (before and after David Wayne and Michael Sewart sketch comedy for MTV), as well as for nostalgia itself, and for the year 2001, which was preceded by many unsung stars such as Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poller and Paul Road.Lifting water up.
As a cultural artwork, it is the imitation and embodiment of the permanent memories of our Facebook era.
But as a series, it feels like time is not enough.
The first day of Camp resonated strongly, but not only because of its absurd humor (the drama is about the original story of a talking vegetable canned, dubbing by H. Jon Benjamin).
Redoubling the use of the core laughter in the drama - middle-aged actors acting as good-time mistreated children - makes it a funny part of the inability to return to the past.
In “Ten Years Later”, adults actually play the role of adults, emotions are not too deeply entrenched, and imitation is more diffuse, including improvisation of movies tracked in the 1990s, such as “Hand of the Lullaby”.
At some point, a character is trapped in an apple notebook, some straight skates, and something else in 1991.
Many core stories are the same.
Sweetheart (Mr. Sugar) is now a novel, but he still hasn't forgotten Katie.
Victor (Ken Marino) still has a virgin.
There is another insidious plot involving Ronald Reagan (also played by Mr. Howard), instigated by George H. W. Bush (Michael Ian Blake).
As always, the best part of this series is interpolation.
It is particularly interesting to see this ever-young Mr. Luther, who shows off the soul patch of Matt Dillon in the movie “Single Nobles”, where Andy now feels like a giant.
This is a moment of random madness that may give impetus to this film, as if it were the recurring “Seven Years of Life” series, until I come to what I think is a logical conclusion: “Harry Summer Camp: Twenty Years Later”, the final act of which is to get the Kasr to see the premiere of the film “Harry Summer Camp”.

This is a wonderful idea.
But it's not just an idea.
There are some good visual gimmick (the police watch the time of chess on TV because Americans like to play football).
And there are many celebrity dubbing actors - including Jenny Slate, Nick O'Fman, Mahsala Hashbaz Ali and Kolo Sevini - who created a wonderful sound festival.
But Detective Shuangxiong is so committed to creating a bustle-and-bustle propaganda comedy - a killer with a head-on-Reagan mask - and it usually plays such a role.
This six-episode TV is slightly dragged, and comedy effects are not released quickly or frequently enough.
The director of Detective Twin-hsiung was edited more strictly, and during his repeated visits to the US embassy, Gregor and Etheef showed a better inflammatory effect, as there were always two fat wolves swallowing a bunch of burgers in the embassy lobby.

The reporter learned in a recent interview that the efficiency of the Northeast region's steel, rail transportation, ships and machinery manufacturing industries has generally declined and even suffered losses.
Some experts believe that under the current situation, the new round of Northeast Industrial Revitalization is not only related to the country's current economic recovery, but will also have an impact on the long-term development of our manufacturing industry and international competitiveness. Therefore, it is urgent to adjust the transition.
The general downturn in business performance in the traditional industry is even more a loss in the raw materials industry and the heavy machinery manufacturing industry. The significant downturn and even loss in efficiency in this round is the first manifestation of the economic downturn in the Middle East-North industry.
In the past, the economic downturn was mainly characterized by high impact on low-end and primary products, but in the current economic volatility, both high-end and low-end industrial products in North-East traditional industries were affected.
Saddle Steel Group (Weibo) began to restructure its products in previous years, focusing on the development of high-end panels such as container boards, steel tracks, shipboards and civilian appliances. However, sales of these varieties have dropped considerably this year, especially since the slabs sales fell 50% from the same period last year.
Angang Stocks (Director of the Metallurgy Division of the Liaoning Provincial Industry and Trust Commission, Hao Qingshun, said that metallurgy is the third largest pillar industry in Liaoning, with an annual output of 60 million tons of steel and iron production ranking third in the country.
In January-May this year, Liaoning Province produced 2.1.54 million tons of rough steel, and the production and sales of products required for projects with strong state policy encouragement and local government construction were relatively good, and the decline in products with strong market competition was a further characteristic of the northeast manufacturing industry.

Yang Yang, who had just undergone a right-ear surgery a few days ago, appeared for the first time after his injury. He interpreted his role as “fury does not take shape”. He always paid for nothing and kept all his feelings hidden in his heart.
Yang Yang said that he needed to mobilize his entire body to pass on the hidden grief of his role to the audience. “This is a new challenge for my performance. In the course of the performance, I really want to hold my internal wounds.”
Liu Yifi disclosed that he was simply “crying” when he was playing this movie, and once cried to collapse.
The Japanese Olympic Committee recently indicated that the Japanese delegation's gold goal for the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games was 30, and advanced to the top three gold medals.

Yesterday, the second session of the fourth Guang'an People's Congress was held in a simple manner.
Go into the Guang'an Convention and Exhibition Center, there are no slogans, no tea cups, and even a bottle of ordinary mineral water.
Instead, a simple banner, a meeting location, a simple, environmentally friendly paper bag with meeting materials, and an eco-friendly paper cup of tea.
The conference materials were somewhat thin compared to the past, and several pieces of paper summarized the theme and agenda of the meeting.
“Saving is about the people. It must be thrift when it is thrift. Back to the present simple, real meeting environment, we understand and welcome.” Wang Cheng, deputy to the Guangan Municipal People's Congress, said that meetings that are efficient and practical and do not engage in formalism are meetings that they are willing to see and participate in.

Bank of England will maintain a 0.25% interest rate
The Bank of England will announce at a later stage that interest rates will remain unchanged, and previously weak economic growth and loose inflation have dashed the upward adjustment.
The Bank of England issued a warning that economic growth would continue to be “weak” as it tightened household incomes while controlling interest rates.
The decision makers of the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to maintain a 0.25 per cent interest rate on a 6-2 vote, while a few members this month called for an increase in interest rates, even if weak economic growth had weakened the upward adjustment.
In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank of England reduced growth forecasts for 2017 and 2018 to 1.7% and 1.6%, respectively, and warned that the contraction in household income would continue, while inflation would soar to nearly 3% in the autumn.
It indicated, however, that in the next few years, interest rates would need to be raised to curb inflation from the deEuropean period, while borrowing costs might need to be raised more substantially than the financial markets expected in the medium term.
A year ago, a large-scale economic promotion policy was implemented as a result of the disintegration, and members also voted to withdraw it.
The Bank of England will announce the discontinuation of its regular financing scheme, which will provide low-cost funding to banks starting next February, although it claims that under the scheme, the Bank is currently required to add an additional Pound15 billion over Pound115 billion.
In the minutes of the interest rate decision meeting, Bank of England stated: “In the MPC core forecast, gross domestic product (GDP) has remained weak in the near future, as the contraction of real household income will continue to suppress consumption.”
With regard to interest rates, the bank has repeatedly reiterated the need for “a certain monetary policy retrenchment” to suppress inflation, and for “a greater degree” than market expectations.
The market is expected to grow for the first time in the third quarter of next year and for the second time in 2020.
However, the bank stressed that any upward adjustment would be “slow” and “restrained”.
The Bank's growth forecasts for this and next year show a downward trend, compared to 1.9% and 1.7% in May.
The bank maintains a 1.8% increase forecast for 2018.
The exchange rate of the British pound against the United States dollar declined, followed by the euro.
The British pound fell 0.5 per cent to 1.31 per cent against the United States dollar and 0.4 per cent to 1.11 per cent against the euro.
Prior to that constant decision, rising expectations were dashed by recent unpromising growth data. GDP increased to 0.3% in the second quarter, compared with 0.2% in the previous three months.
The growth in the third quarter is likely to remain at 0.3 per cent, although it will rise slightly by the end of the year.
Ordinary households were hit by a surge in inflation, while wage growth was negligible. The Bank of England's recent inflation report did not give them any news because the Bank said that tightening would get worse before it improved.
He added that monetary policy “cannot prevent” the attack on income in the next few years, but wages are expected to recover “on a large scale” at the end of the three-year forecast.
At the same time, as the British pound depreciates, demand for British goods grows significantly, and the economy will be stimulated to offset some of the effects of low consumption.
A year before the decision was made, the shocking EU referendum plunged the British pound and the August interest rate went down to 0.25%.
The Bank of England estimates that it may take four years to have a full impact on prices and the British economy.
Before the bank publishes its latest interest rate ruling, the interest rate upward calls were heard because inflation exacerbated the already stressful average family, while three policy makers called for an increase to 0.5 per cent in July.
Last month inflation dropped from 2.9% in June to 2.6%, although Bank of England said it was expected and would rise again in the next few months.
The line claims to be the last bottom line of the weak pound in relation to its 2% target.
“Given the recent fall in swap rates, the mortgage market seems to be becoming more competitive again, as lenders strongly appeal for more business and look forward to a perfect ending this year with a positive trend,” said Andrew Monterrey, director of Coreco Mortgage Brokers.
Such a market would seem particularly advantageous for those who may be close to closing existing transactions, as re-collateralization (many free of charge and low interest rates) is becoming more popular.
The China Seismological Station Network officially determined that the magnitude of the earthquake was 8.0 at 19:02 on November 13 in New Zealand (42.53 degrees south latitude and 173.05 degrees east longitude), with a seismological depth of 10 km and a strong earthquake in the capital, Wellington.
The UK National Health Service (NHS) has a green light for controversial HIV drugs
Patients will be able to access “transformative” HIV prophylaxis treatment from September, after the dust of NHS funding has been settled by the High Court.
NHS England announced that pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), a drug that can be taken before sexual intercourse, has proven to reduce the risk of infection in high-risk populations by about 86%. Health services now provide the drug to an estimated 10,000 people through a three-year initial trial.
It agreed to fund the experiment after the Court of Appeal had upheld the High Court's ruling last year. The ruling states that although NHS claims that local authorities should fund the drug, NHS is entitled to pay PrEP fees.
The announcement on Thursday was called a “major new intervention” by Simon Stevens, Chief Executive Officer of NHS in the United Kingdom, while the National AIDS Trust (NAT) described it as a “critical moment”.
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be the first to register sexual health clinics. More clinics will be added in October, followed by full implementation in England in April 2018.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is an HIV drug that is taken before sexual intercourse to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
Experiments have shown that PrEP can significantly reduce HIV transmission among people at risk of infection.
Taking PrEP before sexual intercourse means that there are enough specific drugs in the human body to prevent HIV infection.
The drug can be taken daily or two hours before sexual intercourse.
Those eligible for treatment include lesbian, bisexual, transgender and unsuccessful HIV carriers.
The clinic will identify eligible and agreed-to-test participants, including men, women, transgender persons and unknown persons whose sexual partner has HIV status on antiretroviral treatment.
Persons who reside in England and are registered as general practitioners can also enrol in the sexual health clinic they attend locally.
The plan will cost Pound10 million, and the NHS English branch signed a contract to purchase the drugs this week after international competitive procurement.
The test aims to assess the full potential of PrEP by collecting clinical evidence on how it is positioned, absorbed and implemented on the basis of large samples.
Mr. Stevens said: “This major new intervention should complement and reinforce HIV prevention broadly and increasingly successfully.
This is another milestone for more than 30 years worth making progress in addressing key human health challenges.”
Chief Executive Officer, British AIDS Trust Fund (NAT) Dipola? Kim said: “This is a critical moment in the fight against AIDS.
If it does target populations in need and at risk, pre-exposure prophylaxis offers the possibility of changing the British AIDS epidemic.

High quality of life: Apply loft and smart design to build Earl Palace apartments into spacious homes
Joanne Ray was a banker who was passionate about renovating her house, and in 2014 she moved from a large house on the Knightsbridge to a small apartment at the Count Palace.
This apartment is located on the ground floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - Joanne did not pack his luggage and sold it, which is strong proof of the new design.
“Before that, I and my ex-boyfriend lived in a bigger house at the Knightsbridge,” said Joanne.
“I was looking for the right house to offer.
I saw this apartment at the Count's Palace, and its ceiling was high.
I would love to make an offer that day.”
Since the first visit, the 1,000-square-foot apartment has now been completely overhauled.
The apartment was originally a complex single room - it needed to pass through the kitchen to get to the bedroom - and Joanne wanted to add storage space and loft to make the most of the plenty of ceiling height.
“I want high ceilings, large windows, plenty of light.
That's what I asked,” she said.
To that end, she hired Elfan Azadi from Duck & Shed Architecture and Design Studio (in Notting Hill) to use this 12.5-foot high ceiling to elaborate a home. This house is not only a development project, but also a place where Joanne lives.
The height of the ceiling is not enough to add two up and down spaces, so the challenge is to create an attic that is high enough to stand up.
Elfan must be creative in order to solve this problem.
“The steel structure is quite complex,” he explains.
“We must arrange space for it to be displayed up and down, and we do not need to shrug our shoulders.
Not only is it easy to build a simple platform, but it is also necessary to start the steel so that it is at the right height to achieve its function.”
Through this arrangement, Elvan is able to get two full-height rooms in the space - which can add many interesting elements.
The attic features Retrouvius brand retro copper windows overlooking the charming area of life.
The golden furnishings with mirrors, small silver furnishings and the Serge Mouille retro lighting provide a holistic style.
The use of mirrors plays an important role in increasing atmosphere, space and light.
Mount the mirror on both ends of the short hallway to make it look longer.
In the kitchen, splash-proof panels with mirrors are like windows to another room.
At the gates, the small plaid with a mirror provides Joanne with storage space for cutlery and glassware.
The beautiful living room has a fascinating sense of space that allows the kitchen to be picked up when not in use.
The folding kitchen is not fresh.
But the unique feature of this folding kitchen is a garage-style lift door.
“This involves knowledge of some engineering fields,” Ervin explains the MDF door for reinforcement of steel bars.
“This is a balancing principle, so it's easy to slide when you push the door.”
Joanne gets an extra 16 sqm, an extra bedroom and an improved layout thanks to the ingenious use of space and storage.
“Ultimately, what you sell is the size of the house - or your property valuation is based on the size of the house,” said Elvan.
“Basically, the real estate agent walks into the room and calculates the size of the floor.”
They try to increase their space while using high-quality materials, bringing a sense of luxury to the space.
Elfan said, “The material is your choice, so it helps create emotional ties at home.”
“You won't fall in love with power on the wall.
These things are important, but they won't hold your heart.”
It turns out that with good design and extra space, standard apartments can shake up to surprise you.
Actually, you might, like Joanne, choose to live.

Two brothers staged a $500 million real estate empire battle
Forty years after the founding of his Italian family, the two brothers fought for one of Victoria's largest real estate empires worth more than $500 million.
Former Carlton FC director and developer Colin? Germany? Colin De Lutis lives in a mansion in the Tutcala district, while the three doors are located at a distance from the residence of his brother Paul. The latter brought him before the Supreme Court with regard to the division of their real and operating assets.
Paul has wanted to leave the family business since 2014, but the two brothers have engaged in a fierce debate in the Supreme Court over this division of assets.
Together, the brothers and their mother own 38 real properties worth more than $500 million that have accumulated since the family bought Smith Street in Collinwood District in 1973.
There, the family created Westco Jeans and gradually expanded it to 160 retail chains.
In 1999, the company sold at a price of $85 million.
After that, the money was put into real estate. Currently, Germany? The Rutis family portfolio includes city office buildings, Braunschweig and Solento development projects, Gold Coast and Mount Bleu apartments, and suburban shopping malls.
By agreement with his late father, was his brother Paul called German? Kolin, the “main promoter and dominant figure” of the Rutis family, owns about two thirds of the company's assets, while Paul accounts for about one third.
According to the documents submitted to the Tribunal, the property owned by Colin was valued at $316 million, and that owned by Paul was valued at $176 million, after conversion.
Paul argued that the division of real estate and cash proved to be the crux of the negotiations.
“Colin's proposed division of property left him what I thought was the best property,” he wrote in a first court oath in 2015.
Last Friday, the Supreme Court held its first hearing after several mediation failures.
Now, the brothers are still competing for control of the existing business, and Paul claims that Colin has kicked him out of the game.
Colin denied this and accused Paul of not managing certain real property.
In his early affidavit submitted by Colin, he expressed the hope that the dispute would be resolved.
“My Italian tradition determines that the family is the most important option. My Italian descent determines that the family is the most important,” he writes.
The cost of the case continues to rise, with hundreds of pages of affidavits, e-mails and company reports from companies such as Deloitte, Pitcher Partners, Charter Keck Cramer, top law firms such as Allan Myers, QC, and senior lawyers hired by both parties.
Germany? Ms. Rutiz and her late husband, Luigi, were Italian immigrants. They started running popular food and deli stores in the late 1950s and bought a store in Brenschweig in the early 1970s.
They used collateral to buy Collinwood property, where Colin opened the family's first jeans shop.
Colin said, “I read three,” where he founded Westco, “At that time, Paul was small (about 10 years old).”
Anna? Germany? Rutiz said she and Luigi, who died in 2012, wanted to pass their property to their son peacefully.
“Luigi often told me that he never wanted his brothers to end up in court,” she wrote.
The other two brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer German? Kolin, a member of the Rutiz Group, said that when Mark left the company, he paid him $10 million and Luke $26 million.
Paul said Luke and Mark were “dissatisfied with their property division clause.”
According to TV star Eddie? Eddie McGuire, a member of the Board of Directors of the former AFL Club, kept a low profile in biographies published between 2015 and 2015.
“Fairfax Media” contacted Colin and Paul on Friday, as well as their lawyers.
However, only Colin responded via SMS. He said, because the case has been brought to court, “I really cannot say too much.”
“My brother Paul chose to sue me and bring our family affairs to court, which is very, very sad,” he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote in a court document that he had tried to meet the demands of his brother.
He said: “Our father does not want to see Paul and I finally have such a dispute,” and added that he “still has hope for the settlement of the dispute.”
Friday, this hope seems to be dashed.
“Our problems will be resolved by the courts in the near future”, Colin writes.

Trump's new chief of staff plans to limit the President's media time
Others have tried, but all have failed.
John F. Kelly might really be able to do that.
If that's true, then he's the first person.
According to Politico, the new White House Chief of Staff plans to restrict the flow of information to President Trump, including press reports, with a view to ensuring a more stable boss.
Here is a quote from journalist Josh Dawsi:
“When the new White House Chief of Staff, John F. Kelly, started his first day of work and gathered with senior officials, he pointed out that he wanted to address one of the main problems of President Trump's entry into the White House: the bad message that flows to the President”.
Kelly told the officials that receiving good information would help the President to make better decisions, so that the information needed to be passed on to him - whether in writing or in the form of briefings.
Kelly's diagnosis looks like it, but others have tried to tame it by watching Trump's media time, but eventually they all failed.
President Trump's television addiction has been long-standing - now in the White House, his habit of watching television is still growing.
In February, former campaign advisor Sam Naperg told Politico: “If candidate Trump is frustrated with unfair reporting, it would be useful to let him know that he has also received positive coverage on credible channels.
Politico's Tara Palmeri wrote at the time, “Based on the experience of six former campaign officials, the focus of the habit of controlling Trump Fitter is to ensure that the media information he receives personally always contains some praise.”
This is completely fine.
But Trump's Twitter habit was ridiculous about being “controlled”.
Perhaps these campaign officials know something that we don't know - that Trump's Twitter would even be more mad if it weren't for their intervention.
We probably never knew Trump didn't send those tweets.
If his staff were able to save him from the fire, even a few times, their efforts would be worth it.
But no one can keep Trump from being controversial.
Part of the problem is that in a White House composed of competing groups, people promote their world view by transmitting to Trump information that may or may not be reliable, and the fancy of their cause.
Politico - it's all about this story - in May, it was reported on the hobbies of advisors in providing suspicious information strategically to the President.
This is an example described by journalist Shane Goodmancher:
“According to current and former Trump officials, Trump's reaction to negative news clips, such as volcanic eruptions, especially those damaging information leaks, would be crazy about finding their source.
At the end of February, an article on GotNews.com, the website of Cyber Instigator Charles C Johnson, was maliciously copied to the President, complaining that Deputy Chief of Staff Katie Walsh was the “source of massive information leaks” at the White House, as was the case at Trump.
Even though Johnson had been permanently banned by Twitter for harassment, no concrete evidence had been provided, and he had blown up a large number of erroneous accusations, which had subsequently been blatantly denied.
Trump looked at the article and started asking officials about Walsh.”
Goodmancher added that Reynes Pribas, then Chief of Staff, and Robert Potter, White House Secretary, “tried to establish a system to manage and record documents received by Trump”.
What happened?
Kelly intends to do the same thing in three months.
Perhaps he could prove that he was a more efficient manager than Pribas, but Trump was the impulsive Trump, and his assistants were still competing for influence.
These timeless influences will make Kelly's mission even more difficult.
Tour town: how to get drunk
[Summary] The potential of Zhejiang town is gradually awakened.
Today, these small towns are important destinations for Zhejiang tourists to admire Zhejiang's water, read Zhejiang culture and feel the sentiments of Zhejiang. They will also provide important assistance to China's most beautiful tourist destinations.

In recent years, with the advancement of tourism construction across the province, the potential of Zhejiang town has been gradually awakened.
In 2016, the provincial government office officially released the “Zhejiang Province Tourism Style Town Creation Work Implementation Method”, which proposes to name about 100 provincial tourism towns with a strong folk culture, an excellent ecological environment and a rich tourism culture in the province over a period of about five years.
Today, these small towns are important destinations for Zhejiang tourists to admire Zhejiang's water, read Zhejiang culture and feel the sentiments of Zhejiang. They will also provide important assistance to China's most beautiful tourist destinations.
Relevant officials of the provincial tourism bureau explained that, under the boom in the creation of tourist-style small towns, the townships of various parts of our province are now paying more attention to the creation of personalized tourism industries.

“Prof. Xie Hanfeng, director of first-line television and television advertising at the Chinese Academy of Fine Arts, and Professor Xu Xiangxian, director of the Chinese University of Metrology and Communication, told the cross-border story of small towns such as “Small Village Improvement” in the footage.
Many tourist towns in Zhejiang have deep cultural resources, and Tung Xinjian, a small town from Nanqi, Huzhou City, explained the Chinese painting for everyone at the scene.

To date, Zhejiang Province has issued the first list of 21 provincial tourist style small towns and 115 provincial tourist style small town incubation list.
As a priority area for the development of rural tourism during the “13th Five-Year Plan” period, the style of small towns will eventually be built into tourist attractions above the level 3A, becoming a new model for the variety of tourism products, high tourism efficiency, and industrial integration and win-win.
The key to the attraction of the tourist town is its original flavor.
The beauty of the tourist town stems not only from the smoke and rain fans of the bridge flow water, but also from a long cultural tradition; the rural revival, the cultural self-confidence.
Throughout the world, the Dutch town of Liser, the Austrian town of Harstadt and the French town of pumpkin, each with tulips, “salt” and pumpkin as its core attractions, attract a large number of tourists from all over the world every year and achieve tourism to boost the economy of the small town.
For small towns, the focus of “highlighting the characteristics and keeping the countryside sad” makes the town distinctive personality and soul, but also provides cultural immersion, carries the local culture, highlights the native civilization.
Tour town, with culture and countryside sentiment as the link, with the humanities and landscape as the vehicle, connect with the visitors of the Quartet, let traditional style and culture inherit and innovate in the common building sharing.
By its very nature, the tourist town is a complex and open tourist attraction, and it should be a shared living space for local residents and visitors, as well as residents.
As the main battlefield for future tourism growth, small tourist towns may not only change the ecological landscape of the countryside, the way of economic and social development, the direction of the flow of industrial factors, but also be an important force in bridging the urban-rural infrastructure gap and awakening the recovery of rural culture.
Zhejiang's tourist-style town will showcase a richer story in the great tide of the country's accelerated revitalization.

Tenants negotiate ditches and return to “Regal Street”
Some of the wealthiest owners in the West Midrand region have again been in dispute with determined tenants, who have consulted on a government-excavated ditch to demand the return of land outside the mansion.
The tenants parked 20 of their trailers in an open area outside the bustling Solihr Street, known as Regal Street.
Rangers with horses, embrace babies and lead a motorcade, and returned again after being expelled in May. The “moat” dug up by the municipal department did not prevent them from entering.
This sleek and skilful team found a gap in the line, through which their vehicles were squeezed, although there was no roadblock for passage.
Angry residents criticized the Solihull Council violently, calling it “very poor in dealing with this issue”.
A non-famous resident said: “They arrived there on Monday night before coming to Bentley Heath Street, throwing stones at passers-by.
The Commission should be ashamed of their actions, as they are simply nothing to deal with.
The tenants came here in May and were then evicted, and now they are back.
A lot came last night, and today may be more.”
She added: “The Birmingham City Council knows how to handle it by enforcing a long-term ban to protect its park.
I live on Streetsbrook Road, and if Parliament cannot stop this, I cannot continue to pay municipal taxes.
A local resident who did not want to be named said: “This is ridiculous. We just saw the last batch of motorists go away, just to make it easier for another batch to destroy.
The number has increased again, and some people even see horses on the park lawn eating grass.”
A spokeswoman for the Solihr Commission said: “We know that unauthorized camping is taking place in an open area of the Szettsbrook Road, and now we work with the Solihr police and take the necessary legal action to get them out of here as soon as possible.
In order to support us in gathering evidence, it is important that as many local residents as possible report any antisocial or criminal acts to the police by calling.
This helps us to outline the situation for the Court's consideration when we refer cases to the Court.”

Italy takes a tough attitude towards the non-governmental organization migrant rescue ship
Italy has issued a warning to the Mediterranean non-governmental organizations that operate migrant rescue ships that they will not be allowed to continue their operations unless they sign new operational regulations.
In an interview with the Turin Daily News, Interior Minister Marco Minnetti said: “If non-governmental organizations do not sign a new code of conduct, it is hard to see how they will continue.”
On the day before the warning was issued in Minnetti, the Italian authorities detained the crew of a German aid organization “Youth Aid” ship on suspicion of actually collaborating with human traffickers to assist illegal immigrants.
The aid organization operated for only one year and refused to comment on the specific subject of the charges against the Italian prosecutor, Ambrogio Caltocio.
In a social media statement, the organization said, “For us, saving lives is and will be the most important thing, so we regret that we cannot operate in the SAR area at this time.”
“Having gathered all the information, we can only assess all the allegations and situations at this time.”
Italian authorities have been monitoring the ship Iuventa from October.
Its crew was suspected of carrying migrants who had been transported directly from small boats by human traffickers and allowed smugglers to flee hastily and reuse their ships.
According to the Prosecutor's documents, at least one such meeting allegedly took place at sea 1.3 miles from the coast of Libya. The document was published by the Italian media.
Its crew is suspected of blatantly ignoring the authority of the Italian Coast Guard, which oversees rescue operations in the area for humanitarian enthusiasm and not for any other motive.
According to the code of conduct, vessels such as Iuventa clearly require an Italian police officer to supervise their activities on board the vessel.
Currently, only three of the nine non-governmental organizations involved in search and rescue operations have agreed to comply with the code of conduct: Save the Children, the Immigration Maritime Aid Station in Maltese and Pro-Activa Open Arms in Spain.
The latter said on Thursday that it considered the new provisions to be unnecessary but acceptable, as they did not bring about any “significant changes and obstacles” to its rescue operations.
Among the organizations that refused to sign were the Nobel Prize-winning organization Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF).
At the same time, Minnety claimed that the number of immigrants who had arrived in Italy in recent weeks had fallen sharply, indicating that efforts to strengthen Libyan coast guards and bring together local mayors had begun to bear fruit.
The minister said: “In recent days, we have begun to see the dawn at the end of the tunnel. “”
He announced plans for this month's in-depth talks: discussions with Libyan mayors on economic development activities, and discussions with Chad, Niger and Mali on ways to reduce the number of migrants wishing to leave those countries for Europe.
According to the Chief Financial Officer of the Bank of Communications, Lianping, the growth of industrial value added is expected to accelerate to 6.6% in December due to the late-season trend in industrial value added in the first three quarters of 2017.

Industrial production, although weaker than in October, remained largely the same as in November.
In December, China's manufacturing investment was running at a low level, but capital investment has improved slightly, so it is expected that fixed asset investment will be stable in November.

The reporter learned from the ceremony that in recent years, in order to strengthen the core functions of the capital and to deal with the “metropolitan disease”, in the context of the joint development of Beijing and Jingjin and the dissolution of non-capital functions, Beijing has accelerated the evacuation of the central urban universities to the suburbs. Teachers and students of some universities are gradually moving to new campuses in suburbs such as Shunyi, Daxing and Foshan.
Located in Changping Nankou Town, the North Chemical University Campus covers 1800 acres and is 40 km from the city. It is one of the key projects in Beijing to evacuate non-capital functions.

After all construction, it is planned to meet the learning and living needs of nearly 20,000 undergraduate, graduate and teaching staff.
Looking back at this year's film market, we found that the original text of the film and two groups of actors who participated in the film became an important part of the expected audience of the film.
At 1710 hours today, the Xiaoyang City 119 Command Center received a warning of a fire on the four-hydrofurans stored at the Hongzhi Chemical Factory in Longshitang, Shuangqing District of the city.
The Shaoyang fire brigade immediately dispatched five squadrons of 20 fire trucks with heavy protective clothing, anti-chemical washing trucks and other equipment to the scene.
Preliminary investigations have led to the firing of small storage tanks containing chemical substances such as tetrahydrofurans, which produced high levels of smoke.
As of the time of the reporter's release, fire officers and soldiers were being rescued in an intense manner. The municipal departments of health, security, environmental protection, security and transportation had successively rushed to the scene, and no casualties had been found.
Michelle? Michelle Carter encouraged Conrad by text messages? Conrad Roy was convicted of suicide
A Massachusetts woman was sentenced to two and a half years in prison for encouraging her boyfriend to commit suicide by text mail and telephone.
Now 20-year-old Michelle? Carter will serve a 15-month sentence, which may be converted to a probation. Another 5 years probation.
Carter was sentenced to Conrad in June? Conrad Roy committed unintentional and unpremeditated murder, which committed suicide on 13 July 2014.
Roy's father said at a hearing on Thursday: “My family is sad.
My son is my best friend.”
While awaiting appeal, Carter was granted personal liberty.
She faced a maximum of 20 years' imprisonment, but her team considered that she and Mr. Roy were both mentally ill.
At the time of sentencing, Carter stood, wearing red trousers and beige shirts, tight hands, tears, and looked down.
“Her behavior killed Conrad? Roy, the prosecutor told the court.
“She ended his life to live better for herself.
She was not responsible”, the prosecutor said.
“She has no remorse.”
But Carter's lawyer said it was “a terrible consequence, and she felt very sorry.”
However, Lawrence? Judge Lawrence Moniz said that he did not find her “age or maturity, or even her mental illness, would have any significant impact on her behavior.”
A prosecutor read Roy's mother Lynn? A statement by Lynn Roy said, “I don't feel a day without losing my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of what I and I have done. I am trying to stand with his sisters in all my misery, which will accompany us forever”, said the statement.
Mr. Roy's sister, Keddy? Camdyn Roy testified that she was “unconscious” because she realized she could never attend her brother's wedding or become his child's aunt.
“The loss of a man who has been with me since my birth is a pain that will befall me for the rest of my life.” She said.
This case seems to set a legal precedent, as Massachusetts law does not criminalize incitement to commit suicide.
In 2014, Roy was found dead of carbon monoxide poisoning in the car; that year, Carter was 17 years old.
After Carter's text message revealed that she had encouraged him to commit suicide, the case raised national concerns.
“There are many ways to hang, jump, stabbed yourself.” She indicated in several short letters sent two weeks before his death that he was on holiday with his family.
The time before he killed herself, she wrote, “You need to do this, Conrad,” and “All you have to do is start the generator, and then you get free and happy.”
Judge Moniz said that Carter had drawn attention through the death of Mr. Roy and ordered her not to profit from the case through any media.
There is a difference of legal opinion in this case.
The number of people defending Carter is small, Amanda? One of them is Amanda Knox, who was accused of murdering her British roommate in Italy in 2007 and acquitted two years later.
30-year-old Knox said in a column article published in The Los Angeles Times: “Michelle? Carter deserves sympathy and help, not imprisonment.”
Zhang Yimou is destined to be a controversial movie artist, and since he started filming the first film, Red sorghum, he has been leading the trend of Chinese cinema while also reaping a lot of uncontested.
The reporter learned on the 2nd from the Lhasa Purification Basketball Club that the Lhasa Purification Basketball team recently won the fourth place in the national junior basketball league finals held in Beijing.
The Lhasa Purification Basketball Teen Team is composed of 11 native players, and the coach is the assistant coach of the Lhasa Purification Men's Basketball Team Tzu.
Tibetan “basketball boy” before leaving for Beijing for the finals.
Leung Jun-chao, general manager of the Salsa Purification Basketball Club in Lhasa, told reporters that compared with last year, the team's achievements have improved somewhat, and the player's self-confidence and confidence in the arena have improved markedly. Interaction between players and other teams is also more comprehensive, and there are more and easier exchanges on and off-site.
After the tournament, Team Yangtze Zuo said he hoped to gain experience by participating in the tournament and make every effort for the basketball business in Tibet.
It is learned that in the competition in Beijing, the players overcome factors such as low altitude drunk oxygen and displayed the image of Tibet.
Despite the fact that athletics are a gold medal at the Olympics and the athletes are the world's winners, the track and field names will be in the lower wind than the stitching of gold.
Automobile manufacturers face shock, Audi will retrofit up to 850,000 diesel trucks
Audi announced the day before the renovation, BMW said it would provide software upgrades to more than 350,000 cars.
BMW's chairman said that BMW believes that “driving has more smart choices than restrictions”, meaning that major European cities - including Munich, where BMW's headquarters are located - consider banning or limiting diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced Tuesday that three million Mercedes cars in Europe will be converted to reduce diesel emissions.
None of the companies claimed that this was a recall.
European automobile manufacturers have promoted the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to help meet CO2 emission requirements.
However, nitrogen oxides emitted by diesel engines are considered carcinogens and may lead to asthma.
The cost of installing equipment to offset diesel vehicle exhaust emissions has also increased, making it difficult to maintain the price competitiveness of diesel trucks.
As German automobile manufacturers face censorship, the Government led by Chancellor Angela Merkel has also been accused of too much letting these powerful automobile companies go unnoticed signs of the problem.
These automotive companies are trying to avoid repeating the popular mistakes of concealing their use of so-called failed devices, adjusting emissions to comply with regulations when testing cars and returning to normal conditions of driving.
Several public executives have been charged in the United States, while others are under investigation in countries across the Atlantic.
Last month, a former head of thermodynamics at Audi's engine development department was arrested in Germany.
Zachero Giofanni Pamio, former manager, is Italian and therefore not protected from extradition and may face trial in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi was involved in a German criminal investigation involving the general public, and the German Government accused Audi of installing the system to avoid European emission requirements, expanding the scope of the investigation previously limited to the United States.
Audi's investigation could have a major impact on the public: luxury car manufacturers make up a disproportionate share of the profits of Volkswagen.
A film, from preparation to presentation, lasted a year or two or even a few years, is commonplace.
The animated film “Big Fish Begonia” was announced to be screened on July 8, 12 years from preparation to presentation!
The original author of “Big Fish Haitang”, Leung Yong, 21 years old, from Tsinghua University's Thermal Power Profession, together with his friend Zhang Chun, founded the other shore day, in 2008 received a $1 million risk investment from UNTI, and launched the animated movie virgin “Big Fish Haitang”.
The film has won many awards at home and abroad during the creative sample phase, and has been admired by the Pompidou Centre for Contemporary Art in France as one of the most outstanding works of art.
For six years from creativity to production, the film is called the “Divine Pit” by millions of fans who look forward to it.
The Big Fish Begonia tells a fantastic story that belongs to the Chinese. With the announcement of this archived trailer, new expectations are created for all viewers.
Liang Yong said: “This is the only thing that has been done in these 12 years, and now it has become a reality from a dream, and I am both nervous and excited.”
Zhang Chun said: “Always thinking about using one of the other's 50 percent budget to make exactly the same picture effect as others, the team will be driven crazy by me.”
Dongguan, a “world factory” that used to rely on the processing of raw materials and a large number of industrial plants, is directing its attention to high-level talent who can lead the repositioning of the city.
During the week of high-level talent events organized by the Dongguan Municipal Government in recent days, the first financial and economic reporter saw that some powerful local enterprises were participating in the talent fair.
The orange background wall is lined with an exceptionally bright billboard, each with a significant price.
Therefore, the China Television Drama Production Industry Association decided to join the national television drama production industry to sign the self-regulation convention.
Provence Lavender is threatened by climate change
Lavender has become a symbol of the city of Provence in southern France, but there is bad news that it is threatened by climate change.
As a result of the continuing drought and the emergence of viral insects, lavender is declining, leaving headaches for scientists and farmers who are trying to find solutions.
Expert of the Agricultural Research Institute (CRIEPPAM) in Provence, Eric? “Provence's lavender is facing an enormous threat, as the plant has been affected by climate change in recent years, with a sharp drop in spring rainfall and heavy autumn rains,” said Eric Chaisse.
This affects the lifecycle of lavender.
There is also a small individual cicadas, a leaf cicadas that can spread micro-bacteria, which can appear in abundance in very dry weather. “”
The point is that it is huge.
In addition to attracting vacationers, elegant lavender oils are also sought after by the perfume and cosmetics industry.
Eric? Tsai said: “In contrast to the plants that can open many big flowers with a long Valley Fringe, we have problems with small individuals, stunted growth, missing or weak.
So we have less oil.”
Solutions under study include the adoption of better irrigation techniques and the mitigation of evaporation of soil moisture, the spraying of clay and water protection mixtures on plants and the development of more drought-tolerant species.
Compared to the science fiction elements in the movie, the two starring performers said that what attracted them more was the story in the film.
On the afternoon of September 5, a reporter from the West China Metropolitan News, interviewing a number of celebrities in the audiovisual world, as well as two acoustic artists, was surprised that they were almost unanimous in their silence.
One is the Berlin Shadow Emperor, one is an upward youth actor, and Psychological Offences is also the first partner of Liao Fan and Li Yifeng.
Mexico, dangerous, journalist killed.
All staff of Riodoce Weekly usually meet on Wednesday to review their plans to report on the Sinalo riots caused by criminal organizations, corrupt officials and the endless drug war.
But today, the shadow of tragedy hovers themselves, and they come together to discuss security issues.
It is important that they be told to change their daily habits.
Two senior journalists discussed what was more secure: whether they should take their children to their offices (which had been attacked by grenades in 2009) or leave them at home.
Security experts wrote three words on the blackboard in front of the room: enemies, neutrals and allies.
They gave the journalists names in each column - no evidence needed, enough observation and intuition.
There are suspected drug traffickers, politicians, businessmen and journalists on the Government's list, or cartels, and these gangs put Mexico's reporting at risk.
The violence has never stopped and the corpses of the country have been rampant, with a growing number of journalists: according to the records of the Committee for the Protection of Journalists, at least 25 journalists have died since President Enrique Peña Nieto took office in December 2012; 589 journalists have been under federal protection following attacks and threats; at least 7 journalists have died in 7 states so far this year.
The last dead was their editor and source of inspiration, and Javier Valdez Cadnas, co-founder of Riodock.
In one of the books he wrote about drug violence, Valdez wrote, “The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and become a journalist.”
He was able to feel deeply that he had left, although he was everywhere - a huge photo hung on the front of the Riodock office building, and Valdez had a middle finger with the word “justice”; and Aaron Ivala and Miriam Ramírez, the more than 30-year-old reporter, wearing glare or his iconic Panamanian straw hat.
The seminar was held less than two months after his death; journalists discussed their common trauma, nightmares, insomnia and polysuspicion.
Although a special federal prosecutor's office was established in 2010 to deal with journalists' cases, according to the records of the Committee for the Protection of Journalists, the office indicted only two persons.
The majority of the thousands of crimes committed each year involved drug trafficking and organized crime, so that the perpetrators of killings of journalists were rarely brought to justice.
In Riodock, they insisted on reporting incidents of violence in Sinaloa, although they had broken hearts, although the land was already in vapour.
Iwala said that there was no information about the murderers and no justice was done, so it would be of little use to hold a security seminar.
He said, “It's stupid to waste time attending such a seminar.
As long as we don't know why, you don't trust anyone.”
In the morning of May 15, Valdez left the Riodoce office in the capital city of Kuliacan.
His red Toyota Carola was stopped by two men only a few blocks away; they forced him out of the car and fired 12 shots, presumably because the name of the newspaper - translated into the Twelve Ways.
The assailants drove his car away and hit him nearby.
Valdez is 50 years old.
Leave his wife and two already adult children.
Quuliacan rumors four times.
But on the subject of Valdez, in fact there is nothing but silence.
Since Guzman was arrested last year and extradited to the United States in January, Sinalo has become the bloodiest battlefield in the country, with hostile forces fighting frenzied.
It has become commonplace that one or more people are shot and killed on the streets of Sinalo every day, and that the cemetery is filled with two layers of the gorgeous tombs of drug lords.
Forget for the moment that the state of “calm” is when only one cartel controls this coastal state and its ports to the United States and drug trafficking routes.
Even so, even though Valdez was well aware of the dangers of the job, the 60-year-old co-founder and director of Riodoce, Ismael Pohoqueque, felt guilty for not protecting his friends.
He believed that two mistakes had caused the tragedy.
First, in February, an interview was published with Damasso Lopez, who led a cartel group that was fighting with several sons of Guzmán.
The report may have provoked the sons; the newspapers were buyout by suspected gang members as soon as they were sent to the news stand.
The second mistake was that Valdez was not forced to leave Mexico for his own security concerns after another newspaper reporting the same story was confiscated.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his death was of great significance to the violence against journalists in Mexico.
His spirit is alive, and his friends and colleagues believe that he has always been with us.
He was also a senior journalist for Noroeste in 2003, when he co-founded Riodock with five colleagues and sold $50 in shares.
Pokhokwi said in Sinaloa, “It is impossible to set foot in the news industry without dealing with the drug problem.”
Over time, the newspaper gained a good reputation for its bold and honest reporting, and sales and advertising increased.
Journalists like to be able to publish direct investigation reports against the most important victims without worrying about censorship. Readers also like newspapers publishing stories that others are afraid to report.
Five years after its inception, Riodoce won the Maria Moskapo News Award from Latin American countries.
The same year, the Association for the Protection of Journalists awarded Valdez the International Press Freedom Prize for his courage in pursuing the most authentic Mexican drug reports.
He said he was scared.
When the Association for the Protection of Journalists awarded the award, he said, “I want to stay alive.”
Later in late October, in an interview with local television station Rompeviento TV, he said, “In Sinalo, drug trafficking is a way of life.
You must be a journalist with the task of falling on your shoulders - either as deaf or as mute.
I don't want to be asked, “What have you done in the face of so many deaths... why don't you sound at what's happening?”
All Riodock employees miss Valdez, remembering him like a wharf worker, remembering this friend who never hesitated to embrace and advise, and the teacher who knows how to live.
They depend on his habits.
He used to wear that hat.
The El Guayabo bar, opposite the office, is always sitting on the same table.
Now they will ask: Is it his daily habits that caused his meteorite?
His death also forced them to think about how to do their job and live.
“They don't like the clandestine airports that you cause trouble to their women and children, nor do they like the clandestine airports that you affect their legitimate companies and use to transport drugs.
These have crossed their bottom line.”
The result is a high degree of self-censorship and self-protection, even at the safest time.
Believe your instincts.
If you smell a dangerous breath, hurry away.
“The problem is,” said Andrés Vila Lille, Riodock editor, “Breath is a feeling of being cheated... and then something like Javier will happen.”
He and others have said that the previous rules no longer apply to Sinalo - just as they no longer apply to Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states, where smuggling routes are lucrative and where institutions are weak, government officials are corrupt and smoky.
The situation is constantly changing.
In the rooms where Riodoce employees attended security training, mobile phones were suddenly not allowed; a few days ago, spyware allegedly sold only to the Government had been used in Mexico to monitor journalists and activists.
Outside, two policemen took a cool ride under the shade, avoiding a high temperature of 104 degrees (40 degrees Celsius).
They were sent by the State Government to protect the offices of Riodock, which are located in a four-storey building in the middle class neighbourhood of Culiacan.
Some reporters were joking about not knowing whether these policemen would be 50% of the letter that the governor himself said.
Journalists have been in the mountains for several months, where drug trafficking groups are under the control of their physical existence.
This week Riodoce focused on three major events.
Among them was the murder of the brother of the great former boxer Julio César Chávez of Sinalo,
Also, the government funds of the governor's hometown were disclosed,
and the kidnapping in an expensive restaurant in Kuliakan, only a block from the prosecutor's office.
The official did not publish information on the subject and the kidnapping process, so it was necessary to be cautious when writing what the city knew: that is, the restaurant was a place that both drug dealers and the official loved.
One journalist learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician of the ruling party, the Revolutionary Regime Party (PRI), which dominated the political class almost throughout the previous discipline.
Recently, several PRS governors have been accused of corruption in several high-profile cases.
Verari asked reporters to write about what had happened at the scene of the incident before, including an incident in which a son of Guzman, Mexico's number-one drug lord, escaped a military attack.
If, a few months ago, readers would have looked at the Valdez column for the most powerful information about the kidnapping.
46-year-old Vilarrill, who was called “skinny” because of his small size, said, “Before, we already knew what happened.
Now all our sources of information are cut off.
Valdez's office is now being used to store logos and stickers protesting against the killing of journalists, as employees become what they never wanted to be: activists representing the media.
The following morning, reporter Miriam Ramírez took a logo out of his room and went to the office of the local prosecutor to attend a march related to another journalist.
El Salvador Adame disappeared in the western state of Michoacán three days after his murder in Valdez.
The official found a burnt body, which he claimed was his body, according to DNA tests.
Throughout the country, journalists have become more outspoken, organizing protests and painting the word “rescue media” on sidewalks and buildings.
On that day, Director Pokhokwi was not in Washington, and he was trying to bring justice to the Valdez case and garner international support.
The day after Valdez was killed, during a meeting with the Governor of Sinalo, Ramírez complained of official spying on journalists and killed them because they had given the facts.
Given that her anger had affected her objectivity, she also requested to resign from her position of reporting on government affairs.
Valdez has repeatedly reiterated that Mexican journalists are “surrounded” by organized crime, co-flawed government officials and indifferent societies.
In his previous book, The Drug Journalism, he wrote that journalists were not only maimed by drug trafficking groups, but were also on the list of politicians and security forces who were in line with organized crime.
Media Monitoring Group Articulo 19 blamed police and public officials for more than half of last year's journalists attacks.
Ramirez said, “In Mexico, they let you die in order to shut you up.”
Apparently, these murders are chilling.
No one forgets that six years ago, the blogger Maria Elizabeth Masias died on the border north of Tamaulipas.
Her body was beside a note allegedly signed by Zeitaskatel: “I came for my report.”
Her head was cut off, next to which was a computer keyboard and headphones.
, after Miroslava Brechy was killed in March, some newspapers opted to close down, such as El Norte on the northern border of Chihuahua.
Others continue, and the director of El Manana of Nuevo Laredo was killed in 2014, but they continue.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juarez used a front-page news open dialogue drug cartel entitled “What do you want from us?”
Some of the journalists fled their homes or even left the country.
This is a difficult choice.
It is difficult to find work in exile, and they still need to be careful and alert to danger on the streets.
Sometimes they are arrested and reportedly killed in 2015 by photographer Rubene Espinosa in a Mexican city and four women three months after fleeing Veracruz.
For those who stay behind the scenes and continue to work, this is a daily step in high-risk decision-making.
Ivara wanted to be a poet, and he admitted that he was afraid to report on the drug trade.
He said, “Mexico is becoming hell, so I became a journalist.”
In the midnight of the last Friday, the latest issue of the newspaper had been printed, and the editors of Riodoce were sitting on the walkway outside the office drinking beer and suddenly their phones rang.
A series of gunfire between gang rival forces and security forces near the beach resort city of Massatland has confirmed the deaths of 19 people.
The fighting is still escalating, as the series of cartel messages found in the area foreshadow.
They uploaded the news to the Riodoce website by mobile on the side of the road.
The headlines of the next day had to be changed.
The siren rings in the neighborhood - another battle of life and death in the area.
Pohoqueque glanced at the policemen standing there escorting to see if they were alerted.
If they were scared, they didn't show up.
The founder of the newspaper had been killed, and in his large portrait, his middle finger pointed to what the entire Sinalese state needed to look at, and all the staff of Riodock followed him.
“How can you even want to shut down? The same day Javier was killed, the intern asked me to send her to the street to participate in the report.”
Car-driven tourism in China 2020 market size or beyond trillion yuan
[Summary] Driving is encouraged by national policies and favours by a growing number of consumers in the broader context of increased consumption and freedom.
At the same time, however, the self-driving market, which is expected to break the trillion scale, faces a double challenge.
Driving is encouraged by national policies and favours by a growing number of consumers in the broader context of increased consumption and freedom.
At the same time, however, the self-driving market, which is expected to break the trillion scale, faces a double challenge. On the one hand, the development of the self-driving industry is not proportional to the market demand, and self-driving organizers such as the self-driving clubs and travel agencies are faced with a low-profit dilemma; on the other hand, the infrastructure and services facing self-driving drives are still in their infancy.
60% of all domestic tourists, market size is expected to break trillion
In 2016, the number of domestic tourists was 4.44 billion, with driving taking over 60% of the total number of tourists in the country. By 2020, the number of self-driving tourists is expected to reach trillion.
According to statistics on the number of people travelling by car from the China Association of Tourism Vehicles, the number of people travelling by car has continued to grow in the last five years. The proportion of tourists traveling in China has stabilized at more than half.
At the same time, more attention and support have been shown at the regional and national levels in the emerging area of self-driving, with policies and regulations relating to self-driving, home-based and camping tourism being introduced intensively between 2016 and 2017.
In July 2017, eight departments, including the State Tourism Administration and the State Sports Administration, jointly issued the Car-owned Sports Camp Development Plan; in the same month, 14 departments, including the State Development and Reform Commission and the Ministry of Finance, jointly issued the Programme of Action for the Promotion of Quality Upgrading for Rural Tourism Development (2017), the driving tour was highlighted.
The introduction of the policy provides opportunities and policy guidance for domestic driving development.
The self-driving club is extremely profitable and the complete industrial chain is key
Although the domestic market for self-driving is of great potential and national policy is actively guided, the self-driving industry is still at an early stage.
According to the annual China Driving Report 2016-2017, there are thousands of home-grown clubs, automobile clubs, car club and car club, but the proportion of tourists arranging self-driving trips is the majority, and only about 15% of tourists take part in various agencies such as car club and self-driving club.
At the same time, online tourism enterprises and traditional travel agencies that independently develop their own driving products are among the best. Many online travel platforms sell only self-driving products from some suppliers, and some self-driving clubs are also important suppliers.
In terms of organizing guided tours, it covers many aspects of “eating, staying, traveling, traveling, shopping, entertainment”, high fragmentation, heavy upstream supply chains, and random consumption of tourists.
Li Guanjie, founder and CEO of Beijing Jiuanxian Automobile Club, believes that the driving club is essentially similar to the travel agency. The main profit model in the early years was based on offline activities, with the core point being the product of the driving route and the lead service.
However, there is now a high homogenization of line products in the area of driving, and the level of leadership service is uneven.
It can be seen that self-driving is not an independent industry in itself, but rather a cross-geographical, industry-wide eco-circle with its own driving characteristics, and it is important to form a complete industrial chain.
Experts noted that in addition to basic tourism consumption, experience is a more important consumer element.
Therefore, for the development of the self-driving industry, experience features should be enhanced to develop the “self-driving +” theme and IP for self-driving products.
Landscapes are not just roads, car camps should not only cater to food and accommodation
In the face of the rise of driving, the basic development of driving is also relatively primary.
Li Guanjie pointed out that the tourist landscape is not just a road, but needs to integrate the elements of transportation and tourism. However, it is the responsibility of the two departments to repair roads and do tourism themselves. The transportation department has increased the tourist element. It also stays in the construction of toilets, consultation centers, information bars and other facilities, and the integration of tourism is not high.
Comparing the famous self-driving route “US Highway 66”, building experience is worth learning.
Landscape design is no longer the fastest route from origin to destination. Rather, it follows the concept of “Driving Fun” to provide your own traveller with the best view of the road; it links points and face-to-face tourist landscapes, preserving both the historical and cultural value of ecotourism resources along the route, as well as organizing a variety of themed events to enhance your participation and relaxation experience.Tourism creates economic benefits.
In addition to landscapes, the camp is an important companion to self-driving trips.
However, among the self-driving tourists known to Xinjing reporters, few consumers choose to stay in the camp.
In their view, many camps are biased towards infrastructure, catering only to food and shelter, low grade and single product, and cannot meet the need for many elements such as self-driving.
Some industry insiders who do not want to be named said that many of the enterprises that worked in the camps in previous years were trying to take land. After taking land, the supporting infrastructure construction and services did not keep up. Many of the operating conditions were lost, and without a later financial injection, it was difficult to make some corresponding complementary products.
Consumer group
According to data released by the China Association of Travel Vehicles in 2017, from the age point of view, the driving group is concentrated between 21 and 40 years of age, with a special focus on 31 to 40 years of age. This group has a certain economic base and has a high demand for personalized tourism and is mostly a parent-child tourist.
According to the accommodation survey, the self-driving population has a relatively higher preference for non-standard accommodation.
Depending on the type of driving, perimeter driving is the main type of driving, accounting for 84.32%.
Exiting and driving is the yearning of many people, but the proportion is smaller.
At the same time, as consumer demand grows, visitors who used to like to drive “sightseeing spots” began to shift their mindset away from “getting out of the car and sleeping in the car” in the course of their own driving. Instead, they focused more on the experience and process of travel.
Dinosaurs use disguise to avoid enemies
At first glance, it was terrible, but it looked like a statue.
Researchers published the first results of a study of rhinoceros-like, incredible biofossils found by Canadian miners, pointing out that this fossil is well preserved, and therefore experts call it “Mona Lisa in the dinosaur world.”
This fossil is well preserved and can even be determined that its scale skin is red brown. This suggests that it has had some “troubling experiences”.
The report in Contemporary Biology describes it as “one of the best preserved dinosaurs ever discovered and one of the best dinosaurs in the world.”
The fossil is a newly discovered species of kosher, living in the middle of the Cretaceous Period between 110 million and 120 million years ago.
Its preservation is extremely good and shocked researchers, who describe it as “truly amazing”.
According to the National Geographic Magazine, this species of pasta beatles dinosaur fossil is the best preserved dinosaur fossil ever discovered.
March 21, 2011, Sean? Shawn Funk discovered this fossil during mining at the Suncorr Millennium mine near Fort McMurray, northern Alberta, Canada.
At that time, he ran into something that seemed different from the rocks around him, and he decided to look carefully.
The fossils he found were then sent to the Royal Thai Museum of Antiquities in Canada.
Researchers took 6 years to expose the beast to its true face inside a clay of 2,500 pounds (1100 kg).
After such hard work, the final results are now available.
“If you look at it, you will almost believe it is sleeping”, Scientist of the Royal Terrell Museum, First author of Caleb? According to Caleb Brown. The creature was on display at the exhibition hall.
“It will be one of the most beautiful and best-preserved dinosaur specimens in the history of science - Mona Lisa in the dinosaur boundary.”
Researchers have studied their skin and found that this herbivorous creature, although wearing armor, like a walking tank, may be exposed to major threats from predatory dinosaurs.
The dinosaur with its heavy armor uses red and white camouflage to avoid predators and uses a covert technique known as “anti-shade”, which is also used by many modern animals.
Experts say that in this way it can better integrate with the surrounding environment, thereby avoiding the enemy, which indicates that it is prey by larger dinosaurs.
This 1100 million-year-old creature is part of the Knostalgia family and is now on display at the Royal Terrell Museum of Paleontology for the first time in May.
Museums technician Mark as a member of the team? After 7,000 hours of careful uncovering the veil of the beast, the researchers are now studying it and naming it “Borealopelta markmitchelli”.
The sample is well preserved, allowing Dr. Mitchell and the team of international scientists to record the patterns and shapes of scales and armor on his body.
They found the “shade shield” technique, which is a common defense in the animal world, which means that the back of the creature is darker than the color of its side.
Although “shade-shielding” is common, the results are surprising, as the dinosaur is much larger than the existing animals using shade shielding.
Such dinosaurs are under pressure to be hunted by meat dinosaurs, thus evolving in a favourable direction, enabling them to hide in the opposite base as a means of survival.
However, most of the remaining animals using anti-shade techniques, such as deer, zebra or armadillo, are as small and vulnerable as prey, indicating that the creature is under real existential stress.
“The massive heavy nail dinosaur suffers from crazy prey shows how dangerous Cretaceous meat dinosaur is,” said Brown.
The chemical analysis of the organic composites in its scales also shows that the dinosaur's skin color is red brown.
Scientists are continuing to study the lifeline of the creature, including its stomach contents, to find the final food to eat.
In their view, the dinosaurs fell into the river at the time of their death and were then rushed into the sea and eventually sank back down the sea.
At that time, the climate in Alberta was as warm as today's climate in southern Florida, and rivers and oceans may be deeper inland than they are now.
Brown said, “This knot is truly amazing because it is fully covered by its preserved scalar skin, and it has been preserved in the maintenance space so that its original shape can be preserved.”
“So the shape of the creature now is almost the same as that of the Cretaceous era.
You don't need to rebuild it with too much imagination; if you look at it, you'll almost believe it's sleeping.”
The Cretaceous Period is the period when large animal foot dinosaurs roam the earth.
Even though the Tyrannosaurus is the king of the dinosaurs, it only appeared millions of years after the Beatles dinosaurs. Beatles dinosaurs may have been killed by some of their ancestors.
They include high thorny dragons, a beast weighing 6 tons and 38 feet long (11.5 meters).
The latest research found that scientists appearing in Contemporary Biology believe that the knot dragons were washed into the sea after they died and then formed mummies in the earth.
March 21, 2011, Sean? Fink excavated the creature at a millenium mine near Fort McMurray, Alberta, Canada.
According to the museum, it is the world's best preserved beatles dinosaurs, from nose to hips in the area of the skin and armor are complete.
This creature is approximately 18 feet (5 meters) on average and weighs up to 3000 pounds (1300 kg).
It has two 20-inch long tips that stand out from the shoulder.
Researchers believe that such pasta beatles dinosaurs are now active in the western region of Canada, after which flooded rivers rushed into the sea.
However, such dinosaurs are buried at the bottom of the ocean to keep their pits intact.
The fossil remains of this special sample are kept intact, leaving the remaining skin still covered with uneven oracle on the skull of the dinosaur.
Like Michael? As Michael Greshko wrote in National Geographic, this level of preservation is just as rare as the middle color.
The more I look at it, the more I find it incredible.
The remaining skinned fossils are still covered with a mottled armor on the skull of the dinosaur.
Its right front palm is on its side and five toes are up.
I can count it out.”
The reporter learned that the addition of natural or plant-based seaweed acids, preservative acids and amino acid efficiency carriers to the urea production process can improve the efficiency of traditional urea, resulting in an increase of 5 to 10 percentage points in the utilization of seaweed urea, zinc preservative urea, and grain urea nitrogen over ordinary urea.
The environment is friendly and the potential for increased crop yields is clear, especially large particles of value-added urea are also high quality raw materials for BB fertilizers.
This total number of security personnel is twice as high as that of the 2012 London Olympics.
To ensure the safety of the Rio Olympics, Brazil will launch the largest security association ever.
Previously, the Brazilian government said that a total of 85,000 people from the army and police, including 20,000 soldiers and 65,000 policemen, would fight together.
Most of the military will be responsible for guarding the Olympic venues, while the additional 3,000 will be responsible for the security of the international airport, subway stations and streets.
The police patrol other parts of the city, including subways, buses and streets.
It is reported that 6,000 soldiers have arrived in Rio to serve the Olympic security.
They are responsible for patrolling the airport and the main roads connecting the airport and the Olympic stadium, in addition to the four Rio Games.
The introduction of evaluation mechanisms in the service sector is no longer new. For evaluation mechanisms to be effective, it is important that regulation be more effective and not less formalistic.
How radical elements learn to answer the question: “Whose street?”
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrer was troubled.
On the first day of his journey to New York City, the St. Louis was sitting in an Audemars Piguet bed and browsing Facebook on his mobile phone.
She occasionally found a post for a high school student.
It says, “The police have just killed an 18-year-old child who is still lying on the street.”
She was puzzled to find that nobody else posted this message on the feed. She turned off Facebook and opened Twitter.
A @TheePharoah user keeps pushing her to the Dynamic Times.
The live Twitter of a rapper in the St. Louis region live broadcast of the death of Michael Brown. Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old black man, was killed by a white policeman in Ferguson, Missouri.
He posted a picture of Brown's body lying on the street without signs of life, and his body lay on the street for four hours.
“Crazy,” Ferrer thought.
But death is not new to her and her community.
She put her phone down and only opened Twitter again that evening to read the tweets about the crowd gathering on Canfield Avenue.
There's a police video and a photograph of people shouting, and a photograph of a man claiming to be Brown's father, which says, “The Ferguson police have just killed my unarmed son!”
She saw a live feed from a police officer standing in front of a group of protesters with a bark dog.
She said in another video, another policeman raised his rifle and screamed: “I will kill all of you... animals.”
“This is not normal,” said Ferrer in his memories.
“This is not what we used to call a typical murder.”
At that moment, I was shudder.
I was angry and crying.”
She booked a return flight and went home the next day.
After landing at 11 p.m., she took her 6-year-old daughter from her father's home and decided that the two men would go to Ferguson the following morning.
In the next three years, what happened to Ferrer and Ferguson was a new documentary, “Whose street?”, shown in the theater on August 11. theme.
It's a story about survival and protest, love and loss, strength and tenacity from the perspective of people living in this community, crowded with streets demanding answers.
When Ferrer and her daughter drove to Ferguson in a flower dress with coronation accessories, they reopened their discussion of numerous topics before that morning - “About the Black Experience and the Black Situation”.
“Do you remember when I taught you when black people had to fight for their faith?” She recalls.
“We're going to Ferguson now because the police killed an 18-year-old boy, which is wrong.
I had to take her,” said Ferrer later.
“What happened today is the climax of all the things of the past.
She wants to know, see and rise from this.
She needs not only to develop well in terms of radicalism and organization, but also to understand the different dimensions of the black experience and the black situation and what we must do to achieve freedom and emancipation.
Even if I had the privilege of providing her with racist experiences that she had not experienced first-hand, she was no different from other black girls.
If I protect her in this thing, I think I'm hurting her.”
They arrived at Ferguson's first stop at a site opposite the South Florida San Road police station. The site became their camp when the militants waited until the result of police officer Dallen Wilson's eventual non-prosecution.
Ferrer and her daughter were in contact with a local business owner who made a bag lunch.
They prepared the bags and passed them to the protesters.
Slowly, Ferrer began to form a new form of activism.
She said, “My radicalism changed completely after August 9.” As a graduate student at the State University of Missouri at St. Louis, she was President of the Association of Minority Nursing Students, focusing on the food justice and health gap in the black community.
“I have no organizational experience.
This is all about it.”
A few weeks later, Ferrer met with the co-director of the film Sabah Fleyan during a night march.
Fleyan said that she and her photographic director Lucas Alvarado Fall “just wanted to record” what happened.
The question arises in Ferrer's mind: “Do you want to record or find a story you can use?”
This suspicion stems from many such cases: people - usually white people - enter a community to benefit from their suffering and tenacity.
As Forleyan explained in a recent interview, “We heard that people who grew up in Ferguson did not concentrate their voices, and we wanted to do it differently.”
Fleyant has contacted the co-director Daimon Davis. Daimon Davis is a regional artist known for his radicalism against death row prisoners.
His involvement led Ferrer to join six other locals in “Whose street?” The project team continued to give up several years after Brown was shot.
“This documentary is not about people speaking for us or talking to us. This is our statement.” Davis said.
“I'm primarily concerned about how these people are presented, because this is how I am presented.”
Although the goal is not to focus on Ferrer's experience - but to show the campaign “not about the Saviour Leader, but about community cohesion”, Fleyant said - it turns out she was the most open to film participants.
The result, “Whose street?” Surprisingly recorded Ferrer's personal life, such as falling in love and marrying.
“I feel naked,” Ferrer laughed the first time he saw the finished product.
“But I understand that there must be a degree of vulnerability to do this and to make black people sexual.”
In addition, the story of Ferrer reaffirmed and repositioned the role of black cool women in the broader black life events movement.
Two of the three founders of the campaign - #BlackLivesMatter created on social media after the 2012 black teen Trevor Martin shooting - were identified as cool.
“Black cool women in leadership generally support this movement,” said Ferrer. “It's because we're fighting on multiple fronts.
Black cool women have to bear it all.”
Forleyan agreed and mentioned, “This movement really has the support of black women and many black cool women.”
Because of her identity, Ferrer was chosen as the core of the film. However, she insisted, “This is not affirmative action for things.”
“She was the one who inspired this energy,” she said.
“Although she's on the front line, it's not a coincidence. Because in life at these crossroads, as a black cool woman, you have a lot to do.
Through the screen, you can feel her energy.”
At the same time, in Ferguson, news cameras had long disappeared, but tensions between communities and the police persisted.
Ferrer was sentenced to more than two and a half years' probation for attempting to block the highway during a procession.
She describes the socio-political atmosphere in what she calls home: “A mess.”
Nevertheless, since she went to the streets of Ferguson three years ago, she has persisted in her efforts to remember the sacred song.
“It is our duty to fight for freedom.
It is our duty to win.
We must love each other and support each other.
We can no longer lose, except the shackles on our bodies.”
In fact, online translation services were already available on the Internet 10 years ago, and in fact, long ago, the argument that “machines are about to replace human translators.”
Parallels: Artists use Chelsea? DNA Creative Portrait of Chelsea Manning
There are several faces in the center of the New York Friedman Art Gallery: white, black and brown, with almost undetectable similarities between each face, which are tied by lines down from the ceiling.
These 30 portraits are made by artist Heather? Dewey? The use of Chelsea in Dewey-Hagborg? Manning sent her cheek cotton sign and hair crumbs for creation.
Manning sent hair chips from Livingwosburg prison and was sentenced to 35 years in prison for leaking confidential diplomatic telegrams via WikiLeaks website.
The exhibition was opened on August 2 under the title “similarities”.
This is Dewey for two years? The result of communication between Hagburg and Manning, Dewey? Hagburg combines his discipline with his own in technology, computer science and art, while Manning, a famous dissident, was imprisoned and underwent transsexual surgery in prison. Former US President Obama pardoned her remaining sentence three days before the end of her term.
An algorithmic analysis from Manning's DNA creates 30 portraits of “a likely appearance”. Heathiduwi Gaborg made a sharp and somewhat ruthless comment. His comments were about both the multipurpose nature of DNA and the very concept of identity.
Manning was born under the name Bradley Edward, who publicly admitted that he was a woman in adolescence. Convicted in 2013, involving 20 charges, including 6 espionage law violations, computer fraud and theft.
In prison, her image was suppressed, with only one photograph, a black-and-white self-photograph with a grain sense, apparently uncomfortable, sitting on the driver's seat, wearing a platinum wig.
In 2015, Heather Dewey Gaborg achieved great success in her 2012 project Stranger Visions.
In that work, she used medium court exhibits from smokies and gum, DNA extracted from crumbs, to create 3D portraits of characters that might look similar.
That was an email she just received from Paper Magazine.
“They want to interview Chelsea Manning in prison and need a portrait,” said Heathiduwi Gaborg to the media at the opening of the exhibition.
Chelsea Manning was unable to visit or take pictures, so they contacted Chelsea to ask her if she was interested in making a DNA portrait.
So the artist and her incarcerated muse became an impossible pen friend and exchanged many letters for two years.
They even created a comic book, “Stopped avatar”, drawn by Shoili Kanungo. The comic book foresaw that the President could grant privileges to Manning in the future and that she would be able to see the exhibition in prison.
Obama asked for her release a few days after the book was published. It may be a coincidence that Manning spent his seventh year in Kansas Military Prison.
In addition, the exhibition has another depth. Because in contemporary America, the Trump government is constantly declaring war on government secrets and transgender soldiers, while looking for new ways that can be speculated on Twitter to blatantly incite division, and this exhibition is intended to bridge this divide.
When asked about all this special time, Heathiduwi Gaborg said, “There is a reason for anything to happen.”
In the artist's statement written on the gallery wall, Manning's oversized signature is below (“i” in the name is painted with a heart), calling for an end to “the mess of parties based on gender, sexual orientation and culture.”
The opposite wall is her linear particle DNA sequence, with a pencil twisted and curved the symbols Cs, Gs, and As.
By including 200 letters (or nucleotides, complex scientific dictionaries for each artist), Heathiduwi Gaborg wants to express, at least physically, this way for everyone by depicting these strange and similar portraits.
“I want people to get out of this predicament, our genome will not care who we are, how open genetic data are interpreted and how subjective it is,” said Heather Dewey Gaborg, whose 2007 video, False Memory, is also on display.
“DNA data tells us many different stories, so this is 30 of them.”
The last piece of the exhibition, in a room, comes from a page in the novel in the previous illustration.
Demonstrated Manning in the American soldier's hand-held loudspeaker float and diamond shape.
“When they stop your speech, they win”, written on the wall.
“So don't shut up.”
“The content comes directly from a letter she wrote to me,” said an artist from Philadelphia.
“I am afraid again, I still have to say.”
Manning has not seen this exhibition personally, as foreseen in the comics, but when she does, she will be hailed by her own DNA portrait mask, like a group of protesters at the pavilion centre.
It is also purposeful, like all the items in the exhibition, to reach the height of her genetic monofold information in pencil (5.2 feet, height of Manning).
“In the past, I hung them to the wall, but I hope they feel like a group of people”, Dewey? He said when talking about the portrait.
“But I want them to feel like a group of protesters with Chelsea, just as people protested to release her.”
Northwest University professor and Oxford University staff wanted for murder.
Police said that a man was found to have been fatally stabbed in a luxury apartment in Chicago. A Northwest University professor and an Oxford University employee were subsequently wanted and are currently looking for suspects nationwide.
The Cook County Court recorded that on Monday, 42-year-old Wyndham Lesham and 56-year-old Andrew Warren were arrested without bail for a first-degree murder on suspicion of the death of Trenton H. James Connell Durrano.
Connell Durrano, 26, was documented to have died of multiple stab wounds.
A community alert issued by the Chicago police said the body was found on July 27.
The police arrived at the Grand Plaza apartment after receiving a call and found multiple cracks on the victim's body.
According to the police, Connell Durrano died instantly and the detective was investigating the murder, while the police were actively looking for two suspects.
Letheim has been an Associate Professor of Microbiology and Immunology at Northwest University since 2007.
In an e-mail statement, Alan K. Kobayci, Deputy Director of the Campus Relations Department, said that Lessham had now been separated from his post and had been banned from the Northwest University campus.
“Now this is a criminal case, the relevant authorities are investigating, and Northwest University is actively cooperating with the investigation.”
Warren is Senior Finance Assistant at Oxford University.
“We have been in contact with the British police and are ready to assist US investigative agencies as needed,” said a spokesman at Somerville College, Oxford University, in an e-mail statement.
The statement added that Warren's colleagues were deeply shocked and hoped that he would surrender.
Anthony Guremy, Chief Liaison Officer of the Chicago Police Department, strongly encouraged suspects to surrender to the authorities.
Guremi said, “The police already have an approximate idea of their whereabouts, and we are trying to locate possible locations.”
Guremi said that local, regional and national authorities are making every effort to help search suspects.
Gurelmi said that the police had received a phone call from the manager of the Grand Plaza apartment, and he had just received a secret reminder that something had happened at apartment 1008.
The police said the situation was terrible.
Guremi said it is still unclear whether the incident also occurred on July 27.
He said that according to the security cameras, it was confirmed that Lessham and Warren were in the building.
“We believe Professor Lessem has something to do with the victims,” said Gulemi.
The management team of Grand Plaza issued a statement to the residents, saying: “The police are currently studying the timeline and background of the victim's case and are investigating various motives, including a possible domestic incident.”
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Muteko said, “We will complete the road map of the World Anti-Doping Agency in the near future”
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Muteko said that it would not take too long to implement the remaining standards of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) for restoring the rights of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA).
“The implementation of the roadmap standards has reached a certain stage, and RUSADA has acquired the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD (British Anti-Doping Agency).
The WADA road map has been updated in this regard,” Muteko said on Thursday.
Deputy Prime Minister Muteko made the above statement when commenting on the second part of the World Anti-Doping Agency Road Map Compliance. This section sets out the criteria for the restoration of RUSADA rights and has recently been published on the organization's website.
According to Muteko, the standards do not contain anything that could cause concern in Russia.
He added, “Everything has to be announced and everything will be implemented.
The results will be presented to the IOC and WADA in the near future.”
However, one of the criteria mentioned in the list is that the Russian Anti-Doping Agency must publicly accept the findings of the investigation approved by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren on WADA concerning Russian State support for doping in national sports.
Speaking of this matter, Muteko said: “We are investigating and our anti-doping system has undoubtedly failed.
All measures have been implemented.
But there is no national plan behind this, and we will not admit what does not exist.”
Muteko's remarks echoed those of Vitaly Smirnov, head of the Independent Public Anti-Doping Commission of Russia.
In an interview with the media Russian outlet RSport earlier that day, Smirnov acknowledged the problems of the Russian anti-doping agency in the past, but added: “We have said on many occasions that the report contains controversial positions and provisions.
No one plans to accept this report unconditionally,” said Smirnov.
After the doping scandal in November 2015, WADA suspended the right of RUSADA to perform doping tests in Russia.
However, in June this year, RUSADA was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and UKAD.
During his visit to the organization's headquarters in Moscow in July, WADA Director General Olivia Negrie said that RUSADA was “moving in the right direction” and trying to restore its rights.

Croatian Football Association President Davo-Suk said in an interview that the Chinese Cup is very important for Croatian football and the Chinese Cup is very large.
No longer need to look for a substitute purchase! These 8,000+products are duty-free.
At the regular press conference convened by the Ministry of Commerce on January 11, a press spokesman from the Ministry of Commerce said at a peak that, to date, 15 FTA has been in force in China, covering 23 countries and regions, covering more than 8,000 imported products with zero tariffs.
At the same time, imported cosmetics, Icelandic salmon, Chilean wine, and ASEAN tropical fruits... you don't have to spend a lot of money on these products.
Currently, 16 free trade agreements have been signed with 24 countries and regions, and 15 have entered into force, covering over 8,000 imports with zero tariffs.
In the case of agricultural products, with the implementation of the FTA, consumers can enjoy good quality and cheap agricultural products from different origins throughout the year.
For example, in ASEAN, tropical fruits such as durian, lychee and firedragon fruit have been reduced from 15 to 30 per cent to zero tariffs.
(b) The reduction of tariffs on imports of Icelandic salmon from 10 to 12 per cent to zero;
(a) Wine in Georgia and Chile, with import tariffs reduced from 14 to 30 per cent to zero;
New Zealand's specialty agricultural products, such as beef and milk powder, have also experienced significant tax reductions.
In the case of industrial products, for example, tariffs on the import of some cosmetics in Switzerland have been reduced to zero;
(a) A 50 per cent reduction in tariffs on imports of some watches, which will be reduced to zero in a few years;
In Korea, import tariffs for products such as refrigerators, cooking pots, massage machines and beauty machines have been reduced by 40% and will be reduced to zero in a few years;
There have also been relatively large tax reductions in consumer electronics, among others.
At the same time, zero-tariff products under the FTA also include intermediate products and raw materials required for the manufacture of many domestic end-consumer goods, and to some extent contribute to the structural upgrading of domestically produced consumer goods.
A press spokesman from the Ministry of Commerce said at a peak that nearly one third of our total imports can benefit from preferential tariffs under the FTA, most of which are final consumer goods, bringing tangible benefits to consumers.
Further reduction of tariffs on consumer imports
As of 1 December 2017, we have adjusted import tariffs on some consumer goods to further reduce import tariffs on consumer goods, covering all types of consumer goods such as food, health products, medicines, daily necessities, clothing and footwear, household equipment, cultural entertainment, and daily groceries.
The average tax rate for this group of consumer goods will drop from 17.3% to 7.7%, almost “stalled”!
On 1 January 2018, we also partially adjusted other import and export duties.
The import tariffs for some cosmetic products such as lipstick, eye shadow, perfume have been reduced from 10 per cent to 5 per cent;
When tariffs are lowered, it means that consumers do not need to buy on their behalf, much less to go abroad to buy favorite foreign products.

Outgoing: Year-end US Mall regulations vary widely shopping returns need to be cautious
Chinanews.com, December 29
According to the US World Daily, Christmas has just passed, and returns are coming.
According to ABC, more than half of the merchandise sold last Christmas was returned.
In addition, readers have been deceived for multiple outlets, and consumers need to be careful when shopping on informal websites.
In general, large shopping companies have regular and reasonable return procedures, but care must be taken to buy gifts or e-commerce from small shops.
On December 1, local time, Ms. Hou of Roland Gang bought a coat for over 60 yuan (US dollars, below the same) in an online shop specializing in printing jackets, which has not yet been sent.
She emailed the customer service and did not reply.
Another netizen blew up, went to the United States last year to travel to buy a cell phone from a third party seller, and after sending it, it was discovered that it was a box of rubber mud.
Once you know that you've been cheated, request a refund from the website and get a full refund.
However, customers also believe that the website refund service is not 100% perfect.
Mr. Wang, a resident of Chinese origin in Northern California, said that an expedited shipping service for a website had been purchased twice, and an expedited service of four yuan had not been delivered on time twice.
No response was received after requesting a refund.
There are good return policies for large malls or shopping malls.
Most Macy Department Store (Macy's) items are fully refunded within 180 days.
However, the item must remain “original” and must have proof of purchase such as a receipt or bank purchase record.
In the absence of a certificate, the customer can also earn Mall Points, which can be used to purchase other items.
Target usually has a 90-day return period for general goods, and electronics usually 15 days.
However, the return period for electronics and entertainment items purchased between November 1 and December 25, 2017 was extended to 30 days.
It is important to note that the 30-day refund period starts on December 25, that is, by January 25, 2018.
Extreme shopping experience, new era of shopping development in the business community
More than a decade ago, our country was generally in the seller market, with limited choice and demand.
However, after 10 years of development, the market has already shifted from the seller's market to the buyer's market, and today consumer tastes have become more disgruntled, and they are no longer satisfied with simple “one-hand, one-hand” shopping.
As a result, getting consumers a shopping experience becomes the next competition for real estate developers.
Among the many factors that affect the consumer shopping experience, shopping centers in the business community have the greatest impact.
See how city builders focus on shopping experiences.
There are no two exactly the same leaves in the world, let alone two exactly the same shopping malls, a famous shopping mall necessarily has its own characteristics.
For example, the world-renowned Kanyon Mall in Turkey, with its unique wave-shaped architecture inspired by the Canyon, Kanyon, known as the tunic, walks in Kanyon's 200-meter trail as if it were in the Grand Canyon.
In addition to the canyon-style design, there is a large, inward-concave oval show in the center of the shopping mall.
Thanks to the open platform design, visitors can walk on every level overlooking the activities carried out in the “canyon” and have a step-by-step effect.
In China, Nanjing Forest Moore Commercial Street, known as China's first forest-style stroll, combines shopping with ecology and fairy tales.
7000 sqm green square, 3000 sqm rooftop water platform, the project consists of nine monomer buildings, between the buildings connected by the air, the whole sunken courtyard design, take the edge of the French sycamore trees for the building surface, rooftop water platform, create a forest-like feeling.
Walk into the forest Moore, just like accidentally fell into the rabbit hole in Alice's memorable encounter, climbing along the trunk of the building surrounded by meadows and springs, bringing people into a vibrant and vibrant forest.
Also in Chongqing, Longhu built the Liga Harbor, plans to introduce more than 50 top international specialty flagship stores, more than 100 top international brands and more than 500 famous domestic and foreign brands in the future, creating a business center with strong thematic characteristics for service industries.
In addition, the Lijiabei Aquarium will be ecologically integrated into the building, guided by TOD public transport, combining fashion shopping, living services, catering, entertainment, education, sports, and bringing consumers the ultimate shopping experience while also leading them to the unique “waterfront culture” of Chongqing, which will combine shopping with water entertainment and leisure.
In summary, it can be found that at present some housing companies have learned about the discovery trajectory of this new urban business, and industry insiders say that this consumption pattern, which is centered on the consumer experience, and how to combine shopping and experience, will also be the mainstream of urban development in the future.
Today's business community is not just a collection of goods, it is more an integrated place that combines artistic culture and creative themes, but also carries responsibility for urban living.
Therefore, while meeting the consumer's one-stop material needs for food, drink and play, maximizing the multi-level spiritual needs of transmitting culture and art, and fulfilling the need for habitable living, is necessarily a high point for the future development of the business community.
In Chongqing, Guoxing's North Shore Jiangshan, located in Jiangbei, is close to the Guanyin Bridge, amassing the world's business excellence, international giants around, first-class brands come together and connect with international fashion.
This is a stunning place where the best of the world is at its finest;
Dongwon Hyatt has a better shopping environment, with Dongwon Hyatt close to the South Ping business district, enjoying the western and even the country's leading four-storey three-storey transportation system, enhancing shopping comfort.
In addition, landscaping and landscaping were upgraded on two pedestrian streets, Huiyong Road and Wanda Square, planting about 300 trees in Qiao Mu, reconstructing 40,000 square meters of land and raising the image of the South Ping business circle;
On the other hand, Longhu Yu Lake No. 1, close to Chongqing's first low-density waterfront business district - Liga Ka Bin Water Business Circle, surrounded by nine parks, the commercial neighborhood is low density and high level of openness, making people more willing to stay, stay, slowly enjoy shopping, rather than being held hostage by the flow of people behind to rush forward and make a real “walk shopping”.
Today's commercial competition will only get fierce, and how to kill a blood line in a highly homogeneous market and win the reputation of “shopping holy places” in the minds of future consumers deserves serious consideration by all real estate developers.
The strategy of differentiation alone is far from enough. Only those developers who really put consumers in their hearts and minds, think about what consumers think, and provide consumers with a minimalist and simple shopping experience can laugh at the storm's coming market.
Of course, at the end, I think it is still the people of Chongqing who have such a good shopping experience and business circles that no one could have imagined the bustling of today 10 years ago.
Festivals: Consumer carnival masks real environmental prices
168.2 billion yuan, this is November 11, 2017, “Tmall Double 11 Global Carnival” within 24 hours, Tmall users consume the deal.
Specifically, after the start of the “Double 11”, the turnover of the cat in just three minutes exceeded 10 billion, 6 minutes and 05 seconds by more than 20 billion yuan, and 9 hours by 100 billion.
On that day, the total amount of payments made by consumers worldwide through treasure payments reached 1.48 billion, an increase of 41 per cent over last year.
These consumption will result in 812 million logistics orders.
Whether it's a Skycat online shopping platform or a PayPal payment platform, all belong to Ma Yun's Ali Group.
Ten years ago, no one would have imagined that on November 11, single youths created their own ridicule to create a “bamboo festival” subculture that will be cataloged by e-commerce and become today's “double 11” shopping carnival.
On November 11, 2009, Alibaba first used the marketing gimmicks of the “Bare Day Promotion”: no one was in love with you, so the “single dogs” came to buy online.
The result is surprising, this day Taobao Marketplace (the “Tiancat” predecessor) traded more than 52 million yuan, 10 times the amount of the day-to-day trades.
Since then, the “Double 11” has become a shopping carnival created by Alibaba. From the beginning, domestic buyers and sellers have entertained themselves, to the current influx of global merchants, nine years have passed, and Tencat's “Double 11” 100 billion transactions have been more than 3200 times that year, making “Black Friday” unexpected.
With the “Double Eleven” promotion of Feng Tian Cat, there are many e-commerce merchants, among which “Jingdong” is the strongest.
“Jingdong” has its own shopping festival “6.18”, but there is no “double 11” influence. This year, from November 1 to November 11, the accumulated sales of “Jingdong” reached 1.271 billion yuan.
And “Double 11” followed by similar “Double 12” discounts, Christmas New Year shopping period.
After the New Year, waiting for Chinese consumers also before the Spring Festival purchase period, Valentine's Day shopping period, consumption, will not be vacation.
Environmental problems caused by instantaneous consumption have been brought to the attention of professionals and institutions.
According to Xinhua Daily Telegraph, according to the usual standard conservative estimate of 0.2 kilograms per box in the industry, this year's “double 11” period produced at least 300,000 tons of garbage.
Liu Hua, director of the pollution prevention and control project of the Green Peace East Asia Division, told the Chinese and foreign dialogue that the order volume of the “Double 11” cats alone will generate 160,000 tons of packaging garbage this year.
The National Post Office released a report in 2016 that in 2015 the volume of fast-paced items during the “double 11” period (November 11-16) was about 780 million, using more than 3 billion woven bags, 9,922 million boxes, 16,985 million m tape, tape length can be around the Earth's equatorial 425 circle.
This year, the National Postal Administration expects the volume of “double 11” fast-moving items to exceed 1.5 billion items.
Wang Shi, manager of a garbage incineration center in Beijing, told Xinhua that the daily entry of garbage after “double 11” exceeds 2,000 tons, and also exceeds the processing capacity of the incineration station.
The courier company has realized that the environmental pollution caused by the courier industry cannot be underestimated.
Some e-commerce logistics enterprises, including Su Ning, introduced recyclable reusable plastic courier boxes, recycled bags that can be reused as shopping bags and garbage bags, etc., but the customer acceptance rate is not high.
Ma Yun also called on the logistics industry to support “green packaging” and “green logistics.”
The microblog has harvested more than 68,000 “likes”.
What kind of mobile payment do the Germans want?
Zhang Dongfang: The mobile payment battle in Germany is not expected.
WeChat Payments and Alipay have not moved the battlefield to Europe, the competitors have not changed, and the positions taken by them have not changed - the Chinese, this is also global?
Where there is treasure payment, there must be WeChat payment.
In accordance with the agreement with German e-payment service provider Wirecard, WeChat payment officially began to land in Germany in November of this year, and gradually layout the merchants in Europe.
This exotic reunion between the two “hometowns” took place in Europe.
Pampering and WeChat have been paying a high song on the road to globalization.
With regard to the global approach to mobile payments in China, Erie Consults China's Third Party Mobile Payment Industry Study 2017 concluded that the first is through strategic investment, the export of experience, equity and the support of home-grown mobile payment companies abroad.
Second, through the consumption behavior of Chinese tourists abroad, mobile payment services are promoted to overseas merchants, thus changing the perception and acceptance of China Mobile payments in foreign countries.
Indeed, the Chinese people have to be around the world.
The rapid economic development of China, coupled with the large population base, is an attractive figure for Chinese tourists spending in Europe.
But this is also doomed to the fact that this time the China Mobile Payments campaign in Germany is not expected.
WeChat payments and treasure payments are just moving the battlefield to Europe. The competitors have not changed, the positions they seized have not changed - still Chinese, this is also global?
More ground-breaking exploration is whether China's mobile payments can open up its territory in Europe?
Take Germany as an example.
“New Retail” with magic.
Chen Zhao Lei, Yang Kai-han: Amazon announces its entry into bookstores and grocery stores as it squeezes into the world's top ten retailers.
In November 2015, Amazon opened its first physical bookshop in Seattle, followed by two bookstores in Portland and Santiago.
Starting in 2017, Amazon opened a store in New York and plans to have at least eight stores by the end of the year.
Almost at the same time, Amazon announced that no supermarket (Amazon Go) was running on a trial basis, that customers did not need to queue up or checkout when they arrived, that they could sweep the code, take the desired item and leave, and that the purchase amount was automatically deducted from the customer's Amazon account.
As far as Amazon is concerned, it is a very unexpected event to suddenly move on top of the physical store in recent years.
As early as 2007 in the Open Letter to Shareholders, CEO Jeff Bezos stressed that Amazon will not easily open a physical store unless the following four conditions are met at the same time:
1. We must be convinced that this new opportunity will give shareholders a return on their investment;
2. We must be convinced of the significance of this new opportunity for the company as a whole;
3. We must be convinced that this new opportunity is ignored by the market;
4. We must be convinced that in this market we have enough resources to make customer-oriented differentiation.
Bookstores and grocery stores are the most crumbling categories of retail in both entities, and are the first opponents of Amazon's emergence.
When Amazon squeezes into the world's top 10 retailers, it's worth playing with both timing and motivation.
Does Amazon's practices contravene the warranties in shareholder letters?
Similar voices were heard on the other side of the planet. On the morning of October 13, 2016, at the 2016 Hangzhou Yunqi Congress, Alibaba Board Chairman Ma Yun delivered a keynote speech.
He said: “Starting next year, Alibaba will not mention the term 'e-commerce'.
The era of pure e-commerce will soon come to an end, with no e-commerce in the next decade or 20 years, replaced by 'new retail'.
Online and offline logistics combined to produce new retail.”
At one time, the three words “new retail” were magically applied and were frequently hung up by the industry.
But what does “new retail” mean?
This concept is not new if it is only a combination of online and offline.
In 2016, eMarketer, after tracking the 180 largest e-commerce businesses, estimated total e-commerce sales to be around $200 billion, with the top 25 accounting for over $159 billion.
Of these 25, 18 are traditional retailers (such as Macy, Nordstrom, Target, Gap, etc.) who have only started operating online in the last five years.
Alibaba Group also has a history of 283 billion yuan in shares in Suning Yun.
Globally, retailers and e-commerce are moving from a single channel to a full-channel retail system that covers physical, e-commerce, mobile and social media.
Is Ma Yunty “new retail” more a summary than a vision for the future?
If not, how does the whole channel concept differ from “new retail”?
Perhaps the point is not whether or not online and offline will blend, but how.
Looking back at the retail sector over the past 20 years, the rise of e-commerce, like the rise of earlier discounted retailers, has focused on prices and convenience.
With these two pain points, e-commerce moved highly standardized products such as books and CDs from offline to online.
As online consumption habits grow and customer experience grows, e-commerce extends its tentacles to other categories and begins to improve efficiency.
In the words of Alibaba CEO Zhang Yong, “Using the ideas and technology of the Internet to comprehensively reform and upgrade the existing total of about 30 trillion social retailers, the increasing consumer demand of Chinese consumers can be effectively met, making the entire process of commodity production, circulation and services more efficient because of the widespread use of the Internet and big data.”
Thus, the road of e-commerce is a road of surface light assets, real heavy assets.
“Light” means that the burden of fixed assets, staffing, management processes, etc. is not large in the traditional retail industry; “heavy” means the need for huge investment in logistics, warehousing, etc.
Changes in logistics ensure efficient e-commerce.
According to the news from the Chinese government network, Premier Li Kexiang of the State Council presided over a general meeting of the State Council on April 28. The meeting held that expanding domestic consumption demand was an important step in stabilizing growth and reconciling structures.

On January 18, Alibaba held an E-commerce Summit Dialogue in Chongqing, announcing that by exploring a new model of “Internet+Poverty Eradication”, it will help to boost accurate poverty eradication and rural revitalization.
This is another “coding” of Ali's anti-poverty attack following the introduction of the rural strategy, the launching of the rural Taobao project, the development of an anti-poverty platform for rural farmers and the establishment of the Alibaba Anti-Poverty Fund.
The fight against poverty is one of China's most important national strategies.
The total eradication of poverty has never been achieved in China in the past few millennia.
“Poverty alleviation by e-commerce is an innovative new round of pro-poor development. It is an important grasp for achieving accurate poverty alleviation and poverty eradication.
The central government attaches great importance to and points out that it can play the role of the Internet in helping to push the fight against poverty, promote accurate poverty alleviation, and get agricultural products out of rural areas through the Internet.”
As a result, as early as 2014, Ali proposed a village strategy, along with big data cloud computing and globalization, as three of its three core strategies for the next 20 years.
In the same year, Ali launched the Rural Taobao (Village Taobao) project to recruit “Village Taobao” in the countryside, leading farmers to fight poverty and wealth through e-commerce.
In 2017, Ali partnered with the business sector to create a pro-poor channel for Xingnon, which currently connects 13 provinces and 120 poor counties at the national level.
The village of Taobao, which is boosted by the Ali platform, already has 2118.
Of these, nearly 400 are found in poor counties in the provinces and 33 in poor counties in 13 countries.
In 2017, on Alibaba's Chinese retail platform, Taobao Village nationwide sold 120 billion yuan.
Zhang Yong said that in the face of the national strategy to fight poverty, Ali has been thinking about how to use the technological, big data, cloud computing and other innovative capabilities of the Ali economy to make a new way out of poverty.
Among them, MuraoTao is the main hosting platform for Alibaba e-commerce to fight poverty, and has walked through a new direct-to-market Internet link to fight poverty.
In the planting chain, Village Tao and Ant Golden Costumes jointly carry out agro-owned tools and micro-credit support.
In 2017, out of 832 poor counties at the national level, ants served 795 and provided easy payment, credit and other services.
Vegetable birds solve storage and logistics, Skycat is responsible for sales, Alibaba Cloud's big data anti-feeding guides agricultural production, further improves the supply standards, quality and market competitiveness of agricultural products.
The development of e-commerce to fight poverty requires not only products, distribution channels, industrial planning, but also human resources.
Ali introduced e-commerce courses at Taobao University to teach farmers a standardized, qualitative and scaled-up planting method, achieving a combination of “poverty alleviation+mindset” to enable farmers to stay out of poverty.
These courses have covered about 92 per cent of the poor counties at the national level.
However, the idea of “public interest mentality and commercial means” to fight poverty can also guarantee that Ali will “truly alleviate poverty” when alleviating poverty.
President Ma Yun of Alibaba's Board of Directors said that poverty eradication should be divided into three phases: poverty alleviation, poverty eradication and wealth.
Poverty alleviation is to teach people to fish, to fight poverty is to teach people to fish, to make rich is to create a “fish pond” for farmers, so that farmers have fish to feed.
The industry driven by the electronics industry is pro-poor, that is, making fish ponds.
In the area of industrial poverty alleviation, the model of Lokhuan apple industry poverty alleviation, which was developed by Ali in cooperation with Luochuan, Shaanxi, has been replicated and promoted nationwide by relevant departments as an example.
The work of Alibaba e-commerce in reducing poverty has also been recognized at the decision-making level.
Alibaba's representative e-business enterprises have been mailed to ensure farmers increase their production and income through online and offline channels.
Some village junior and ant costume staff were also invited to the United Nations and Africa to share the experience of e-commerce in fighting poverty.
Currently, the China office of the United Nations World Food Programme has been working with Muraotao to alleviate poverty in the electronics industry in Anhui and other places.
Sina Financial Information The Third New Economic Think Tank Conference, co-sponsored by the Ali Institute and the Chinese Visionary think tank, was held on January 16. Zhang Li, Director of the Institute of Electronic Commerce of the Ministry of Commerce, attended and made a statement.
In her view, our globalization has in fact overlooked the most important issues, namely, the nature and use of globalization, as well as the stage of globalization.
In this way, many people believe that globalization has stagnated and that many developed and developing countries, in the new phase, have different attitudes towards globalization and different models.
The second concept is the question of the medium-term phase of globalization, and what are the constraints of the medium-term phase of globalization?
It is because of the changing economic base that globalization has been constrained by the economic environment base.
Zhang Li believes that the global economic adjustment will basically end at the end of 2017 and will enter a new cycle of growth after 2018. The next round of growth must be a production pull.
Jingdong's first fresh supermarket, 7FRESH, has officially opened recently and plans to build more than 1,000 stores across the country in the next three to five years.
In addition to Ari's box Horse Fresh, Yongfei's superspecies, Su Fresh in Sonin, and the American Group's fish palm, the “new retail stores” began to be piled up, and “call boards” on innovative models and even prices.
Fresh supermarket competition has escalated and has become a phenomenon-level topic in the new retail sector. Where is the new retail market?
“In 2018, we will quickly enter the country and will open a large number of shops in Beijing, Shanghai and Hangzhou before the Spring Festival.”
Hou Yi, CEO of the Freshing CEO of Boma, disclosed the “new method” of 2018 at the Second New Retail Summit on the 10th.
“Starting in 2018, Carton is not just a fresh e-commerce company, but a lifestyle e-commerce provider that meets the consumer's immediate service.
The core mode offline is lead, experience, online is real sales.”
Different from traditional shopping malls and supermarkets, Fumihashi is a fun and tasty “red shop” in the eyes of many consumers, and even intermediaries have put out the concept of “box room”.
Both online e-commerce platforms and offline retailers have advantages and disadvantages, but consumers appear in multiple channels, so both sides are trying the full-channel mode.
Industry believes that in the general context of consumer upgrading, there will be more and more stores of “carton horses” in 2018.
From the initial freshness, the box horse continues to explore more consumer areas, heralding more innovation in the retail market in the new year.
“For example, the business model of online and offline integration has attracted the eyes of consumers, and the fresh supermarkets that are opened everywhere call the seat well.”
“But it's no use to talk about these relationships any more, and finally whether you have brought a great experience to consumers, I'm willing to pay for them.”
In the view of Yuan Bin, the joint CEO of the Tai Yun Fat Cow Network, consumers have changed their habits and their purchasing needs have changed in the new retail environment.
It turns out that pure lines and sublines are cracked. Underline lines need to defeat lines, online lines need to counter lines, and now we are jointly holding hands, because consumers are no longer able to distinguish between offline lines.
The competition for capital has allowed the new retail powder flavor, currently represented by a fresh supermarket.
Analysts believe that the competition of new retail first-line cities is far from the Red Sea pattern, and that there are still large areas of second-line cities to be excavated, and the market still has great opportunities and space.
The layout of new retailers in different types of industries brings the development of new retailers into a diverse state of development.
CCTV's Financial and Economic Channel, in conjunction with the Institute of Financial and Strategic Studies of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, has prepared a dry product for everyone. This is the annual report on the development of Chinese e-commerce.
What kind of scorecard did Chinese e-commerce produce this year?
What are the trends in global e-commerce?
Let's make it known to all.
Total Sales Re-track Growth Back to Accelerated Track
From 2006 onwards, our online retail sales volume can be said to have been showing an ultra-high growth. It is estimated that at that time, we thought online shopping was very fresh and could buy things without going out. It was cool!
Starting in 2013, however, online retail growth began to fall below 50 per cent, and in 2015 for the first time it was below 40 per cent, and in 2016 it turned to 26.2 per cent.
However, this year the situation is different, online retail volume has again accelerated, this year January-September, the growth rate rebounded to 34.2%.
Much higher than the 2015 and 2016 growth rates.
Probably everyone peddling around, find or buy more to make the person happy.
Among them, online retail sales of physical goods amounted to nearly 5.08 trillion yuan, and online retail sales of services amounted to nearly 1.49 trillion yuan.
The share in total retail sales of social goods reached 13.6 per cent, an increase of nearly 3 percentage points over the same period.
Students, don't doze off, focus, service online retail sales is definitely a great credit!
Second, the French netizens who love to chop off their hands have a per capita online purchase of US $1925, and they buy the most goods online. They are costumes, and they deserve to be the country of love fashion.
You must be a young man who loves online shopping?
Help you avoid becoming the next startups
Amy Erett once wanted to investigate employee happiness at her e-commerce startup, but the survey didn't work.
The responses received are often vague, unhelpful and, worse still, deceptive.
Even though she promised anonymity, some employees still did not trust the process.
Ellett manages 75 people's San Francisco e-commerce hair care company, Madison Reed, who says “there is a lack of consistency and objectivity in the responses received.”
So she called for help.
A number of new human resources startups have sprung up to help companies understand how employees feel.
They build and empower software specifically designed to measure employee participation, which allows companies to conduct quick polls for specific teams and population groups, provide anonymous and complaint hotlines for employees, and in some cases allow whistle-blowers to bypasse executive reports directly to the Board.
“Now you can track your health with tools like Strava and Fitbit, but where is the company's Fitbit?” Jim Barnett, Co-Founder and CEO of Redwood City Startup Glint, said. Glint software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement.
Erett said that in three years, she gained more insights into what employees think and feel with Glint.
In addition to a team-specific quick survey and public opinion poll, Glint also provides company heat maps, which units have the highest number of complaints, and which managers have a low approval score, which gives her an insight into why.
Companies are beginning to realize that they must be proficient in the company's workplace culture so that it does not become the next advantage. Before Euju's former employees published a blog article describing the harassment environment, the speakers were punished by the company, and then Euju fell into a scandal.
For startups like Glint, the company's oversight desire is a business opportunity with little money.
According to the financial technology analysis website Let's Talk Payments, the value of the global governance, regulatory and compliance industry may exceed $187 billion by 2020.
Convercent, a start-up in Denver, Colorado, is committed to helping companies prevent and detect bad behavior, and they saw an increase in interest and activity during the damage to their reputation earlier this year.
Convercent has nearly 600 customers, including Audemars Piguet, Microsoft and Tesla.
Youpei recently signed up to become a customer.
Like Glint, Convercent allows companies to send customized “diagnostic” surveys, collect confidential responses in real time and view heat maps of their problem areas.
Convercent also offers an anonymous SMS hotline for employees to report misconduct.
If the chairman is implicated, the complaint will go directly to the board.
“The Court of Public Opinion usurped the powers of the Supervisory Authority,” said Patrick Quinlan, Founder and CEO of Convercent.
If a company is found to be ill-treated or unethical towards its employees, even if the regulator is not involved, the company may face high consequences of consumer resistance, loss of employees and involvement in litigation, Quinlan said.
Ruby Tuesday is a catering chain that spans more than 500 locations and has more than 25,000 employees, and has been using Convercent for over a year to ensure that employees understand work guidelines and work protocols and provide easy access to the company's headquarters.
Prior to this, if an employee wants to report a problem, he or she must find the company headquarters phone number or e-mail and file a formal complaint, and hopes that it will be taken seriously by the headquarters.
This is often a frightening and unsettling experience, and Ruby Tuesday's chief legal adviser, James Vitrano, said that he did not think there was a good way to track employee complaints.
But now that the company uses Convercent, it can more quickly identify and resolve issues that were previously unknown to senior executives in remote offices, cities or states - such as discrimination, harassment or unfair wage behaviour.
“I can understand the work experience more closely and 360 degrees,” said Vitrano, who is responsible for Ruby Tuesday's risk management team.
“We are protecting our shareholders from employment litigation.”
Quinlan said that since 2002, after the closure of the Andorran accounting firm because of the Anron scandal's breach of ethics, companies have paid more attention to ethics, values and employee professionalism.
But it was only after “social media went into their own world” that companies realized that they could not stop their explosives from spreading viral on the Internet.
“People see hope as a strategy before using technology to monitor ethics,” he says.
Both Glint and Convercent offer their software as a service and charge companies recurring fees for product use.
This business model and business opportunities are supported by venture investors who already support the two startups.
In February, Convercent raised $10 million from companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, with total capital rising to $47 million.
In November, Glint received $10 million from Bessemer Venture Partners, with a total of $60 million.
Given the interconnectedness of companies, cultures and venture investments, these investments are hardly surprising.
A growing number of studies show that employees today expect a higher place of work than before.
In a highly competitive market like Silicon Valley, high-paid and interesting projects are just bets.
Employees want to feel that they are accepted, valued, and that their time is spent in a company with an active mission.
“When people are happy to join the company, feel that their voices are listened to and what they do is useful, they are more committed to making the company succeed,” said Nina McCartney, Vice President of LinkedIn's Global Welfare and Employee Experience. LinkedIn uses both Convercent and Glint software.
Investors repay when their portfolio company performs well; the company performs well in employee loyalty and dedication.
It is not surprising that third-party analytics tools are looking for financial support if they are committed to increasing the loyalty and commitment of their employees.
Workplace cultural experts say it is important to have data on employee engagement.
However, these data are useless unless the company's administrator takes action.
In fact, if a company requires feedback from its employees, it can be expected that the company is undergoing change.
If change does not progress fast enough, or if there is no progress at all, it can lead to disappointment and disengagement.
“If you want to look for 4000 suggestions, then you need to be ready for 4000 conversations,” said Russell Lacers, head of consulting business at Cot International. He had seen some companies relying too heavily on data acquisition errors.
“Because if you don't follow through, the staff will think, 'Did you really hear what I said?
Do you care?
If you don't care, why do I care?”
According to Erett, Madison Reed now conducts monthly employee surveys and is able to take action on the day Glint reports the issue.
After collecting feedback from employees about their frustration due to speed of decision-making and quality of communication, she is able to solve problems by reorganizing teams within the company and increasing communication training.
Ruby Tuesday is gaining new insights about its employees and in the long run they want to transform and better retain their employees in an industry that is known for its high brain drain rate.
“If you are not committed to creating a culture of transparency, you will lose talent,” said Vitrano.
“If you lose talent, you lose your customers.
And when you lose your customers, you lose your company.”

NCAA cancels training twice a day to extend the Bear team's daytime training time
Late at 11 pm, UCLA football team members wander around the team's new campus exercise.
Some players have taken off their sweatshirts and exposed the sweaty back of the first day of the training camp.
For a large part of the team, these free minutes are rest time.
After a three-hour exercise, players who take the summer course will return to the dormitory for the final exam, then return to the Wasserman Football Center the next morning at 6.30 a.m.
“The next three days are a grinding of these guys,” said Jim Mora, Bear coach, as he approaches Tuesday.
NCAA cancels two exercises per day (designed to ease the player's burden), but actually extends their daytime training - at least by Friday.
That's why the first three training sessions at the University of California at Los Angeles are scheduled to begin at 7:15 pm to adapt to the schedule that players have squeezed.
From canceling training twice a day to more training once a day, the Bears were trained almost a week before the last season, and Mora was trained at the summer school for the first time in six seasons in Westwood.
They are scheduled to start 18 training sessions on August 20 before starting pre-match preparation for the first battle Texas farm workers in September.
Mora said he supported the NCAA's rule adjustment, although it added another item to the player's busy trip.
“In three or four days, we will impose a huge amount of training on them, which is very challenging,” said Mora.
“They also just passed. They were grinding, they were great kids.
I thought Saturday, we'd have more time, really good.”
Once the camp is over, the University of California at Los Angeles will stop training. This is not an easy task considering the clear sight of the nearby parking lot and Luskin Center. Luskin Center Superior Hotel has been thrown all over the body by football that crossed the cylinder behind the ball.
Bear team members will live at the hotel starting this weekend. But Mora admitted that once these rooms are empty during the season, problems may arise.
“We'll take security measures,” said Mora.
“This is a real concern. The idea that someone might rent a room and sit in the room to record training scenes is not far-fetched.
If you have a training video, it's pretty good.
But we will take security measures there as well as security measures in parking lot 8.
We will do the best with the available resources.
I'm not too worried about this.
We have a plan.”

Facebook will launch the Fact Verification feature to combat false news
Facebook announced on Thursday that more potentially prank articles will be sent to third-party detectors and the results will be displayed below the original post. Facebook, the world's largest online social network, is trying to fight so-called false news.
Facebook said in its website statement that Facebook will begin to use updated machines to learn to detect possible pranks and send them to the Fact Finder and may display the Fact Findings below the original post.
Facebook has been criticized as one of the major dissemination points of the so-called false news, and many believe that Facebook influenced the US presidential election in 2016.
This issue has also become a major political topic in Europe. Prior to the May presidential election in France, voters experienced a proliferation of false stories, while Germany took the lead in adopting support for the fines plan prior to the September elections, and would be fined if social media networks failed to remove hate posts in a timely manner.
Facebook said in a separate statement in Germany on Thursday that a new verification feature test is being launched in the United States, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
“In addition to seeing stories questioned by third-party fact-verifiers, people want more background to help them make informed decisions about what they read and share,” said Sarah Su, Facebook News feed product manager in a blog.
She added that Facebook would continue to test its “Related Articles” feature and make other changes to its news summaries to reduce false news.
Create a graphic novel: The Story of the Castle of England
Recently, the small Scotnier Castle was featured in compressed music films and once became a refuge for Mrs. Margaret Thatcher during the 1970s.
But Scotnie has witnessed 700 years of turbulent history in the comfort of the Beale Canyon in Kent, and now it is the source of inspiration for graphic novels written by Jamie Rhodes, a Yorkshire who has a special interest in historical documents and has a towing head.
“You can see the handwriting of an ancient man 300 years ago, and I found it really beautiful,” he said with his eyes.
“What kind of interpersonal bond does this letter have in my hands?”
From the Middle Ages until the Eduard era, “A Castle of England” readings of the families living in Scotnie, each story is composed of different, future British artists such as Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exky Palmer, and Isabel Greenberg.
This is not Rhodes's first archive-based book: He also wrote The Dead's Teeth and Other Stories 2014, a book inspired by the literature of the British Library, a work that he did with an uncontrollable passion for creativity.
He said, “I cannot suppress my writing impulse from the moment I saw the thumb stamp left on the side of the letter, which was written by a double agent working for Jacob in the 18th century.”
“That was his fingerprint!
And the letters always smell smoke, because then you need to light up to be bright.
For us 300 years later, this smell makes people feel that they are also with us.
Oh, I love slotting text!”
For those who are touched by old paper, it seems fantastic to be able to get the support of the National Trust and Arts Council of England and live in the castle for almost four months (“To be honest, I've been a little longer”), and I don't believe it really.
Rhodes spent several days visiting Victoria's “new” castle, looking through archives, studying many treasures and antiquities of the estate, such as hyenas hanging on the wall and bottles that had spent centuries in the moat.
He strolled on the land and ruins of the old castle and chatted with the vagrants, gardeners and sometimes illustrators in his books.
Then in the evening, he would “drink some whiskey and write.”
The secret history of Scotnie is not yet clear, because National Trust entered only after the last heir, Elizabeth Hesse, passed away in 2006.
Ten years later, when Rhodes arrived, the staff started processing the files, and he described them as “centuries ago the nobles were leaving: “Oh, put it in the attic.”
Diaries, letters from the British Empire, maps depicting the boundaries of countries: “You will think land disputes will be boring,” Rhodes said, “But there will be two families fighting for a birch tree.
Let go, guys!”
Some of the stories in this work began with the castle and went on to look at the history of Britain at a broader level, including The Labourer, which traced a man who left the new castle to join the 1381 peasant uprising.
The story of “Kent and Sussex Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex” recorded a riot in the castle in 1380, Rhodes said.
“The peasant uprising began in that region, and I think it was a good place to launch it.
Maybe there's a connection between these two?”
Other stories are deeply rooted in the history of the castle, such as The Priest, which tells the story of the Darel family hiding a Jesuit priest for seven years during the period of British religious reform.
Or The Smuggler, the master of the story is the 18th-century smuggler Arthur? Darel, he was thought to have held his funeral by filling himself with stones filled with coffins (several years later his coffin was exposed to the ground and was discovered).
The Darrells is Roz's favorite Scotnier Castle family: “These gentlemen seem rogue and always borrow money to buy what they can't afford.
Generations of Darel men solve their debt problems by marrying wealthy old women, and I think they should be a handsome group of young men who know how to pursue women.”
As his mission in the castle ended, Rhodes began to look for other strange writing experiences.
He spent two weeks in the Finnish wilderness completing a graphic novel about “El? ¤ m? ¤ nm? ¤ ki”, it was an early 20th century sanatorium, and it was slowly abandoned.
But Scott has a special status for him.
“I left with sadness,” he said.
“It's like: 'Oh, I have to face the real life of the cakes.'

All major energy companies are “rich and enemies”, then who is the best among many energy companies in the world?
Yesterday, the famous PFC Energy Company announced the top 50 ranking of the listed energy companies in 2011. ExxonMobil, the US oil and gas producer, won the championship with a market value of $406.3 billion, followed by the Royal Shell of China and the Netherlands.
In this list of PFC, China Petroleum was raised twice in 2007 and 2009, with ExxonMobil taking the lead in other years.
In the top 50 list in 2011, a total of three companies from Mainland China entered the list. In addition to China Petroleum, ranked 2nd, there were also 9th China Petroleum and 15th China Ocean Oil.
According to PFC statistics, however, although current oil prices are much higher than they were four years ago, PFC Energy Company CEO points out that the reasons for the low total market value are many, including the decline in natural gas prices in North America and the low activity of the global stock market.
According to Xinhua News Agency report, the heavy pollution weather in Jingjin and the surrounding areas began on the 16th and further intensified on the 19th, with AQI in the cities of Shijiazhuang, Xin Zhuang and Handan in Hebei showing a “blast table”.
Changes to Green Card Regulations in the United States
The media quoted President Donald Trump as saying that the United States would introduce a new immigration plan and amend the Green Card regulations.
The plan is intended to reduce legal immigration to 50,000 per year, with more stringent restrictions on temporary work visas and family-oriented visa applications.
The new regulations were introduced by the Republican Party and supported by the President.
The draft law will be discussed in both houses.
The American media quoted Trump as saying, “This law will reduce poverty, raise wages, save billions of dollars for taxpayers, and realize these benefits by changing the way the United States issues green cards to other citizens.
The law would replace the current programme and reduce chain migration.
This new application process is beneficial to applicants who speak English, have financial support and have skills conducive to economic development.”

In order to optimize the landscape and build beautiful Nanyue, the “636” Volunteer Service Brigade of the Nanyue Tobacco Special Bureau (Branch) has recently carried out environmental protection activities of “Mountaineering Forest and Home Friendly”.
The event not only received the support of all cadres and employees of the District Tobacco Bureau, but also attracted retired cadres and workers and dependants to participate in environmental protection practices. The three generations of young people and young people worked together to work together, climb the mountains, clean up the forest and clean up the garbage, and dedicate their part to building the “beautiful southern mountains”.
The purpose of this voluntary service activity is to protect the scenery resources of Nanyue, promote the concept of volunteerism “caring for others, caring for society, caring for nature”, also let the next generation from childhood to receive smoked pottery, inherit the virtues of volunteerism.
It is reported that since the formation of the “636” Volunteer Service Brigade in early April this year, a total of 16 members have been developed. They have carried out a series of volunteer service activities, such as visiting traumatized retail customers, helping smokers to care for tobacco leaves, and the Ya'an Earthquake Love Donation, to become a volunteer force dedicated to passing positive energy.

Sex robots do rise, but we should be careful.
Just when you don't think it's even more weird in 2017, a new technology development report was released in the area of sex robots.
Yes.
Now the sex robot is a big thing.
Recently, the Responsible Robotics Foundation (FRR) published a report outlining the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years.
According to Professor Emeritus of Robotics and Artificial Intelligence of Sheffield University and Co-Founder of FRR Noel? Shaki said that we need to begin to take seriously the rise of sex robots.
Customers can choose the eye color, nipple shape, and nail type of the robot.
When the new report was released, Chaki said, “People laughed behind, but the big companies did launch a lot of sex robots, and we will see more.”
Modern sex dolls have evolved from inflatable dolls to robots with silicone skin that feels warm and deliberately uses artificial intelligence to set up human-like sexual reactions.
Users can also “customize” their robots to suit their preferences, from eye color, nipple shape to nail type or color.
But even more disturbing is that many robots with “personality” make “copying petite wives” look advanced.
Modern sex toys have evolved into robots with silicone skin.
For example, RealBotix robots can be defined according to what the user considers attractive, such as shy.
There are also Roxxxy Gold sex robots developed by True Companion, which pre-set character features, including a slightly shy “Cold Farah” and “Wild Wendy” with “Adventure-ready”.
“Roxxxy Gold Robots have the personality you can match,” said True Companion.
So she loves you, evil you.
She had a little mood that day, like normal people!
She can be lazy, she can talk, or she can 'sexual erection'!”
The rise of sex robots has brought much unease - not just replacing real human relations - but also the subservient feminine character and the implication of rapes drawn in cold (interpreted as resisting) Farah is most worrisome.
True Companion compared Roxxxy to a man's vibration stick on its website.
The site says, “If a woman has a vibration stick, then why can't a man have Roxxxy?”
However, these sex robots are not a simple fetish or just a sex toy.
Their presence and growing maturity point directly to the darker, deeper part of our culture: from perfect gender equality fleeing to sex with obedience as an additional option.
Of course, most men do not have sex robots, and although FRR points to the growing popularity of sex robots, they are still on the verge of consumer culture.
But what infiltrates from the edge gives us an idea of the course of our time.
Many people are not strange or offensive until the free market gives them the opportunity to become so.
It is no coincidence that these sophisticated sex robots are present at a time when women's rights are threatened around the world and that a President of the White House boasts of sexual violence against women.
The most frightened part of the TV drama, The Story of Women, is not the reality of the picture, not the hanging body, nor the pair of eyes that were dug up, but the excessively real imagination.
The Republic of Kiribati was a jump, but now it does not look far away.
The goal behind these sex robots is to do everything possible to create the bodies that are most similar to real women (although in proportion to the pornstars).
The creators of these robots want them to have a human touch and imitate real human movements.
But frankly speaking, their “personality” does not represent real women.
They cannot break up or leave.
They have no recourse to institutions and no follow-up stories, no independence at all and no possibility of breaking the complete illusion of slavery.
In other words, they are sex slaves.
Or according to the popular saying of 2017: to make a woman.
The Great Wall tells the story of an elite Chinese army in ancient times fighting with monsters in the world-renowned Great Wall to defend humanity.
The last issue of the fourth quarter of the Running Bar Brothers has been recorded.

From “Running Men” to “Funny Villains” in “Running Men” to “Villad Angels”, and then “Decadent Man” Chen,” Deng Chao gave the impression to the audience that they were changing.
Deng Chao said, “In the performance, I will not do the same thing, and will keep updating.”
The Great Merit of Trump?
Jean Mitt? Mitt Romney became a microcosm of common sense.
Political differences lead to polarization of the American electorate, and from a microscopic point of view, they undermine the harmony of the American family. This is no wonder for the Trump era.
Before and after Christmas and Thanksgiving, major newspapers in the United States are full of comments about how to deal with the fears of Trump's relatives.
Usually, we are doing our best to crack our “filter foam”.
Less so is the power of Trump to bring the family together.
I mention this because my cousin, a left-wing poet living in Chicago, has long been out of touch with the Republicans in our home, and this week he is coming to New York to visit me.
She reminded me that unity against common enemies can have a powerful effect.
As a result of working with Trump in the White House, all the people she knew, including even the Republican relatives who had had political quarrels for decades, were suddenly and strangely on the same front.
If it's all at the table, it's certainly a good thing. But I am shocked that, from a broader perspective, this poses significant risks.
Although the Left has always been encouraged by Trump, the warping effect of his presidency pushes us all to the right.
When we talk about “normalization” and Trump, we're talking about the possibility of worrying that his strange behavior might stop someday.
However, there is a more worrisome long-term scenario in which Trump is going to “normalize” relations with right-wing Republicans who had previously opposed Mr. President's criteria and now suddenly appear to be a symbol of reason.
I found myself recently against Mitt? The Romney version of the epileptic weird is somewhat remembered: put the dog in the car, 14% income tax (but at least we know his tax returns), the crimes of these two moves seem to be really slight compared to Trump.
After the Trump era, the next Republican candidate needs only reason to qualify for immeasurable improvements.
When my cousin lived in town, we took the kids to the carousel of the New York Park, the largest carousel run by the New York Central Park Administration, and if you don't need coffee, these three dollar tickets are the most consumed value in the city.
Trojan horses sound like thunder, the central cylinder is designed for fiberglass, all clowns and animals twist over their heads, horrible and sinister looking at their shoulders, while the music of the dinges rings oddly.
Too many vulgar cities are disappointing: the landscape overlooking high-rise buildings becomes old, the skyline becomes too familiar to provide too much stimulation, and the reality of the city does not support dreams.
Thirty-five years later, I haven't completely forgotten that day, and I found that this Swiss cabin is not actually a Swiss cabin, but rather an old Swiss cabin in the theme bar, Ye Olde Swiss Cottage, which I can't remember, but near a crossroads in northern London.
However, the Central Park Carousel is still a magical experience for two 2-year-olds, one 11-year-olds, and four 40-year-olds with two girls who can participate in the event.
If I could evaluate the carousel, I would give it full points, but fortunately no one asked.
But this week, in a department store, I was asked to rate my trading “experience” for one to five stars before I brush my credit card.
This is also true in the cafes in the corner of my street, and you can choose to rate it with 15% tips to buy things on the counter.
The effect of this is not only to slow down what should have been neutral transactions, but also to put pressure on waiters to add personal factors to unwanted scenarios.
The poor woman in the department store was sorry to laugh, and I was tired, and the credit card trading experience gave her five stars.
Oscar Pistolis transferred from prison to hospital for chest pain
This was the second time that Pistol left prison and was transferred to hospital.
Last year he was taken to a hospital to treat his wrists, which were officially claimed to have been caused by his fall in his cell.
Pistolis was convicted of murder following an appeal by the prosecutor against the initial decision to miskill.
At dawn on Valentine's Day in 2013, he shot SteinCamp several times through the toilet compartment door in his home in Pretoria, leading to his death.
Pistolis claims to have mistaken her girlfriend as an intruder hiding in the compartment at night.
The prosecutor has announced their intention to appeal again, this time for a six-year sentence against Pistol, which they consider too lenient.
The National Public Prosecutor's Office indicated that an appeal would be lodged with the Supreme Court of South Africa and that the appeal could be heard this year.
If the prosecutor succeeds, Pistolis will face an increased sentence of 15 years.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.

On May 18, the Ministry of Finance announced the “Restructuring of Industrial Enterprises Special Award and Replenishment Fund Management Scheme”, which will arrange special reward funds to promote the deconstructing of excess production capacity in the coal and steel industries, with a total value of 100 billion yuan.
Recently, several local governments, including Shanghai, Shanxi, Shandong, Jiangsu and Heilongjiang, have submitted reform proposals to defuse excess capacity.
Among them, many provinces even proposed that they should actively seek financial support from the central financial authorities for their provinces for their deproductive capacity.
In support of this, the coal deproduction target announced in only eight provinces stood at 90 per cent of the national coal reduction plan.
In an interview with reporters, Lin Boqiang, director of the China Energy Policy Research Institute of Xiamen University, believed that the “go-to-production capacity” of the steel and coal industries is far from sufficient to rely on 100 billion yuan from the central government alone. More funds need to be solved by local governments and enterprises. How?
In the recently released regulations on coal degeneration, Shanxi Zhao Coal Group is proposed to be reorganized into a state-owned capital investment company, to reorganize and integrate the assets and business of enterprises and to build a new business model.
The actual shortfall in funding may be three times greater than the subsidy before, Minister of Human Resources and Social Security Yin Weimin said that the initial statistics on the coal system of employees to be resettled “off-capacity” are 1.3 million and the steel system is 500,000.
South Daily News (Reporter/Xie Qingyu) The reporter learned today from the Provincial Environmental Protection Agency that in 2012, the results of the credit rating for environmental protection of key pollution sources in Guangdong Province are being publicized.
Of the 1251 companies listed for environmental credit management, 134 were not rated due to shutdown, failure to accept and close down.
In the enterprises that are proposed for the red brand, there are more heavy polluting enterprises, mainly plating, printing, and preventing and controlling, and some sewage treatment plants are also on the list.
The Provincial Environmental Protection Agency said that in order to reflect the principles of openness, fairness and fairness and to be subject to public supervision, the results of the rating will now be published on the Environmental Protection Agency website.
During the publicity period, the EPA accepts public calls, letters, visits and many other forms of reflection of the problem, EPA will investigate, verify and deal with the issues reflected.

Does meat, dairy products and chocolate help relieve inflammatory enteric diseases (IBD)?
Meat and chocolate may sound like a nightmare of your digestive system.
But a new study shows the opposite: a diet rich in meat protein and dairy products can help relieve the symptoms associated with inflammatory intestinal disease.
This incurable disease affects the lives of about 1.3 million Americans and about 300,000 British, leading to stomach convulsions and swelling, recurrent or haemorrhagic diarrhoea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
Researchers at Washington University often advise patients to avoid eating meat and dairy products to relieve symptoms, but researchers have found that protein-critical amino acid-colamine helps to promote immune cell growth, which increases intestinal resistance.
Chief Fellow Marco? Dr. Marco Colonna explained that immune cells patrol the intestines to ensure that harmful microorganisms hidden in food do not slip into the body.
Balance between inflammatory cells and cells that enhance tolerance, protecting the body without harming sensitive and vulnerable tissues.
Inflammatory intestinal disease can occur when the equilibrium is too biased towards inflammation.
An immune-promoting cell was found in rats carrying special bacteria.
Bacteria require colic amino acids (one of the components of protein) to form the appearance of cells.
Professor Cologne said, “We have established a link between a bacterial stock (Roy Breast, which is a normal part of the intestinal microbial community) and cell population development that promotes resistance.
The more chromatic acid they intake in their diet, the more immune cells they have.
He suggested that if humans use the same method, that is, a combination of Bacillus Lactic acid and a colic ammonia-rich diet may result in a more resistant and less inflammatory intestinal environment.
Dr. Louisa? Cervantes? Luisa Cervantes-Barraganwas studied an immune cell that improves resistance when she found that a group of mice studied had such cells, but another group of the same strains were kept separately.
She suspected that the difference was related to the intestinal microbial community of mice (i.e. bacteria, viruses and fungi usually living in the gastrointestinal tract).
DNA sequencing of cholesterol in mice reveals that 6 species of bacteria are present in mice with immune cells, but not in mice without immune cells.
Rats are raised in sterile environments, so they lack intestinal microbes and cannot appear, and the presence of brucella produces immune cells.
To understand how bacteria affect the immune system, researchers cultivate Lucella in fluids, and then transfer small amounts of bacterial-free fluids to premature immune cells separated from mice.
The immune cell develops as a resistant cell.
When the active ingredient is purified from the liquid, it can be proved that the active ingredient is a by-product of the pyroamine metabolism, known as the lactate-3-lactic acid.
When researchers doubled the number of colamine in mice feed, the number of such cells increased by about 50%, but when the level of colamine was halved, the number of cells was halved.
Cervantes? Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that people, like mice, have the same resistance-enhancing cells, and most of us have Lucella in our gastrointestinal tract.
It is not yet known whether humans can induce cell growth, as in experimental mice, by-products of chromia from Lucella, but the genetic defects associated with chromia are found in patients with inflammatory intestinal diseases.
She said, “The growth of these cells may be exactly what we want, because they can control inflammatory reactions on the inside of the intestine.
It may be inaccurate to say that the presence of high levels of chromia in Lucella may lead to an increase in the number of these species.
Jose Mourinho thinks Manchester United signed the “genius” of Neumania Matić
On Wednesday night, after Nemaniya Martić debuted for the first time in the Sampdoria Contest, Murinho identified Manchester United as a “genius” midfield player.
Martinic, from Chelsea, signed up to £40 million in gold and played 2-1 in Dublin on Tuesday in the last season before the European Super Cup against Real Madrid, winning the favor of Paul Bogba and Andreas Pereira.
However, in the Bruce Preseason Asian Tour, the Matty was seriously underdeveloped for only 45 minutes, and Murinho admitted that improvements were needed before the start of the British Super season.
“He needs time, but he has experience, wisdom and genius - he thinks about football,” says Murino.
“We'll help him get ready as soon as possible.”
Murinho began to arrange his inaugural lineup at the beginning of the season. Like Matić, the new contract players Viktor Lindlov and Romero Lukaku also started the game at the Injevic Stadium.
The independent newspaper reported this week that Murinho still wants to introduce three more contracted players, but he insists that the club “works well”. He has four preferred contracted players in his heart. The club has already introduced three of them.
“I appreciate the club's introduction of three of the contracted players.” He added.
“I'd be happier if the club could bring in all four players, but they've done a lot for me.”
Is China going to fall behind if this type of warship is not built?
With the recent announcement by the major naval powers of the world of plans for the construction of new frigates, it seems that the frigates have become the focus of naval attention among the major powers overnight. First, Japan has identified the purchase of two new frigates in its 2018 defense budget. This has led to a substantial breakthrough in the Japanese DEX frigate plan. Later, Lockheed Martin recently announced the latest version of the US FFG frigate plan.Case, then where should China's new frigate go from?
With the installation of a new 054A frigate at the end of 2017, the 054A frigate has built as many as 29, approaching the sum of the 053H frigates, and since the first 054A launch in 2006, the construction of 054A has been going on for 12 years, even around the world, so many high-performance universal frigates have been built.In China, only the “Perry” class frigate built by the United States in the 7th and 80s of the last century can be compared.
The reason why so many 054A should be built is also simple, that is, it is affordable, useful, plus the addition of years of naval arrears.
The 054A frigate has been favored by the Chinese navy for many years with a high cost-effectiveness ratio and a good combat force. It has a drain capacity of about 4,000 tons with a 76 mm main gun, 32 units of sea red flag-16 and fish-8 anti-submarine missile launchers with a dairy system, 8 eagles 83 and 1 straight-9 helicopter, although it was built in 2006 and was designed to be a very early ship., but its combat force is not too bad to put it in today's position, and it can reach the middle of the world's frigates.
But after all, this is a type of ship designed at the beginning of the 21st century, with weapons on the side, its power system and electronic radar equipment are already very different from the current mainstream frigate in the world, like the same type of frigate in Europe already equipped with full-power propulsion, small multi-function phased array radar, large-size helicopter deck, and the time has come to develop new models.
Well, how China's new frigate should develop is directly related to its future positioning and the strategic approach of our Chinese navy.
The future development of the Chinese navy will definitely become the blue-water navy, and in the future it will also be directed to the ocean. It will have a rapid deployment in areas where China has vital interests, demonstrate the existence of force and, if necessary, be able to have strong combat power to ensure that China's vital interests in the region are not damaged, so it seems that the new Hu Wei Jiang will certainly move towards large-scale and ocean development.
Let's look at the positioning of the new frigate in the future Chinese navy sequence. The future Chinese navy should be similar to the US Navy. In addition to the necessary offshore defense vessels, other major ships will form aircraft carrier battle groups or amphibious attack groups as necessary.
And the role of the new frigate should serve as the anti-submarine main and the positioning of mid-to-near areas in the future aircraft carrier battle group. In the amphibious attack group, it should act as a frigate class, then according to this demand, the new frigate must have strong anti-submarine capability and good mid-range air capability.
Based on the above-mentioned positioning, it is possible to visualize a broad profile of the future national frigate.
First of all, there will be a significant increase in drainage compared to the current 054A frigate, and it is estimated that the new frigate will have a drainage of about 500-6,000 tons; the power system will use an integrated power propulsion system consisting of a QC280 improved gas turbine and two diesel engines, with a maximum speed expected to reach about 30 sections and a significant increase in its capacity;mm main gun and 1130 near anti-gun should be retained, but will add a red flag 10 launch system, behind the main gun should have a 32-48 units red flag 16 improved and fish-8 cooler, in the rear of the vessel should be equipped with a large vertical system of 8-16 units for eagle firing 18 and new cruise missiles; the hangar and mortar platform will also be large, up to 2 10 tonsPosting and storage of lifts; in the case of electronic radar systems, a high level should be equipped with small four-sided fixed-phase arrays based on 346A development, and low-matches can use a versatile rotating phased array radar similar to that on the European frigate.
In this way, the overall level of the new frigate will reach the current world's highest standard, even if it is less successful than the U.S. FFG.
Of course, the above-mentioned concept is only the author's speculation about the new domestic frigate. How exactly can we wait until the new frigate is under water before we can see exactly what it is, let's look forward to together.

In recent years, the city has encouraged enterprises to actively participate in the construction of national, industry and regional group standards, giving 300,000 yuan in incentives to enterprises that are mainly or involved in the development of Zhejiang manufacturing group standards, and 500,000 yuan to enterprises that have passed Zhejiang manufacturing brand certification. This is the highest level of the award in the province, and has stimulated enthusiasm for companies to participate in the target.
Recently, Wang Li Group's production workshop, Gao Jian, the head of the Group's system, together with the staff, is packing a safety door box to serve as a sample for the Zhejiang manufacturing group's standard compliance work, ready to be sent to Shaoxing Quality Test Center.
Just two days ago, Wang Li has passed the site review of the “Zhejiang Manufacturing” certification team.
Gao Jian said that a professional team of industry technical experts and quality certification organizations praised the group's achievements in the core areas of excellence and independent innovation. He agreed that the bid was fully compliant and that as soon as the product passed the test, Wang Lie would be one of the first companies to adopt the standard.
Wang Lei Group is just a microcosm of the standard lever industry transformation upgrading.
We are also working with the Zhejiang Manufacturing Group on standard alignment and compliance.
Since the Zhejiang Manufacturing Team Standard was established by the Zhejiang Safety Gate industry last year, companies such as Star Moon and Xindo have also actively applied for the docking work.
In recent years, large amounts of capital have flooded into the film and television market, and the visibility of star actors and chip pay has increased. He Jingsheng, the producer, said that two actors in one of the hot-shooting shows had nearly $100 million in film remuneration. In the end, they had only taken a two-day movie together. The rest of the plays were basically performed on their own behalf.
At a time when actors are playing with each other, at the same time the female starring is in different theatrical groups, causing the same time not to be present in the studio at the same time, the theatrical group is forced to use the alternative to guarantee the cycle.
It is understood that after returning to Beijing from Chengdu, Morris continued to go to the hospital for acupuncture treatment to ensure that the injuries will not continue to deteriorate.
Samsung said in a statement released earlier this week that 93% of the Note7 smartphones sold in the US market have been recalled.
Finally, Li Yanhong also said that China does not lack good stories, but does not “cross culture and have an eco-effect IP” like Harry Potter, which is exactly where we should learn from Hollywood.
Is China's domestic debt rate close to the United States more terrible than it cannot afford housing?
In recent times, everyone has been discussing what has changed recently in real estate policy, is it that real estate policy is loosened again? Is there a decline in housing prices due to the diversity of land policy supply subjects?
However, at a time when we are worried about real estate prices, about macroeconomic regulation, and about the future movement of the real estate market, the People's Daily wrote another article. Last time we specifically discussed the regulation of real estate regulation in the People's Daily, and now the People's Daily wrote a more serious topic than buying a house that cannot afford it. That is, if you can afford a house, can you still pay a debt?
Today, we will talk about a more serious problem than buying houses: repayment of loans.
I. China's growing housing debt crisis
The overseas edition of the People's Daily published a commentary article on January 17, “Awards and Loans: The Fun and Concern of the Struggle Youth”, according to the data in the article, in November 2017, the Third Quarter China Leverage Process Report issued by the National Financial and Development Laboratory of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences and the National Balance Sheet Research Center noted that the leveraging rate in the residential sector continued to increase from 47.4 in the second quarter of 2017.% rose to 48.6% in the third quarter, 1.3 percentage points, 3.8 percentage points in the first three quarters of 2017.
The proportion of indebtedness of the residential sector in the entire real economy has increased, and the leverage rate has increased more rapidly.
Studies show that the indebtedness of Chinese households in financial institutions is dominated by consumer loans, accounting for about two thirds of the indebtedness of residents, which is about twice as high as that of operating loans.
Among them, in consumer loans, medium- and long-term loans dominated by housing loans accounted for about 80%, but in incremental terms, short-term consumer loans grew faster than medium- and long-term loans.
In addition, the domestic debt ratio of China only counted the total amount of credit received by the family sector from financial institutions, while the Chinese family still had a lot of private borrowing, including borrowing from relatives and friends, and there were large hidden debts.
It is quite striking to see such data. According to statistics from the Sonin Institute of Finance, China's resident leverage rate was only 3 per cent in 1996 and only 18 per cent in 2008. However, since 2008, the resident leverage rate has begun to grow rapidly, doubling to 36.4 per cent in just six years. By the third quarter of 2017, the resident leverage rate had reached 48.6%.
Let's compare another data. Last May, HSBC released a survey that spanned nine countries and reached tens of thousands of people.
The report was visited by “Millennium Generation” young people in nine countries (born between 1980 and 2000).
According to the report, China's housing ownership rate for young people after 80 or 90 is as high as 70 per cent, and is far ahead of the second Mexico (46 per cent), twice the United States target (35 per cent).
These data tells us a very likely problem, that is, the biggest potential of the Chinese residents at this stage, the “gray rhinoceros”, is expected to be less indebtedness than they cannot afford housing.
II. Why is the housing debt crisis the most serious problem?
As we analyzed before, although we have been saying that China's housing prices are high, China's housing ownership rate is actually quite high compared to other countries in the world, so rather than the high housing prices that cannot afford to buy houses, I'm afraid you have to ask a lot of friends now if you can afford a loan?
Looking at real estate markets around the world, China's real estate market, due to its late start, has not seen an excessive real estate crisis, except what we said earlier in Hainan, but the origins of the 2008 world financial tsunami just 10 years ago were the real estate crisis in the United States.
The cause of the real estate crisis in the United States was attributed to two houses: Fannie and Beauty.
At that time, in the golden age of the United States, real estate companies sold houses to low-income people in the United States at that time in order to expand sales, and at a time when the United States economy was improving, the real estate market was also booming. However, the good prospects were not long. As the United States economy stagnated, resulting in a decline in the income of the buyers, large household consumption expenditure began to decline.
However, the current situation in the United States at that time was a financial asset and real estate asset component of household assets in the United States, where almost all household assets in the low-income group were real estate, while most of the assets in the top 20 per cent of the high-income group were financial assets, resulting in higher indebtedness rates for the poorer households in the United States.
A serious fact is that these people are all buying houses at a time when the economy is better, so the money to pay the mortgage is also calculated by their better income. When income falls, not only does the pressure on mortgage loans not diminish, even because some subprime lending schemes have become more fluctuating, so the real estate problems of these American families have gradually evolved into a crisis for real estate.
As a result, some people cannot afford to pay their mortgages because their income is too low, so banks begin to recover their property. When banks recover their property from buyers in arrears, they will sell it at very low prices. This has led to a step-by-step decline in housing prices in the region. This process has led to a further decline in housing prices, creating a vicious circle, when housing prices fall to a certain degree, more and more and more buyers find themselves.The value of the house is even lower than its own loan, so more people stop repaying the mortgage and create more bad debts.
So a huge vicious circle is formed:
“The economic downturn - income decline - some people still do not take up the mortgage - the bank sells the house of the debtor at a low price - housing prices fall - more people stop repaying the mortgage - the bank sells again - housing prices fall again...”
And the problem is more than that, because the price of housing continues to fall. After everyone stops paying back the house to the bank, you don't have any debt. If the bank auctions the house still doesn't get the money you owe to the bank, then you still need to pay back the money. Simply say, if you pay a mortgage of 600,000, 2.4 million people buy a house that was worth 3 million at the time, when the price fell to the house., you no longer lend the house back to the bank, after the bank auctions the house, you not only lost your first payment of 600,000, but also owed the bank 400,000 debt, you still have to pay back the money.
Thus, in such a vicious circle, the United States economy gradually collapsed and eventually triggered the United States financial crisis of 2008.
Therefore, at this stage, the level of domestic debt in China is 46.8% high. This data is still below the level of developed countries. However, the problem has begun to emerge. The country has repeatedly emphasized the issue of leveraging since last year. This is a very first-seen judgment. If it is allowed to continue to rise, the domestic debt rate will inevitably trigger a huge winds.Insurance, so protect against the emergence of financial risks.
As a result, after that, the house was used to live, not to be used to speculate on the location, the state will more quickly establish multiple measures such as multi-body supply, multi-channel guarantee, leasehold merger and other measures to further defuse potential risks.
For our individual families, we must abandon speculative thinking on real estate and do everything in our power when buying a home, and avoid their families falling into a huge burden. Only a reasonable assessment of their income and level of indebtedness is a path to healthy family wealth development.

British inventors plant chips in their own body, waving into the house into the car
A British inventor installs a chip for himself, waving his front door, entering the office and even starting the car to become the first person in the country.
33-year-old Steven Nossem implanted a small chip between his thumb and index finger and is now offering this service to companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives, a service that his company BioTeq implements through technology.
Has he worked with Jeff, Senior Consultant, Royal Hampshire Hospital, Hampshire? Dr. Watson joined forces to ensure that the implantation process meets medical standards.
The technology is similar to cats and dogs chip implantation and takes only 30 seconds.
Mr. Northam's company will also replace locks in rooms and vehicles to be compatible with the chip at a cost of £300 per lock.
The married father with a child has now installed the technology for his home and his BMW Z4, and he can start the car with his hands on the steering wheel.
Speaking of this central financial and economic working meeting, Hu Angang felt a lot, and the contents of this meeting focused on both national development and personal life.
On 10 July, the National Statistics Office published the National Consumer Price Index (CPI) and the Industrial Producer Price Index (PPI) for the month of June 2016.
The White House props cost thousands.
According to military records published by Time magazine, last month the White House decided to send a Marine helicopter to the South Lawn to highlight the great glory of American manufacturing at a cost of US $24,000.
The green and white Sikorsky VH-3D (also known as Marines 1 when the President was riding) was an important exhibit in the White House on July 17, highlighting US construction projects.
President Donald Trump, Vice-President Mike Pens and senior White House officials visited manufacturing products from all 50 states.
The exhibits included a Connecticut-made helicopter, a Maine yacht, a Wisconsin fire truck and a Mississippi forklift.
According to the records of the Force Marine Corps Helicopter First Fleet (HMX-1), which operated the helicopter, the White House Military Office requested the helicopter to appear as per routine order (FRAGO), that is, only 36 hours before it landed on the South Lawn to participate in this “special” event.
The day before the event, Commander HMX-1 said in an e-mail to his superior Marine Flight Deputy Commander, “I just want to confirm that you know, because the event is highly valued.”
This information indicates that the helicopter will arrive on the South Lawn on July 17 at approximately 7 am for a 3 pm event before leaving on the same night after the lawn is cleared from 6 pm to 9 o'clock.
The information also indicates that in the event of a delay in departure from the White House, the return flight will require a second crew due to time constraints on duty.
While the former crew members were on standby at the helicopter side during the operation, the security forces were on standby in the vicinity while the aircraft was on the ground.
The records available to Time magazine do not clearly indicate the eventual need for a second crew.
The Hach Act prohibits federal employees from using government property for political purposes.
It was noted that HMX-1 had asked whether the event was in violation of the Act.
The commander wrote, “One question we asked was whether this violated the Hach Act and was told that there was no violation.”
“Sounds like you were locked up,” Deputy Commander replied.
The White House defined this “Made in the USA” activity as an official activity and is therefore not governed by the Hatch Act.
But even official activities are political.
During the event, the President introduced the topic of the then Senate: medical reform and extolled the control of government regulations.
The use of Marines One or Air Force One aircraft for political propaganda purposes is no longer new.
Successive Presidents have been asked to travel on these aircraft.
However, it is not common for them to be expropriated for photographic purposes only.
In February, Trump received attention when he was in Melbourne, Florida, where the presidential jet slowly glide and finally stopped in the background of his first campaign rally, while his Twitter account was full of complaints about the former president's use of the presidential jet.
“The White House was excited by this 'Made in America' exhibition, which showcased products from all 50 states, all of which were made from American materials,” said Lindsay Walters, deputy press spokesman at the White House.
The HMX-1 crew regularly conducts flight training near the Washington area and the South Lawn to practice accurately placing the President of the United States in the White House.
In early July, Trump practiced 58 landings at the White House during the G-20 Summit in Germany.
An official said that this US manufacturing activity flight was included in this month's crew training requirements.
Helicopter troops also flew an extra 11-hour “non-presidential support mission” on the same day.
The White House claimed that the taxpayer did not bear the cost of any other props in the event.
A Sikorsky spokesperson stated that the company was not involved in arranging the South Lawn helicopter display.
HMX-1 did not keep a budget record of the presidential flight and it was therefore very difficult to determine the exact cost of the event.
However, according to the Ministry of Defence hourly fee for fiscal year 2017, VH-3D Department of Defense reimburses $24,380 per flight hour.
The Force recorded a 30-minute flight time for each flight from the base of the Marines Airport in Kuantico, Virginia.
The White House claimed that the cost of operating the helicopter was much lower than that cost.
“Estimating taxpayers' fees based on reimbursable fees is very misleading,” Walters said.
These estimates include personnel costs, maintenance costs and many other sunk costs included in the annual appropriation.
A 2015 RAND study showed that MoD reimbursable costs did not include personnel costs, but did include oil, maintenance and contracting costs.
At that time, Sean Speicher, a former White House press spokesman, defended the operation by using the helicopter.
and said, “The idea is to show things made in the United States this week,
And I know that both Sikorsky and Connecticut are proud of their contribution to our national security, and I guess there are hundreds of people working without them.
And I think, like most Americans, we are all proud of this helicopter and other military equipment, which is the result of the unyielding efforts of countless Americans.
So it is certainly not inappropriate to highlight this.”
We do not know whether Trump interacted with the helicopter during his tour of the South Lawn during the event, but he did sit in the driver's seat of the fire truck.
Within the White House, Trump spoke to a representative of Sikorsky and joked with the media about his own company aircraft.
He said, “I know the Sikorsky plane very well. I have three.”

The head of the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan said on Wednesday that only elections with the participation of all members of society, including women, are representative.
The head of the United Nations Assistance Mission, Nicholas Heisom, said that hundreds of women were participating in the provincial council elections and three women were participating in the vice-presidential elections, with more than 30 per cent of the new registered voters being women.
In his statement on Wednesday, he said, “The status of women cannot be underestimated.”
Only when women are fully involved and included in all stages of the electoral process will there be truly representative and credible elections.

According to a market star report, from 2005 to 2011, the GDP of our province rose from the middle side to the second seat.
However, my province's economic growth still suffers from low investment efficiency and a lack of core competitiveness in the industrial economy. To this end, the latest issue of the Economic Blue Page of the Provincial Economic Information Center recommends improving the quality and efficiency of economic growth.
Based on some representative indicators of our provincial economy in 2005 and 2011, it is compared with the national and central regions.
In terms of industrial economic efficiency, in 2011, the high-energy-consuming industries such as industrial energy and raw materials, which accounted for a significant proportion of the province, were heavily affected by market fluctuations and “double pressure” on excess capacity. At the same time, the leading industries such as household appliances and automobiles had insufficient innovation power, resulting in marginal profits.
And the fact that large investments have not yielded corresponding economic benefits is an important reason for the poor quality and efficiency of economic growth in our province.
In this regard, experts suggested that effective measures should be taken to encourage enterprise innovation, and that the scientific and technological achievements of universities and research institutes should be “transferred” to enterprises in a timely manner.
With regard to the low economic efficiency of industry, experts said that they should also actively promote the restructuring of industrial mergers, optimize the industrial layout and extend the industrial chain.

The United Kingdom General Union (GMB) focuses on investments in McVitie's plant in Glasgow
The union hopes that the management of McVitta, a biscuit manufacturer, will ensure a long-term commitment to production at the factory in Las Vegas.
According to the Scottish branch of the British General Union, the company remained silent about the future of investment in the Tollcross plant.
With more than 500 employees, the plant produces oatmeal biscuits (Hobnobs) and tea biscuits (Rich tea).
Pladis, owner of McVita, said that over the past few years, the company has invested more than £5 million in the plant.
He added that if factory operations change, employees and union representatives “will be the first to know.”
In a letter to the director of the company, the Scottish branch of the British General Union called on McVita to “solve the problem of the funds that have not been transferred to the modernization of the production line.”
Drew, Senior Sponsor of the General Union of England? Drew Duffy said, “Our members are deeply concerned that we have not been able to get a clear picture of Tollcross's future business needs and investment plans from the general manager of the plant.
Generation-to-generation families work here, and the high concentration of labour in local communities and the Greater Glasgow region is an important pillar of decent employment in areas with high levels of unemployment and social deprivation.
Therefore, from the perspective of employment, remuneration and economic prosperity, the eastern Glasgow region is in dire need of McVitta's expanding production network against the backdrop of Britain's ebb, rising cost of living and a long-term decline in manufacturing.”
“The director of Tollcross just received a letter from the Scottish branch of the British General Union yesterday, and the company will respond immediately, because we value keeping in touch with employees and trade union representatives.
Two months ago, we held regular meetings with employees and representatives of the General Union of England in Tollcross to discuss a number of issues openly.
We discussed with our employees and then, like all other companies operating in a highly competitive and economically uncertain environment, we reviewed our continued operating model for companies and factories to remain competitive.
She added: “In recent years, we have invested more than Pound5 million in the Tollcross plant, especially in production lines and operational improvements.
We are fully aware of the historical status of Tollcross as a production base and our employees and union representatives will be the first to know if there is any change in our operations at the plant.”

Paris Saint Germain warned Barcelona about signing Nemar three years ago?
Sicar may regret throwing olive branches on Marco Vilati
After offering a Pound189 million offer to exercise the exemption, Paris Saint-Germain would not give up entering Nemar, but had they warned Barcelona three years ago to launch an attack against the world record raider?
This sensational approach has opened the summer flip window, and the French Clubs are ready to break the world record at more than twice the price of the last one. Paul Bogba returned to Manchester United in the last season for up to £89 million.
Once the transfer is complete, Nemal will jump to become the world's highest-priced player and also the world's highest-paid professional athlete, Saint Germain Paris, with a weekly after-tax salary of over Pound500,000.
Barcelona was outraged by the way Nemal was attacked and the way out, and sources who learned about the board of Catalan insisted that after his arrival from Santos in 2013, the club had been doing its best to take care of him.
But did President Saint Germain of Paris make such a prediction about the world of football three years ago?
When Manchester expressed an interest in signing the contract with Blaise Mateddy in 2014, Nassir Alhlefi warned any club that wanted to sign the best player in Saint Germain Paris.
“I'm not worried, because they know that if they touch any of our players, we will definitely be against them, and we will contact their players,” said Alhlefi.
“We respect all clubs.
But if they try to sign on to our players, they also have to eat evil.”
Earlier this summer, the Spanish club seemed to have crossed the line, and Barcelona threw the olive branch to Marco Vilati, Paris's midfieldsman.
Paris Saint-Germain made it clear that they would not allow the Italian foot to leave in any way, and Barcelona was likely to be affected by the loss of its genius Nemal.

At the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics, the British delegation achieved a gold-1 silver-2 bronze performance, the best since the first Winter Olympics in 1924.
