Munich 1856: Four maps that change your view of the city
A false institution where young people are to meet today.
A gravel chapel where is now digging for the S-Bahn tunnel.
Kleingtners manage the former land of farmers.
Munich's oldest official map reveals exciting stories.
It's annoying when maps aren't up to date.
This is familiar to anyone who has had to get upset because the car navi displayed a green meadow instead of a bypass.
The historical maps of the digital Bavaria atlas, an offer by the Geoportal Bayern of the State Government, are far from up-to-date - but for that very reason very revealing.
Especially when compared with current online cards.
Then it becomes clear how cities and towns in the spread area of the Munich Mercury have changed since the 19th century.
The digital Bavaria Atlas is a patchwork quilt that cannot be immediately recognized as such.
More detailed maps, so-called primordial position sheets, were incorporated into the large map.
According to the Bavarian surveying administration, these were created between 1810 and 1864 and originated from the first survey of Bavaria.
Her client: Napoleon.
The French Army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria.
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a topographic recording of Bavaria - for military purposes, of course.
Even though French troops finally withdrew with the Lunéville peace of February 9, 1801, it was today's neighbors who created the idea of a nationwide Bayern map.
Kurfürst Max IV. Joseph continued to drive the project forward, establishing the "Topographic Bureau" - and thus the Bavarian surveying administration.
The original position sheet for Munich dates from 1856 and can be found on the website of the Bavarian National Library.
The comparison between earlier and present is most impressive in the example of the provincial capital.
The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.
An example of this is Untersendling, which is still relatively isolated in the map of 1856.
Sendling was congregated as a Munich district 21 years after the map was created, in 1877.
Today Untersendling is in the middle of the city.
The houses Untersendlings concentrate around 1856 along present-day Plinganserstraße, which was only named in 1878 after Georg Sebastian Plinganser, a leader of the Bavarian farmers' uprising against Austria in 1705.
Where today the Westpark is, you can see nothing but fields - at first glance: when zooming in, a small-part map with dozens of lines and numbers appears: handwritten numbered hallways from the so-called "copying" from which the land tax was derived.
Small plots of land no longer occupy farmers there today - but gluers of the plant "Land in Sonne".
A large green area looms north of Untersendling.
Theresienwiese, the site of Oktoberfest since 1810, was actually still a meadow in the 19th century - and no concrete desert.
On the other side of the Isar, the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.
In the original position sheet, in the area of the current district of Au-Haidhausen, you can read not only the street name "at Gasteig" or the hill "On the air" - but also in large letters "Irre Anstalt".
Yes, here on Auerfeldstraße people were once locked up with delusions.
In 1858/59 the Munich Kreis-Irrenanstalt "On the Auer Llüen" was founded.
From 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden led the institution - the psychiatrist brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II.
"He was progressive for his time and, for example, ended up chaining the so-called lunatic.
He has also banned staff from using force against the inmates," says Hermann Wilhelm, head of the Haidhausen museum, which has been working on the institution for an exhibition.
For 280 patients, space was initially available, and later expanded to 500 places.
At some point, this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the circle-irresort in Haar 1905.
The Isar-Amper-Klinikum München-Ost, one of Germany’s largest psychiatrists, has been located there since 2006.
In the area of the former Auer Anstalt young people meet in the Munich Salesianum.
The Order acquired the complex in 1920 and transformed it into a youth home with training establishments.
To the west lies the football pitch of TSV München Ost, to the east residential buildings from the 1980s.
In 2015, the children's house "Casa Don Bosco" was built - an architectural reference to the origin building of the Irrenanstalt, which had been destroyed in World War II bombings.
Marienplatz was listed as the " Haupt Platz" around 1856, while Kaufingerstraße was called "Kaufinger Gasse".
The Second World War also brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich.
The Allies' bombs tore many holes into the city centre in December 1944.
A large one remained to this day - at the Marienhof.
The English Institute, small business houses and a Middle Ages chapel once stood at the Marienhof, where these days the preparatory work will take place and on April 5, 2017 the spades for the second S-Bahn line will take place.
The slider compares the old Munich map with today's aerial image - and fills the hole at the Marienhof.
Civil rights group releases travel warning for Missouri
The National Association for the Promotion of Colors has issued a warning for colored people traveling to Missouri because of discriminatory policies and the state's racist attacks.
"The NAACP Travel Advisory for the State of Missouri, which is due to enter into force by August 28, 2017, urges African-American travelers, visitors and Missourians to pay special attention and exercise extreme caution when traveling through the state, as a number of questionable, racial-based incidents have recently occurred throughout the state and are noted here," the group's opinion reads.
A recent Missouri law that makes it harder for people to win discrimination lawsuits, as well as the state's law enforcement agencies that disproportionately target minorities, prompted the group to issue the travel warning, the NAACP said.
"They have violations of civil rights that happen to people.
They are stopped because of their skin color, they are beaten up or killed," the president of the Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, told the Kansas City Star.
"We hear complaints in such frequency that we haven't heard them yet."
It is the first such warning issued by the organisation for a state in the US.
The group cited incidents such as racial offences against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died in questionable circumstances earlier this year after he had no gasoline during the trip through the state and was taken into custody by Missouri police without being accused of a crime.
The council also points to a recent report by the Office of the Attorney General of Missouri showing that black motorists in the state are 75 percent more likely to be stopped than whites.
"The recommendation is that people be aware and inform their families, friends and associates about what might happen in Missouri," Chapel said.
"People need to be prepared whether to bring bail money or let relatives know that they are travelling through the state."
Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest figures from the FBI's hate crime reporting program, which ranked the state 16th in terms of the number of such injuries.
The travel warning is also a response to a new Missouri law that would make it harder to sue a company for housing or employment discrimination.
Earlier, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after the states passed immigration laws requiring local law enforcement agencies to arrest people for immigration violations, which, according to the ACLU, will help further racial profiling.
Travel warnings are usually issued by the State Department to other countries, but lately interest groups have used the measure in response to specific laws and trends within the U.S.
Weidezaun project is fundamental
The Fischerbach Weidezaun project is a success project and will continue next year.
The CDU members Peter Weiss and Kordula Kovac have got a picture on the spot.
At the Schwendemann family graveyard, representatives of the Fischerbach CDU local association met with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two deputies.
Markus Schwendemann first provided insights into his farm, in which he farmed 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, supplied 40 dairy cows and as many young animals and housed in five apartments.
"Black Forest milk" is for him the alternative-free marketing route for the milk of his cows, according to Schwendemann.
The table of holiday guests is exclusively regional.
Since he is also BLHV chairman of Fischerbach, he called the grazing fence project "elementally important."
I cannot make a profit on such steep land.
The green area has a lot of work to do, a lot of things have to be done with the motor sense.
"We are struggling here with the conditions and with the topography," Schwendemann pointed out.
In 2003 he took over the parental operation and managed it without chemical plant protection and fertilizer, even if it does not run a bio-farm.
For Mayor Thomas Schneider, it was clear: "The Commune has recognised the importance of the grazing fence project and is pleased with the Leader funding."
Farmers would have to be supported at a cost of between EUR 3000 and 4000 per hectare.
It is hoped that the afforestation of the land could be dragged out for a while.
"The greatest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and are thinking about how to continue their operations," the mayor stressed.
Farmers often face criticism for promotion
A total of 25 parcels of eleven participants were fenced off in 2013 through pastoral support.
The open area thus covers 40 hectares, which must not be replanted until at least 2023.
Of the total costs of €71,500, half was funded through Leader, a quarter carried the municipality of Fischerbach.
This left farmers EUR 12 610, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometres of grazing fence.
"The big advantage is the durability of the fences," Schwendemann explained.
Kordula Kovac stressed: "You're doing a really good job without farmers and rural women it's not."
For Peter White, too, it was clear that "best food is produced here."
The Landscape Care Directive (LPR) Baden-Württemberg allows state support for grazing fences.
The aim is to keep the Black Forest open.
The condition is the presence of a conveyor belt called the LPR.
Moreover, the fenced area must not be allowed to be dumped (in excess of 35%) and must therefore be threatened with afforestation.
At present, the request of eight participants with 24 plots, who would like to build a fence of just 16 kilometres, is under way for the Fischerbach Weidezaun project in 2018.
The open area corresponds to 35 hectares and the calculated cost is more than EUR 112 000.
Is nothing more sacred?
Now Trump’s White House takes the Statue of Liberty
The surest sign of a regime change is when they start attacking statues.
Americans appreciate this as much as any other - hence the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein at Firdos Square in Baghdad in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologues of the Trump regime, certainly knew what he was doing when he took a symbolic axe in a heated dispute with Jim Acosta of CNN over the president's proposals to slash legal immigration with the Statue of Liberty.
To be fair, Miller did not attack the statue itself.
A horde of boat owners and Liberty imitators would have lynched him if he had done so.
But he attacked their importance, and in particular the importance attributed to it when Emma Lazarus's famous poem was added to his base in 1903, 17 years after the monument's completion.
As Miller Acosta quipped, "I don't want to dwell here on a complete thing about history, but the Statue of Liberty is...a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the world.
The poem to which you refer was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty."
Miller is factually correct, but as he put it himself, it's not really about history.
It's about contemporary resonance at the stirring words of Lazarus, the only ones where a state invites not just any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "Your tiredness, your poor, / your afflicted masses who yearn to breathe freely, / the miserable waste of your rich coasts."
There was never a time when the "elending waste" was better seen on our screens.
Miller was not engaged in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people are not welcome in Trump's US.
This conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural clash: It is indeed a conflict about the importance of America.
Lazarus - and her friends who campaigned to base her words after her death - knew very well that she was doing a highly political act.
The sculpture was intended to show the connections between French and American republicanism by depicting the female embodiment of freedom in a worn-out classical pictorial representation.
Lazarus changed that meaning: In her poem, the female character is no longer abstract - she has received a voice.
And she gives herself a very different name: Mother of the exiles.
Linking the poem to the picture is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American nativism.
And just as Lazarus changed the statue's meaning, people from the right wing wanted to change it back a long time ago.
The great screamer Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty is not inviting anyone, but rather an early neo-conservative, bringing the American flame to the nightly world: "Lady Liberty is going ahead.
It is meant to carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
The torch should not open the way to the United States."
Quite unusually, Limbaugh has come across something here.
The significance of the statue is entirely a matter of the point of view of perception.
Lazarus's great fanciful deed was to see her as seen by the exhausted, miserable but hopeful after long and often terrible journeys on the decks of ships.
It is literally about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives.
Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome they must hear.
And that, of course, is not the perspective Miller and Trump ever want to acknowledge.
Their torch is not intended to clear the way, but to ignite hatred, which is their only source of power.
World Cup 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish members of the Team of Britain
Eilidh Doyle remembers a time when only two Scots belonged to the team of Britain
The UK's performance director of athletics, Neil Black, says the 16-member Scottish contingent in the World Cup squad "will make a massive contribution to the team."
A record number of Scottish athletes have been selected for London 2017, which starts on Friday.
Black believes that "something special is developing" in Scotland and the UK's athletics needs to learn something from it.
"We welcome it, and we try to understand it, and we will continue it until we find out," Black said.
"I talk to people at the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they have done.
Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they did.
British Athletics: It has something to do with what they did.
And also with the type on the street corner.
Whatever the combination of circumstances, it is absolutely brilliant."
Several of Scotland's athletes are medal contenders, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000m track, while Eilidh Doyle has been elected team captain by the team.
"Eilidh is pretty modest.
Their captain's speech was unbelievable," says Black.
"A number of athletes, whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train, went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated.
The passion and real feeling that Eilidh brought naturally were great."
The Commonwealth silver medallist, who will compete at the 400m hurdles in her fifth World Cup, says it is "incredible" that 16 Scots are in the British team.
Scotland's best overall number of athletes at the World Cup was seven achieved in 1983 and 2015.
Mid-range runner Muir leads along this path and set five British and two European records last year.
She will attend the 1,500m and 5,000m runs.
Chris O'Hare, who runs 1,500m, is another Scot to watch after a great season that included victory at the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games.
Doyle remembers her first world championships when the only other Scot in the team was Lee McConnell.
The team captain says she is "hugely proud" of the fact that many of her compatriots are not only part of the team, but in some cases will also be involved in the medals and finals.
"The special thing about being team captain is that she was chosen by the other members of the team, so it was a great honour anyway, but knowing that my teammates voted for me and voted for me makes it something very special for me," she added.
"Obviously I'm very proud of all the Scots who are part of the team.
It just shows how far we have come.
And they are here as established athletes, athletes who want to rise to podiums.
As for my speech as captain?
Yes, I think she went well.
I just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home World Cup.
So it's really important to rely on this home support and benefit from being back in the Olympic Stadium.
I get a second chance to go out there and compete and it's just going to be such a great atmosphere out there."
Block critics over Facebook: Don't run for public office if you can't cope with heating up voters
The father of our country knew something about bad press.
Americans loved George Washington, but it didn't take long for newspapers to beat him because of everything, from domestic politics to his political principles.
He chimed in at the criticism, surely.
But he did not silence his critics.
For in 1783, Washington said, "Free speech can be taken away - and, stupid and dumb, we are slaughtered like sheep."
That brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan, who has to work to be more like Washington.
Hogan's staff have blocked and deleted the posts of at least 450 people who have expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page.
And the American Civil Liberties Union therefore sued him earlier this week.
The governor's staff dismissed the lawsuit as frivolous, and the online comment was full of a backlash with "Well, and?"
"It's just Facebook," many people said.
But it's important.
And it's especially important when it's a guy like Hogan.
This is a Republican governor in an overwhelmingly Democratic state who is surprisingly popular.
He has the second-highest approval rating of the nation's 50 governors.
Hogan is not a reactionary hothead.
He has shown a firm hand in running his state and strict adherence to principles.
He was also very adept at using Facebook as a primary means of connecting with his constituents and playing down his hairless head after chemotherapy on his side.
So blocking people who come to the governor's side - which is a public forum called official and paid by staff with public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan spokeswoman Amelia Chasse defended the governor's actions, arguing that blocking the comments was nothing more than a moderation.
But it's too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hate-filled people swinging the whip online.
The Post spoke to some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.
And these are only real people who speak with their elected leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur and a pastor, not a troll.
They all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not profound.
The pastor cited the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogan's Catholic faith.
Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., wasn't hateful, but she asked about hate crimes.
"I commented politely that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other recent news," she wrote in the commentary section of the news program "The Post."
"I also don't appreciate this idea, if a number of people take a stand on the same subject, then they are disregarded by some rather than a so-called collective effort and not recognised as a large group of affected citizens."
What the governor's aides called a "focused spam attack," others would probably call "advocacy."
The Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or erasing a negative comment.
It is much cleaner than in the past if the same thing had been done, that staff were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical editorials or to arrest and silence protesters.
But that is exactly what is happening digitally.
Hogan is not the first public official to be criticized for embezzling Facebook and other social media outlets.
President Trump is being sued by Twitter users who were blocked by his Twitter feed.
One of the first milestones on the issue fell last week in Virginia.
The chairman of the Board of Supervisors of Loudoun County violated the First Amendment, according to U.S. District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when she banished a voter from her Facebook page.
And in Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit from the ACLU because of his use of Facebook and Twitter.
That shouldn't be so hard.
At the time of Washington, the period of affordable postage had a similar effect to the Internet.
The number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letter writers struck at his leadership.
And even then, Washington had anonymous trolls.
The people who used pseudonyms like "Juricola," "Valerius," "Belisarius" and "Portius" all wrote letters to newspapers that turned down Washington's decisions.
Petitions criticizing his position on Amity's contract, trade and shipping with Britain overwhelmed his office, according to historical documents collected by the George Washington Project's online papers.
But he didn't silence them.
Freedom of speech, dissent and discourse form the basis of our nation.
And true leadership means accepting that.
Ronan Rafferty hopes to house comfort at Renaissance Club
Former European No 1 Ronan Rafferty will be hoping for home comfort over the next three days as the Renaissance Club in East Lothian hosts the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open.
Nordire, who led next-to-last at Archerfield Links until the final round before losing to Paul Eales last year, is linked with the new venue and acts as a tournament ambassador on behalf of the club's founder and CEO Jerry Sarvadi.
"I've seen the Renaissance Club built and we see how it reaches its fame with this event," Rafferty said.
"The players will see this course from his best side, he's in a terrific condition.
Jerry did a terrific job when he set that place.
He's a keen believer in this game and is proud of his performance here.
This is a great showcase for this course."
Englishman Eales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time, although in his 32-year career he has won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour.
"It really feels special," said the player based in Southport.
"I haven't been able to defend the Extremadura Open since it was taken out of the program in the year after I won it.
Coming back to this part of the world is magical.
It is a wonderful place to play golf.
The memories from last year come back and it was something special for me and my wife Sharon to win here last year.
It was a really special time and one that we will always appreciate."
Gary Orr, who came to the European Senior Tour after his 50th birthday earlier this year, returns to action on home soil.
This event will be his first Scottish appearance since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
"It always means a little bit more when you play at home," said Orr, the man from Helensburgh.
"You want to do well, but you also feel that extra pressure.
I really enjoyed playing again and I played solid golf.
I am pleased with the way it has gone."
With the trio on the field are former Masters champion Ian Woosnam and senior major champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are among the six Scots on the field, the others being Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
Admission is free, parking costs £5 per car with an occupant and £10 per car with two or more occupants.

Fewer lung cancer deaths from passive smoking
Over the past two decades, fewer and fewer people have died from lung cancer because of passive smoking.
Scientists from the University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) have come to this conclusion in a study.
"According to our estimates, 167 lung cancer deaths a year are due to passive smoking," said study leader Heiko Becher.
By comparison, he produced his own 1994 study on the subject.
At the time, there were still 400 lung cancer deaths due to passive smoking per year in Germany.
The new investigation is published in the International Journal of Public Health.
Home connections prove very complex
Construction work on Villinger Street is in full swing and "lies reasonably in time," according to the building's director, Fred Heinze.
In the area of home connections, the situation is more complicated than anticipated, as there is a lot underground, which is not mentioned in the plans.
Traffic, which repeatedly hinders construction work, is a major problem for the construction crew of Stumpp.
"The ignorance of motorists in front of red lights and shutters is already enormous," Heinze reports.
The road is closed and only the buses are allowed to pass.
Angelo Caruso, Marvin Kostorz and Tim Kostorz of Stumpp have been working on the bridge for weeks.
"The hot days were quite exhausting.
But fortunately, we were provided with cool mineral water by our friend Fritz Matt," he told Marvin Kostorz.
Poverty and Death in Indonesia's Goldland
When Bardina Degei cooks dinner, she doesn't use a stove.
It rarely uses pot.
In her wooden house in Enarotali, the capital of the Paniai Republic in the troubled Indonesian province of Papua, the housewife normally puts a sweet potato - locally called "nota" - straight into the fireplace.
After half an hour, the coiled crab is taken out and swallowed with eager, unwashed hands.
Degei sits on the clay floor - she has no furniture - where she also performs her daily work, such as washing clothes with cloudy water from the nearby swamp.
A bucket in a roofless room serves as a latrine.
As the youngest of her husband's four wives, she was not assigned any fields.
Polygamy is common here.
Of course, being late can be dangerous: Most villagers are unemployed, and many drink heavily, and there are soldiers here.
"No one dares to walk around the village after 17 o'clock," she says.
It is a rare glimpse of daily life in the Highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony that began in 1969 after a disputed referendum in Indonesia, when only 1,026 elders were due to vote through a public handout before the occupying forces.
An existing movement for independence against Dutch rule quickly turned against the Jakarta government, which controls the region and excludes foreign journalists or legal observers.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua, with the independent part of Papua New Guinea covering the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is as remote as it is deserted, the journey includes a 90-minute flight from the provincial capital Jayapura to Nabire and then a morning 5-hour car ride by car.
There is no public transport.
The city of about 19,000 residents consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences, and of corrugated iron roofs, converted by rust into various yellow-brown tones.
Very few Indonesians have made their trip here, let alone journalists and virtually no foreigners.
Before Christian missionaries arrived, Mee Pago Papuans worshipped a god called Uga Tamee.
There have also been other changes.
"We weren't used to wearing these clothes," says Degei, pointing to her vibrant, hand-woven turban, her dark shirt and her bright skirt.
"We used to have only leaves on our bodies."
Papua is Indonesia's poorest province, where 28% of people live below the poverty line and have some of the worst infant mortality and literacy rates in Asia.
But it is also Indonesia's gold land.
The world's largest and most profitable gold mine, Grasberg, owned by Freeport McMoran from Phoenix, is located just 60 miles from Paniai, a Highland province the size of New Jersey with 153,000 residents.
In 2015 alone, Freeport has mined $3.1 billion worth of gold and copper.
In addition, Papua has timber resources worth an estimated $78 billion.
These riches, however, are a source of misery for the Papuans, ensuring that Indonesia's powerful military maintains a suffocating presence.
A 2005 investigation in The New York Times reported that Freeport paid local military personnel and units nearly $20 million between 1998 and 2004, including up to $150,000 to a single officer.
Papuan demands for greater autonomy threaten these golden goats and are dealt with mercilessly.
According to activists, more than 500,000 Papua people have been killed and thousands have been raped, tortured and detained by the Indonesian military since 1969.
Mass killings in Papua's tribal highlands in the 1970s became genocide, according to the Asia Human Rights Commission.
In the region alone, Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful protesters last year.
"We Are All Losing," it said in a 2016 report by the Archdiocese of Brisbane, which included reports of atrocity the previous year, such as unlawful executions and torture - rape and electric strikes are particularly popular, according to another report - and the brutal crackdown on peaceful demonstrations.
"It's difficult to count the number of victims since every week incidents happen," says Andreas Harsono, Indonesia-based researcher for Human Rights Watch.
The screws have strengthened as Papua's resources bring an influx of settlers from other parts of Indonesia.
The population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83% Christian, but demographic changes as Muslim economic migrants come from the densely populated islands of Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Javanese warp canteens sell fried chicken and Gado-Gado, a mixed vegetable served with peanut sauce.
Local people struggle to keep up here.
"The migrants have started selling chickens and vegetables in the traditional market cheaper than the local Papua," explains Abeth You, a 24-year-old Paniai native who moved to the provincial capital of Jayapura for work.
"It cost the indigenous Papua - the mumma [the women] of Papua - their market."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, popularly known as Jokowi, promised during his 2014 election campaign to address the inequalities and violations of justice in Papua.
The former carpenter secured 27 of Papua's 29 districts - including Paniai - on his way to the presidential palace in Jakarta.
But in Papua little has changed and today the locals feel betrayed.
"Our hearts are broken because we voted for Jokowi in 2014, with the expectation that he will fulfil our hopes that justice will be restored," says You.
Indeed, just two months after Jokowi’s inauguration in October, Paniai hit a low.
On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children were outside and singing Christmas songs in front of a campfire in Enarotali when two Indonesian soldiers broke through the darkness on a motorbike.
The frightened children told them to turn on their headlights.
One of the soldiers took offense to her tone and later came back with four soldiers, according to local pastor Yavedt Tebai.
The soldiers who had been drinking jammed and beat the group with their rifles, victims and witnesses said.
Then one of the soldiers fired into the children's group.
One child, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was so badly beaten that he fell into a coma.
A few hours later, the building of the nearby government commission was set on fire and things escalated the next day.
About 1,000 young Papua men, women and children gathered at a football pitch in front of the local police station and the military command center to demand justice.
They wore ceremonial hunting bows and performed the Waita dance - in circle running and imitating a bird song - of Papua's Mee Pago tribe.
Some protesters began throwing stones at police and military posts.
As the mood heated up, the soldiers were sent a command via an internal radio: "When the crowds resisted more than three times, they shoot them dead," according to an official document from TIME, which was not released to local media.
Yeremias Kayame, 56, the head of Enarotali's Kego Koto district, saw the threat and called for calm and urged the crowd to return home.
No one was in the mood to listen.
"When I turned around, I was suddenly shot in my left wrist," he told TIME on the porch of his colorful painted wooden house.
Kayame still doesn't know who fired, but says the bullet came from the ranks of the soldiers gathered here.
"It was crowded, a lot of shots were fired," he adds.
Local man Alfius Youw was hit three times, according to his cousin, who witnessed the shooting.
"I ran toward him and looked at his body to make sure he was," said Yohanes, who, like many Indonesians, has only one name bearing TIME in grim mood.
"I saw that he was dead... I kissed him."
The Papua police's chief inspector, Yotje Mende, told reporters that his officers only wanted to "secure" their station because it was being attacked.
"We have to defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us," Papua police spokesman, Commissioner Pudjo Sulistiyo, said in 2015.
"It's about life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and many more injured.
News of the killings only came the following day 'filtered' to Jakarta.
Three weeks ago Jokowi gave a passionate speech in Jayapura in which he expressed sympathy for the families of the victims and vowed to tackle the historical grievances in Papua.
"I want this case resolved immediately so it won't happen in the future," he said.
Security Minister Wiranto said in October 2016 that he was setting up an out-of-court mechanism to resolve historic human rights violations.
But the excuses began almost immediately.
"Most injuries occurred a long time ago.
Some were in the 90s and early 2000s.
The point is that we are committed to addressing these violations, but there are processes that need to go through," he said.
Then Wiranto made a retreat when he spoke to TIME on June 5 in Jakarta and said he had no plans to set up a complaint mechanism in Papua.
Instead, everything "is regulated by law," he said.
Wiranto, whom the UN has accused of "crimes against humanity" that left more than 1,000 dead in East Timor's bloody 1999 independence vote, said 11 cases of human rights abuses in Papua had already been settled, including the Paniai incident.
Families of the Paniai victims took such claims with grim disbelief.
"I've been interviewed four times in the last three years, but there has been no progress whatsoever," Yohanes says.
'I'm tired.'
He says years later he still lives in fear.
"I'm scared," he says.
"I am afraid of being arrested by the military, I fear being shot."
His brother Yacobus reiterated the view that people in Paniai are afraid to discuss the incident.
He says he was beaten by the military after he helped bury four of the victims.
"After I had buried the corpses, the military searched for me," he says.
The shootings have not stopped.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police shot at villagers in Paniai's neighborhood of Deiyai.
During a confrontation between villagers and the manager of a construction company that refused to bring an unconscious man to hospital, one person died and 17 others were injured, including children.
The man, 24-year-old Ravianus Douw, who drowned when he fished in a nearby river, died on his way to hospital.
Excited villagers protested in front of the company's office.
Police said villagers threw stones at officers who responded by firing warning shots.
But locals say the mobile brigade (Indonesian paramilitary police) began firing on the crowd, killing one.
"We were so panicked, we were afraid there was going to be revenge," says 29-year-old Dominggu Badii, who lives near the hospital and witnessed how the injured were quickly delivered here, according to TIME.
"I was hiding in my house for two days."
The Deiyai parliament has called for the officers involved to be held accountable and for withdrawing the police's mobile brigade from the area.
Paniai has always been a troublemaker for the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development reinforces the dissatisfaction of the tribesmen Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal, who live in the Green Highlands of Papua.
Many joined the Free Papua Movement (OPM), the rebel army that claims to defend Papua's rights by launching sporadic attacks and kidnappings of Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the top OPM leaders are from Paniai, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
In response, thousands of people have been arrested and arbitrarily detained in Paniai in recent years on the pretext of "safeguarding national sovereignty."
Some never resurface.
Among the people of Papua, Paniai is known as "a tragic, forgotten place."
Poverty reinforces discontent.
The bit of rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive for locals.
Bread is just as out of reach.
People here build everything they eat: especially nota and fruit and leaf vegetables.
Agriculture is the responsibility of women, who can each process four or five fields of sweet potatoes.
They keep most of the crop for the family while the rest is sold on the local market.
Ten pieces of Nota cost just 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Over time, economic inequalities have grown between native Papua and the new migrants, who have arrived in greater numbers since the opening of new routes to Nabire Airport.
The few jobs that exist in the region typically go to the better-educated and wealthier migrants.
Papua rarely has the capital or skills to run its own businesses competitively.
"The young people are not interested in staying in the village ... because here there are no jobs or money," says John Gobai, the chairman of Paniai's tribal council.
Isolation keeps the eyes of the world away from Papua.
Moreover, restrictions on reporting to international media remain tight.
Earlier this year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were deported from Papua for lack of coordination with related institutions, despite being given rare permission to film.
According to Phelim Kine, the deputy Asia director of Human Rights Watch, the promises of Jokowi's campaign to lift the restrictions on reporting to promote transparency and development were not realized.
"There are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to report from Indonesia's most troubled eastern provinces of Papua and West Papua: Visa refusal and a blacklist," he said in a statement.
Lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indonesian government remains largely confined to Papua's immediate neighbours.
In March, six Pacific nations - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - asked the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the "various and widespread violations" in Papua including the Paniai shootings.
The same countries have historically supported OPM.
Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesman Arrmanatha Nasir dismissed the group's allegations and told journalists in Jakarta: "In Indonesia there is still a democratic system and there is free media so it is difficult to cover up the evidence of human rights cases."
Local people want more foreign governments to take note of this.
When an official delegation from the Netherlands, led by the human rights ambassador Kees Van Baar, visited Jayapura on May 4, locals broke their silence and urged him "We want freedom," according to a source who also attended the meeting but wants to remain anonymous.
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019, but Papua officials say they are unlikely to vote for Jokowi again.
"Jokowi is a man who has good intentions, but he is surrounded by the people involved in the Paniai shots," says Gobai, the chairman of the tribal council.
He wants Jokowi to know that, apart from living under the constant threat of a predatory military, the Paniai people are in poor educational and health services.
Gobai says the Paniai people, like other Papuans, regard their vote for Jokowi as a "debt" he must repay.
"They don't need money, they just want justice," he says.
Despite the threats and intimidation, families of the Paniai shooting victims performed a last symbolic act of defiance: the body of a victim was buried on a site just opposite the police and military station.
They know that they may never get justice, but at least they do not let those responsible forget their crimes.
"A member of our family was killed," says Yacobus with a lowered head.
"What else can we do?"
Fire captures Dubai's 'Torch' skyscraper for second time
A fire took place Friday in one of the highest residential towers in the world in Dubai, forcing hundreds of residents to flee the 337-metre-high, 79-storey building.
It is the second fire to sweep through the high-rise in just two years, which is coincidentally called the Torch-Tower (Fatile Tower).
The building was evacuated, injuries were not reported and there was no direct word on the cause of the blaze.
"We slept and we stood up at the fire alarm and shouting people.
We ran down the stairs, and it took about 10 minutes to get down from the 50th floor," a resident who gave his name as George told Reuters.
Dubai's civil protection authorities said firefighting units at around 4.00pm local time (00.00pm GMT) extinguished the fire and cooled the building.
The government said it was working on providing shelter for those affected.
The incident may revive questions about the safety of materials used in exterior areas of high-rise buildings around the world.
An investigation by the management of the Torch building after its fire in 2015 revealed that most of the damage came from the lining, the outer lining to decoration or insulation.
In Britain, police said they believe the system of plates to isolate and disguise at London's Grenfell Tower in June may have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire in which about 80 people died.
No Davis Cup reform: Continue best-of-five
The president of the International Tennis Federation (ITF) has fallen through with his big Davis Cup coup at the General Assembly.
At the meeting in Ho Chi Minh City, the revolutionary proposal for this sport to play Davis Cup individual only on two sets of wins was razor-thin not supported by the required two-thirds majority.
The five-sentence classics, which are often very long but also very much appreciated for this reason, therefore remain the traditional one.
63.54 percent of member countries voted for the reform, so ITF President David Haggerty’s goal was narrowly missed.
"We respect this decision but are disappointed that our member nations have not adopted the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and Fed Cup.
We need a change to secure the long-term future of these iconic and historic contests," Haggerty said.
We will continue to work to improve the competition.
Not until the vote, after many objections, was the proposal to make the final in a neutral place.
New from 2018 are only comparatively minor details: for example, the finalists in the Davis Cup and Fed Cup will have the host right in the next year in the first round.
To reduce the cost to organisers, the requirements in terms of training pitches etc will be made easier and players will have to complete fewer official media appointments before the Davis Cup.
More than 1 in 5 U.S. travelers bring banned items to the plane, a survey finds
A survey of airline passengers found that more than 20 percent intentionally or unconsciously smuggled items past the checkpoints of the U.S. Transportation Security Administration, including at least 6 percent who boarded the plane while inadvertently carrying prohibited knives or other items with blades.
Less than 1 per cent claimed they had belatedly discovered they had gone wrong with firearms, ammunition or explosives.
The survey of more than 1,000 people - conducted by a jet charter service, the Stratos Jet Charters Inc. - also found that younger travelers are more likely to disregard the rules.
Of those surveyed who admitted they knowingly tried to fly with something banned by the TSA, 19.7 per cent were millennials, compared with less than 15 per cent who were members of Generation X.
The most common items deliberately passed to TSA agents were food and liquids.
More than 3 per cent admitted knowingly carrying items with blades through the security check, while 2.2 per cent of female respondents and 3.7 per cent of male respondents also confirmed they had deliberately brought banned drugs into the plane.
The company said it interviewed travelers across the country to find out how many had inadvertently brought contraband through airport security and how many had done it deliberately.
It's no surprise that the people most likely to carry contraband - knowingly or unwittingly - through security were the ones most likely to fly.
However, the company points out that the TSA guidelines are somewhat complicated and confusing.
People are often unsure what liquids they are allowed to carry with them or how much of it.
So it's no surprise that the largest amount of the items seized by the TSA are prohibited liquids.
For a while, people thought the TSA could view books as contraband.
Liquids are allowed on domestic flights, but not on international flights.
Elon Musk doesn't care: Tens of thousands of Tesla customers cancel order
Electro-thousandsassa Elon Musk is happy to give with the huge number of pre-orders for his new Tesla "Model 3."
In doing so, he has so far suggested that some of the customers have already withdrawn their non-binding reservation.
In addition to the always triumphant figures on sales growth and even more gigantic sales targets, Tesla’s chief executive, Elon Musk, revealed for the first time a different, less shiny figure in announcing the latest quarterly results: the cancellations of the new mass-market model 3.
Musk has frequently advertised in recent months with the more than 500,000 pre-orders for the new car, whose delivery is just beginning.
Now Musk admits: Of the total 518,000 pre-orders, 63,000 have already been withdrawn.
Critics have repeatedly pointed out that these are merely non-binding reservations.
In the event of a cancellation, Tesla will pay back the 1000 euros (US$1000 in the US and £1000 in the UK) "reservation payment" in full.
There are currently 455,000 such non-binding reservations, Musk conceded in a conference call with analysts.
However, the Tesla chief does not believe that the cancellation of around twelve percent of all orders so far could become a problem.
His argument is that the challenge to ambitious growth targets is not demand, but production.
Last year, Tesla supplied 84,000 vehicles.
In 2018, it is expected to be - all models put together - 500,000, and one million in 2020.
The demand for this is obviously there.
According to Musk, there are currently 1800 reservations per day.
Anyone who orders a "Model 3" today must expect delivery at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - if Tesla manages to drive its brand-new, never-before-tested production roads without major disruptions with maximum capacity utilization.
Many experts doubt that this is possible.
If there are major delays, however, the non-binding nature of the reservations could become a problem for Tesla.
Because then the company cannot prevent unhappy customers from running away in droves.
EPA chief Pruitt withdraws because of delaying Obama-Era rules on reducing emissions
A day after being sued by 15 states, Scott Pruitt, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, reversed his earlier decision to delay implementation of the Obama-era rules to reduce emissions of smog-causing air pollutants.
Pruitt presented the change as his agency proved more responsive to the needs of state environmental authorities than previous administrations.
He did not mention the lawsuit, which had been filed against his previous spot in a federal appeals court.
At issue is a deadline that expired on October 1 for states to meet 2015 standards for ground-level ozone.
Pruitt announced in June that he would delay compliance by a year to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid "interfering in local decisions or hindering economic growth."
Pruitt, who was Oklahoma's prosecutor before his appointment by President Donald Trump, has long been a reliable opponent of stricter environmental regulations.
Since arriving in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly moved to block or delay regulations that the chemical industry and the fossil fuel industry oppose.
Wednesday's sudden reversal is the latest legal setback to the Pruitts regulatory rollback agenda.
Last month, a federal appeals court in Washington ruled that the EPA administrator exceeded his authority when trying to delay implementation of an Obama administration rule requiring oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leaks.
In an opinion issued Wednesday night, Pruitt suggested that his U-turn on ozone standards simply reinforces EPA's willingness to cooperate with the states through the complex process of timely compliance with the new standards.
"Under previous administrations, the EPA often failed to meet the deadlines for implementation and then waited to be indicted by activist groups and others, and in an agreement to set the date for implementation," said Pruitt, who sued the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job.
"We don't believe in regulation through litigation and we take deadlines seriously.
We also take seriously the law and authority that we have."
Still, the EPA's opinion said that Pruitt will eventually use its "authority to delay and all other legally available powers" to ensure that the rules are "based on sound policy and the best available information."
Congressional Republicans are pushing for a broader rewrite of the ozone rules.
A bill approved last month is expected to delay implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years.
The measure has not yet been put to a vote in the Senate.
New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who headed the coalition of states that sued the EPA this week, said the group intends to maintain legal pressure.
"The EPA's reversal -- following our lawsuits -- is a significant boost to the health and safety of these 6.7 million New Yorkers and the over 115 million Americans who are directly affected by the smog that flows into their communities," Schneiderman said.
New York joined California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington and the District of Columbia in this case.
Ground ozone occurs when pollutants from cars, power plants, oil refineries, chemical plants and other sources in the atmosphere respond to sunlight.
The resulting smog can cause serious breathing problems in sensitive groups of people and contribute to thousands of premature deaths each year.
Public health officials and environmentalists cheered on Pruitt's surprising change of course.
"It's disturbing how much pressure it takes to get this sensible step from the person responsible for protecting the air we breathe," said Lori Ann Burd of the Center for Biological Diversity.
"We must continue to fight the Trump administration's ideological crusade to bid to polluters and their particular interests."
Tumlingen celebrates 750 years of St. Hilarius Church
750 years of St. Hilarius Church: On the occasion of the anniversary of the Bergkirche the old cemetery area in Tumlingen will be invited to a serenade at 16.30 on Sunday, July 16.30.
Whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the town, the historic St. Hilarius complex is a popular place to stay.
Visitors to the sixth charity serenade can be enchanted by this powerful place.
Saving and preserving the oldest building in the village has made Tumlingen's friends and patrons their concern.
Walter Martini stresses: "It's a unique village gem."
In 1267, the St. Hilarius Chapel was first mentioned in the Württemberg Documentary: Count Hermann von Sulz sold "the mountain with the parish church on it to Tumlingen and the Vogtei" to Magister Eberhard von Horb and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark Silber.
According to the wording of the document, in addition to the former parish church, there was also a stately court on the Tumlinger Berg, which included the church or the right of patronage and not the other way round.
So people lived there too.
As can be seen from the description of the Oberamt Freudenstadt from 1858, besides the Unterdorf and Oberdorf, which are still visible today in the townscape of Tumlingen, the "Berg" was the third, the stately centre of the village.
Old maps dating back to 1600 underpin these historical realities.
The patronage law originated from the early Middle Ages right to own churches.
A gentleman who built, furnished and occupied a church remained the owner of this church and was able to inherit this own church.
This meant the right to appoint a priest or to propose a new pastor to the bishop.
Three altars were in the church and two bells on the tower.
The larger of the two crumbled on Christmas 1673.
The newly acquired bell first sounded in 1692, but had to be delivered later in the Second World War in 1942.
In the 30-year war (1616 to 1648), the windows were knocked down and the bells were stolen.
The roof was leaking.
In 1796, French troops camped near the church.
They broke out the pulpit and church chairs and used them as firewood.
Remains of the church threatened to collapse in 1809.
Until 1869, the Tumlinger Hilarius Cemetery also served as the final resting place for the dead from Hörschweiler.
In 1823 the cemetery was extended and Hilariuskirche aborted.
Only the church tower was left standing.
In New Year's Eve 1834, a storm split the church tower and half collapsed.
To prevent an accident, the tower was aborted.
Only the tower, which still exists today, remained a witness to 750 years old church history.
Horst Kallenberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem are now caring for the Hilarius facility by the "creative pensioners" in place of Dieter Dockhorn.
As an organizer, the friends and patrons of Tumlingens invite to the sixth serenade at the old cemetery of St. Hilarius Chapel on Sunday, July 16.
This is created by the combo of the Kepler-Gymnasium Freudenstadt and with contributions from Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis.
Local Hartmut novels speaks the final word.
The programme starts at 16.30.
Admission is from 15.30.
For the end of the serenade, a roundabout takes place in front of the cemetery.
"Enjoy a summer evening under the shadow of old trees and with the wide view over meadows towards the forest," organisers put out the fantastic views.
The Serenade only takes place in dry weather.
Organisers are hoping for many supporters to preserve the historic St. Hilarius facility, which is important for tumbling and hearing aid workers.
The friends and patrons of Tumlingens feel particularly committed to home care, as Serenade organizer Walter Martini affirms.
Club wants approval of windmills examined
"Boisheim wrestles" sees no legal requirement for construction and has therefore contacted the county council.
The "Boisheim wrestling" association has asked Councillor Andreas Coenen (CDU) to withdraw its approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Boisheimer Nette.
It was unlawful.
The association argues that no wind turbines could have been approved at the time of the approval on December 30, 2016 in the Boisheimer Nette, as at the time there was only a wind turbine concentration zone in Viersen on the city border with Schwalmtal.
Within this concentration zone, construction and operation of wind turbines are basically possible, but at the same time the concentration zone causes an exclusion of wind energy use for the rest of the urban area.
Such zones are intended to prevent "saving" the landscape.
Although the city of Viersen had decided a second wind concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette a few days earlier by changing the land use plan, it had not been approved by the district government of Düsseldorf because of a formal error.
"By the lack of planning permission, the approval decision issued is still illegal and therefore to be withdrawn," said Christoph Erkens, chairman of "Boisheim wrestling."
Current state of affairs: The city council again decided on the wind concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette before the summer break; approval from the district government is pending.
Erkens: "Therefore, at this point the granting of a permit for the construction of wind turbines is legally excluded."
The circle confirms the receipt of the call.
"The relevant letters have been received at County Viersen since last week," a spokesman explained.
The county is taking them to re-examine the matter.
But they are not expected to stop the proceedings.
With a view to ongoing proceedings at the Administrative Court, the county on Thursday did not wish to comment on the content of the association's argument "Boisheim wrestles."
NEW Re, a subsidiary of NEW, plans to build four 200-meter high wind turbines on an area at the Boisheimer Nette.
Last year, the company in which the city of Viersen is indirectly involved concluded lease contracts with the owner of the site, which is about 65 acres.
The construction of the four wind turbines is intended to meet the electricity needs of around 11 400 households - roughly one fifth of the electricity needs of all four-seat households.
NEW Re wants to invest around EUR 20 million.
Last summer, Viersen's city council gave the go-ahead for the purchase of three wind turbines at the Linnich wind farm near Aachen and a stake in a wind turbine plant in Übach-Palenberg in Heinsberg County.
Car and tractor crashes together: Woman dies in horrific accident
A horrific traffic accident occurred at 10am on Friday morning on L 333 between Niederwallmenach and Bogel (Rhine-Lahn-Kreis).
A woman was fatally injured.
Two other people were slightly injured.
The national road remained closed for hours.
According to police, a 17-year-old young woman from Bornich with her car in the course of accompanying driving with her 53-year-old mother as a companion drove the L 333 towards Bogel.
City and retailers plan 'home shopping' weekend
Bad Langensalza and people from the region are expected to rediscover shopping opportunities in the city centre in September.
The trade association and the city council want to use the weekend on 8 and 9 September to attract residents to shopping in the city centre.
As the chairman of the trade association, Christian König, announced, the "home shopping" weekend should make customers aware of what offers their own city offers away from the usual supermarket goods.
A market with regional suppliers is therefore planned, similar to the weekly market.
In addition, local companies should present themselves with their apprenticeships.
In addition, downtown shops are expected to invite "midnight shopping."
The action not only targets residents of the city and the nearby region.
In preparation are commercials on the radio, an Internet video and printed bags that point to the action weekend, according to Christian König.
City administration and trade association cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry.
The trade association and the city thus go into another stage of the "attractive downtown" project.
This includes new offers such as the first "Active Day" to the Fountain Festival and an open-ended Sunday, talks with all traders and hosts to encourage them to actively participate.
Also attractive offers on Saturday and waiving parking fees on that day are part of the concept.
In addition, customer potentials should be newly or re-opened.
This includes spa guests and tourists.
But many locals would have lost sight of the city centre when shopping.
In the end, everyone would have to help revitalize the city center, right down to landlords, businesses throughout the city and clubs.
It was intended to overcome with a network the lethargy, which was partly spread, King said in the spring.
Birgit Strang, head of the IHK-Center in Mühlhausen announced that the third "home shopping" day, for the first time five Thuringian cities, is taking part in Germany.
In addition to Bad Langensalza, these are Weimar, Sömmerda, Heiligenstadt and Bleicherode.
The day should "promote for the appreciation of local trade and emphasize its importance to the common good of our cities," according to Stafford.
The action under the auspices of the IHK and with many partners also makes it clear that each citizen with his or her purchasing behavior can influence his or her direct environment.
Two dead and several injured after blast at U.S. school
During construction work, a gas explosion occurred in the school building.
New other people were injured.
Two people have been killed and nine others injured in a gas explosion in the US city of Minneapolis, some of them seriously.
According to the fire service, an injured person was still in critical condition on Wednesday (local time).
One man died when part of a school building collapsed in the explosion.
An initially missing person was also later found dead.
The dead were employees of the school.
As the cause of the accident was suspected, authorities were working on a gas pipeline.
At the holiday time, few people were staying in the Minneha Academy building.
Trump, after leaked transcripts of phone calls put Mexico under pressure over payment of border wall
Transcripts of phone calls between U.S. President Donald Trump and leaders of Mexico and Australia were published by The Washington Post.
On January 27, Trump called in a phone call with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto to stop saying publicly that he would not pay for a proposed border wall.
The US President denounced him for publicly denouncing the Wall and reportedly said to him: 'You cannot tell the press.'
Trump launched his presidential campaign by promising to erect a wall on the US’s southern border and vowed to make Mexico pay for the project.
Transcripts of his first call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull were also released and revealed a tense exchange.
Mr. Trump told Mr. Turnbull that a trade deal for the U.S. allowed refugees who migrated to Australia to take over was "ridiculous," "me" and "stupid," and that the insistence on trade brokered by the Obama administration would make him look like a "depp" after he proposed a ban on resettling refugees to the U.S.
Mr. Trump ended the call after telling Mr. Turnbull that "this is the most unpleasant call for all day."
Moors Ford massacre: Activists stage racist lynch as appeal for justice resumes
A 1948-born Ford Mercury drove through a group of spectators in rural Monroe, Georgia, and rumbled onto Moore's Ford Bridge.
Before the car, which had four black passengers and a white driver, could reach the bridge, a group of white men stepped out with guns to block its way.
The leader of the mob - a middle-aged man in a pinstripe suit - took a long train at his cigar and glanced testily through the windshield.
Inside, the inmates were floating in fear.
"We want this n -- r Roger!" screamed the man.
"Get him out of the car!"
Shouting tore the silence as a young black man was dragged from the front seat.
Fortunately, this terrible scene, played on July 22, is just an afterthought.
But when a noose is thrown around the neck of "Roger," almost everyone in the audience encountered very real sighs.
Since 2005, civil rights activists have returned to Moore's Ford Bridge to replicate the night in which two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and Mae Murray Dorsey - were lynched by the Ku Klux Klan in 1946.
No one has ever been charged with the murders.
"It's really inconceivable that in all these years no single person has been arrested - even though we see them in our communities, even though we know who they are," said Tyrone Brooks, who helps organize the re-enactment.
"It's a dirty spot on a story, but it's a burden on our souls."
Brooks is a 71-year-old former congressman of the state of Georgia and a lifetime civil rights activist.
For him, the re-enactment serves as a dramatic call to action and represents an annual reminder to the Monroe community that an injustice has never been corrected.
"We want prosecution, we want ending, we want healing, we want reconciliation, but first we need to get justice," he said.
"We cannot reach healing and reconciliation until we get justice."
A forensic scientist lays a bed sheet over the body of one of the victims of the Moore-Ford lynching on July 27, 1946.
According to FBI files obtained by NBC News, more than 50 men from Monroe and surrounding counties were suspected in the lynching process.
But none has ever been charged.
Although the suspects have remained at large for decades, civil rights activists say that the dual motivation for the lynch action has always been known throughout the city: Politics and sex.
In April 1946, a Supreme Court decision allowed black citizens in Georgia to vote for the first time in the summer pre-election race.
About the same time as the election, according to the FBI, black farmhand Roger Malcom stabbed a white landowner, Barnett Hester, during a fight - allegedly because of a woman.
Brooks said the rumor in the city was that Hester had slept with Malcom's wife Dorothy and that the baby she was carrying was not from her husband.
On July 25, 1946, Loy Harrison, a prominent white landowner, paid $600 to free Malcom from prison, according to the FBI.
He was accompanied to prison by Dorothy and her cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey.
But when they got away from prison and approached Moore's Ford Bridge, a lynch mob surrounded the car.
"As it turns out, it was Harrison who prepared and ordered the killings," concludes an FBI report.
"It is also obvious that there was a plot between state and local law enforcement not only involved in the killings, removed evidence and covered up the identity of witnesses."
Brooks put it more succinctly.
"It was an electoral law massacre," he said.
"They were all killed to send a message to black people in this community: "If you register and if you vote, that will happen to you here."
For nearly a decade, Cassandra Greene has led the annual retrial of the Moore Ford Bridge Lynch murders.
Their representation is vivid, engaging, and grounded in a kind of deep racism that many would like to believe no longer exists in America.
It's hard to watch, and even harder to look away, but Greene said that's the point.
"We don't want to talk about the lynch because then we are faced with its uglyness in all of us," she said.
"But I can't build a relationship with you if you don't want to listen to me or don't want to hear what I've been through."
Samples for this year's production began in June, and on the first day, nearly 30 actors - a dozen whites and the rest blacks - crowded into a room and listened as Greene launched a well-rehearsed overview of the play.
Wade Marbaugh is here Greenes co-director.
He has played the role of chief clan member for years, but he said the role never gets easier.
"I feel dirty because I'm not like that," Marbaugh said.
"But I think it's very important to keep this story alive because we don't want to go back to those times."
On the other side of the room, the actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, who play Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester, rehearsed their lines.
The play begins with Malcom screaming at Hester and pushing him, angry that he slept with his wife Dorothy.
"I said, n -- he, vanish from my property!"
Rascona resisted the fire.
There's a break.
And then everyone (at least all black actors) breaks out in laughter.
Greene laughs the loudest.
"What?!" asked Rascona.
He is alarmed and confused.
Was I too tough?
"No," Greene said, still chickening out.
"I just don't think white people said 'n -- - him' back then."
"But," quipped one of the other black performers.
"You just have to hit the hard 'R'."
And that's exactly where the energy shifts in the room, a sense of comradeship replacing the discomfort.
Everyone is busy getting this right, not only because of the game, but also because of the memory of the four people killed.
The scene begins again.
This time, when Rascona says the N-word, he says it's sharp and forceful.
Absolutely no one laughs.
This repetition ends violently and quickly.
There are cries, shots and then silence.
A woman, wearing a mourning dress, stands over the actor's corpse and performs Billie Holiday's grieving eulogy "Strange Fruit."
Her voice breaks at every second word.
Roughly a hundred yards behind, a group of about four dozen bystanders wields sweat and tears from their eyes.
The audience is almost evenly divided between black and white.
A couple have travelled from Ithaca, New York, to watch the performance, many just down the street.
They all experienced Georgia's humidity for nearly eight hours when Brooks led them on a pilgrimage to the grave sites of the Malcoms and Dorseys.
Up to that point, the killings have remained an anecdote, but now, when you stand on the same land where the lynch killings took place, the air feels eerie.
When the last notes of the song sound out, Greene invites the crowd to get closer and inspect the corpse name.
Children hover at their heads, register the fake blood and the silent bodies and whisper to each other.
"They're not really dead," grumbles a little boy, as if to remember.
After a few minutes, Greene thanks the crowd - and suddenly it's over.
The actors throw the lynch rope away and wipe away their tears.
Bradshaw hugged Marbaugh, the man in the suit who played the clan member.
Nick Rascona hugged two of his fellow players and then collapsed in their arms crying, the emotional burden of the performance eventually breaking with him.
"It's okay," whispers one of the women.
"We know that's not in your heart.
You did it for a reason."
Later, the audience sits down with the actors for dinner.
At a table, a white couple from Atlanta excited about re-enactment with a black couple they just met.
Denise Duplinski struggled to find words about what feeling the performance left.
"It's hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... coming from people who look like you and who do that because they look like you," she said.
"What this really does with me makes me believe that the lynching continues," she added, "today this is just called police shooting."
In the same room, Tyrone Brooks holds court at his table, he eats and recalls civil rights.
He said he had already started planning the performance next year.
"The imitation is in a way inspiring, because it describes the horror of what we've endured, but it's also a moment of learning," he said.
"It's like if we don't learn anything from it then it can happen again.
Those who do not study their own history, those who do not know their own history, are condemned to repeat it."
"Godfathers" reconciled the Wagnerians in Bayreuth
Also in the fourth part of Richard Wagner's monumental work, director Frank Castorf puts on a colorful-frivolous staging against a gigantic, six-story backdrop.
The Rotbühne (designed by Aleksandar Denic) shows a shabby street corner with Wallrest and Dönerbude in Berlin, a "Plaste und Elaste" logo from GDR times or the New York Stock Exchange.
Before that, an open Mercedes-Oldtimer parked in which the Rheintöchter poses as rocker girls, or alternatively an Isetta.
Stacked oil barrels remind of Castorf's leitmotif - money, power and greed - which runs through his "ring" staging.
The three Rheintöchter - sung by Stephanie Houtzeel, Wiebke Lehmkuhl and Alexandra Steiner - harmonize wonderfully as in the "Rheingold".
Kess seduces them Siegfried (Stefan Vinke), smashing a corpse into the trunk in Hollywood manner and giving the octuplets clique.
Stephen Milling sings the wonderfully nasty Hagen, which surrounds the aura of a heavyweight boxer.
Brutal the scene when he beat Siegfried.
Later, Gunther (Markus Eiche) must also believe.
The audience thanks the ensemble with strong applause.
Stormily celebrated are Foster, Milling, Vinke and conductor Janowski, who bows modestly and hands formal to the Mercury turf.
There is great applause for the Festival Orchestra, which is showing up for the first time on stage - given the great heat again in casual leisure clothing.
The appearance of Frank Castorf and his directing team was eagerly awaited.
Had he had to endure a fine pipe concert in 2013, five years later, there was great jubilation in which the sporadic "Buh" calls went down.
Festspielchef Katharina Wagner may have been pleased about this.
"You notice that the audience has grown up with the "ring" in some way," she had said shortly before performing the dpa.
The audience not only made a form of peace with Castorf, but it also grew an understanding of his viewpoint.
I prefer a positive reshuffle.
Max Menge works as a volunteer
They work in multiple locations in their volunteer year.
Where everywhere?
Lot: Normally in Steinfurt in the Furniture Exchange, once a week I help out here in Greven in the Furniture Bridge.
And I've also worked at the school all day.
What are your experiences with this?
Lot: It's a beautiful, broad spectrum I see here.
I have to deal with different people, with young people, with refugees, with young adults.
They are now 26 years, so a late-term volunteer.
How come that?
Crowd: I did high school.
And then a civil engineering degree, let's say, successfully aborted.
I realized for myself that it is the wrong thing for me and I want to do something else, work with people.
And then I wondered what you are doing.
Make a social year, there's an insight, you can see how it really is on the ground, in the focal point perhaps.
And was it?
Crowd: I collected great impressions.
I will start my studies in social science in the winter semester.
I'm going to study dual, I'm probably doing a social worker training in the youth office in Herne and studying in Hamm at the University of Applied Sciences.
Is it not something unusual to have several different locations of use during the voluntary service?
Crowd: Yes, it's very variable.
It probably always comes down to where you do your FSJ.
You can do it from retirement homes to youth work - in all kinds of facets of social work.
It was very varied for me.
I was also partly in OGS, so in afternoon care.
For me, that was exactly what irritated me.
I could see my own strengths and see how it really happens.
Unlike in civil engineering studies?
Lot: Well, clearly, this is not about counting statics.
There are always other people who have a very different story behind them.
Whether a refugee, a young person who has been brought out of the family - you always have to deal with it individually.
Very interesting.
And you had no touches?
Crowd: I'm not the guy for that.
It's an area that gives you a lot.
A lot of love, a lot of kindness.
There are also negative moments, but so is that life.
Pearson cuts another 3,000 jobs and cuts dividend to revive business
British education group Pearson said on Friday it will cut another 3,000 jobs and cut its interim dividend by 72 per cent as another restructuring programme is launched to overcome the pressure the company is facing.
The job cuts, announced mostly by Director-General John Fallon in late 2018 and early 2019, are in addition to his previous restructuring, which has already lost 4,000 jobs.
Pearson announced in May in a third cost-cutting programme a plan to cut costs by another £300 million ($394 million) to revive a business hit by the rapid move to digital learning.
The company, which last month sold its stake in Penguin Random House to partner Bertelsmann, said that the outlook for the fiscal year was unchanged after it reported an increase of 1 per cent to £2.05 billion in the first half of the year.
Kabul convoy attack: NATO soldier killed in suicide attack
A suicide bomber has attacked a military convoy in the Afghan capital Kabul, killing one NATO soldier and injuring several others, officials say.
Five soldiers and an interpreter were injured, a statement from NATO said.
Unconfirmed local reports said three civilians also died in the incident in the Qarabagh district.
The bombing is the latest violence to hit Afghanistan this month - on Tuesday more than 30 people were killed at a mosque in Herat.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
In a NATO opinion, it said the explosion on Thursday night occurred when a joint patrol with the Afghan army was attacked by an "improvised explosive device carried by people."
The statement says all the injured are in a stable condition and are being treated at the U.S. military hospital at the Bagram airfield.
Correspondents say the growing strength of the Taliban and the group known as the Islamic State (IS) in Qarabagh is a major concern for NATO forces in nearby Bagram.
According to the United Nations, there were at least 1,662 civilian deaths in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, about 20% of them in the capital.
In late July, a suicide car bomb killed at least 30 people in a mainly Shiite district of Kabul.
The Taliban said they carried out that attack.
On May 31, a massive bombing in the center of the city killed more than 150 people with the country's most deadly militant attack since US-led forces ousted the Taliban from power in 2001.
The violence underscores the precarious security situation in Afghanistan as U.S. President Donald Trump weighs in on increasing the number of U.S. troops supporting the military and police in the country.
Correspondents say the suicide bombings in Kabul in recent weeks have also caused a crisis of public confidence in the government, its policies and especially in the reputation of President Ashraf Ghani.
EPA reverses decision to delay smog rule after lawsuits
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency overturned a decision to delay an Obama administration regulation requiring states to curb smog-causing emissions, a day after 15 states sued the agency for the move.
The EPA announced late on Wednesday the decision to advance the so-called "zoning provisions of 2015," and said it shows the agency's commitment to working with states.
"We believe in dialogue with and in responding to our state partners," EPA Chief Executive Scott Pruitt said in a statement.
Pruitt announced in June the EPA's intention to use ozone regulations - in which pollutant emissions are to be measured in part of the country to determine where cuts must be made to meet stricter air quality standards - to delay a year until October 2018.
A group of 15 mostly Democratic states, along with the District of Columbia, filed suit Tuesday, saying that the effort was illegal.
President Donald Trump’s administration has sought to scale back a broad range of environmental constraints imposed by former President Barack Obama as part of a broader agenda, according to Trump, to boost economic growth.
However, the efforts have triggered the setback of Democrats and conservation groups, who are worried about the impact of greater emissions on public health.
The EPA's website says inhaling air that contains ozone "can reduce lung function and amplify breathing symptoms" such as asthma.
Local council wants community space
In the end, the decision was clear: In two dissenting votes, the town council of Fluorn-Winzel decided to set up a community area in the future senior housing estate.
Before the discussion there is an important information: The purchase contract for the missing piece of land has been signed, reports Mayor Bernhard Tjaden.
Although it will take time for the area previously belonging to the parish to be owned by the parish, there is no longer any obstacle to planning the project to be completed by a private investor.
For this there is a discussion about a Community area.
One of the two investors still in the boat has offered to meet the community.
On the ground floor, it would provide a living area - around 55 square metres - and an adjacent terrace with as much as 70 square metres of space for a special price.
The administration and the majority of the local council have the idea of not providing such a communal area as a meeting place only for the residents of senior-level housing, but to enter the community openly.
As an example, the word "Strickcafé" went round.
The decision, which was pre-determined last autumn by the provision of funds for the current budget, is sweetened by funding opportunities.
The building is located in the rehabilitation area.
Establishing a community space, Tjaden reports, would be eligible, with 60 percent of 30 percent.
The proposal for a decision, in order to signal to the investor that they do not want to throw a stick between their legs in this respect, provides for the observation that both saddle - which is linked to the environmental construction - and pulpit roof - which reduces the height of the shed and makes construction more economical - would be possible.
Unnecessary, Wilfried Sohmer says, is this addition.
If it helps, it will happen unanimously.
The Community area is not as simple as that.
Daniela's reputation refers to the many separate buildings with which you don't really get along, for which you are now opposed in the community room out the window, she says: "I'm struggling with it."
Yvonne Staiger is absolutely in favour of the Community area - but absolutely against local participation.
It sees behind it a covert subsidy to already wealthy or even outside investors.
That is not the case, because the acquisition of the area does not give a subsidy, but rather gets a real value, which can be marketed in the event of doubt, is the opposite.
Staiger's motion to split the proposed decision accordingly finds three supporters.
So two votes against the original programme, which Stefan Haller sums up as follows: 'If we take the decision in this way, we will take a giant step towards closing a huge gap in our infrastructure'.
Collision with car: Cyclist is thrown on road
When crossing the road, an 82-year-old cyclist was struck by a car in Garath on Wednesday and seriously injured.
As police pointed out, the 82-year-old Langenfelder had been riding his bike on the Black Way cycle path from the direction of Hilden at 12.20pm.
The senior wanted to cross the runway at the height of the road Am Buchholzer Busch.
A car driver travelling in the same direction gave him priority.
When Langenfeld drove to the road, however, he apparently didn't pay attention to the counter.
He collided with a car carrying a 66-year-old Hildenerin.
The man was thrown onto the street.
He suffered serious injuries and was taken to hospital with a rescue truck.
FC Bayern Munich must miss out on David Alaba and Thiago in the Supercup against Borussia Dortmund
The Supercup takes place without him: David Alaba must snatch the game against Dortmund.
With personnel concerns, FC Bayern travels to Dortmund for the first compulsory game of the new season.
Seven professionals are missing the title defense in the Supercup against the postseason.
The personnel concerns at the German football league champions Bayern Munich are growing ahead of the Supercup on Saturday (20.30/ZDF and Eurosport) at Cup winners Borussia Dortmund.
Coach Carlo Ancelotti must also miss out on David Alaba in the duel with the BVB.
The Italian confirmed that on Friday.
In addition, the mouths of Manuel Neuer, James, Thiago, Jerome Boateng, Arjen Robben and Juan Bernat are missing.
For the five defeats in the past six Test matches, Ancelotti has blamed the physical condition and lack of balance in his team's game.
"We know we're not in the best physical condition," Ancelotti said, adding: "The main point is the balance in the team.
It was not good after all.'
However, the 58-year-old believes in a performance increase in the first official compulsory game of the season.
"Football is also tactics, strategy, personality and motivation.
I have great confidence that my team is showing these qualities.
The team is ready.
We want to play intelligently," said Ancelotti, who expects a "difficult, intense game."
The duel of the two German football heavyweights captivates fans.
The match is sold out with 81,360 spectators, the German Football League (DFL) announced on Friday.
Walking in the resin of star to star
In resin the first "star trail" is to be created nationwide.
This is planned by the association observatory Sankt Andreasberg.
There is a planetary path in Göttingen - since 2003.
A "Star Trail" meets the information needs of many resin visitors, it was said.
It combines nature, science, movement and sporting performance.
Members want to make tabs along the planned route and inform about stars and constellations.
In a first phase until 2018, the association plans "well-reachable installations at five to six locations" in the upper resin.
St. Andreasberg, Braunlage, Hohegeiß and Sieber would be eligible.
The information on the boards should be supplemented via the Internet.
A good mobile network reception therefore plays a role in the choice of location.
Accessibility is also a criterion.
Later, the Star Trail train is to be expanded by train.
"On the star trail, viewers learn a lot of worth knowing, for example, about the physics of individual stars," the association explained.
They also learned why stars have different colors, or why one star shines more than another, even though it is much further away.
It also tells you where a star is located and when it is best to see.
The association already operates the highest observatory in northern Germany since 2014 in the mountain town of St. Andreasberg.
The location in the middle of the National Park of Harz is one of the six darkest regions in Germany, according to the Federal Office for Conservation of Nature.
Often, the Milky Way and even the Andromeda galaxy can be seen with the naked eye.
Since 2003, at the initiative of the Planetarium Göttingen association, there has been something similar to the planned stargazer - the planetary path.
Starting in front of Gebhard's Hotel in Goetheallee, which forms the interior of our solar system, the planetary path leads up to Hainberg and the Observatory - as well as an "out-of-the-world" location in Diemarden (community of equals) with the planet Sedna.
The poles with the individual planets - including the Pluto degraded to the dwarf planet at the end point - are positioned precisely at the distance and scale of one to two billion.
The earth shrank to a sphere of 6.5 millimeters in diameter, while the sun, which is exactly 75 metres away, measures 70 centimeters.
The total distance of the planetary path is about four kilometers.
While the light from sun to pluto takes about eight hours, pedestrians need a good hour to get to the Stele with Pluto.
Pedestrians are therefore faster than light in space.
The march to the next fixer, however, would take six months.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomakeko meet for first time, discuss a possible showdown
Vasyl Lokonenko and Mikey Garcia, who should be in a collision course to stage the most exciting boxing match in the near future under 147 pounds, met for the first time Thursday.
They were in separate rooms at ESPN's offices in Los Angeles until Garcia, the undefeated World Boxing Council lightweight champion, walked down the hallway to welcome Lomachko, the World Boxing Organisation super-featherweight champion.
After Garcia's victory by unanimous decision over former four-division champion Adrien Broner on Saturday at Showtime, both fighters are members of the top five pound-for-pound list.
Garcia stretched out the right hand and said, "How do you go, champion?
I wish you luck.'
Lomachko defends his belt against Miguel Marriaga at 19 on ESPN on Saturday night.
As the pair posed for photos, Lokomotiv manager Egis Klimas noted that a possible showdown between the fighters would be the "perfect magnitude."
"I'm a former featherweight," Garcia recalled.
"I went up for Broner [at 140 pounds] but I'm not that big.
I'm small for 140.
I want to get down to lightweight.
And he has to move on lightweight [135 pounds] and then we fight.
That's what fans demand.
Let us give them that."
Lomachko agreed.
'Boxing needs this fight'.
Klimas asked if it should be on pay-per-view, part of a strategy that Lokäko will have to contend with with a 135-pound debut this year to agree a date next summer with Garcia (37-0, 30 knockouts) who also has interest in fighting the winner of Jorge Linares-Luke Campbell following their lightweight title fight at the forum on September 23.
"This fight could take place in pay-per-view mode because all the fans have asked for him," Garcia said, and pressed openly later to fight at the network, which offers the best financial package.
We are the best.
No other names can generate that kind of attention.
Whenever they are ready, "
Garcia said he regarded Lokonenko as "an enormous fighter," and he may participate in his Saturday fight.
But Lokonenko kept in generous praise for Garcia and said that he thinks the three-game champion from Riverside look "very slow, sorry Mikey ... you wanted the co-off."
Garcia said the focus was to show potency, then boxing.
Both said they could feel the momentum building for their own fight.
"This is the fight that needs to be carried out.
No other fight creates so much attention and enthusiasm.
I'm more than happy to work on it," Garcia said.
Lomakeko said: "I've been waiting for the top fighters, and that's Mikey.
It will be a great fight."
Four injured after tire burst
Four people were partially seriously injured in an accident on the A7 on Thursday afternoon.
According to initial information, the driver of an Opel Zafira lost control of his vehicle at around 16.30 shortly before the junction of the market wide, presumably after a tire burst.
The car slammed to the right into the embankment, where it fell over and then remained on the roof in the green strip.
The four occupants - two adults and two children - were partly seriously injured in the accident.
During initial care for the injured by the ambulance service, the A7 was closed to the north for about an hour, then traffic on the left lane could be routed past the accident site.
Fortunas Hoffmann: 'triple chain works better'
Andre Hoffmann hopes after 2:2 at the start of the season against Braunschweig that optimizing the defense formation will bring points in Aue.
With the first game of the season, Andre Hoffmann was happy with the result even if there had not been the two opponents at 2:2 against Braunschweig.
"These were two oppositions too much, and we need to be even better at Aue," says the defenseman from Fortuna Düsseldorf.
In the Ore Mountains the tripartite chain should be further optimised.
And a goal after a free-kick the Fortunen don't want to catch either.
"For the future, no one will be on the line next to Michael (Rensing).
Hoffmann is convinced that even after the experience in preparing with the three-man squad, his team can cope better than with the four-man squad.
"Still, I don't know how we're going to operate in Aue," says his coach Friedhelm Funkel, but Hoffmann is sure of his cause, "because we're just in the triple chain on the half positions in Kaan Ayhan and Niko Gießelmann have players who can build well," Hoffmann said.
"The premise is, but that we harmonise even better and that we do not do so many play-offs in the construction."
Of course Hoffmann also goes to Aue to win the game.
"Whether you can talk about a failed start after a draw doesn't know.
The performance might well be okay," said Hoffmann.
"If, however, we can leave on Sunday with four points and concentrate on the cup, we will certainly be able to talk about a proper start to the season."
His coach didn't want to know about it.
"I only judge the start of the season after six to eight days," said Friedhelm Funkel, who does not want to speak of an advantage over Aue just because the Saxony game in Heidenheim had to be cancelled prematurely because of a storm.
"Now they can virtually start the season with a home game," Funkel said and Hoffmann believes the players from Aue might even be a little fresher as they wouldn't have a heavy and complete game like Fortuna against a rising favorite in the bone.
"But they don't know as 100% where they currently stand," says the Fortuna's interior designer.
Although the guests from the Rhineland as a light favourite on Sunday go to the meeting at the finally (almost) finished stadium of Aue.
"That we sweep them away just because we are entitled to come under the first six is stupid," says Funkel, whose record in only one defeat against Aiken from nine games is thoroughly positive.
"There is no team in the 2nd Bundesliga you have to beat from the start," Fortunas head coach explains.
"To make such a statement would be arrogant and arrogant."
And so Funkel certainly doesn't want to experience his players on Sunday.
New findings of Swedish Asylum Age assessment tests published
Recent results from tests for asylum-seekers in Sweden, which have undergone a new method of medical assessment of their age, show that more than 80 percent of the people tested are older than 18, but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results.
The Swedish Forensic Medicine Authority (Council Medicine) began conducting the tests last year.
They are expected to make the assessment of age more accurate during the asylum process after the Swedish Migration Authority (Migrationsverket) was criticised for errors in assessing the correct age of some refugees who were underage.
To date, Migrationverket has sent out 6,880 cases to be tested and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now released the results of 2,481 tests from the period from mid-March to July 31, 2017.
Eighty per cent (2002) were judged to be 18 or older, while in a further 25 cases the Forensic Medicine Agency judged that the person was "possibly 18 years or older."
In 432 cases, the conclusion was that the person "may be under 18 years old."
The tests are carried out only in cases where the age of the person is questioned.
According to Johan Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency, the results in recent months are steady.
"We don't see a big difference in statistics over the past few months, the numbers are pretty constant," he told The Local magazine.
The high proportion of cases in which the person was judged to be over 18 does not necessarily mean the asylum seeker lied about his age.
In May, the agency released the results of 581 tests and said there were 442 cases that "propose that the person investigated was 18 years or older."
When the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet looked at the 581 published results, it found that in 243 of those cases, the person had openly said she would turn 18 this year.
The method of medical age assessment, in which X-rays of wisdom teeth and MRT recordings of knee joints are made, then analyzed by dentists and radiologists, has also been criticised in some areas.
One skeptic is endocrinologist Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute, whose work includes assessing people's biological maturity to see if they went through puberty sooner or later than usual.
"I had reason to think about it and I don't think the type of measurement should be used.
Judging biological age in this way is very uncertain.
If we can't say it safely, we shouldn't pretend we could," he told newspaper Metro.
Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency, however, defended the accuracy of the tests: "In general, you can say that the risk of judging a child as an adult is low.
The biggest risk is that if the person is just under 18, in this case that is around 10%."
Full in plan
Work on the three bridges of Landstraße 108 between Lauterbach and Schramberg is progressing well.
On Wednesday, a seven-ton concrete section was installed at the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lauterbach.
"We're very good at the time, it's going great," says Reinhold Leicht, construction manager at the Department of Road and Transport at the Government Bureau of Freiburg.
In April, work began simultaneously on all three necessary bridges between Schramberg and Lauterbach.
The building is scheduled for October and it is easy to be sure that the timetable will be adhered to.
The first bridge, coming from Schramberg, leads over the Trombach.
It is a concrete vaulted bridge with a red stained sandstone and a total length of 4.80 metres.
It was built in 1900.
Like the other two bridges, it has now entered the years.
In order to ensure stability and road safety, the three buildings are now thoroughly renovated.
The other two bridges lead over Lauterbach.
They are made of red stained sandstone.
Both were built in 1939 and are 12, respectively 10.60 metres long.
The bridge at the local entrance of Lauterbach has now received a 1.30 m wide and seven tonne so-called bridge cap on the north side on Wednesday morning.
This is an edge fixing which is also used as an operating path.
A 2.20-metre bridge cap is to be deployed on the southern part of the bridge on Friday.
Then the pedestrian path should run.
The special thing is that these are finished parts, a patent of the Schramberger company Dizwo.
The other two bridges are already equipped with the patented bridge caps.
The installation of pipes through the building in Lauterbach required particular sensitivity.
Because there is also a fibre-optic cable that many companies are connected to.
Residents were informed of the project by handout in advance of the work.
In addition, fish and crabs first had to be fished.
For the bridges between the Bauhof building and the Collector in the direction of Schramberg, traffic is punctually regulated by a traffic light.
For construction work on the bridge at the Lauterbacher entrance, the road in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotels "Tannenhof" and "Sieben Linden" is completely closed.
The total cost of the three bridge renovations is EUR 700 000.
It is financed by the country.
AfD in Gerolstein: Bum protest at German potato salad
It is not so often that parties pull together, but when it comes to the Alternative for Germany (AfD), what is otherwise difficult to reconcile comes together.
The parties represented in the Vulkaneifel district (CDU, SPD, Greens, FDP, FWG, Left) belong to a broad alliance, which is peacefully flagging this day because the AfD in the Gerolstein City Hall invites Rondell to "great campaign start" according to the poster.
And familiar names to launch - such as Alice Weidel, who along with Alexander Gauland forms the top duo for the general election on September 24, and Deputy Federal Chairman Beatrix of Storch.
But those who are on the ground hours before the event begins don't want to listen to the AfD learners, they want to demonstrate.
The motto "The Eifel remains colorful."
Originally the town picnic was planned under the motto "All at a Table" on the fountain square, but it now takes place in the parking lot below the Rondell - and thus directly in front of those who come to the AfD event in the city hall.
A colourful picture to see.
And what Christa Karoli, chairman of Forums One World and one of the authoritative organizers, really likes: "Toll how many people have come here."
There's music and plenty of food, including an "urgent potato salad that even the AfD could easily eat," says the woman who brought him along.
Police have ordered many officers to Gerolstein, showing presence mainly at the station, which is just a few metres from the venues.
How did the AfD actually get to Gerolstein?
Mario Hompes of the AfD Volcanic Eifel reports he has sought such an event and got the supplement.
The 45-year-old from Gönnersdorf had first enquired in Daun but got a cancellation there because of the already built Laurentiuskirmes there was not enough parking.
So now the Rondell, Hompes is pleased that "we can have such a beautiful event here."
Looking at the event at the Rondellvorplatz, he says, "This is people's good right, principally, it remains peaceful."
That's what it does: At about 20 p.m. on the Rondellvorplatz a band provides entertainment, in the city hall various speakers, including the rhubarb-painted AfD chairman Uwe Young.
There are about 200 listeners in the room waiting for the top candidate for the general election, Alice Weidel, and the deputy federal chairman Beatrix von Storch to make their speeches.
The police presence is unchanged, but so far the officers have had a quiet evening.
The AfD event lasts a little more than an hour, the guests in the front seat have a longer breath, but it is also scheduled to clean up shortly after 21 a.m.
The police can move away - no special incidents.
Posaune hits trumpet
A rehearsal with the Wolfacher Posaunist Frederic Belli will be available in the series of Haslacher Monastery Concerts tomorrow, Sunday, at 20 p.m. in the monastery church.
Together with the Bulgarian trumpeter Miroslav Petkov he gives a concert under the motto "Black Sea meets Black Forest", or even "Balkanfolklore" meets a classical German education with roots in brass music.
Both soloists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and hold solo positions in top European orchestras.
Petkov is solo trumpeter at the renowned Concertgebouw Orchestra Amsterdam and Frederic Belli is solo composer of the SWR Symphony Orchestra.
Both combine the desire not only to cross the boundaries on their instruments, but also to merge the boundaries of different genres.
For example, Johann Sebastian Bach sounds like in a new guise, Daniel Schnyder's "World Music" combines with Bulgarian folklore, and in the piece "Exchange Suite" by the jazz award-winner Nils Wogram, mixing classical, jazz and free play into a fascinating work of art.
This centerpiece of the program was premiered only this spring with huge success in Freiburg.
The renowned composer Nils Wogram wrote it especially for the two musicians and even more: The Haslacher Klosterkirche with its special acoustics is deliberately included in the concert.
Kristen Stewart talks about her bisexuality
"Some people love grilled cheese and will eat it until the end of their lives.
But I want to try everything out," Kristen Stewart said bluntly about her bisexuality.
"When I once put in grilled cheese, I think, 'Oh this was cool, what comes next?'"
The Hollywood star's most famous relationship was with her "Twilight" colleague, Robert Pattinson, who ended up bitterly apart.
Despite all this, the brittle actress assures the "Harper's Bazaar" magazine: "I was seriously in love with everyone I dated.
Or do you think about it, I'd played it?"
After her separation, Kristen admitted that she was bisexual: "I've always lived dualism and seriously believed it.
So it has never confused or hindered me.
I just never wanted to be taken seriously."
She suffered particularly from it, according to "Bang Showbiz" but at school, when she preferred to dress like a lad: "Not all girls are typical girls.
That really hurt me.
When I was eleven the children told me I would look like a lad.
I felt really assaulted, scared and ashamed.
Now I look back and think, 'Girls, be proud of you!'
Particularly to the public, she doesn't like to explain her love life: "People expect you to behave in a certain way and that annoys me.
Some may call me thankless, but I do not like having to justify myself to the general public."
West Virginia governor announces he is switching party
. The Democratic governor of West Virginia, Jim Justice, announced Thursday night at a rally with President Trump that he would change the party.
Whether you like it or not, the Democrats have distanced themselves from me," Governor Justice said.
"Today I will tell you many prayers and many reflections ... today I will tell you, as a resident of West Virginia, that I can no longer help you when I am a Democratic governor."
The rally erupted in jubilation.
"Tomorrow I will change my registration to Republicans," Justice added.
"As a coach, I would say it's time to play another game."
Mr. Trump previously promised a big announcement at the West Virginia rally.
Mr. Trump won West Virginia by 42 points, and Justice did not endorse Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice, who according to Forbes is the only billionaire in the state, was elected in 2016.
Forbes notes that he owns coal mines in five states, and inherited a coal business from his father.
It is worth about $1.59 billion.
Meanwhile, on Thursday evening, the Republican National Committee issued a statement saying, "Governor Justice's change of party is another blow to a Democratic Party that would prevent us rather than work to make our country great again."
"With only 15 governorships and control of the fewest legislatures in history, Governor Justice's announcement is just the latest rejection of a party that is from top to bottom without leadership and unable to find a positive, unifying message," RNC Chairman Ronna McDaniel said in a statement to CBS News.
Coe praises 'honest' Russian apology for doping scandal
The world's head of athletics, Sebastian Coe, praised on Thursday what he described as an apparent apology from Russia over a doping scandal, but he reiterated it was not the moment for the country to get back into the sport.
Russia's athletics chief Dmitry Shylakhtin said during the IAAF congress on the eve of the World Athletics Championships that his country's banishment from the sport was correct and that he was determined to fight doping.
He said he was sorry for "all athletes who were snatched away gold and silver medals at competitions."
Despite his comments, the IAAF Congress voted to maintain the ban imposed in November 2015 after a report by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) found evidence of state-sponsored doping in Russia.
"I thought it was a very open response today, a very honest presentation," IAAF president Coe told reporters.
"The entire Council and the entire Congress were pleased that the Russian Federation recognised itself that it had experienced some fairly hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is reshaped."
Coe said he was also "pleased" about Russia accepting the criteria for its reinstatement.
"I think it was a very constructive day and I think progress has been made, but Congress supports the task force's recommendations that this is not the moment to reinstate Russia," Coe said.
"We have to do everything in the coming months to normalise this situation.
The guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate clean athletes from the tainted system," he added
Nineteen Russian athletes will compete as neutral players in the World Athletics Championships, which begin in London on Friday, according to the strict IAAF criteria.
The head of the IAAF task force, Rune Andersen, said Monday that Russia still needed to meet some of the criteria for reinstatement.
Drug tests are still inadequate and banned trainers are still operating freely, he told reporters in London after a lecture at the IAAF Council.
Funeral for soldiers killed in Mali
At a funeral service in northeastern Fritzlar, about 1,000 people of the two killed in a helicopter crash in Mali were thought to have died.
The ceremony took place in Cathedral City on Thursday amid high security precautions.
On the unsolved crash cause, Defense Minister Ursula von der Leyen (CDU) said nothing.
But she described the two killed pilots as "kings of their profession."
"We bow to this highest sacrifice they made on behalf of the Federal Republic of Germany," she explained.
The 33-year-old Major and the 47-year-old chief of staff from northern Iraq were killed in West African Mali on Wednesday a week ago.
Their coffins were transferred to Germany and brought to the Fritzlar Cathedral of St Peter on Thursday accompanied by a German army death guard.
At midday, only the relatives in the church said goodbye.
Afterwards, the funeral ceremony began in the circle of the family, close friends, representatives of the Bundeswehr and politicians.
Among them were Hessen's Prime Minister Volker Bouffier (CDU) and the general inspector of the Bundeswehr Volker Wieker.
Mourners laid down roses, loved ones stood arm in arm at the coffins.
In front of the church, Fritzlars and numerous soldiers pursued the ceremony on a canvas.
Defense Minister von der Leyen called the killed soldiers "highly decorated" and deployed.
The chief of staff helped set up the flight operation of the Tiger helicopter in Fritzlar and was one of the first six trained Tiger pilots in his regiment.
Volker Bauerachs, commander of the regiment, which includes the soldiers, also declared: "If this crew could not avert the crash, then no one would have been able to."
Doubts about the UN mission in Mali did not show Minister of the Leyen: the deployment was dangerous.
But he is also of high importance "for a country from which we are only separated by two states," she said.
After the funeral ceremony, coffins were brought out of the cathedral.
When and where they will be buried, the Bundeswehr did not specify.
Prince Henrik wants no grave next to his wife
The man of Danish Queen Margrethe (77), Prince Henrik (83), does not want to be buried next to his wife after his death.
That divided the Royal House on Thursday.
Traditionally, the Danish royal couple are attached to the Cathedral Church of Roskilde.
The sculptor Bjørn Nørgaard has already produced a sarcophagus for the two.
The queen agreed with her husband's decision, the notice said.
Where Prince Henrik will be buried is still unclear.
But he did not intend to be attached to his French home.
Prince Henrik had never made a secret that he was not happy with his title.
After ousting his wife Margrethe in 1972, he would have liked to become king.
He retired in 2016, also taking the title "prince grind."
Since Henrik did not get the title and function he wanted in Denmark, he does not see himself as equal to his wife - nor after death, explained Lene Balleby, the chief spokeswoman of the Danish Royal House.
Where the 83-year-old's final resting place will ultimately be is still unclear.
However, he did not intend to be attached to his French home, but to Denmark.
He likes the country for which he has worked for the last 50 years.
Born Henri de Laborde de Monpezat, son of a French nobleman, Margrethe met in London in 1965.
At the Thames, he worked in the French embassy.
While his later wife always received expressions of popular sympathy, Prince Henrik had a difficult standing with the Danes in his almost 50-year reign.
In an autobiography, Henrik said over the first few years in Denmark: "A few months after my arrival everything I did was criticised.
My Danish was fluctuating, I preferred wine rather than beer, silk stockings rather than knitting socks, Citroën rather than Volvo, tennis rather than football.
I could not hope for leniency even for the Gauloises I smoked instead of Virginia tobacco, and who had a reputation here for being the brand of socially critical intellectual.
I was different.
I seemed content with that position and not ashamed.
These were two mistakes!'
Prime Minister Weil wants speedy reelection
CDU and FDP ahead of possible majority in Lower Saxony
Dutch Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) is in favour of a swift reelection of the country's parliament after losing the red-green government majority, but he does not want to resign.
Because spoke in favour of dissolving Parliament on Friday.
Previously, the surprise departure of a Green MP from her rural parliament in Lower Saxony plunged the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) into a severe crisis.
Five months before the official election date, the Red-Green coalition in Hanover lost its narrow one-vote majority in parliament to the opposition from the CDU and the FDP.
The previous Greens MP Elke Twesten justified her move with the non-nominee for the 2018 election in her constituency in Rotenburg (Wümme).
"I see my political future in the CDU," she declared in Hanover on Friday.
CDU leader Björn Thümler wants to advise his group to include them.
Together, the CDU and the FDP would have 69 seats in Lower Saxony’s Landtag, the SPD, and the Greens.
So far, the relationship has been reversed.
The new Landtag will be elected regularly on 14 January next year.
Thumbler said that the red-green state government must now decide whether it can continue to govern without a majority in this situation.
Stephan Weil, however, considers it essential that the Landtag decides on its own dissolution as soon as possible.
The CDU group is expected to decide on its further action on Tuesday.
The state constitution also provides for the possibility that the country's day will strip the prime minister of confidence and choose a successor.
"Our constitution offers several options.
These opportunities need to be examined legally cleanly," Mr. Thümler said.
"One will calmly discuss all issues when they are legally soundly examined."
Thumbler called Twesten's move "yet something curious."
The politician himself stressed: "I am not a traitor.
I feel very good."
She described herself as a supporter of black and green.
The Greens called on the renegade MPs to return their county mandate.
"We assume, of course, that she returns with immediate effect her Landtagsmandat, which she has received through the Green Land List," state chairs Meta Janssen-Kucz and Stefan Körner told AFP.
Greens leader Anja Piel said: "We deeply regret Elke Twesten's decision."
She deliberately chose not to have a debate in the group.
"Also, given that there were no differences in content, we cannot understand this step."
SPD candidate Martin Schulz condemns the transfer of Dutch Green MEP Elke Twesten to the CDU as a betrayal.
"The behavior of former Green MPs in Lower Saxony is not only betrayal of the voters, but also betrayal of Red Green," the Federal Chief of the Social Democrats wrote on Facebook on Friday.
He supports the decision by Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) to quickly re-elect the Landtag.
Leaving Twestens costs Red Green in Lower Saxony the majority.
The politician puts "in her injured vanity and in her frustration her personal interests ahead of the good of the country," SPD Secretary-General Hubertus Heil criticized.
"It's a scandal that the CDU is involved in Lower Saxony this dirty intrigue game and is trying to make political capital out of it."
Dutch CDU leader Björn Thümler wants to recommend his MPs include Elke Twesten in the CDU.
The SPD's leader in the Bundestag, Thomas Oppermann, accused Twesten of using personal career thinking to distort the outcome of the 2013 general election.
The CDU was strongest before the SPD at the time, but SPD and Greens had a razor-thin majority of one vote in the country's parliament.
Agriculture Minister in interview - How do we protect ourselves from poisonous eggs, Mr Schmidt?
Germany is discussing contaminated eggs.
How could the scandal happen?
How can consumers protect themselves?
Agriculture Minister Christian Schmidt (CSU) speaks and responds in the interview with the editorial network Germany (RND).
Mr Schmidt, how can consumers protect themselves from poisoned eggs?
I can only encourage all consumers to look closely at the eggs in your fridge and check the stamp print.
On the consumer protection portal www.food Warning.de the federal states provide the latest information on the affected egg strains.
Affected eggs should be destroyed or returned.
Even if, according to everything we currently know, a health hazard is virtually impossible.
Does Aldi now undertake the best possible crisis response - all eggs out of the supply - because the central role of the enlightener is not really perceived by the Federal Minister for Agriculture?
Food monitoring is the responsibility of the Länder.
Nevertheless, my house moved up immediately and has been in close contact with the authorities of the countries ever since Germany became aware of its concerns.
All information and risk assessment is available to consumers.
Trade, like manufacturers, must ensure that the products sold are transportable and safe.
If eggs exceed the maximum residue limit of 0.005mg/kg, they cannot be transported.
However, untainted eggs can be sold and consumed.
This time, businesses are not to blame.
Are production plants and consumers in the same boat?
According to current knowledge, the production companies are not directly responsible.
Instead, they face economic damage because of alleged illegal practices by service companies.
As always, there are too few inspectors in the worst case scenario.
Is it just a lack of staff or of coherent competence?
It was the official controls that revealed the operation.
The truth, however, is that food fraud and criminal energy can never be ruled out 100%.
It is precisely for this reason that it is vital to ensure that such events are properly investigated and handed over to the public prosecutors in cases where crimes may be committed.
I have already made it clear on several occasions that I expect the authorities responsible to provide full information.
Is regular alarmism really necessary in the case of food scandals?
Consumers have the right to obtain only safe and transportable food.
When an unauthorised insecticide is used in the food industry, consumers are rightly outraged.
By armoured means, manufacturers, dealers and consumers are in a situation that is absolutely unnecessary.
In principle, it must be clear that the illegal use of Fipronil insecticide in the rearing of food-producing animals is unacceptable and must be stopped immediately.
This must be done consistently and with high pressure at all levels.
I expect all the competent authorities to investigate the matter promptly and fully.
How football's financial rules affect Neymar's move to Paris
The rules, which aim to prevent unfettered spending by European football clubs, will not disrupt Neymar's world record transfer from Spanish Barcelona to French Paris-Saint Germain.
Any consequences will still come for Paris Saint-Germain of UEFA, because the senior organisation overseeing the European game has the power to ban teams from accessing the prestigious Champions League tournament.
Financial fair play rules launched by UEFA in 2011 mean PSG will eventually have to prove that Neymar's transfer was funded without big losses.
Barcelona has paid 222 million euros ($262 million) to buy the Brazilian out of his contract, and Neymar will receive a salary that will be tens of millions of dollars a year.
Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymar's move to France.
PSG can certainly loosen the money to allow Neymar to underwrite and bring him to a galaxy of other stars, given the team's funding from Qatar's energy-rich ruling family.
Clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money on acquiring players, but must counter with legitimate sources of revenue that allow them to break-even point in their football-related business.
FFP was conceived by Michel Platini after being elected UEFA president in 2007.
The former French player believed that clubs that had incurred huge debts in their pursuit of success were effectively cheating and risking ruin if banks or owners withdrew their support.
In 2011, FFP shifted from focusing on club debt to monitoring its losses.
The change meant that the business model that Roman Abramovich originally used in Chelsea in 2003 - buying a club with potential and then investing heavily to improve the team and build a global brand - should become a tougher business.
During the current three-year FFP disposition period, which runs until 2018, clubs can accept losses of £30 million.
And, though Platini fell from the presidency in 2015, his UEFA successor, Aleksander Ceferin, remains committed to deterring excessive spending.
"Surely, FFP is not dead and we will certainly reinforce the rules for the future," Andrea Traverso, who is in charge of FFP at UEFA, told The Associated Press last week.
Although PSG paid Neymar's buyout clause in a lump sum, it can distribute the amount to the accounts over the duration of its contract.
Neymar has signed a five-year contract so the transfer fee for the next five years of €44.4 million can be declared in the annual accounts.
The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 has hit the PSG along with Abu Dhabi, which is owned by Manchester City, with the heaviest sanctions.
The PSG was fined EUR 60 million (then $82 million), which was later reduced to EUR 20 million - and it was ordered that the team members for the 2014/15 Champions League be limited to 21 players instead of the normal 25 players.
UEFA is looking at clubs that could try to overhaul their financial supervision by inflating their revenues through companies linked to the owners of a club.
While a Qatari company could sponsor PSG if the value of sponsorship were to exceed standard market rates, UEFA would not allow this to be considered a legitimate income.
That is exactly what happened in 2014, when UEFA decided that the value of the PSA's sponsorship was inflated by the Qatar Tourism Authority.
It was reported that part of PSG's payments to Neymar could come from the organising committee of World Cup 2022 in Qatar.
But PSG and Qatar in 2022 have denied that Neymar will become World Cup ambassadors and that such a maneuver could easily be found for UEFA regulators.
Previous sanctions against PSG mean UEFA will be even more attentive to any attempt to circumvent the rules.
UEFA had no preparatory talks with PSG over Neymar's transfer, people familiar with the situation said on Thursday.
They spoke on condition of anonymity with The Associated Press as they were not authorized to discuss the PSG situation.
The latest published reports show that PSG achieved a profit of more than EUR 10 million in 2015/16 with sales of EUR 542.4 million.
The accounts for the last fiscal year have yet to be released.
PSG expects Neymar's arrival to be a boon for sponsorship deals, merchandising and jersey sales.
The club anticipates that sales will rise by at least 30 per cent after signing.
The Spanish league was clearly irritated to see one of the best football players go and they tried to prevent Neymar's move by claiming that PSG would breach the FFP.
"It is a clear case of "financial doping" with the club and the state," La Liga president Javier Tebas told Spanish daily AS regarding Qatar's eventual ownership of PSG.
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, whose club is owned by an American sports tycoon, shares La Liga's reservations about a state funding a club.
"It's the consequence of ownership and that has completely changed the whole landscape of football over the last 15 years," Wenger said on Thursday.
"Once a country owns a club, anything is possible.
It will be very difficult to respect financial fair play because you can go different ways or have different interests when a country has such a big player to represent a country."
Swiss is looking for a new choggi supplier
In recent years, Chocolat Frey has produced in-flight chocolate for the Swiss.
Now the sweet cooperation is at a possible end: the airline is rewriting the order.
Swiss spokeswoman Meike Fuhlrott confirmed, at the request of the news agency sda, a corresponding report from the newspaper "Northwest Switzerland" of Friday.
According to current plans, the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018.
The products would be reviewed every two to three years and undergo quality control.
"With current supplier Chocolat Frey, we are very pleased," the spokeswoman said.
About 17 million small red-white packaged choggie plaques at 14 grams distributed per year to flight attendants before landing to passengers.
The Swiss did not want to provide information on the costs.
Industry insiders estimate the order volume according to "Northwest Switzerland" at 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the Migros subsidiary achieves annual sales of around one billion Swiss francs.
But more important is the advertising effect: For a chocolate manufacturer, it is a prestigious order.
The Swiss do not want to reveal the number of applicants for the new tender.
However, only Swiss manufacturers are eligible.
According to the newspaper report, Chocolat Frey intends to seek a renewal of the contract beyond the spring of 2018.
For the sda, the largest Swiss chocolate manufacturer could not be reached for an opinion.
Chocolate boards have been distributed by Swiss since 2006 on board their flights.
Before Swiss signed a contract with Migros's daughter, Barry Callebaut, in collaboration with Hug, had delivered the chocolate tablets.
The ability to place the logo led Swiss two and a half years ago to launch cooperation with Chocolat Frey.
The airline works with various Swiss chocolate producers.
On long-haul flights, First Class customers are spoiled with treats from Confiserie Sprüngli, Business Class nascent passengers Schoggi from Lindt and Economy Class Schoggi from Chocolat Frey.
Also on the short circuit, Swiss Schoggi is distributed by Chocolat Frey, both in business and economy class.
Athletics - Discuss Olympic champion Robert Harting reaches World Cup final
The three-time world champion is fighting for a medal on Saturday in the final.
His brother Christoph, Olympic champion of 2016, failed in the national championship draw and could only watch the discus competition from the grandstand.
Also with the first try, Polish titleholder Piotr Malachowski, who threw 65.13 yards, qualified for the final fight.
Nostalgia goes into niche in "Wet Hot American Summer" and "Comrade Detective"
This repetition of the story is simultaneously nostalgic because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80s, for the 90s-era horror era (when the presenters David Wain and Michael Showalter turned the sketch comedy "The State" for MTV), and for themselves - that is, for 2001, before their stars, like Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd, went to bigger things.
As a cultural artifact, it is equally a parody and an embodiment of our Facebook-capable era of permanent memories.
But as a franchise, it feels like time is running out.
"First Day of Camp" worked surprisingly well, not just because of its absurd humor (it contained an original story for a talking can of vegetables spoken by H. Jon Benjamin).
By getting to the heart of the gag - middle-aged actors play horny children who will grow up - they nonetheless managed to win back the last part of the joke.
"Ten Years Later," with its adults now playing adults, is less emotionally rooted and its parody goes more according to the casting principle, including a riff on the stalker films of the 90s like "The Hand That Rocks the Cradle" ("The Hand That scooped the cradle").
At one point, a character stumbles through an Apple Powerbook, some inline skates and "a number of other things from 1991."
Many of the central stories are the same.
The amiable Coop (Mr. Showalter), now novelist, has still not forgotten Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) still hasn't lost his virginity.
And there's another crazy-bad plot in which Ronald Reagan (including Mr. Showalter) is included, now backed by George H. W. Bush (a well-received impression of Michael Ian Black).
As always, the excursions are the best part of the franchise.
It's especially fun to see the ever-young Mr. Rudd, who shows Matt Dillon's sublippenbart of "Singles," whose former Big Man-on-Camp Andy now feels like an old knack.
It's the moments of random madness that could fuel this franchise like a kind of repetitive "Seven Up!" series until it reaches what I regard as its logical conclusion: "Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later," whose final scene will show the gang as they attend the movie premiere of "Wet Hot American Summer."
"Comrade Detective" on Amazon now recalls another kind of nostalgia: the revival of the Cold War by "The Americans," the film "Atomic Blonde" and even "GLOW" with its east-to-west ring-fight iconography.
The comedy created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka, with Rhys Thomas as director, claims to be a found TV series: a Romanian drama of the eighties with the two policemen as friends, two officers from Bucharest fighting for truth, atheism and the path of Marxism-Leninism.
The main characters - a hard-nosed Gregor and an idealistic Iosef - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Ulici, whose dialogues are synchronized by Channing Tatum (also an executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt in English.
It's a brilliant idea.
But it's not much more than an idea.
There are some nice gags to watch (the police spend time watching chess on TV, as Americans might do with football).
And the list of famous speakers - including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny - makes for a decent game of 'Find the voice out'.
But "Comrade Detective" is so committed to the veracity of a desperate propaganda drama - a murderer wearing a Reagan mask is included - that it often plays like a single one.
With six long episodes dragging on, and the comedy isn't fast or frequent enough.
"Comrade Detective," which has been edited to a lesser length, could better deliver its Agitprop satire as Gregor and Iosef repeatedly visit the American Embassy, whose lobby is always staffed by two thick men who devour a bunch of hamburgers.
The message for the imagined communist audience is that Western culture can make everything for a laughing stock.
The fictional Romanian creators were not wrong: we do it even with our own recent history and with theirs.
Blow to drug mafia in country
The police have succeeded in striking the Italian mafia in Baden-Württemberg.
On Wednesday morning, numerous objects were searched in the Schwarzwald-Baar-Kreis, Rottweil, Konstanz, Esslingen and Stuttgart, as the prosecutor's office told Konstanz on Friday.
15 defendants between the ages of 25 and 77 were arrested and have already issued arrest warrants against them.
Officials also secured larger quantities of marijuana and cocaine, firearms, and several hundred thousand euros.
Two people have been arrested in simultaneous raids in Italy.
German arrest warrants were issued against the two suspects Italian.
The two are therefore presumably extradited to Germany.
Italian and Bavarian investigators were involved in the action.
In all, more than 300 police were deployed.
Mafia members are accused of organised drug crime, serious violence, attempted murder and robbery and blackmail.
Since summer 2016, the public prosecutor's office has been investigating the organised drug trade in southern Germany.
There was a lively exchange between the prosecutors in Konstanz and Palermo and the investigators of Kripo Rottweil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily.
Therefore, the large operation was also accompanied by four officers from Palermo on Wednesday morning.
The investigation focused primarily on Italian nationals closely related to the Italian mafia.
An incident on May 27 in Hüfingen, in which several shots were fired into a restaurant early in the morning, is also likely to go to the gang's account.
Way laments big gaps in the Foreign Office register
'Data from citizens who should not appear': according to one report, the register of foreigners in Germany has significant shortcomings.
This leads to some serious errors in asylum procedures.
According to a media report, the Federal Government's Refugee Management Officer, Frank-Jürgen Weise, drew attention to large gaps in the Central Register of Refugees.
Deficiencies in the data registered there could lead to "some serious misjudgments" in asylum procedures and deportations, Weise warned in an analysis presented to the Süddeutsche Zeitung.
According to figures, the register covers ten million people with foreign nationality, including some 5.7 million from non-EU countries.
The data is thus managed by about 600 foreign authorities in Germany.
Because the data has not been adequately maintained, data quality has not been good in parts so far.
In individual cases, data from 1921 was found "from people who haven't been alive for a long time, or from citizens who have become German citizens and shouldn't actually appear in the register."
"Faulty data input can significantly slow return processes," the report said afterward.
In addition, the statistics on people who travel are EU citizens who do not have to leave.
However, such misallocations led "to a distorted debate about how to deal with expatriates," the analysis said.
Meanwhile, the federal government appears to have begun sending refugee families with under 16-year-old children back to Italy when they arrived from there.
This is based on an internal paper by the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF), reports the New Osnabrücker newspaper.
The paper therefore states that the BAMF is carrying out such procedures "in relation to families with children - with the exception of infants and infants - back to Italy since 1 June 2017."
This has been virtually impossible since late 2014, according to the newspaper, citing the difficult situation on the ground.
Under the Dublin Agreement, refugees from the EU state are the first to reach them.
If a migrant travels to another EU country, that state can return him to the country of entry.
To justify the move, the office now writes: "In between, the absorption capacity for families with underage children has increased significantly in Italy."
Italy has provided guarantees for the reception and accommodation of families.
Even the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) considers these commitments sufficient.
Other EU states would also send refugees back there under the Dublin agreement.
The left-wing group's domestic policy spokeswoman in the Bundestag, Ulla Jelpke, criticised this decision: "Families with children face human rights abuses because of the shortcomings in the Italian asylum system and a threat to child welfare."
Second best result achieved
A total of 220 litres of blood from people living in Oberreichbach was already available to other people.
At least of the twelve citizens who were awarded Friday.
Especially Jürgen Greule, who with his 100 donations now shares 50 litres of blood.
Traditionally, the municipality pays homage to the council's multiple willingness to donate blood.
"It's ingenious how our body is designed for this and we pay respect to donors who provide their blood to strangers, even to disinterested ones," said Mayor Karlheinz Kistner.
"A single blood donation helps several people," explained the district readiness manager of the German Red Cross (DRK), Holger Maisenbacher, because the canned ones are broken into their components.
Three people could benefit from a donation.
At the same time, Maisenbacher reported on the actions being carried out in Oberreichbach in the spring.
"This year we achieved the second-best result with 114 donors," said the DRC's circular readiness manager.
Obviously, the move to Theaterhaus a few years ago led to higher attendances.
Even before that, Thomas Bockstadt, Susanne Reichle, Sandra Schöck, Thomas Reichle and Meta Umbeer were among the multiple donors and received 50 donations each.
Herbert Mair and Dorothee Riexinger account for half as many, while Tamara Pfrommer, Petra Schleeh, Stefanie Stoll, and Uwe Vetter delivered 500 millilitres of their life juice ten times each.
The Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged after weak economic growth and slowing inflation dampened speculation of a rise.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain "sluggish" as it kept interest rates on family incomes in the midst of intensifying pressure.
Bank Monetary Committee (MPC) policymakers voted 6 to 2 to keep interest rates at 0.25%, with fewer members seeking a rise this month as weak economic growth weakened support for an increase.
In its quarterly Inflation Report, the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7% and for 2018 to 1.6%, warning that the pressure on household incomes would continue, with inflation expected to rise to close to 3% in the autumn.
But it signaled that interest-rate hikes would become necessary in the coming years to rein in the inflation fueled by Brexit, and it said that borrowing costs might have to rise more than expected in financial markets.
Members also voted to withdraw part of the mammoth stimulus package issued a year after Brexit.
It will call for time for the funding plan to provide cheaper funding to banks from next February, although it has been said that it now expects to raise £15 billion more under that system - with £115 billion.
Minutes after deciding on the interest rate, the Bank said: "In the MPC's central forecast, gross domestic product (GDP) remains weak in the short term as pressure on real household incomes continues to weigh on consumption."
On interest rates, she reiterated that "some tightening of monetary policy" would be required to cool inflation and a "somewhat larger" scale than markets expect.
Markets are currently forecasting the first rise in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020.
However, the bank stressed that increases would be "gradual" and "limited."
The Bank’s downwardly revised growth forecasts for this year and next are compared to the 1.9% and 1.7% forecast in May.
It has maintained its growth forecast to 1.8% in 2018.
The pound fell against the dollar and the euro after these news.
The pound fell 0.5% to $1.31, and fell 0.4% to €1.11.
The decision to make no change comes after the latest disappointing growth figures have dampened rising expectations of a rate hike and raised GDP to 0.3% in the second quarter from 0.2% in the previous three months.
Growth is expected to be 0.3% in the third quarter, although it will recover slightly after the bank closes at the end of the year.
The latest inflation report offered little enthusiasm for households hit by rising inflation and small salary increases as the tightening first gets worse before it gets better.
She added that monetary policy cannot "prevent the income slump" over the next few years, but she added that wages will "clearly" recover at the end of her three-year forecast.
The economy is also being strengthened by rising demand for UK goods, due to the weak pound, which will compensate for some of lower consumer spending.
The decision comes a year after cutting interest rates to 0.25% last August following the shocking EU vote that caused the pound to sink.
The Bank estimates that it will probably take four years to achieve full price and economic performance.
Before the Bank’s latest policy judgment on interest rates, the call for a rate hike had risen as inflation increased pressure on hard-pressed households, with three policymakers demanding a rise to 0.5% in July.
Inflation fell last month from 2.9% in June to 2.6%, although the Bank said that was expected and that it would pick up again in the coming months.
The bank said the excess relative to its target of 2% was "entirely" attributable to the weak pound.
Andrew Montlake, director at Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: "In light of the recent decline in swap rates, the mortgage market is likely to become more competitive again as lenders are clamoring for deals and want to end the year in a positive way.
The market looks particularly good for those where existing deals are phased out and the new mortgages are completed, and many with fee-free options and low rates are becoming more popular."
NHS (The National Health Service) to prescribe controversial HIV drug to 10,000 people
Patients will be given access to "transformational" HIV prevention treatment from September after a fight in the High Court against funding for the drug in the NHS.
NHS England announced that a pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) taken before intercourse, which can reduce the risk of infection in high-risk patients by around 86 per cent, is now delivered by the health service via an initial three-year study for an estimated 10,000 people.
He agreed to fund the trial after the Court of Appeal last year upheld a High Court ruling that the NHS had the power to pay for the PrEP despite claims that local authorities should fund it.
The move announced on Thursday was welcomed by NHS England chief executive Simon Stevens as an "important new intervention," while the National Aids Trust (NAT) described this as a "crucial moment."
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to allow people to register and more clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced across England in April 2018.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a consequence of HIV drugs taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
Studies have shown that PrEP significantly reduces HIV transmission in infectious diseases.
Taking PrEP before intercourse means that there are just enough drugs in a person’s body to prevent HIV infection.
Such drugs can be taken every day or so two hours before intercourse.
Those eligible for treatment include gay or bisexual men, transsexuals and people with HIV-positive partners who were not successfully treated.
In clinics, suitable participants are identified who agree with the study, including men, women, transgenders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by antiretroviral treatment.
People living in England and registered with a family doctor can also apply for possible participation at their local participating sex clinic.
The programme will raise £10 million and NHS England signed a contract to supply the drugs this week following an international competitive procurement.
The study is intended to assess the full potential of PrEP by collecting clinical evidence on how it is targeted, recorded and implemented on a large scale.
Stevens said: "This major new intervention should complement and overtake the far-reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV.
It is another milestone in more than three decades of progress in addressing one of humanity's greatest health challenges."
Deborah Gold, chief executive at NAT (National Aids Trust), said: "This is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV.
PrEP, if targeted at needy and vulnerable people, offers the opportunity to change the English HIV epidemic.
From September onwards, people with high HIV risk will have access to this NHS-funded attempt in England to develop a new instrument that will be genuinely individually controlled and not subject to negotiation with a partner, leading to the improvement of many, many lives.
We warmly welcome this announcement."
Ian Green, chief executive of the Terrence Higgins Trust, said: "The priority now must be to ensure that the study is carried out quickly across the country and that no one who has a risk of HIV is left behind.
Now that PrEP testing medicine has been obtained, we are well on the way to protecting more than 10,000 people infected with HIV."
Sharon Hodgson, shadow health secretary, said: "The start of the PrEP process is welcome and overdue after months of delays and slow implementation by the government.
The evidence shows how transformative this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transmission of this life-changing infection.
This trial brings us one step closer to understanding the benefits of PrEP.
Now it is important that this study be carried out as soon as possible across the country to protect people who are infected with HIV and that it will help us move a step closer to ending the spread of HIV in society."
Living the big life: Midstairs and clever designer tricks have turned this little Earls Court flat into a generous home
Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, narrowed down in 2014 from a large house in Knightsbridge to an Earls Court apartment.
It is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Joanne has not packed and sold her bags.
"Before that, I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger space," says Joanne.
"I was looking for something that was comparable to my price.
I was shown this flat in Earls Court and she had the same high ceilings.
I fell in love with them and made an offer that day."
Since the first visit, the 1,000 square foot apartment has been completely overhauled.
Originally a one-bedroom property with a nestled layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get to the bedroom - Joanne wanted to add storage space and a mezzanine to make the most of the generous ceiling height.
"I wanted high ceilings, big windows, a lot of light.
That was my requirement," she says.
To that end, she commissioned the architecture and design studio Duck & Shed by Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill to use the 12.5-foot high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Joanne.
The ceiling was not large enough to place two spaces above each other, so the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine where you could stand.
Erfan had to think creatively to solve the preset.
"The steelwork is pretty complicated," he explains.
"We had to arrange the rooms in such a way that they were stacked on top of each other without us having to bail.
It was not just a matter of building a simple platform, but of creating steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below."
That arrangement allowed Erfan to place two rooms in full over each other - with much extra drama.
For the mezzanine, a classic copper light window from Retrouvius looks down over the glamorous living area.
Mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program.
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theater, space and light.
At both ends is a short corridor mirrored to make it look longer.
In the kitchen, the mirror feels like a window into another room.
At the entrance mirrored units provide space for all of Joanne's tops and glasses.
By perceiving a more glamorous space, the beauty of the living room can shut the kitchen if it's not used.
Collapsed kitchens are nothing new.
The special thing about this is that it is a garage door.
"A little bit of engineering went in," Erfan explains of the steel-enhanced, furnished MDF door.
"It's counterweight, so when you push the door, it's slipping very easily."
Thanks to the clever use of space and storage space, Joanne was able to win an extra 16 m2, an extra bedroom and an improved layout.
"At the end of the day, you will sell the floor space - or as your property is valued," says Erfan.
"In a rudimentary form, a real estate agent will come in and make a calculation based on ground size."
Here they have managed to enlarge the floor space while using high-quality materials that give the space its luxury advantage.
"The materials are the things you touch and that therefore help create an emotional bond in a home," Erfan says.
"You don't fall in love with the electrical outlets in the walls.
These are important, but they do not play with your heart."
It shows that an apartment can turn through good design and increased square meters of something by default into something quite amazing.
In fact, like Joanne, you might decide not to leave these.
Brothers fight for a $500 million property empire
Two brothers are in a dispute for one of Victoria's biggest real estate empires worth more than $500 million four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty.
Former director of the 'Carlton Football Club' and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a villa in Toorak, just three doors away from his younger brother Paul, who brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and business assets should be shared.
Paul has wanted to retire from the family business since 2014, but a sharp clash over separation is taking place in the Supreme Court.
Along with their mother Anna, the brothers own 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars, accumulated since the family bought a business in Smith Street, Collingwood, in 1973.
There, the Westco family founded jeans and grew into a chain of 160 retail stores.
It was sold in 1999 for $85 million.
That money has been invested in real estate, and De Lutis' portfolio now includes offices in the city centre, the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento, the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller as well as shopping centres in the suburbs.
Under an agreement with her late father, Colin - described by Paul as the "main operator and the dominant personality" in the De Lutis family - owns about two-thirds of the company's assets and Paul about a third.
A court filing says this means Colin owns property worth $316 million and Paul worth $176 million.
The division of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul.
"The divisions proposed by Colin left him with what I thought were the best objects," he wrote in a first affidavit in 2015.
Last Friday, after several failed mediations, the Supreme Court's first hearing was held.
The brothers are also now fighting for control of existing business - something Colin, as Paul claims, has ruled him out.
Colin argues this is not true but accuses Paul of managing some possessions incompetently.
In an early affidavit filed by Colin, he says he hopes to settle the dispute.
"My Italian heritage prescribes that family is the main priority," he wrote.
Costs are rising in the case, with hundreds of sites with affidavits, e-mails and reports from companies including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and with leading lawyers, including Allan Myers, QC, and law firms held by both parties.
Mrs De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who ran milk bars and delicatessen shops from the late 1950s and bought a shop in Brunswick in the early 1970s.
They used security to buy the Collingwood property where Colin opened the family's first jeans shop.
Colin says he started Westco there when he was "in my last years of high school when Paul was still a small child (about 10 years old)."
Anna De Lutis says she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to pass on their property amicably to their sons.
"Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to land in court," she wrote.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis group of companies, with Colin claiming that Mark was paid $10 million and Luke $26 million when leaving the company.
Both Lukas and Mark are bitter, Paul says "about the terms of their financial separation."
Colin has been very restrained despite being a former AFL board member and following a 2015 biography of Eddie McGuire, the TV star's best friend.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers.
Only Colin replied by SMS to say "I really can't say much" because the case is in the courts.
"It is very, very sad that my brother Paul decided to sue me and move our family name through the courts," he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote in a letter to the court that he was trying to meet his brother's demands.
"Our father would not have wanted Paul and I to end up in our current dispute," he said, adding that he "still hoped for a solution."
On Friday, that hope seemed over.
"Our matter will be resolved by the courts in the near future," Colin wrote.
Trump’s new chief of staff plans to limit the president’s media abstinence.
Others tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.
If so, he will be the first.
Politico reports that the White House's new chief of staff plans to restrict the flow of information to President Trump - including news media reports - in hopes of keeping the chief on a more even course.
Here's a piece by reporter Josh Dawsey:
"When John F. Kelly, the White House’s new chief of staff, met with senior executives on his first day in office, he posed a major problem in President Donald Trump’s White House that he wanted to fix: poor information that gets into the president’s hands.
Kelly told staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in briefings - because the president would make better decisions if he received good information."
Kelly’s diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to tame Trump by monitoring his media diet.
President Trump's relationship with television stretches back decades - and now that he is in the White House, his television ads are still strong.
"When candidate Trump was upset because of unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he was getting fair coverage of posts that were to be persuaded," former campaign adviser Sam Nunberg told Politico in February.
Politico's Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that "the key to keeping Trump's Twitter habit under control, according to six former campaign officials, is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady praise."
Okay.
But the idea that Trump's Twitter habit was ever "under control" is ridiculous.
Perhaps these campaign officials know something we others don't know - that Trump's tweets would have contained even more spark without their interventions.
We'll probably never find out about the tweets that Trump didn't send.
If his staff have managed to keep trouble away from him several times, their efforts have paid off.
But no one has consistently prevented Trump from generating controversy.
Part of the problem is that people in a White House made up of competing parties keep trying to advance their own agenda by presenting Trump material that may promote their views of the world.
Politico - preoccupied with this story - reported in May on advisers' penchant for providing dubious information to the president for strategic reasons.
This was an example described by reporter Shane Goldmacher:
"Current and former Trump officials say that Trump can react like a volcano to negative press releases, especially those with damaging leaks, and that he's bent on finding out where these come from.
That's exactly what happened in late February, when someone maliciously gave the president a printed copy of an article by GotNews.com, the Web site of Internet provocateur Charles C. Johnson, who accused deputy chief Katie Walsh of being "the source behind a pile of leaks" at the White House.
Although Johnson has been permanently banned from Twitter for harassment or that he has not offered specific evidence or that he has made false allegations in the past and revoked them.
Trump read the article and began asking staff about Walsh."
Goldmacher added that then-Staff Reince Priebus and the White House secretary general, Rob Porter, "tried to implement a system to manage and document the paperwork that Trump receives."
How did that work out?
Kelly is trying to do the same three months later.
Perhaps he will prove to be a more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his advisers are still seeking influence.
These invariable factors make Kelly's mission very difficult.
Most wanted criminals get post from Europol
Since the address is unknown, the help of the population is requested and hoped.
Police across Europe are sending (virtual) postcards to dangerous criminals on the run this summer.
Since the addresses of the wanted serious criminals are naturally not known, references from the population are hoped for and requested.
Europol reported on Friday the action, which follows the "EU Most Wanted" advent calendar from winter.
Experience has shown that many refugees are hiding in holiday destinations, according to Europol.
There were 21 postcards for wanted criminals from 21 EU countries.
Since 2016 the website www.eumostwanted has been available, more than 2.5 million times this has been viewed.
36 of the online searches have been arrested so far, at least eleven of them due to notices after posting on the website.
Travelers negotiate a ditch and return to 'millionaire' row
Some of the West Midlands' most affluent landowners are back at war with some determined travellers who negotiated a ditch drawn by the community to reclaim a field in front of their mansions.
Travelers parked their 20 caravans in a field outside an affluent Strait of Solihull, dubbed the "Millionaire series."
They brought horses, babies and an army of vans after they were only thrown out in May, but without being deterred by a ditch excavated by the council to prevent their incursions.
The tactful group found a gap in defense equipment and pushed their vehicles through a section that remained unobstructed to find a way.
Angry residents have afflicted the Solihull Council, which said it was "useless to deal with the problem."
An anonymous resident said: "They moved there on Monday night after being sent by Bentley Heath, where they threw stones at the passers-by.
The Council must be shamefully forced into action because it was useless in dealing with the problem.
Travelers were there in May, moved on and are now back.
More came last night, probably more today."
She added: "The Council of Birmingham knows how to deal with this by holding long briefings to protect their parks.
I live on Streetsbrook Road and I am not happy to continue paying my local tax if the Council cannot even stop it."
One resident, who asked not to be named, said: "It's ridiculous we've just seen the last round of these travellers, only to be looted by another round.
The numbers have increased this time and you have even seen a horse in the park area."
A spokeswoman for the Council of Solihull said: "We are aware of an unauthorized camp on land beyond Streetsbrook Road and are working with Solihull's police and we are taking the necessary legal steps to ensure they move forward as soon as possible.
To support our collection of evidence, it is very important that as many residents as possible report anti-social or criminal behaviour to the police by calling 101.
This helps to create a picture of the situation where the court will have to examine when we present our case."
From Birkenhof, Waldhotel Luise
From the former Hotel Birkenhof becomes the Waldhotel Luise.
The house at the gates of Freudenstadt is currently being renovated and is due to reopen on 1 March next year.
That's good news for the city.
After all, with the closure of the Hotel Birkenhof by the former Ambiente Betriebsgesellschaft mbH on 13 April 2014, around 30 000 nights per year were lost at the time, as well as revenue from the tourist tax.
In the fall of 2014, in the face of dramatically increasing numbers of refugees who came to the county, the hotel building was offered to the county council as collection accommodation, causing controversy.
The city prevented the accommodation of asylum seekers by establishing a construction plan to secure the area as a hotel site.
The decision was not uncontroversial at the time in the local council.
But above all, Freudenstadt's Lord Mayor Julian Osswald defended the hotel location and already spoke of serious prospective buyers at the house at the time.
He should be right.
The Luisenhotels group with managing director Birgit Scherer, based in Bad Bergzabern, acquired the former Hotel Birkenhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to turn it back into a three-star plus category house called Waldhotel Luise.
The group has four houses with the Joytown property.
Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Herrenalb.
They are called Hotel Luise, Luisenpark, Parkhotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise.
At the former Hotel Birkenhof building rubble containers have been standing in front of the entrance for a long time, and when you enter the house it becomes clear how extensive renovation work is being done.
The floors have been torn out, blankets have been partially dismantled, old bathtubs removed from the rooms.
The entire hotel building is a single building.
There is still much to be done by March.
"It's actually a nice hotel," Thomas Scherer says in conversation with our newspaper.
Everything is to be renewed in the Black Forest style.
The rooms are equipped with large walk-in showers, the entrance area is redesigned, new windows are installed.
Everything should be "beautifully close to the people", as Thomas Scherer puts it.
"We want to do a piece of jewellery."
The hotel features a swimming pool, spa and meeting room.
You don't want to position yourself at the high level of hotels in Lauterbad, but already at an upscale downtown level, Scherer points out.
The Waldhotel Luise, with its 60 or so rooms, wants to be broad, Scherer explains further.
The hotel is suitable for individual holidaymakers, groups or businessmen.
Talking to OB Julian Osswald and tourism director Michael Krause he's already had, according to Scherer.
The city's ideas are similar to those of the hotel group.
"We are on the same line."
Asked about the level of investment, Thomas Scherer doesn't want to set out exactly.
Just under a million euros, he reckons.
The exteriors are also brought to the fore, which is already clear.
In an interior courtyard, a large terrace will be open from the restaurant, which is public.
Thomas Scherer is optimistic: "Freudenstadt is a good market."
Russia case: U.S. special investigator sets grand jury trial
In the Russia case involving U.S. President Donald Trump, special investigator Robert Mueller is alleged to have set up a so-called grand jury after a report.
The panel has begun work in recent weeks, the Wall Street Journal wrote, citing people familiar with the matter.
The newspaper viewed the move as a sign that Mueller has expanded and intensified his investigation.
CNN reported there were already preliminary charges by the panel in connection with a meeting between Trump's eldest son and a Russian lawyer.
US intelligence has long accused the Kremlin of deliberately meddling in the 2016 presidential campaign.
Mueller is investigating whether there was any collusion between Trump’s campaign and Moscow.
The focus of the investigation is to include several men who acted as an adviser to the Republican in the campaign.
According to reports, Mueller was increasingly scrutinizing Trump’s private and business environment.
The Washington Post wrote a few weeks ago that the special investigator had personally targeted Trump, investigating the allegation that the president may have obstructed the judiciary in the course of the affair.
Grand Jurys' main task is to examine present evidence in possible criminal cases and decide whether to file charges.
Grand juries are therefore also called indictment chambers.
Mostly, they are switched on when there are larger and more controversial cases.
The procedure is always done behind closed doors.
The panel can also be turned on by the prosecutor to pre-load people for interrogation under oath.
According to CNN, preliminary charges have already been issued revolving around the meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer.
People involved in the meeting were asked to make a statement, the report said.
They should also provide documents.
In addition to Trump Jr., Trump’s adviser and son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and then-electoral chief, Paul Manafort, were in the conversation.
Legal experts said Thursday night on U.S. television that the ad shows that Mueller is not intimidated in his work and that he wants to act quickly if necessary.
But it does not necessarily mean that the grand jury will be switched on at the end to decide whether to bring charges.
Nevertheless, the establishment of the panel is the beginning of a new phase in the investigation and a new source of concern for President Trump.
Amid the new revelations, the president used a speech in West Virginia on Thursday night to portray the Russia affair as a campaign by his political opponents.
"The Russia story is a total fabrication," Trump said.
The issue gives Democrats a way to "feel good because they have nothing else they can talk about."
His special adviser, Ty Cobb, said in an opinion that he knew nothing about setting up a grand jury.
But they also usually work in secret, he stressed.
The White House supports any measures that speed up the work of the special investigator in a "fair" way.
Former FBI chief James Comey has said three times that he is not investigating the president.
There is no reason to believe that this has changed, the statement continued.
Mueller, however, was only deployed after Trump fired Comey.
Because of that outburst, charges against Trump were made that he wanted to obstruct the judiciary.
Comey testified in June before a Senate committee that Trump asked him to stop investigating then-national security adviser Michael Flynn.
The president is under intense pressure because of the investigation.
According to US media, the White House collected material against the special investigator and his associates.
That sparked speculation about whether Trump would sack Mueller.
Unlike an independent special investigator of Congress, such as the Watergate affair involving the late President Richard Nixon, Mueller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired by the Justice Department at the president’s insistence.
However, several senators from both parties want to prevent such a move.
Two groups of Republican and Democratic senators on Thursday presented legislative proposals under which the special investigator could no longer be dismissed as easily.
Antarctica: Giant iceberg drifts in Antarctica
In West Antarctica, a gigantic iceberg has dissolved from the shelf ice of almost seven times the size of Berlin.
That was announced by the Bremen-based Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday.
The colossus, weighing more than one trillion tons and 5800 square kilometers, is now heading north, and will probably take two or three years to melt.
It is one of the largest ice giants, with 175 kilometres in length and a width of up to 50 kilometres, researchers have registered over the past three decades.
He is not a danger to people.
The extent to which climate change has played a role in breaking the iceberg is unclear, according to research.
Overall, however, there has been a series of unusual outbreaks of ice cream in the region for about 30 years, the US Research Centre for Snow and Ice (NSIDC) writes in a factual background.
According to many researchers, this could be related to global warming.
The now abandoned colossus has so far been part of the Larsen-C shellfish.
Shelf ice swims at sea and is fed by large glaciers.
It grows further and further into the sea and breaks down regularly.
The Larsen-C shellfish is located south of South America almost at the top of the Antarctic Peninsula.
North of this shelf, the balance of waxes and aborting was upset a few years ago.
A complete shelf ice fell there, writes AWI researcher Daniela Jansen.
There is a strong case to be made that the Larsen C shellfish is also in danger, because the front edge has never withdrawn as far as it is now.
In addition, the ice sheet is under tension and could fall apart if a piece breaks off at a key point.
Melting shelf ice and icebergs does not raise sea levels as they swim on water and displace ice as much water as it does after melting itself.
However, the loss of the shelf leads glaciers to flow directly into the sea and out much faster than before.
This may raise sea levels, but only to a small extent, writes the British Research Project on Antarctic Monitoring (Midas).
According to AWI data, the Larsen C shellfish is the fourth largest shelf ice in Antarctica with nearly 50,000 square kilometres.
At the transition from the mainland it is up to 700 metres thick, at the front edge of the free ocean about 200 metres.
It regularly breaks down there.
"While it is a natural event and we are not aware of any direct link to climate change, the ice sheet is now in a more vulnerable position," said Martin O'Leary of Swansea University in Britain.
"This is the furthest withdrawal since records began," he also confirmed.
Among scientists, it is controversial whether the Larsen C shellfish will now grow again or go back in the long term and possibly collapse, said his colleague Adrian Luckman, adding: "Our models say it will be less stable."
But it will take decades.
Although these researchers do not attribute the demolition of this gigantic iceberg to climate change, many of the Antarctic Peninsula’s ice buckets have collapsed in recent decades.
This long tin of Antarctica stretches toward South America.
According to data from the British Antarctic Survey, the ice surface of the Antarctic Peninsula has declined by 28 000 square kilometres since the 1950s.
The rise in temperature has contributed to the decline.
The Antarctic Peninsula has warmed by around three degrees over the past 50 years, making it one of the areas where temperature rises fastest.
CDU wants house price on staff
Because it is becoming increasingly difficult to fill vacancies, the CDU is demanding to leave the employers' association in order to become more attractive.
Just before the summer recess, the County Council has won 41 new posts in administration.
More than 1100 employees and officials work for the district administration in Mettmann.
Now 17 trainees have completed their first working day.
The training places at the circle are obviously very much in demand.
Approximately 620 applications have been received for this year's courses.
However, the circle still lacks staff to cope with the increased demands and tasks.
At present, there are still 50 unfilled positions at Mettmann County.
They include doctors, engineers and general administration forces.
Together with the FDP and the UWG, the CDU now wants to take the initiative to address the shortage of skilled workers in administration.
According to the wish of the parties, the administration is to develop "a concept for recruitment and personnel development".
The aim is not only to meet short-term needs for skilled workers, but to counteract the shortage of applicants in the future, it says.
The overall concept should be internally and externally oriented, show concrete measures for cross-country beginners and include a training offensive, demand CDU, FDP and UWG.
That sounds like a good approach.
Because the circle is dealing with staffing problems that were previously unknown.
Other cities advertise good officials and employees and offer more attractive terms.
The talk is of a veritable "competition of public employers."
In addition, a high number of staff who are sick or old are leaving the service.
It is therefore high time for action so that more jobs are not left unfilled.
But Klaus-Dieter Völker, leader of the CDU, goes beyond the joint motion with his party.
He caused a nasty surprise recently in the district court, when he publicly questioned the staff costs cap and stunned the other parties.
Peoples want all options reviewed to allow a leave of absence from the municipal employers' association.
"If we don't come to a satisfactory solution here in the short term, the district administration should seek a house tariff with the unions - perhaps in cooperation with the county's cities," according to people.
In doing so, the CDU is trying to pay employees and officials better than the public service collective bargaining system actually provides for.
Salaries are currently strictly prescribed, increases or more money are available only if you move to a higher level, geared towards professional years.
But the county's responsibilities have grown more and more in recent years.
Only a few weeks ago, new rooms had to be set up in which employees took care of the provisions of the new prostitutes law.
Not least because of the increasing number of asylum seekers, Councilman Thomas Hendele and County Director Martin Richter have a problem: They have too few staff.
Italy tightens tone on NGO migrant rescue boats
Italy has warned NGOs that use lifeboats for migrants in the Mediterranean that they will not be allowed to continue doing so unless they comply with new rules governing their operations.
"If NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct, it is difficult to see how they can continue working," Interior Minister Marco Minniti said in an interview with the Turin daily La Stampa.
Minnitis' warning came a day after Italian authorities seized a boat from the German aid organisation 'Youth Savet' because its team had effectively worked with traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration.
The aid organisation, which has only been in operation for a year, declined to comment on detailed allegations made by Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.
"For us, saving human life is and remains our top priority, so we are very sorry that at the moment we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone," the organization said in an opinion piece on social media.
"We can only judge all the allegations currently being made after we have gathered all the information and can judge the situation."
Italian authorities had been monitoring the boat from 'Youth Rescue', the Iuventa, since October.
It is believed that his crew is taking hoseboat migrants on board, which are delivered to them directly by traffickers, and that the smugglers can depart so that the ships can be used again.
At least one such meeting allegedly took place just 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast, according to the prosecutor's file, the contents of which were published by Italian media.
The crew is suspected of flouting the authority of the Italian coastguard to monitor rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not for any other motives.
Under the code of conduct, boats like the Iuventa must in particular have an Italian police officer on board to monitor their activities.
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have so far agreed to abide by the code: Save the Children, MOAS from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain.
The latter said Thursday that the new rules would be seen as unnecessary but acceptable as they would not involve "essential changes or disabilities" to their bailouts.
Among those who refuse to sign up is the Nobel Prize-winning organization Doctors Without Borders (MSF).
Minniti meanwhile said that the number of migrants arriving in Italy after the rescue efforts had plummeted in recent weeks, indicating that efforts to strengthen the Libyan coast guard and cooperate with local mayors have borne fruit.
"In the last few days we have started to see light at the end of the tunnel," the minister said.
He announced plans for further talks with Libyan mayors this month on economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving these countries in hopes of reaching Europe.
Rises and Trials
Nine Weilermer Biker, the "Berlin outpost" and two guest drivers met in Wachenheim in the northern Palatinate to enjoy four days of trials and sights.
Three friendly guides were available for this purpose.
Accommodation in the Wachenheim Valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours.
The castle and wine festival of Wachenheim was a welcome extra.
The first tour led at hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Michael Chapel above Deidesheim.
The viewpoints were followed, partly on towers, from which one could see far beyond the peat forest and the upstream plains.
In between, there were always longer climbs for which long trials rewarded.
The second day went to Bad Dürkheim to Saline and the Volksfest Wurstmarkt.
Again, vantage point at vantage point, combined with "flowy" trials and moderate climbs.
On the last two days many vertical meters were called again.
Caves, rocks, towers, castles, ruins and refuges brought welcome breaks.
In Bad Dürkheim the bikers breathed in the open-air inhalation saltwater.
Neustadt was also steered.
After 173 kilometers and nearly 4500 meters of altitude, the group had met the peacock forest from its best side - sporting and cultural.
Console rather than grass - Bundesliga gears up for e-sports
Are sports stars sitting in front of computer consoles in the future rather than struggling in the wind and weather over stadium turf?
Fact is: E-sport has long become a serious industry, a lucrative business - big stars, millions of fans and huge tournaments with high scores included.
This has also been recognised by the first Bundesliga clubs to become increasingly involved in this area.
The beginning of 2015 was VfL Wolfsburg, later followed by FC Schalke 04 and, most recently, VfB Stuttgart, which founded an e-sports department in mid-July and contracted two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17.
"We hope to inspire completely new young target groups for the VfB," says Executive Director Jochen Röttgermann.
He is sure "that a number of clubs are still rising on this train."
Next weekend FIFA is organising the first Interactive Club World Cup in London.
In addition to Schalke and Wolfsburg, Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain or PSV Eindhoven have qualified.
Robin Dutt also sees great potential in e-sports.
The former coach of Bayer Leverkusen and Werder Bremen is now advising an agency for virtual football players.
"Real football in particular has to deal with the 14 to 30-year-olds that young people are still going to the stadium in the future," the 52-year-old says.
And: The clubs tried to conquer all sorts of markets, especially the Asian ones.
With prominent e-sportsmen under contract, you could be present online much more often than just sending the Bundesliga team to Asia once a year.
What exactly is it about?
In e-sports, computer games such as "League Of Legends", "Dota 2", "Counterstrike" or football simulation FIFA are contested at the level of competition.
As in normal sports, leagues have long established themselves in which the professionals compete.
And at the 2022 Asian Games, e-sport is already part of the official program.
But is it a proper sport at all?
For many, the notion is surely getting used to.
Ingo Froevil, too, has long been grappling with the question.
For the professor at the Deutsche Sporthochschule in Cologne, e-Sport is a sport because it is competent and shows many biological and physical reactions that can also be found in classical sport - for example, increased heart rates, stress reactions, hormonal changes.
It also requires cognitive skills, a technical and tactical understanding, and a rapid response capability.
Professional gamers should not only train at the console but also their bodies and pay attention to nutrition.
"The fit player is a good player."
Frozen, though, also sees problems: "Doping is becoming more of an issue."
Controls were difficult to implement in online games, and the scene lacked the structures of classical sport.
On the positive side, the scientist highlights the high inclusive effect of e-sports.
The players are travelling internationally, which is like a big global family, as there are no intercultural barriers.
A study by Deloitte and the Federal Association of Interactive Entertainment Software (BIU) predicts rapid growth in e-sports.
In 2016, EUR 50 million was implemented in Germany, mainly through advertising, sponsorship and major tournaments.
In three years, sales are expected to be 130 million.
That is little against the nearly $2.4 billion of the Football League.
However, eSport is "no longer far removed from the other established sports such as handball, basketball or ice hockey," the Deloitte advisers write.
Internationally, many countries are already ahead.
Big markets are Asia and the US, where ex-basketball player Shaquille O`Neal and baseball star Alex Rodriguez join the US team NRG eSports.
Hollywood actor Ashton Kutcher is investing in eSport betting provider Unikrn.
Something is happening in Europe too.
In a Norwegian school, e-sports have been introduced as a teaching subject, Froefel says.
In the Netherlands and France, according to Dutt, the Football First League clubs are now obliged to set up an e-sports department.
"In European comparison, Germany is lagging behind," explains VfB CEO Röttgermann.
Falling into nostalgia only, and closing the old days, is no longer enough.
The aim is to preserve the tradition of the association, but also to align the company with the modern market.
"We live in a digitized world," says Dutt.
"You cannot hold on to the fact that only football remains as it always was."
Gift eggs ade - The egg alternatives to cooking and baking
The toxic egg scandal has now affected almost all federal states.
Aldi Süd and Aldi Nord have responded and have taken all eggs out of sale across Germany.
Only eggs that have been shown to contain no fipronil are to be added to the shelves.
Michelle Carter sentenced for texts urging Conrad Roy to commit suicide
A woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years for encouraging her boyfriend to suicide by texts and calls.
Michelle Carter, now 20, will spend 15 months of her sentence behind bars and five years have been suspended.
Carter was convicted in June of negligent homicide of Conrad Roy, who took life on July 13, 2014.
Roy's father said at the hearing on Thursday: "My family is inconsolable.
My son was my best friend.'
Carter was allowed to remain free until appeal.
She had faced a maximum sentence of 20 years, but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy were suffering from mental illness.
Dressed in red trousers and a cream-colored blouse, Carter stood there with tears in her eyes, with folded hands and downward-facing eyes when she was convicted.
"Her actions killed Conrad Roy," the prosecutor told the court.
"She ended his life to make her own better.
She didn't take responsibility," she said.
"She has shown no remorse."
But Carter's attorney said it was a "terrible circumstance she completely regrets."
However, Judge Lawrence Moniz said he did not find that her "age or maturity or even her mental illness have a significant impact on her actions."
A prosecutor read a statement from Roy's mother, Lynn Roy, saying that "there is no day when I do not mourn the loss of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and as I walk around with everything... I try to be there for his sisters, despite all my pains we will carry with us for eternity," it reads.
Roy's sister, Camdyn Roy, said she was "tracked" by the realisation that she would never attend her brother's wedding or be an aunt for his children.
"Not having this only person with whom I have been together since my birth every day is a pain I will always keep with me for the rest of my life," she said.
The case appears to set a legal precedent, as there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to ask another to commit suicide.
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead of carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle in 2014.
The case drew national attention after Carter's text messages revealed that she had encouraged him to end his life.
"Hang on, jump off a building, stabbed yourself, I don't know there are many ways," she said in several messages she had sent in the two weeks before his death while he was on holiday with his family.
In the moments before his suicide, she wrote, "You have to do it, Conrad" and "All you have to do is turn on the generator and you'll be free and happy."
Judge Moniz said Carter sought attention by Roy's death and ordered that she benefit from the case through any press.
The case has divided legal opinion.
Among the few who defended Carter was Amanda Knox, who was convicted of murdering her British co-worker in Italy in 2007 before being acquitted two years ago.
Ms Knox, 30 years old, published a comment in the Los Angeles Times: "Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help, not prison."
Joshua Kimmich: Learning from FC Bayern's new mini-Lahm
The fact that Joshua Kimmich was allowed to run as captain at the Audi Cup is no accident.
FC Bayern dare to give the Confed Cup winner a great season - extra motivation does not harm.
Something was different in his place in the cabin, which saw Joshua Kimme immediately, even if the extra garment was very, very small.
But as far and wide on the second day of the Audi Cup, of course, there was no Philipp Lahm, nor Manuel Neuer, he made up his arm for the binding given to him.
"The coach didn't announce it," the Confederations Cup winner told reporters afterwards, after his first assignment as Bayern captain.
Well, the stand could have been better than the 0:2 against the SSC Naples.
But the sign of the coach could also suggest Kimme.
It was not the eight-year-old Arturo Vidal who was chosen as the game leader in the C-Elf, made up of young players, debutants and professionals who have just come on holiday, but he.
Sugar is best distributed to those whom you trust and want to keep you happy.
So anyone who has been chosen to take on the heritage of Lahm can only use a little extra motivation.
Kimme acknowledged: "That's what you want as a player: Taking responsibility."
On Wednesday, the 22-year-old flung as a mini-launch across the field.
Right back, that's now his position, the white tie on the arm did its rest.
And in this starting formation Kimme looked like the one who can best take the helm.
He gave instructions, tried to steer the unmarked squad.
He had the view for the whole while many others were self-absorbed.
Vidal by overplaying his lack of fitness (did hardly work); Renato Sanches by starting on devil's way out to the performances of the Asian tour (does not work out very well); and Sebastian Rudy and Niklas Süle by not being negative in their first appearance in the Bayern jersey.
That worked very well.
Süle ran alongside Kimmich, Rudy before the defense, both acting sovereign.
The Naples storm, which was occupied by the name of the name, was often difficult, and Süle also tried to make a success of the game.
His colleague Rudy admitted that the result was "not as we hoped."
But he also showed a decent performance on the debut.
Game shift, pace change: "For this style, I was brought up as well."
How unusual this Bayern world is still for the new entrants, one saw after the match.
Rudy, for example, did not give one or two in the catacombs, but determined six or seven interviews.
Kimme passed away after a few crisp statements in the back of his new players.
There he heard an interesting phrase from Süle: "What's going on here I've already noticed.
At Bayern you just have to win every game."
After all, he no longer has to teach the new.
Alaba motivates ÖFB ladies
David Alaba believes in the success of our ÖFB ladies
Austria's most famous footballer reported on Twitter just before the game and wished the ÖFB ladies well.
After all, the Bavarian legionaire is almost a club colleague of ÖFB captain Schnaderbeck and is fiddling with our ladys.
The tweet from the Austrian Footballer of the Year and Champions League winner should be a special motivational splash.
Our ladies might well need the famous Bavarian-Dusel.
Business pleased with rhubarb peasant minister: Economy praises Wis. pace
It was often irreconcilable, the relationship between the country and the regional economy, when Eveline Lemke (Green) was still Minister for Economic Affairs of Rhineland-Palatinate.
This is evident after more than a year in which the new economy minister, Volker Wissing (FDP), is in office.
Chambers and businesses from the region talk on T V's request of a change in economic policy - while rebuking the old minister.
Frank Natus, chairman of the Association of Trier Enterprises (VTU), says: "Wissing picks up the wishes of the economy that Lemke has all blocked."
Natus sees the biggest U-turn in infrastructure policy: the gap in Highway 1 between Kelberg and Adenau is now at the top of the country's priority list.
Later this year, the ministry is hoping for a planning process, by 2021, to stand the construction right.
A role in the country's plans is also played by the West bypass Trier, which is in the pressing need of the federal transportation plan.
The aim is to bring the route into operation in December 2020, says ministry spokeswoman Cornelia Holtmann.
Natus sees it as a signpost to prop up regional but internationally competing companies.
The Chamber of Commerce and Industry (IHK) Trier, as Wissing suggested, is seeking a Rhineland-Palatinate label for wine in order to increase sales in supermarkets and halt the trend of German wine exports, which have been falling for ten years.
In addition, Wissing has an open ear for people who want to start their own company, praising the IHK.
The Trier Chamber of Commerce sees the new Master bonus as an additional incentive for young apprentices, says Managing Director Matthias Schwalbach.
A premium of 1000 Euros is envisaged for the passed master examination and 2500 Euros if graduates become self-employed within ten years of master training.
The homework list for the country remains long, though.
The planned road construction is fast creating facts, while the country lacks the necessary personnel, says Jan Glockauer, chief executive of IHK Trier.
Of 56 new engineers Wissing plans to hire at the state-run company Mobility, only 29 have been filled.
IHK is calling for more contracts to be awarded to external offices.
CDU Group Vice-President Christian Baldauf refers to calculations by the Court of Auditors that the country invests more than EUR 20 million less in the maintenance of national roads in 2017 and 2018 than proposed.
Frank Natus also expects a country plan to address the shortage of skilled workers in the region.
It is also disappointing that broadband has been expanded in the country to date.
In 2016, regional companies ranked network supply in an IHK survey only by grade 3.4.
They complained about stalled Internet connections and breakdowns.
In contrast, ex-Economy Minister Eveline Lemke is out of politics at the moment and is still on the board of the wind power company Pro Wind.
The Green Group left Lemke in April to become president of a private university in Karlsruhe - where, after four months of disagreement, she was already clearing the field.
Audi to change 850,000 diesel vehicles - automakers face backlash
A day before Audi's announcement, BMW said it would offer to upgrade the software in more than 350,000 vehicles.
The BMW chairman said the company believed that "there are smarter options than driving restrictions," referring to European cities - including Munich, where BMW is based - to ban or restrict diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions.
None of the companies described the ventures as a recall.
European automakers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with rules on carbon dioxide emissions.
But the nitrogen oxides that diesel engines emit are considered carcinogens and can cause asthma.
The cost to car manufacturers of installing equipment to neutralise the exhaust gases emitted by diesel vehicles is also increasing, making it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also charged with molesting powerful car companies and ignoring signs of the problem.
The companies are trying to avoid Volkswagen's mistakes, which included the use of so-called shut-off devices that were able to regulate emissions to comply with regulations when a car was tested but driving back in normal driving conditions.
Several Volkswagen employees have been charged in the United States, while others are being investigated on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former head of thermodynamics in Audi's engine development was arrested in Germany.
The former manager, Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio, is Italian and is therefore not protected from extradition and could be brought to justice in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi was involved in German criminal investigations at Volkswagen after authorities accused Audi of installing a system to circumvent emissions regulations in Europe, and a request focused on the United States was expanded.
Audi's involvement in the investigation could weigh heavily on Volkswagen: The luxury car maker disproportionately contributes to Volkswagen's profits.
That message has the float on Saturday at Isar
The city wants to protect the Isar.
In order for Isar visitors to join us, tomorrow Saturday a raft will sail through Munich, which has a special message.
If you go to the Isar again on Saturday, you will see a big raft there between Flaucher and Reichenbachbrücke.
And that's not a common raft, with Isar tourists.
Instead the building department wants to clarify.
On the raft you can see a large information banner.
It shows a pile of rubbish.
The prelude to a publicity campaign to appeal to Isar visitors.
The motto "Wahre Liebe ist ..." is to sharpen the understanding of the Isar as a protected wild river.
Last summer the raft sailed over the Isar and again this year there are further actions and measures to achieve considerate and environmentally conscious behaviour.
Mordillos Knollennasen and the Laugh Against the suffering
Mordillo was at times one of the most-published cartoon drawers, the tubers of his characters are his trademark.
Even at 85, the Argentine is still drawing and working on a film.
His message: Laugh, "because there's too much suffering in the world."
Guillermo Mordillo was born on August 4, 1932, as the son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires.
In his first years as an artist, he struck out, among other things, as a drawer for greeting cards - which frustrated him.
"The happiest day in my professional life was the day when lost in my job," he once said.
After stops in Lima, New York and Paris, he made a breakthrough at the end of the 60s: with the release of his cartoons in "Paris Match" and then also in "Stern" and other leading magazines around the world.
Even in China, Mordillo found many fans.
The artist has always been inspired by cities.
Large, run-down Mordillo figures tucked into drawings with the Slate Tower of Pisa, Big Ben in London and Red Square in Moscow.
According to his own figures, he is still sitting at the drawing table today, working almost ten hours a day.
Through calendars, jigsaws, books for young and old, T-shirts, plasters and watches, his dark figures continue to be widely distributed around the world.
For six years he has also worked on a cartoon and a TV series with his characters.
The main person in the movie "Crazy Island" is a giraffe - murderillos' most popular animal in its drawings - who has a thousand-five-tonguer as an opponent.
For the first time, his characters speak in the 3D film, which is due to be released on the cinema screen in 2019.
"I don't know exactly what they will say, it's strange for me," Mordillo says.
The script is not written by him.
That's why he relies more on the TV series, which, like its original drawings, is wordlessly produced.
Lavender from Provence threatened by climate change
He has become a symbol of Provence in southern France, but there is a warning that he is under threat from climate change.
The lavender is in decline because of conditions reminiscent of drought and disease-carrying insects, causing major headaches for scientists and farmers trying to find solutions.
Eric Chaisse, expert at the agricultural research institute CRIEPPAM in Provence, said: "The lavender in Provence is effectively at risk because the plant has been exposed in recent years to the effects of climate change, which has brought much less rain in the spring and much more in the autumn.
This has an impact on the life span of lavender.
There is also a small cicadas, a microbacterium that transmits dwarf cicadas, and in very dry weather there are very many of them."
And there is a lot at stake.
Lavender oil attracts not only holidaymakers, but also perfume and cosmetics.
Eric Chaisse said: "Instead of having very long plant ears with a large number of flowers, we have smaller, underdeveloped and either missing or weakened.
So we have fewer parts with essential oil."
Solutions being considered include better water distribution and slowing evaporation from the soil, but also spraying the plants with a protective mix of clay and water and developing varieties that are more resilient to drought.
The town of Geisa in the Thuringian Rhön celebrates its 1200th anniversary this year.

The murder of a journalist highlights the growing threat in Mexico
The staff of the weekly Riodoce usually meet Wednesday to review their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the state of Sinaloa by organised crime, corrupt officials and ceaseless drug wars.
But that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security.
They were told it was important to change their routines.
Two senior journalists are discussing what feels safer: They are supposed to take their children to the office, which in 2009 was the target of an attack with grenades, or leave them at home.
Security experts have written three words on a plaque at the front of the room: Opponents, neutrals, allies.
They ask reporters to propose names for each column - no proof is needed, perceptions and abdominal feelings are enough.
There are drug smugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists suspected of being on the government's payroll or cartels, a catalogue of criminals who make Mexico's chaos dangerous.
There is no respite from the violence, and as bodies pile up across the country, more and more journalists are present: at least 25 since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012, 589 are under federal protection after attacks and threats, and so far this year there have been at least seven deaths in seven states.
Among the latter is its editor and its inspirator of Riodoce, the co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.
"The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs.
His absence is deeply felt, though his presence is everywhere -- a large photo of Valdez showing his middle finger with the word "Justice" hanging on the facade of the Riodoce building -- two reporters in the Thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wearing T-shirts showing his smiling face with glasses or his typical Panama hat.
The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and reporters discuss their shared themes, trauma, their nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.
Although a special federal prosecutor was established in 2010 to deal with the cases of journalists, according to the Committee on the Protection of Journalists, only two criminal proceedings have been initiated.
As with most of the thousands of murders associated with drug trafficking and organised crime each year, the killers of journalists are rarely brought to justice.
At Riodoce, they still insist on treating Sinaloa's violence, although they are inconsolable and although the terrain is now even more treasonous.
Without information about the killers, without justice, the meeting to discuss security has little benefit, Ibarra says.
"It's very stupid to waste my time in this workshop," he says.
"As long as we don't know why, we distrust everyone."
On the morning of 15 May Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the provincial capital of Culiacan.
He managed only to drive a few blocks wide before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men, he was forced out of his car and shot 12 times at him, presumably because of the newspaper's name - which translates as "Twelve River."
The shooter drove away in his car and damaged it nearby.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He left behind a wife and two adult children.
Rumors tend to fly freely around Culiacan.
But on Valdez, there is virtually nothing but silence.
Since Guzman's arrest last year and extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa has become one of the country's bloodiest battlefields as rival factions here struggle to fill the vacuum.
It doesn't matter that in Sinaloa every day someone or several people are shot in the street, or that the cemetery is full of decorated, two-story mausoleums for drug kings that are larger than many homes for the living.
Forget for a minute that there is a state of "calm" when only one cartel has control of the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trade routes to the United States.
Still, and despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, broke with the blame for failing to protect his friend.
He believes two misunderstandings contributed to the murder.
First, in February, there was the release of an interview with Damaso Lopez, a leader of one of the rival cartel factions at war with Guzman's sons.
This publication may have angered the sons, suspected gang members bought every copy of the issue once it was delivered to newspaper kiosks.
The second mistake was not to force Valdez to leave the country for his own safety after seizing another newspaper that had published the same story.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is seen as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists.
He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed he would always be there.
He was an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003 when he teamed up with five colleagues to set up Riodoce and sold $50 stakes.
In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to engage in journalism without encountering the narcotics problem," Bojorquez said.
Over time, the newspaper earned a reputation for bold and honest reporting, and sales and advertising increased.
Reporters loved to publish hard-hitting investigations without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else dared to treat.
Eight years after Riodoce was founded, she received the prestigious "Maria-Moors-Cabot" award for her reporting in Latin America.
That same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award from the Committee to Protect Journalists for his courage in prosecuting Mexico's drug history, wherever it led.
He admitted voluntarily that he was afraid.
"I want to continue living," he said at the time of the CPJ award.
Drug trafficking in Sinaloa "is a way of life," he said last October in an interview with Rompeviento-TV.
"You have to do the job that suits you as a journalist - either that or you play the fool.
I would not like to be asked: 'What did you do in the face of so many deaths ... why did you not say what was going on?'
The Riodoce team misses Valdez, the fun bird who could curse like a dock worker, the friend who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.
They trusted on his routine.
He would always wear his hat.
He would always go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, and always sit there at the same table.
Now they ask: Was his love of routine his demeanour?
His death has also forced them to question their own assumptions about how best to do their job and stay alive.
"You don't like it when you're dealing with their women, their children, their clean shops, their secret runways" to move drugs.
"These things were not allowed," Bojorquez said.
The result, even in the best of times, is a high degree of self-censorship and self-preservation.
Trust his own instincts.
If it smells wrong, stay away from it.
The trouble is, said the editor of Riodoce Andres Villarreal, that "a sense that can be deceived ... and then things have happened with Javier."
The old rules, he and others say, no longer apply in Sinaloa - just as they do in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states where a toxic mix of lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt government officials are at home.
The landscape is constantly changing.
In the room where Riodoce's staff met for security training, no cell phones were suddenly allowed, and days before it was announced that spyware sold exclusively to governments was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.
Outside, two policemen sought shelter from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shadow of a tree.
They were ordered by the state government to protect Riodoce's offices in a four-storey building in a mid-range district of Culiacan.
Half in jest, some of the reporters wondered if those officers were among the 50 percent of police officers the governor himself called untrustworthy.
It's been months since the reporters went to the mountain resort where drug gangs are de facto under control.
For this week's edition, Riodoce has relied on three main stories.
There was the murder of the brother of former well-known boxer Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.
They also had an exposé on state spending focused on the governor's hometown.
And there was a group that carried out a kidnapping in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the prosecutor's office.
There was no official word on who was kidnapped or how it happened, so caution was needed when it became time to write what everyone in the city knows: That the restaurant is a favorite place of drug traffickers and authorities.
One reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician belonging to the ruling Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), which dominated all political levels almost the entire century.
Several PRI governors have recently been accused of high-profile cases of corruption.
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents at this venue, including one in which a son of "El Chapo" Guzman escaped a military raid.
Just a few months earlier, readers would have viewed Valdez's column as the most well-informed source on the kidnapping.
"We used to know what happened," said Villarreal, 46, nicknamed "El Flaco" because of his slim body stature.
"Now all channels of communication with our sources have broken down."
Valdez's office was turned into a storage room for signs and stickers protesting the killings of journalists because the staff became something they themselves never expected: Activists on behalf of the press.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez grabbed a few signs and went to a demonstration the next morning because of another journalist to the prosecutor's office.
Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez was killed, in the western state of Michoacan.
A burned body has been discovered and officials say based on DNA tests that it is his.
Across the country, journalists have become louder by writing "SOS Press" on sidewalks and buildings in organized protests.
On that day, the director Bojorquez is away in Washington and is trying to gather international support for the justice system in the Valdez case.
At a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa the day after Valdez's assassination, Ramirez accused authorities of spying on journalists and killing them because they were telling the truth.
She has since asked that she be reclassified by the government because she is concerned that her anger has violated her objectivity.
Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were " Surrounded" by organized crime, government officials involved in it and an indifferent society.
In his last book, "Narco Journalism," he wrote that reporters are not only killed by drug gangs, but also on orders from politicians and security forces, who were under a blanket with organized crime.
Media watchdog group Articulo 19 last year assigned more than half of the attacks on journalists to police and officials.
"In Mexico you die because they want you to keep your mouth shut," Ramirez said.
Obviously, the killings have a chilling effect.
No one forgets the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago.
Her body was found along with a note allegedly signed by the Zetas cartel: 'Here I am because of my reports.'
A computer keyboard and headphones were lying next to her severed head.
Some branches have chosen to close, according to the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state of Chihuahua following the assassination of correspondent Miroslava Breach in March.
Others continue, as El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did after her director's murder in 2004.
In 2010, the Diario de Ciudad Juarez addressed the drug cartels publicly with an editorial on the front page titled "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists have fled their home countries or even from the country.
It's a painful decision.
It's hard to find work in exile, and they still watch the streets and look for danger.
And sometimes they are hunted, as appears to be the photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered in 2015 along with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after fleeing Veracruz.
For those who stay behind and continue working, it's a daily dance with high-risk choices.
Ibarra, who once wanted to be a poet, admits that drug trafficking scares him.
"Mexico goes to hell, and that's why I became a reporter," he said.
At midnight last Friday, when the last issue had already ended, Riodoce's editors sat on the pavement in front of the office and drank beer when at once all their phones began to sum up.
A series of shootings involving gang rivals and security forces near the seaside resort of Mazatlan had left 19 confirmed dead.
The war escalated further, as promised by a series of antitrust embassies in the region.
From the brothel edge, they posted the news on Riodoce's website via mobile phone.
The front page had to be changed the next day.
Sirens howled nearby - another shooting in the area.
Bojorquez threw a look at the policemen who held guard to see if they were in readiness.
If they were scared at all, they didn't show it.
Under the enormous portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper, whose middle finger was visible to all of Sinaloa, Riodoce's staff followed his footsteps.
"How can you even think of closing," Bojorquez said, "when on the same day that Javier was murdered, the intern asked me to send her to the streets for reporting."
Dinosaurs used camouflage to evade his enemies
At first glance, it looks like a statue, albeit a terrifying one.
Now researchers have found that the initial findings of the incredible rhino of a Canadian miner were so well received that experts described it as the "Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs."
It was so well received that they could even find that his scaly skin was of reddish brown - and they said they had something of a "troubled past."
The report in the journal Current Biology called it "the best preserved armoured dinosaur ever found, and one of the best dinosaur specimens in the world."
The fossil is a newly discovered species of nodosaurian who lived in the middle of the chalk season between 110 million and 112 million years ago.
Its incredibly well-preserved condition has puzzled researchers who describe it as 'really remarkable'
According to reports in National Geographic, the armoured herbivore is the best preserved fossil of its kind.
It was found by Shawn Funk when he dug at the Suncor Millennium mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011.
He met something that seemed misplaced by the surrounding rock and decided to look more closely.
The fossil he discovered was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.
They spent the next six years uncovering the wild animal within the 2,500 pound (1,100 kg) of earth clumps.
After all this hard work, the finished result is now ready to be unveiled.
"If you just blinked a little with your eyes, you could almost believe it slept," said the principal author, Caleb Brown, a scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature is seen.
"It will go into science history as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaur specimens - the Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs."
Researchers found that although this herbivore is covered with an armor and resembles a changing tank, it was probably threatened by meat-eating dinosaurs.
The heavily armoured dinosaur used a red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and used a shielding technique known as counterlocking, which is also used by many modern animals.
This would have allowed it to blend better into its surroundings and evade its enemies, experts say, suggesting that it was threatened by larger dinosaurs.
The 110 million-year-old creature from the Nodosaurian family first made headlines in May and is now seen at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.
Researchers have now studied the wild animal and called it Borealopelta markmitchelli after museum technician Mark Mitchell, one of a team that spent more than 7,000 hours digging it out carefully.
The specimen's astonishing conservation allowed Dr Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and shape of sheds and armor over his body.
They discovered the cone shade, a common defense method in the animal kingdom, meaning the tip of the creature was darker than its bottom.
Although dense shade is common, the results are surprising, as the size of Borealopelta far exceeds that of the animals living today.
It suggests that the dinosaur was hunted by enough pressure from meat-eating dinosaurs that evolution favoured the cover-up of confrontation as a means of survival.
But most contemporary animals that use the contraption shade - think of deer, zebras or belt animals - are much smaller and more vulnerable than prey, signaling that this nodosaurian was facing a real struggle for survival.
"Strong predator behavior on a massive, heavily armoured dinosaur shows how dangerous the dinosaur predators of the chalk age must have been," Brown said.
Chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the dinosaur's skin was redbrown.
Scientists continue to examine the animal for clues about its life, including its canned intestine, to find out what it eaten as its last meal.
They believe that when the dinosaur died, it fell into a river and was driven out to sea, where it sank on its back to the seabed.
At that time, Alberta was as warm as southern Florida today, and rivers and oceans probably spread much further inland than they are today.
"This nodosaurian is truly remarkable because it is fully covered with canned scaly skin but also preserved in three dimensions and maintains the animal's original form," Brown said.
"The result is that the animal looks almost exactly the same today as in the early chalk season.
You don't need to use a lot of imagination to reconstruct it; if you just shave a little with your eyes, you might almost believe he is sleeping."
The chalk season was a time when giant theropods, carnivorous dinosaurs that stood on two legs, permeated the Earth.
Although the king of them, the Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions of years after Borealopelta, the armoured dinosaur was hunted down by some of its fearsome ancestors.
This includes the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 foot (11.5 m) long, six tonne heavy monster.
The scientists, whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology, believe Borealopelta sank in the sea after death and was mummified in the mud.
The creature was found by Shawn Funk when he dug at the Suncor Millennium mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011.
According to the museum, it is the best-preserved armoured dinosaur in the world, including skin and armor, and is complete from the muzzle to the hip.
The creatures were on average about 18 feet (5 feet) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).
It contained two 20-inch-long tips that raced from his shoulders.
Researchers believe the armoured herbivore was swollen through western Canada until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea.
But the dinosaur's underwater burial kept its armor in exquisite detail.
The fossilized remains of this particular specimen are so well preserved that the remains of the skin still cover rough tanks along the dinosaur
As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, such a level of conservation is so 'rare as a win in the lottery.
The more I look at it, the more confusing it becomes.
Foamed remains of the skin still cover the hollowed-out armour plates that carry the animal's skull.
His right front foot is on his side, his five fingers are spinning upwards.
I can count the scales on his sole'.
In the thunderstorm: Mass blasts on A8: Many injured
Fierce accident on Thursday night on the A8: Just under 30 vehicles are involved in a mass carjacking.
There are numerous casualties, miles of traffic jams - and gaffers.
On the highway Stuttgart-Munich (A8) late Thursday afternoon, about 20 people were injured in a mass carjacking.
According to initial police figures, at around 17.00, almost 30 vehicles, including probably trucks, collided between Adelzhausen and Odelzhausen (Aichach-Friedberg district) during a thunderstorm.
At first, no information was available on the exact number of casualties.
It involved minor to medium-weight injuries, a police spokesman said.
A large contingent of ambulances was at the scene.
The A8 was completely closed to Munich.
In the direction of Munich there was a backlog of about ten kilometres long.
As an AZ reporter reports, massive disabilities also occurred on the opposite carriageway - through numerous gaffers.
The fire department noted the vehicle's license plates now face severe penalties.
Shortly after 18:45 a second accident occurred on the A8, this time between Augsburg and Dasing.
There was a collision between a car van and a passenger car.
A rescue helicopter was en route to the accident site.
Deutsche Bahn: Group tests 'comfort check-in'
It is a moment that almost everyone has experienced before: Nothing unsuspecting is sitting in the train and sleeping.
Or one is immersed in his work and just has a brilliant thought.
And then: pufff.
If the conductor arrives and wakes up an unmoved person or pulls the passenger out of the workflow.
Ticket control.
But the days of interruptions are soon over.
Deutsche Bahn is currently testing free ticket control.
You simply confirm by mobile phone that you take your place and devalue the ticket.
A test operation is currently under way on two routes.
"Come up the offer, we extend it.
It is then expected to be available on many other long-distance routes in Germany early next year," a rail spokesman said.
"Comfort check-in" calls the train the ticket devaluation without chargers.
In order to be able to use them, however, certain conditions must be met: you need a smartphone or a tablet.
And you must have booked an online ticket - which most passengers do anyway.
You also have to buy it through the train app that DB Navigator bought, which is anyway the most convenient way of booking your ticket.
Last but not least, you need a seat reservation.
Because the "comfort check-in" works like this: You get into the train, calling its ticket under "My Tickets."
A button for electronic devaluation appears for test customers.
Train attendants get a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is in the train and has taken the booked seat Y.
When the passenger arrives at Y. when checking the tickets, he knows that there is a passenger with an already devalued online ticket.
So you can continue sleeping, continue working, stay silent.
Check-in has two advantages: one for the customer, one for the railway - which in turn should benefit passengers.
"If you want to travel relaxed without ticket control by our train staff, check in at the DB Navigator.
This allows passengers to make their journey time in train more personal," says Michael Peterson, marketing director of DB Ferntransport.
Second plus: "And our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs."
Those who often train know that, in addition to delays and missed trains, ticket checks are among the biggest upsets.
Because often one of the passengers does not have all the documents you need to devalue online tickets.
Either the credit card or ID card is missing, or any other document you have to show.
As a result, there are endless discussions between train crew and passenger, resulting in poor mood in the section or large area, and delays in checking your own ticket, and ultimately taking time for the conductor to address other concerns.
Only a small number of test customers can still use the new service.
And only on the ICE 915 Dortmund-Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart-Essen.
Other train numbers on the same route are not yet unlocked.
As one activist came to learn the answer to the question: "Whose Streets?"
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shaken to its core.
Just a day after she arrived in New York City, the St. Louis native sat on the bed of an Airbnb apartment she rented and scrolled through Facebook on her phone.
She stumbled across a post from someone from high school.
"The police have just killed an 18-year-old child, and it is still on the street," it said.
Confused, since no one else had posted the information on their feed, they closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
A user with the handle @TheePharoah was constantly retweeted on their timeline.
The rapper from the St. Louis area was in the process of tweeting the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old who was killed by a white policeman in Ferguson, Mo., live.
He posted a picture of Brown's lifeless body that was outstretched on the street and would stay there for four hours.
"That's wild," Ferrell thought of himself.
But death was nothing new for her and her community.
She put off her phone to return to tweets about people on the Canfield Drive later in the evening.
There were photos of the police tape and people screaming, and of a man who claimed to be Brown's father carrying a sign with the inscription: "Ferguson police have just killed my unarmed son!"
She watched a live feed where a policeman stood in front of a group of protesters with a barking dog.
In another video, she said, another policeman grabbed his rifle and shouted, "I will kill you... animals all."
"It's not common," Ferrell recalled her testimony.
"This is not the kind of murder we have become accustomed to and can call typical."
At that moment I felt chills.
I was angry and crying.'
She booked a return flight and went home the next day.
After landing at 23, she took her 6-year-old daughter out of her father's house and decided that the two would go to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson in the following three years is the subject of a new documentary, "Whose Streets?" in cinemas from Sept. 11.
It is a story of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and resilience that exists from the point of view of people who live in the community and have filled the streets to demand answers.
When Ferrell went to Ferguson with her daughter, wearing a floral dress and a matching crown, the two had a conversation that they had »about the black experience and the black condition« numerous times before this morning.
"You remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe in?" she recalled of what she said.
"We are now going to Ferguson because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and that wasn't right.
I couldn't take them with me," Ferrell said later.
"What happened today is a highlight of what happened in the past.
She needs to know and see it and be raised in it.
It must be well developed, know not only activism and organisation, but also the different layers of black experience and black constitution, and what we must do to become free to liberate ourselves.
Even though I am lucky enough to give her an experience where she personally does not experience blatant racism, she is no different from the next black woman's child.
I feel I would do her a disservice to keeping her away from it."
The first stop when they arrived in Ferguson was on South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police authority that became a campground when activists waited for Officer Darren Wilson's possible non-charge.
There, Ferrell and her daughter connected with a local business owner who made lunch.
They prepared bags and helped pass them on to protesters.
Slowly a new kind of activism began to take shape for Ferrell.
"My activism completely changed after August 9," she said, noting that as a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis she was president of the Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on food justice and health inequalities in black communities.
"I had no experience in organizing.
Everything has come."
Weeks later, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, one of the film's co-directors, during an evening demonstration.
Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar just wanted to "document" what happened.
One question came to Ferrell's mind: "Do you want to document or try to find a story you can exploit?"
That skepticism was fuelled by countless cases of people, often from whites - in a community that benefited from their pain and resilience.
As Folayan explained in a recent interview, 'We had heard that people who were born and raised in Ferguson did not center their voices and we wanted to do it differently'.
Folayan had already worked with the then co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the field known for his activism around death row inmates.
His involvement brought Ferrell closer to the project, along with six other locals followed by the team of "Whose Streets?" in the years following Brown's firing.
"This documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks with us... we talk," Davis said.
"That was the main thing for me as these people are portrayed, because that is how I will be portrayed."
The goal was not to focus on Ferrell's experience - to show that the movement "is not a messiah leader but a community coming together," Folayan said - she proved to be the film's most open participant.
As a result, documents from "Whose Streets?" show surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrell's life as she falls in love and marries her wife.
"I felt like naked," Ferrell said and laughed when she first saw the finished product.
"But I understand that there must be some vulnerability in this work and in the menacing of black people."
In addition, Ferrell's story repeats the role of black gay women in the broader Black-Lives-Matter movement.
Two of the movement's three founders, following the killing of black teenager Trayvon Martin in the 2012 film "BlacklivesMatter" on social media, identify themselves as gay.
"Black, gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement overall," Ferrell said, "and therefore we are constantly fighting on different fronts.
Black, gay women must bear the brunt of everything."
Folayan agreed to note that "the movement is really maintained by black women and many black women."
She insists, however, that "this is not an affirmative type of action," where Ferrell was selected because of her identity as the heart of the film.
"She was the person who was shaking up that energy," she said.
"It's no accident, though she's been at the forefront because in a life at these intersections as a black, gay woman so much is at stake.
You can feel your energy through the screen."
Meanwhile, news cameras in Ferguson have long since disappeared, but the racial links between the community and the police persist.
Ferrell is on probation for 21⁄2 years for blocking a highway at a demonstration.
She describes the sociopolitical atmosphere of the area she calls her home: "a mess."
Yet she clings to a voice and she feels committed to that memory since she took to the streets in Ferguson three years ago.
"It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It is our duty to win.
We must love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose except our chains."
From 'dream' to 'size mania': TV readers discuss bite gallery
The Bit Gallery moves people, though it is far from built.
But the idea of a shopping mall at the south end of the pedestrian zone has divided the population into advocates and opponents since the first presentation in 2009.
Cold barely leaves the issue.
The issue is also discussed on our Facebook page "Volksfreund Bitburg."
While the one to the Bit Gallery says, "That would be a dream" (Anja Becker) or "That would be real class" (Nicole's scarves), comes from the other side: "doesn't need a man" (Siggi bashes) or quite plainly, "size mania!" (Lars Scholz).
While supporters are counting on a gallery to attract more customers to the city, which also benefits the rest of the shops, opponents fear that then the pedestrian zone will bleed out.
In addition, the gallery is being planned precisely at the site where the farmers" market hall is located, where 13 direct marketers offer their products.
This will stop at the start of construction work.
The gallery makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - moving to Beda Square with possibility to sit outside.
Simone Zimmer: "We've been buying almost weekly at the Farmers Market Hall for many years.
Mainly our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of the country women always very happy.
We also discovered the buttocks for us.
We would like to see an opportunity to maintain this offer even during and especially after the construction of the gallery.
Other cities do.
The small market hall in Frankfurt is particularly interesting."
Gerd Densing: "Whether direct marketers settle in a market hall in the gallery comes down to the amount of rent.
However, this is unlikely to be very low in the new project."
Eva Kilic: "Why shopping in Bitburg?
Be it clothing, shoes, drugstores or supermarkets, I find that unnecessary.
There is already enough of that in our city.
You can see how many shops are empty here - some for months and years.
However, since there is not even a proper weekly market here, it is all the more important that we at least retain the market hall.
After all, the goods offered there are fresh, are for the most part offered directly by the producer and are also inexpensive.
As you can see, shops in a shopping centre are only rented by larger companies, because the rents there are often not acceptable to a retailer.
It is a pity that special deals are almost non-existent and what remains of them will probably disappear."
Wolf Fandel: "A shopping centre with a market hall doesn't fit in for me.
And the gallery doesn't match Bitburg.
Above all: Where should the peasant market hall go during construction time?
The old Edeka would be the solution - even in the long run, if the bite gallery actually comes at some point.
Or does the ghost bite gallery already manage to drive all the shops out of Bitburg?"
George Marquet: "That just won't work.
And a shopping center that stands empty doesn't need anyone either.
I think it would have been better to promote a proper farmers' market instead of this gallery.
But there is no room for a farmers' market hall, thanks to the mad many - I think - pointless construction projects in Bitburg.
If the farmers' market hall is destroyed, a piece of culture will disappear again."
A fitting similarity: Artist creates portraits with Chelsea Manning's DNA
In the middle of the room at the Fridman Gallery in New York, many faces are seen - white, black and brown, which are almost imperceptibly the same - hanging on cables from the ceiling.
The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from cheek tulips and haircuts sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent the excerpts from the Fort Leavenworth prison, where the former intelligence analyst was serving a 35-year sentence after making public classified diplomatic messages on the WikiLeaks website.
The new exhibition, which opened on August 2, is called A Becoming Resemblance (A matching similarity).
It is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline united her expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a transgender and pioneering dissident whose conviction was commuted by Barack Obama when he had only three days left in office.
Dewey-Hagborg, through algorithmic analysis of the DNA extracted by Manning and created from the 30 portraits of how someone could look with these genomic data, created a sharp, if somewhat intellectual commentary not only on the malleability of DNA data - the many ways they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also on identity.
Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward but has already spoken openly about identifying as a woman since her puberty, was convicted in 2013 on 20 charges, including six violations of the espionage law, computer fraud and theft.
By prison, her image was suppressed, so much so that there was only one photograph - a grainy, black-and-white selfie in which Manning visibly sits unwell in a driver's seat and wears a platinum blonde wig - with which she was associated.
In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg came straight from the great success of her 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'.
In it, the artist produced portraits of strangers from forensic artifacts such as cigarette fumes and chewing gum by extracting DNA from the waste to create a picture of what these people might look like.
That was the moment she received an email from a newspaper magazine.
"They conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison and they wanted some kind of portrait to accompany this article," Dewey-Hagborg explained at a press preview of the new exhibition.
And she couldn't visit at that time and she couldn't be photographed, so you contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait.
The artist and her imprisoned muse became disparate post friends, exchanging several letters over the course of two years.
They even created a comic book "Suppressed Images" illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, which foresaw a future in which the president would convert Chelsea's judgment and enable them to see the exhibition in person.
That Obama would actually call for Manning's release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas just days after the book was published was a welcome kind of happy coincidence.
There is also something deep and powerful about the opening of the exhibition now, as Donald Trump is waging a war against informants from the government camp and against transgender troops to find new, tweetable ways to further unravel the rigid divisions he was supposed to fix.
When Dewey-Hagborg was asked about the strange timing of all these things, she said that "things happen for a certain reason."
In an artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery, Manning, with her outsized signature underneath (the "i" in her family name is marked with a heart), called for an end to the "automatic fragmentation whose basis has been gender, race, sexuality and culture."
On the opposite wall is her mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousand-feet of Cs and Gs and As, written in pencil.
Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show, by incorporating the 200 letters (or nucleotides according to the artist's sophisticated scientific lexicon), how surprisingly similar, at least in biological terms, we all are.
"What people will hopefully take away from this is that our genome doesn't care who we are and how openly genetic data is for an interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video work of 2007, Spurious Memories, is also seen.
"DNA data can tell so many different stories, so these are 30 of these stories."
The final piece in the exhibition, which is kept in a separate room, is a page from the above-mentioned comic novel.
It shows Manning how she appears with a hands-off phone in hand from the United States' discipline armies like King-Kong.
"If they cold your speech, they won," it reads.
"So never stop your mouth."
"It came directly from a letter she wrote to me," the artist said, greeting her from Philadelphia.
"I still get goose bumps when I talk about it."
Manning hasn't personally seen the exhibition yet - just as it was anticipated in the comic book - but if she was to do it, then she will be greeted in the middle of the room by the masks, by her own genomic simulacrums that look like hordes of protesters.
This was also targeted, as was everything in the exhibition, down to size (5" 2, Manning's stature), in which their genetic haplogroups were written with pencil.
"In the past I had them on the wall, but I wanted them to feel like a crowd," Dewey-Hagborg said of the portraits.
"I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea, like the movement that was also behind their liberation."
Professor of the University of Northwestern and an employee of Oxford University sought for killing
A nationwide manhunt is underway for a professor at Northwestern University and an employee of Oxford University who is being sought as suspects after a man was stabbed in a luxury apartment in Chicago with fatal injuries.
On Monday, arrest warrants were issued for Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) for murder for their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, as the files from Cook County District Court show.
The documents say Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after multiple stitches.
A community alert system released by the Chicago Police Department says the corpse was discovered on July 27.
Officers received a call, arrived at the Grand Plaza apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body.
Cornell-Duranleau was still pronounced dead at the scene, and detectives are investigating the stitches as a murder while police are actively searching for the two suspects, officials said.
Lathem has been an extraordinary professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, the vice president for university relations, said in an e-mail statement that Lathem was now in vacation and had been barred from entering Northwestern University's campus.
"This is now a criminal matter being investigated by the relevant authorities, and Northwestern University is cooperating in this investigation," Cubbage said.
Warren is Senior Treasury Assistant at Oxford University.
A spokesman for the University and Somerville College said in an e-mail statement that "we are in contact with the police in the UK and ready to assist the US investigation authorities in every possible way."
The statement added that Warren's colleagues were shocked and want him posed.
Chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Department, Anthony Guglielmi, said he strongly urges the suspects to face the authorities.
"The police have an idea of their whereabouts, and our efforts to locate them are intensifying," Guglielmi said.
Guglielmi said local, regional and national authorities are helping to find the suspects.
Guglielmi said police received a call from the building manager of the Grand Plaza building, who had just received an enigmatic tip saying that something had happened in apartment 1008.
Police described the scene as very cruel.
Guglielmi said it was unclear if the incident also took place on July 27.
It was confirmed by security cameras that Lathem and Warren were in the building.
"We believe that Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," Guglielmi said.
Grand Plaza's management team issued a statement to residents saying: "The police are currently working on the timeline and background of the victim and are investigating a variety of motives, including a possible domestic incident."
"We will complete the WADA roadmap in the near future" - Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mutko
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said it will not be long before the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) for the restoration of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) are implemented.
"At a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the roadmap, RUSADA has been given the right to plan and test in collaboration with UKAD (UK Anti-Doping).
The WADA roadmap has been updated in this regard," Mutko explained on Thursday.
The PM commented on the second part of WADA's roadmap for compliance with the code, which describes the criteria for the reinstatement of RUSADA and was recently published on the organisation's website.
According to Mutko, there is nothing to worry about for Russia.
"Everything has been announced, everything is being implemented.
And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA in the near future," he added.
However, one of the criteria set out in the list states that the Russian anti-doping authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the investigation approved by WADA by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren into alleged state-sponsored doping in Russian sport.
Regarding the matter, Mutko said: "We are conducting the investigation as our anti-doping system has admitted a mistake.
All the measures have been implemented.
But there were no government programs, and we will not admit something that does not exist."
Mutko’s words coincided with those of Vitaly Smirnov, head of Russia’s independent anti-doping commission.
Speaking to Russian sales office RSport at the start of the day, Smirnov admitted problems of the past in Russian anti-doping organisations, but then added: "We have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations.
Nobody intends to accept this report unconditionally," Smirnov added.
RUSADA was banned from carrying out doping checks in Russia in November 2015 in the wake of the doping scandal.
However, her was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti-Doping Authority (UKAD).
After a visit to the organisation's headquarters in Moscow in July, WADA director-general Olivier Niggli declared that RUSADA was "moving in the right direction" to be reinstated.
Aldi isn't selling eggs for now
The business groups shared this view.
It was a purely precautionary measure, and it was stated in the communication that there could be no further assumption of any harm to health.
From now on, only eggs will be delivered to Aldi, which have been tested against fipronil-containing anti-lease agents.
Aldi aims to bring clarity and transparency to its customers.
The start-ups that will help your company not become the next Uber
Amy Errett wanted to measure happiness at your e-commerce start-up, but the polls didn't work.
Answers were often vague, unhelpful or - worse - fraudulent.
And even if you promised anonymity, some workers didn't trust the process.
"There was just never consistency and objectivity," said Savage, who runs the 75-person San Francisco e-commerce Hair Care company Madison Reed.
She called people from outside for help.
A new breed of human resources start-ups are growing to help companies find out how their employees feel.
By creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement, it allows companies to conduct surveys, address special groups and demographic groups, provide anonymity and complaint hotlines to employees, and in some cases allow whistleblowers to bypass the C-suite executives and contact the board directly.
"You now have tools like Strava and Fitbit for tracking their health, but where is the Fitbit for your company?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and chief executive of Redwood City start-up Glint, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement.
Savage said she gained a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with Glint.
In addition to snap polls and surveys of specific teams, it offers a heat map of the company, which at a glance shows which units have the most complaints and which executives have low approval results - so you can pinpoint why.
Companies come to realize that at the top of the workplace culture must stay so you don't become the next Uber caught up in scandals since a former employee posted a blog post describing an environment of harassment where those who spoke were punished.
For start-ups like Glint, this desire for an overview is a lucrative business opportunity.
The global governance, regulation, and compliance sector could be worth more than $118.7 billion in 2020, according to the financial engineering website Let's Talk Payments.
Denver, Colorado, start-up Convercent, which helps companies prevent and detect bad behavior, saw a rising interest and activity earlier this year amid the Uber case discredited.
Convercent has nearly 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber has recently signed up as a client.
Like Glint, Convercent lets companies send customized "pulse" surveys, collect confidential responses in real time, and view the heat maps of your problem areas.
It also offers an anonymous SMS hotline that lets employees report bad behavior.
And when the chief executive is involved, complaints go directly to the supervisory board.
"The court of public opinion has covered the regulators," said Patrick Quinlan, the founder and managing director of Convercent.
If a company is found to treat its employees badly or behave unethically, it can experience costly consequences through consumer boycott, employee fluctuation and lawsuits, Quinlan said.
Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 locations, has deployed Convercent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of the policies and procedures and have an easy way to reach its corporate headquarters.
Earlier, if an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a phone number or email for the company's headquarters, file a formal complaint and hope he was taken seriously.
It was often an intimidation and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesdays General Counsel, who said there was no good way to track employees' complaints.
Now that the company uses Convercent, problems previously hidden by executives who sat in offices in cities or states - such as discrimination, harassment or unfair practices - can be identified and addressed more quickly.
"I can get closer to this holistic, 360-degree view into the experience with employment," said Vitrano, who heads the Risk Management Group of Ruby Tuesday.
"And we protect our shareholders from employment litigation."
Companies began taking ethics, values and employee engagement more seriously in 2002 after accounting firm Arthur Andersen collapsed because of ethical breaches caused by the Enron scandal, Quinlan said.
But it took the "social media to get it right" that companies realized that you could not prevent their dirty laundry from going online.
"Before using technology to monitor ethics, people used hope as a strategy," he said.
Both Glint and Convercent offer your software as a service, and charge companies with recurring fees for using their products.
It's a business model and an opportunity that finds the approval of Venture Capital investors who have supported both start-ups.
Convercent received $10 million in February financing from companies like Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, raising all capital to $47 million.
Glitzern secured $10 million in November from Bessemer Venture Partners, bringing its total financing to $60 million.
These investments come as little surprise, given the interconnected nature of business, culture and venture capital.
There is a growing body of research showing that today's employees expect more from their jobs than before.
In competitive markets like Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are only bets.
Employees want to feel that you are accepted and valued and that you are giving your time to a company with a positive mission.
"If people are happy to be in a company, feel that their voices belong, and that the work you do is worth it, then they feel more committed to making this company successful," said Nina McQueen, vice president of Global Benefits and Employee Experience at LinkedIn, which uses both Convercent and Glint.
Investors achieve returns when their portfolio companies do well; companies do well when employees are engaged and engaged.
If third-party analytics tools promise to increase engagement and employee engagement, it's no wonder you'll find support.
The data on employee engagement according to the experts of workplace culture important.
But the data is useless if a company's managers don't take action.
Indeed, when a company asks employees for your feedback, there may be an expectation that change is on the way.
And if change doesn't come quickly enough, or not at all, it can breed disappointments and discourage employees.
"If you ask for 4,000 suggestions, you have to be ready to have 4,000 conversations," said Russell Raath, president of consulting at business management firm Kotter International, which has seen companies rely too much on collecting data.
"Because if you don't follow, employees will ask, "Have you really heard me?
Do you care?
And who you don't care about, why should I?"
Madison Reed, who now conducts monthly employee surveys, was able to take action on the same day when a problem is reported about Glint, according to Savage.
And after gathering feedback from frustrated employees, it was driven by the speed of decision-making and the quality of communication, able to reorganize several teams within the company and add a communications training to address the problems.
At Ruby Tuesday, the company is getting new insights about the employees, and it hopes that in the long run, this will lead to better retention of workers in an industry known for high sales.
"If you are not required to create a culture of transparency, you will lose people," Vitrano said.
"And if you lose people, you lose customers, too.
And if you lose customers, you will lose businesses.
The NCAA eliminates the two-day practices and makes a long day for the Bruins
It goes to 23 p.m., when a crowd of UCLA football players entertained on one side of the team's new practice fields on campus.
Some have pulled out their jersey tops and show the back full of sweat from the first day of training camp.
For a good part of the team, these idle minutes represent a lunch break.
Players enrolled in the summer courses will return to their final exams after the three-hour practice before returning to Wasserman Football Center the next morning at 6:30.
"This is a real treadmill for the guys the next three days," Bruins coach Jim Mora said just before Monday became Tuesday.
The NCAA eliminated two-day practice sessions to ease the burden of players, and it actually extended its days -- at least until the final Friday.
That's why UCLA's first three training sessions should start at 19:15 to match the players' already packed schedules.
The compromise away from the two days is more than a day when the Bruins postponed the start of camp nearly a week after last season and during summer school for the first time during Moras' six game time in Westwood practice.
They are expected to hold 18 practice sessions during August 20 before the start of formal game preparations for their kick-off against Texas A & M in September.
Mora said he supports the NCAA's rule change even as it adds another point to the players' busy routes.
"We put this enormous burden three or four days on it, and it's very challenging," Mora said.
"And they just pushed it through, they continued to placate, they're great people.
I think as soon as we get to Saturday and we have more time, it really will be great."
UCLA will end its practices once the camp is finished, which will not be an easy task given the clear lines of sight of its fields from an adjacent parking lot and the adjacent Luskin Center, a hotel of the upscale class already littered with footballs that cleared a protective net behind a goalpost.
Bruins-based players are expected to occupy the hotel from this weekend, but Mora conceded that there could be a problem once those rooms are free during the season.
"We will use our security," Mora said.
"This is a real problem, and it's not far-fetched to think that people are hiring a room there and then setting out there to record an exercise.
If you have the video tape of an exercise, it's a pretty good business.
But we have security forces there, and we have security forces in parking 8.
We will do the best with what we have.
I am not too worried, therefore.
We have a plan."
Facebook to step up fact-checking in fight against fake news
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with false messages to fact-checkers from third parties and then display their results under the original post, the world's largest online social network said on Thursday, saying it is one of its efforts to combat so-called fake news.
The company said in an opinion posted on its website that it will begin using updated machine learning techniques to detect possible false messages and send them to fact-checkers, which will potentially display results of fact-checking from the original article.
Facebook has been criticized as one of the main distribution points for so-called fake news, many of whom believe it has also influenced the 2016 US presidential election.
The problem has also become a major political issue in Europe, with French voters flooded with false stories in the run-up to the May presidential election, and Germany backing a plan to punish social media networks if they fail to quickly eliminate hate-filled posturing, as they did before the September elections.
On Thursday, Facebook said in a separate statement in German that a test of new fact-checking will be launched in the U.S., France, the Netherlands and Germany.
"In addition to finding out which stories are being challenged by fact-checkers of third parties, people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share," Sara Su, product manager for Facebook News said in a blog.
She added that Facebook will continue to test its feature on the "related article" and is working on other changes to its news feed to reduce false messages.
Creating a comic novel: A castle in the history of England
In his recent past, the little Scotney Castle was seen in a squeeze-out music video and was a loophole for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970s and 1980s.
But Scotney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history from his cozy seat in the Bewl River valley in Kent and has now become the inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes, a moody Yorkshireman with a penchant for historical documents.
"I find it so nice to look at the handwriting of someone who has been dead for 300 years," he says faintly.
"What a personal relationship, keep this letter in my hands."
'A Castle in England' spans the period from the Middle Ages to the Age of Edward and documents the families who lived in Scotney, and each story has been illustrated by another emerging British artist - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
It's not Rhodes' first book based on an archive: He wrote 2014's "Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories," a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project he found unexpectedly emotional.
"I only reacted to the thumbprint on the page of a letter so written by a double agent in the 1700s who worked for the Jacobins," he says.
"That's his thumbprint!
And letters always smell smoke, because at the time you lit a fire because of the light.
For someone who lives 300 years later, the smell has an effect, as if he were there himself.
Ah, I love archives!"
For someone so smitten with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived in a castle for almost four months ("To be honest: I've got my welcome a little overrated") this seems all too good to be true.
Rhodes spent his days exploring the Victorian "new" castle, reviewing the archives and studying the castle's many treasures and curiosities, such as the mounted hyenas on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the ditch.
He wandered through the site and the ruins of the old castle and talked to landscapers, gardeners and sometimes the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book.
Then, at night, he drank "whiskey and started writing."
Scotney's intimate history is relatively unknown since the National Trust only gained full access in 2006 when the last heir, Elizabeth Hussey, died.
When Rhodes arrived a decade later, employees just started taking care of the archive, which he described as a "hundreds of years in which aristocrats said "Oh, throw it to the attic."
Diaries, letters from the time of the English Empire, maps showing who owned what: "You could think that land conflicts would be boring," says Rhodes, "but there was a birch around which the two families fought.
Guys, let's all walk his walk!"
Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to immerse themselves in English history on a wider basis, including 'The Labourer', which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the farm uprising of 1381.
"There is a record of a riot that occurred at the castle in 1380, in this book entitled 'Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex,'" says Rhodes.
"The farm uprising started in that area and I thought an uprising was a good start.
Maybe the two are connected?"
Other stories are firmly rooted in the castle's history - like 'The Priest', which tells the story of the Jesuit priest whom the Darrell family hid for seven years during the English Reformation.
Or 'The Smuggler', in which the smuggler Arthur Darrell of the 18th century is depicted, who staged his own funeral by filling a coffin with stones (a discovery made only years later when his coffin was excavated).
The Darrells are Rhodes' favourite family of Scotney: "The masters seemed to be pretty crooks, getting into debt and spending money on things they couldn't afford.
Other generations of Darrell men resolved their debt crises by marrying rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of well-liked guys, with a talent for promoting inheritance."
After ending his deployment at the castle, Rhodes is looking for other unique writing experiences
He has spent two weeks in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about Elämänmäki, the site of an early 20th-century sanatorium that has since been reclaimed by nature.
But Scotney has a special place for him.
"I was sad to go back," he says.
It was like, 'Oh, now I have to come back to life condemned'.
Campaign launched: Over 300 year old Marienkapelle shrouded in Rhöndorf
With the closure of the 301-year-old Marienkapelle in Rhöndorf, the town of Bad Honnef on Friday launched its campaign to introduce a new umbrella brand (roundview of Thursday).
Until Thursday, Mayor Otto Neuhoff and his marketing team around Nelson Artz want to keep the logo and slogan secret.
At the end of August there will be a festival on the island of Grafenwerth.
"Too nice for us.
Or?" ask the makers of the action since yesterday on the posters at the Rhöndorf Chapel.
"We don't really think that (of course!)," they write on their website released yesterday.
"But we are using this measure to win your attention.
And to make it clear that much is better than it seems.
Basically, we firmly believe that we, as Bad Honnefer citizens, are well aware of the beauty and attractiveness of our city."
The action involves more than "just" a logo and a slogan, it said.
"There is a need to formulate a single promise, one that gives the city a distinctive uniqueness."
After all, it is in competition with other municipalities.
A median five-figure amount can cost the city of Bad Honnef its new roof brand and campaign.
Military reforms in Turkey - Erdogan's fear of army
Every year in early August in Ankara the Supreme Military Council (YAS) advises on retirements and promotions in the officer corps.
So did this week.
At first glance a normal procedure.
But nothing is routine among Turkish forces a year after the coup attempt.
The meeting was no longer held in the General Staff's building, as before, but in the prime minister's office.
The five Vice-Presidents and the Ministers for Defence, Home Affairs, Justice and Foreign Affairs took part in the discussions under the chairmanship of the Heads of Government.
As a result, the civilian population in the YAS was overwhelming.
The government is pulling the reins in the military.
Chief of Staff Hulusi Akar remains in office, but the commanders of the army, the air force, and the navy were removed.
Since the failed coup, leader Erdogan has fired 169 of the 326 generals and admirals.
Over 10,000 soldiers have been removed from the army's ranks - mostly because of alleged links to the movement of exiled preacher Fethullah Gülen, whom Erdogan sees as the mastermind of the coup attempt.
Opposing 486 people to have been directly involved in the coup attempt has been under negotiation in Ankara since this week.
Even the day after the coup, Erdogan had described the coup attempt as a "God gift" as giving him the opportunity to "fully cleanse" the armed forces.
But does Erdogan really control the army?
In late February, the newspaper Hurriyet published an article with the headline "Uncomfort at the Military Headquarters."
There are concerns in the General Staff about increasing "Islamization" of the Army, which manifests, among other things, in the lifting of the headscarf ban on female soldiers, the newspaper wrote.
In any case, the wholesale purging of the army and the security forces continues.
In mid-July, Erdogan ordered another 7395 public servants to fire by decree, including 2303 police officers and 546 soldiers.
It seemed that Erdogan was tearing up the military.
The generals used to be considered the real masters of the country.
Three times they putted, citing their role as guardians of the secular state order.
After his election victory in 2002, Erdogan gradually pushed back the military’s power, not least by citing the European Union’s reform agenda.
Former officers say Erdogan is deliberately Islamicizing the armed forces.
In Vocal Europe magazine, an unnamed officer who sought asylum after the coup attempt for fear of persecution abroad warned that the Turkish army would be "full of extremists and Salafists" in a few years.
If true, such a development could not leave NATO cold.
After the clean-up, there is no doubt in the alliance about the readiness of the Turkish army.
The governance structures and operational capabilities are "weakened," NATO diplomats say.
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
There will be a new U.S. immigration plan to change the rules of the green card, said President Donald Trump, quoted by the media.
He envisages reducing legal immigrants to 50,000 a year, stricter rules on obtaining visas for temporary work permits and restrictions on family-oriented visas.
The new rules are proposed by Republicans and supported by the president.
The bill is expected to be discussed in both chambers of Congress.
"This law will reduce poverty, raise wages and save billions of dollars for taxpayers, and will do so by changing the way in which green cards are issued to citizens from other countries."
The law will prevent chain migration and replace the current system.
This new application procedure will benefit candidates who speak English, who have the financial resources to support themselves and demonstrate knowledge that will benefit our economy," Trump said, quoted by the American media.
Ministry to clean up track for racing shuttle
Time and again in recent months there has been controversy over the future of the racecourse shuttle - now it's supposed to go quite fast.
Before the end of the year, the ailing route on which the tourist train runs is to be built.
In order to secure the future of the racecourse shuttle in the long term, construction work on the route is expected to begin later this year, according to the Department of Transport.
"With the decision to continue ordering and rehabilitating the Ilmenau-Rennsteig route, the country is committed to this link, which is especially important for tourism," Transportation Secretary Klaus Sühl said in Erfurt on Friday.
He estimated the cost of repairing the route at around EUR 2.5 million.
Of that total, the country exceeds 75 percent.
The contract, on the basis of which the shuttle will continue to be ordered from the country in the future, is currently being finalized, Sühl explained.
The Ministry and South Thuringia Railway as operators already agree on the technical details.
"This is where the roadmap, the vehicles used and the quality standards are negotiated," Sühl said.
The proposed contract between the ministry and the railway company will be concluded for an eleven-year period.
This should make the racecourse shuttle regular on December 2017.
The Rennsteig shuttle is a popular railway link between the Ilmenau railway stations and the Rennsteig railway station.
In recent months, in the course of a pilot operation, it has been tested whether the track is used by enough many people to order it again in the future.
The track is also very decrepit in parts.
The rise of sex robots is real, and we should worry
Just as you thought it might not be even crazy in 2017, comes a new report on technological developments in the sex robot sector.
Yes, indeed.
Sex robots are a big thing right now.
Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years.
According to Noel Sharkey, emeritus professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of the FRR, we need to start taking their rise seriously.
Customers can choose the robot's eye color, its shape of nipple and type of fingernail.
"People are making fun of them, but the companies are delivering lots of them, and we're going to see them much more often," Mr. Sharkey said in releasing his new report.
Modern sex dolls have evolved from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with deliberately human reactions achieved by artificial intelligence.
The user can also "adjust" his robot according to his beliefs, selecting everything from the robot's eye color to the shape of nipples to the type or color of his fingernails.
But it becomes even more disturbing as many robots possess the "personalities" that would make a Stepford woman look progressive.
Modern sex dolls have evolved into robots with a silicone skin.
The RealBotix robot, for example, allows its users to adapt their robots to the characteristics they find appealing, such as shyness.
And then there's the Roxxxy Gold sex robot developed by True Companion with pre-programmed personalities like "Frigid Farrah," which conveys the impression of shyness and "Wild Wendy" with an "adventurous" personality.
"Roxxxy Gold has a personality that's adapted to your personality as best you can," the website of True Companion snapped.
So she likes what you like, and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc.
She also has her moods during the day - quite like real people!
She can be tired of being fixated on conversation or she can be "in mood"!"
There are many troubling aspects to this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the underappreciated female traits, the allusions to rape, when you take a step at Frigid (meaning here: reluctant) Farrah, worry one most.
On its website, True Companion compared Roxxxy with a vibrator, but for men.
"If women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can men then not have Roxxxy?" the website says.
However, these sex robots are not just a fetish or just another sex toy.
Their emergence and increasing sophistication point to something darker and deeper in our culture, to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with submission as an optional addition.
Most men, of course, will not hold sex robots, and while the FRR notes its rising popularity, they nonetheless remain temporarily on the edge of consumer culture.
But what trickles down from the fringe zones can be very instructive in terms of the spirit of the time we live in.
And many people are not strange or insulting until the free market gives them permission to do so.
There is some overlap that these highly developed sex robots appear at a time when the rights of women worldwide are under threat, when there is a president in the White House who has boasted of sexually assaulting women.
The most daunting aspect of the TV series 'The Handmaid's Tale' ('The Report of the Magd') is not the graphic images, the devout bodies and the outcast eyes, but how realistic this vision works.
The Republic of Gilead is a leap, but at the moment this doesn't feel like a big leap.
The goal behind these sex robots is to make a physical resemblance to actual women as realistic as possible (albeit with porn star proportions).
Their builders want them to feel human, that they mimic the movement of a real body.
But, to the point, when it comes to their "personalities," robots don't represent real women.
They can't separate from their pet or just walk away.
They have no mediation or a background story, nothing that hints at independence or anything that could disrupt the fantasy of total submission.
In other words, they are favored slaves.
Or to put it in the 2017 speech: Serving girls
Trump’s Great Power?
He makes Mitt Romney the epitome of common sense
It has become a truism of the Trump era that the political divisions that have polarized US voters have also divided small-scale families.
Around Christmas and Harvest, US newspapers gave advice on how to deal with the horror of Trump’s chosen relatives.
We are all supposedly pushing ourselves to burst our filter bubbles.
What has been less noticed is Trump’s power to bring families together.
I mention this because my cousin, a left-leaning poet who lives in Chicago and has long been involved with Republicans in our family, visited me this week in New York.
It reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.
With Trump in the White House, everyone she knows, including the Republican kin with whom she had fought for decades because of politics, is suddenly and utterly strange on the same page.
This is certainly a good thing around the dinner table, but it strikes me in another context that this also entails considerable risks.
The left was strengthened by Trump, but the disfiguring effect of his presidency has the strength to push us all to the right.
When we talk about "normalization" and Trump, we refer to the grand possibility that one day his kittens will not repel us.
There is, however, an even more frightening long-term scenario in which Trump "normalizes" right-wing Republicans, who suddenly seem to be the epitome of sensibleness at once compared to his standards.
Today, I find myself afflicted by an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's ludicrous version of the madman - the dog on the car roof, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew what his tax returns were) - both of which, in fact, appear to be very mild crimes compared to Trump.
If Trump goes, the next Republican nominee will only have to be mentally healthy to qualify as an immeasurable improvement.
When my cousin was in town, we brought our children to the carousel in Central Park, the largest of New York's carousel department, and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don't need a caffeine.
The horses are huge, the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are crunchy and the animals are spinning to look over their own shoulders full of fear - extremely sinister and the clipping music conveys this in a strange way.
So many clichés of a city disappoint: The views of tall buildings get old, the skylines become too familiar to offer much excitement, and the reality of the city doesn't live up to the dream.
Thirty-five years later, and I'm still not quite over the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is indeed not a Swiss cottage - the themed pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage doesn't count - but a big roundabout in north London.
The Central Park carousel, however, is still a strangely magical experience, as here two two two-year-olds, an 11-year-old and two women in the 40s can go on and all have a great time.
If I could have assessed the carousel, I would have given him the full score, but fortunately no one asked for it.
On the other hand, this week at a mall, I was forced to assess my "experience" with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could pull through my credit card.
In the coffee shop on the corner of my street it is the same, plus the option of matching the rating with a 15% tip - this to buy something over the counter.
This not only slows down what should be a neutral exchange, but also puts pressure on the server to introduce personality into a situation where no one is required.
The poor woman in the mall stood excruciatingly grins while I tired of the experience of stretching her credit card with five stars.
Oscar Pistorius with chest pains transferred from prison to hospital
Pistorius has left prison for a hospital visit for the second time.
Last year he was taken to hospital for treatment of cuts to his wrists, which he told prison authorities after a case in his cell.
Pistorius was convicted of murder following an appeal by prosecutors against a first death sentence.
He killed Steenkamp in the early hours of Valentine's Day 2013, shooting her several times through a door of the toilet cubicle at his home in Pretoria.
Pistorius claimed he held his girlfriend for a late-night intruder who hid in the cab.
Prosecutors have announced their intention to appeal this time against Pistorius's six-year jail term, which they say is too lenient.
The National Prosecution Service said it will appeal to South Africa's Supreme Court and the appeal could be heard this year.
Pistorius risks increasing his sentence to 15 years if prosecutors succeed.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
As farmer Arnold finds a strange egg
As the last of the Blumberg schools, fourth-graders from Fützen and Epfenhofen were discharged into the holidays and into secondary schools.
Three of the school pupils will go to the grammar school in the future, four to the secondary school.
School teacher Angelika Sitte welcomed the parents and representatives of the public at the Civic House Biesental in Epfenhofen on Tuesday evening.
As a symbol of the school setting, the 29 students of the four classes led by Sophia Schumacher and Regine Meder chose a young eagle who grows up in the chicken farm but is then released to freedom.
This was followed by a musical entitled "Der Adler im Huhnhof auf".
Farmer Arnold found a strange egg, and let it roar from his chickens.
Instead of a chicken, a small eagle came out.
But hoping to make out of him a chicken crushed, the eagle spread out on a high mountain up its wings and dislodged.
After that, classes three and four showed a chicken dance in the study of Yvonne Frank.
The hens danced with the young gobs who wore cylinders to make the bet.
The eagle stands for integration, said schoolteacher Angelika Sitte.
The kitten is different from the other kittens (kitchens), but belongs to them.
He will never be like a chicken, though.
Its provision is to be free.
She wished every fourth-grader that he felt adopted in his new school.
It was followed by a word of thanks to the Members, to the former head of school, Michael Müller, who keeps jumping into bottlenecks and to the parents' representatives.
The chicks age is now over, explained class teacher Sophia Schumacher.
She leaves her students very reluctant after two years of teaching, because it was a really great time.
Eventually, they could rely on fourth-graders.
Finally, all students performed a song of summer and holiday time.
There was great joy in the children.
Eight first-graders are already registered for the new school year.
Two Bulgarians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
Two Bulgarians were detained for illegal camping in Greece, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, quoted by television, said.
On the morning of August 1, a group of illegally camping people were arrested in Sithonia by police, including the two Bulgarians.
The same day they were released while an investigation is ongoing.
The Foreign Ministry told bTV that Bulgarians were later released.
The Greek authorities have tightened controls on free camping and impose significant fines on anyone found to be staying in a place not intended for that purpose.
Controls will continue throughout the season.
The ministry said the court may impose a fine.
Software update for diesel vehicles: What people need to know now
How exactly does the software update take place?
Do diesel drivers need to take part in the action?
The main questions and answers at a glance.
At the Diesel Summit, BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW Group offered software updates for a total of about 5.3 million cars.
They are intended to improve the emission behaviour of cars in emission categories Euro 5 and partly Euro 6.
Euro 4 diesel or worse are exempt.
Anja Smetanin of the ACE Auto Club Europe gives assessments:
Is the new action mandatory?
No, the software updates negotiated are voluntary.
"The mandatory updates previously apply only to the vehicles that have cheating software," says Anja Smetanin.
Their retrofitting has been ordered by the Federal Highway Traffic Safety Administration (KBA).
How and when will customers be informed about updates?
Manufacturers have announced rapid implementation in the next few months, but have not yet given an exact date.
Daimler has been told to write to anyone affected.
If an inspection is required anyway, it will be carried out within their scope.
How long should the total conversions take?
"Hard to say," Smetanin thinks.
This depends on the commitment of manufacturers and on political pressure.
"Because we have seen that car manufacturers are not acting voluntarily on the issue of the environment so far."
How long should the update last?
The conversion itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop.
It might be more time-consuming to get an appointment.
What do motorists who do not drive a car from BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW Group do?
The ACE advises to wait.
Presumably foreign manufacturers would follow suit, according to Smetanin.
Is a massive fall in the price of Euro 4 cars now imminent?
The ACE fears that.
But it is precisely in the regions where driving bans threaten.
In rural areas, there has been no loss of value for older diesel.
The ACE advises to wait with a sale yet.
LL Cool J receives Kennedy Center award
The Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most glamorous events in Washington.
President Trump’s first award promises to become political.
One of the laureates doesn't want to come - in protest.
LL Cool J (49) is the first rapper to receive one of the prestigious Kennedy Center's coveted awards.
As the cultural institution announced on Thursday, this year singer Gloria Estefan (59), Lionel Richie (68) as well as the choreographer Carmen de Lavallade (86) and TV producer Norman Lear (95) are among the scholars.
The awards will be handed out in early December.
Traditionally, US President Donald Trump will host a reception and attend the ceremony with his wife, Melania.
For this reason, the progressive TV series winner Lear has already announced that he will not participate in the gala.
The New York Times said: "This presidency has chosen to completely neglect the arts and human rights - even depriving them of the means - and that is putting a strain on me."
The 59-year-old Estefan emphasized that she would use the conversation with Trump to clarify her view.
The Kennedy Center, named after former President John F. Kennedy, is the largest cultural institution in the US capital.
Past winners include Meryl Streep, Aretha Franklin, Robert De Niro, George Lucas, Tom Hanks and Sting.
We make the city liveable
Roland Wacker, Haslach's city builder, is retiring next year.
The job is already advertised - but suitable candidates are rare.
Wacker has been a city builder for 31 years.
And the work is still great fun for him, as he conveys in the press briefing.
He reports varied but demanding tasks awaiting his successor.
At the same time, he is surprised that no application meets the requirements profile.
The city is looking for an architect or civil engineer at the earliest opportunity.
For example, while respecting the regular notice periods, there should still be enough time to start work.
Since Haslach acts as the Lower Building Law Authority for the Administrative Community, the Applicant must have corresponding qualifications.
Because that function definitely wants to keep the city.
If they could no longer fill it, citizens would have to go to Offenburg for advice.
But proximity is important to the city and to it itself, says Wacker, who reports on a good business climate and good mood between authority and citizens.
In more than 30 years in office, some major projects have accumulated, with Wacker looking back with pride.
"We make the city worth living," he is sure about the building's office and its staff.
However, varied projects are also on the agenda in the future: the transformation of the former Hukla area and the Niederhofen parking lot, for example, has been initiated.
The Kinzigbrücke between Bollenbach and Steinach is being renewed, the stadium renovation is still the subject.
The latter alone will contribute around EUR 1.5 million, 'if we get it right', Mr Wacker reckons.
"All in all, great tasks await my successor.
The work here is fun."
There is a lot of room for a builder to design.
With Haslach's own farmhouse and gardening, many things can be responded to in a fairly flexible way.
"You can move a lot," Wacker said, and the design of the greens is often praised by citizens and visitors.
Since the Old Town is listed as an ensemble, it is important to have "an eye for what fits in" when new buildings are approved, the outgoing city builder stresses.
In any case, the builder has a great responsibility.
He's a builder, "in the end everything is going over my table here."
In terms of care and coordination, he can count on long-term employees: Markus Neumaier (high construction) has been present for ten years, and Manfred Schöner (deep building) has been doing so for 15 years.
Also, that his successor remains long, Wacker wishes: "We are looking for someone who really identifies with the place and wants to stay."
Continuity is important not only for a good working climate, but also for the further development of the city.
According to the City of Haslach, anyone wishing to bury Roland Wacker should be able to have a completed degree as a graduate engineer or bachelor with a specialization in architecture and have good expertise in the fields of design and planning law.
The Municipal Building Office is responsible for high- and low-rise construction, construction planning, land-use planning, management of urban properties, urban farmyard with building yard and municipal gardening, as well as Lower Building Law Authority, including monument protection.
Bike thrown at pipes: Southern rail line closed
According to police, the previously unknown offenders had thrown the blue bicycle from the rail crossing in the area of Leobener Street (B116) on the wires.
These were so badly damaged that the approaching freight train had to be stopped.
Investigators are looking at two male offenders and have been searching for them since the night hours.
Near the scene, witnesses said a rosy scooter and a bicycle rider were watching.
"This goes well beyond a blowout," ÖBB spokesman Christoph Posch said to APA.
The perpetrator or the perpetrator would have put himself in great danger and put rail transport at risk.
In addition to the damage to the locomotive and plant, as well as the minute of delay and the cost of replacing the railways, the perpetrators could also be charged with the fines of rail customers.
Overall, it is out of a "significant" amount, the spokesman said.
The damage was remedied on Friday afternoon, and rail traffic on the south railway line could be run without any disabilities.
Nearly ten passenger trains were dropped Friday morning, two of which involved long-distance traffic.
Freight trains did not fall, but they were delayed.
According to ÖBB spokesman Christoph Posch, some 200 metres of overhead lines had to be replaced.
Isolators and poles were also damaged.
Red meat, dairy products and chocolate could help alleviate IBD (inflammatory bowel disease)
Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.
But a new study claims just the opposite: A diet rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products could alleviate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel disease.
The incurable condition, which affects around 1.3 million in the US and 300,000 in the UK, causes stomach cramps and blisters, recurring or bloody diarrhea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
While those affected are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to relieve their symptoms, researchers at Washington University found that the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins helps develop immune cells that promote a tolerant intestine.
The lead researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells in the intestine are patrolling to ensure that harmful microbes hiding in food do not penetrate the body.
Cells capable of causing inflammation are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissue.
If the balance tends too far toward inflammation, it can result in inflammatory bowel disease.
Experiments have found that a type of tolerance-enhancing immune cell occurs in mice carrying a particular bacterium in their infestations.
And the bacterium requires tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the cell's appearance.
Professor Colonna said: "We have established a link between a bacteria species - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the intestinal microbiom, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.
The more tryptophan the mice had in their food, the more they had from these immune cells."
He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and a diet rich in tryptophan promotes more tolerant, less inflammatory bowel militia when the same system also works in humans.
Postdoctoral researcher Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan examined a type of immune cell that promotes tolerance when she found that a group of study mice had such cells, but another group of the same tribe, housed separately, did not.
She suspected that the difference had to do with the mice's intestinal microbiomas - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi that normally live in the gastrointestinal tract.
The fertilizers of the mice were DNA sequenced and there were six bacteria species found in the mice with the immune cells, but without them were missing in the mice.
Mice were reared in a sterile environment so they lacked an intestinal microbiom and they did not develop these kinds of immune cells, and they were given the L. reuteri and the immune cells emerged.
To understand how the bacteria had an impact on the immune system, the researchers allowed L. reuteri to grow in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of the fluid - without the bacteria - to immature immune cells isolated from the mice.
Immune cells evolved into tolerable cells.
When the active component was cleaned from the liquid, it turned out to be a byproduct of tryptophan metabolism known as indol-3 milk acid.
When the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the lining of the mice, the number of such cells rose by about 50 percent, but when the tryptophan levels were halved, the number of cells fell by half.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that humans have the same tolerance-promoting cells as mice, and that most of us protect L. reuteri in our gastrointestinal tracts.
It is not known whether tryptophan side products from L. reuteri develop cells in humans as in mice, but defects in genes related to tryptophan have been found in people with inflammatory bowel disease.
She said: "The development of these cells is probably something we would like to encourage as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestine.
Potentially, high tryptophan levels in the presence of L. reuteri may lead to an expansion of this population."
Jose Mourinho believes Manchester United have committed a 'genius' with Nemanja Matic
At Manchester United, with Nemanja Matic having signed a "genius," Jose Mourinho believes after the midfielder made his debut against Sampdoria on Wednesday night.
Chelsea's £40 million signing began with a 2:1 win in Dublin, the last pre-season game before the UEFA Super Cup against Real Madrid begins on Tuesday, and impressed in the keeper's role when people like Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira marched at will.
However, Matic had been ruled out of the Blues' pre-season tour and managed only 45 minutes, which Mourinho admitted he had to improve before the start of the Premier League season.
"He needs time but his experience, intelligence, a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football," Mourinho said.
"We will help him to be ready sooner rather than later."
Besides Matic, Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku also started at the Aviva Stadium when Mourinho formalised his starting XI for the start of the season.
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho still wanted three more new commitments but insisted the club had already done a "fantastic job" in meeting three of his four priority new commitments.
"To get three out of four, for that I thank the club," he added.
"I'll be happier if they get four out of four for me, but they took a lot of trouble."
Boeing 'paints' Dreamliner in the sky
The US aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the silhouette of a Dreamliner into the sky.
The pilots flew from Seattle in the US state of Washington, but the drawing began in Marquette in the US state of Michigan and moved in the form of a Dreamliner over the US, which is several thousand kilometres.
The action lasted 18 hours and a minute.
On the radar screens was the shape of a Dreamliner.
The whole thing was an endurance test for new engines.
Boeing had previously made such advertising.
So the number "787" and the Boeing logo were painted in the sky.
New low for Martin Schulz - Hanover, we have a problem
How the wind turns: When Sigmar Gabriel was still SPD leader, Social Democrat prime ministers always looked to Berlin with some concern before elections.
Just no trouble from party headquarters, just no headwind from the federal government - that was the primary wish of the campaigners.
Since Martin Schulz led the party, this has changed fundamentally.
Since then, the Willy-Brandt-Haus staff have been watching events in the SPD-ruled state capitals with growing horror.
What Schulz has got from there since the beginning of the year would not even be described with headwinds.
It was low-scoring.
One by one.
The federal CDU sees a general signal against coalitions of SPD and Greens after the surprising end of the red-green majority in Lower Saxony.
"This shows once again: Red-Green simply cannot govern reliably," CDU General Secretary Peter Tauber told the editorial network Germany (RND).
The surprise resignation of a Green MP has plunged the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) into a severe crisis.
Five months before the general election, his red-green coalition lost its one-vote majority to the opposition from the CDU and the FDP.
Greens deputy leader Michael Kellner has called on the breakaway Lower Saxony Greens MP Elke Twesten to return her mandate.
Passing the CDU clearly distorts the will of the electorate.
Elke Twesten must immediately return her mandate," the Federal Executive and Campaign Director of the Greens told the editorial network Germany (RND).
"This must not be true at all," one SPD campaigner sighs as Friday morning's new hiatus reaches party headquarters.
Stephan Weil, SPD Prime Minister of Lower Saxony, is standing without his own government majority after the transfer of the Green MPs Elke Twesten to the CDU.
It is the preliminary culmination of a series of large and small crises in SPD federations.
And no one knows what comes next.
The plight began with the unexpectedly clear defeat in the Saarland election in March.
A blue eye, no more, calmed the comrades at the time.
After the elections in Schleswig-Holstein and North Rhine-Westphalia, everything will be different.
It also became - and it all became much worse.
The defeat in Kiel brought the SPD into disarray, and the Dusseldorf impasse swept the party smoothly.
The comrades laboriously rapped again in the weeks that followed.
Then, just as they had created new courage, the G-20 summit came from Hamburg.
And with him came the next low shot.
Mayor Olaf Scholz, the last strong SPD leader, lost his nimbus that weekend because he sat in the Elbphilharmonie while his city burned.
And because, in crisis communication after that, he pretty much got everything wrong.
Since then, Scholz has been fighting for his political survival.
Now also Stephan Weil.
Because of the VW exhaust emissions affair and its role on the supervisory board, the Dutch Prime Minister has been critical for a long time.
Giant poll numbers added.
Nevertheless, or perhaps precisely because of this, Weil has tried to focus more and more in the last few weeks.
The desire of the former mayor of Hanover to increase his power in Berlin was not concealed by comrades close to Martin Schulz.
They allowed him, because they promised Weil to stabilize the party.
Now the exact opposite could happen.
In fact, Weil is not to blame for the partisan bickering of the Lower Saxony Greens.
And Schulz certainly not.
For now, the comrades are trying to keep their own ranks closed.
Her anger is directed at the Greens, and here in particular at the breakaway parliamentarian Twesten.
"It's unbearable and democratising how Ms Twesten puts her own career interests above the interests of everyone else," says Matthias Miersch, head of the party's left wing in the SPD Bundestag, the editorial network Germany (RND).
Mrs Twesten has been elected to parliament not because of her person as a direct candidate, but via the Land List of the Lower Saxony Greens, according to the Lower Saxony MP.
The logical consequence would be to return her mandate.
Thomas Oppermann, head of the SPD parliamentary group, laments an "undemocratic manoeuvre."
"The voter intent four years ago was clear: The people turned Stephan Weil into prime minister," Oppermann, who leads the Lower Saxony-based SPD as the top candidate in the federal election, told the RND.
"Well, the personal career thinking of a future CDU MP distorts the election result," Oppermann said.
He called for the background to be clarified.
I want to know whether there has been more or whether there have been further commitments from the CDU in Lower Saxony.
Funding for local core III
Those who want to rehabilitate their old house will soon be able to get support from the country.
Mayor Albert Schindler and three representatives informed STEG City Council on Wednesday in Empfingen.
At the beginning of the event, Schindler gave another look back at what has happened so far.
Since 1991 there have been rehabilitation areas in Empfingen.
At that time, in the rehabilitation area I from 1991 to 2004, the state of Baden-Württemberg still took over two-thirds of the funding.
In the recovery area II from 2005 to 2016, the grant was still 60%.
For Schindler, past refurbishments are a "success project" - it is, after all, important to also promote interior development, and not just unlock new construction sites.
On 4 April, the Karlsruhe County Executive received information that there would be a rehabilitation area III.
The funding amounts to EUR 833 333, of which EUR 500 000 would come from the country, the rest from the municipality of Empfingen.
How is a rehabilitation area created?
One will, Schindler continued, investigate where the "really old" houses are.
But it also plays a role in whether there is any interest in rehabilitating the planned area.
If necessary, the borders could then be shifted again.
The STEG represented Martin Keller, Gaby Pietzschmann and Sarah Gotzel on Wednesday night.
Keller presented the contents of the Bund-land-programme "Social City" in which the refurbishments would then be carried out.
The core of the programme is the revitalization of inner cities, improvement of living and working conditions and maintenance and expansion of infrastructure.
The measures would be taken on an object-based basis, i.e. per plot of land.
The rehabilitation area would then eventually be established as a statute.
Since 1 January 2017, the grant period is still running until 30 April 2026.
Until September of this year, however, the inventory would only be carried out once and for all, with a questionnaire for those involved in the rehabilitation area to fill in.
In November or December, as far as possible, the Statute decision should be taken so that the reorganisations can begin next year.
Pietzschmann then explained that each municipality had to carry out the said preliminary investigations.
It is about assessing urban grievances and deciding when to rehabilitate and to what extent.
A cleaning notice will then be entered in the Land Registry for the respective property.
Pietzschmann himself will come to Empfingen again and get a picture of the situation, she promised.
Gotzel stressed that the participation of the participants was an essential success factor for the project.
That is why there will be questionnaires that will be mailed to citizens in the coming weeks and can be completed by the end of the summer holidays.
The yellow questionnaire is the "building and plot sheet" which deals, among other things, with the building condition and rehabilitation intentions.
In the grey questionnaire, the "budgetary and housing arc," details of the size, division and residents of a living room can be made.
The blue "operation sheet" can only be filled in if business premises are operated in the building.
However, note that Gotzel pointed out that a completed questionnaire is not simultaneously a request for funding.
Moreover, new construction measures are not eligible.
Schindler still stressed that the distribution of funding was operating according to the "grey principle" - whoever comes first, grinds first.
You can't "reserve funding" for later.
Finally, photos of the project "Ortskern II" were shown in order to make the attendees "smackable".
British inventor sets himself a microchip to come in with a hand movement in house and car
A British inventor is the first in the country to be fitted with a microchip so he can open his front door, enter his office and even start his car with a hand movement.
Steven Northam, 33, had implanted the tiny chip between thumb and index finger and is now offering the service to businesses and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology through his company BioTeq.
He has teamed up with Dr Geoff Watson, an advisory anesthesist at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester, Hants, to ensure that the implant procedure is performed according to medical standards.
The technology resembles a cat and dogs implanted microchip and lasts only 30 seconds.
Mr Northam's company also wants to change the locks on homes and cars so they are compatible with the chip, all for an extra charge of £300 per lock.
The married father of one has now installed both at home and at his BMW Z4 technology, which begins when his hand is at the wheel.
White House advertising costs cost taxpayers thousands
The White House's decision to fly a naval helicopter to the South Lawn for an event highlighting American manufacturing last month costs taxpayers up to $24,000, according to the military's data, which was left to TIME magazine.
The green-and-white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One when the president is on board, was the centerpiece of the event on July 17 at the White House with American construction programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and senior White House officials made a tour of products from all 50 states.
The helicopter, made in Connecticut, was issued next to a yacht from Maine, a fire truck from Wisconsin and a forklift truck from Mississippi.
The White House military office demanded the presence of the helicopter in a piecemeal order, or FRAGO, barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn, according to the records of the Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for operating the helicopter.
"I just wanted you to be aware of this because it is such an unusual event with high visibility," the commander of HMX-1 wrote to his superior, the deputy naval commander for aviation, on the eve of the event.
The news showed that the helicopter arrived on the South Lawn at 15 o'clock on 17 July at 7 o'clock in the morning for the event, and until the lawn was cleared between 18:00 and 21:00 this evening.
The note adds that if departure from the White House were to be delayed, a second crew would be required for the return flight because of the restriction of service hours.
The original flight crew was in the helicopter during the event, while the unit's security personnel remained on the ground with the aircraft during the period.
Records provided to TIME did not indicate clearly whether a second flight crew was ultimately required.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using state property for political purposes.
Records show that HMX-1 asked if the event could breach the provision.
"One question we asked was whether it was a violation of the Hatch Act and we were informed that this was not the case," the commander wrote.
"Kling as if you're closed," the deputy commander replied.
The "Made in America" event was designated an official by the White House and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act.
But official events also have political overtones.
At the event, the president gave a push for health care reform, which was underway in the Senate, and he promoted efforts to curb government regulations.
The use of the aircraft, known as Marine One or Air Force One, for politically advantageous purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.
Presidents are required to use them for the trip.
But asking for their use only for photo surgery is unusual.
Trump conducted an investigation in February, when the presidential plane operated taxi services against the backdrop of his first campaign rally in Melbourne, Florida, and his Twitter account is full of messages complaining about his predecessor’s use of the presidential plane.
"The White House is excited about the show "Made In America" -- which showcases products from all 50 states made by American workers using American materials," said White House Deputy Press Secretary Lindsay Walters.
HMX-1 crews often conduct training flights in the area around Washington and the South Lawn to remove the US president at the White House with precise centimetres.
When Trump was at the G20 summit in Germany in early July, HMX-1 led 58 practice landings at the White House.
The flight for the "Made in America" event counted in the flight crew's training needs for the month, an official said.
Helicopter units flew an additional 11 hours that day for "non-presidential support missions."
The White House said taxpayers did not take on the burden for any of the other props presented at the event.
A spokesman for Sikorsky said the company was not involved in putting out the helicopter on the South Lawn.
HMX-1 does not maintain budget records for presidential flights, and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event.
However, according to hourly tariffs by the US Department of Defense for the fiscal year 2017, the VH-3D refund rate is $24,380 per hour of flight.
Records of the unit recorded the plane's flight time as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Facility at Quantico in Virginia.
The White House argues that the actual cost of operating the helicopter is far below that rate.
"To set the cost to taxpayers based on the estimates for reimbursement rates is highly misleading," Walters said.
"These estimates include staffing, maintenance and many other hidden costs included in the annual funds."
According to a 2015 RAND study, reimbursement rates for DoD do not include staffing costs, but take into account the cost of fuel, maintenance and contracting.
At that time, former White House press secretary Sean Spicer defended the helicopter's use for the event.
"The idea is to present this week things that are made in America," Spicer said.
"And I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud that they contribute to our national security, and I assume that hundreds, if not thousands, of people depend on it.
And I think, like most Americans, we're all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked tirelessly.
It is, of course, appropriate to emphasise this."
It was not clear whether Trump interacted with the helicopter as he entered his tour of the South Lawn for the event, but he sat in the driver's seat of a fire truck.
At the White House, Trump addressed Sikorsky and joked with the media about his own fleet of corporate products.
"I know Sikorsky very well," the president said, "I have three of them."
TC BW news ahead of tricky task
Top rider of the Second Tennis League competes at Tablendritten Suchsdorfer SV.
The TC Blau-Weiss Neuss will be joining the Tablendritten Suchdorfer SV tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Despite five matches of still impeccable record, the top seed of the Second Tennis League has given himself the sense of reality.
Team leader Marius Zay certainly has respect for the opponent.
"This is a compact team that always plays in fairly similar formation.
It is precisely on the rear positions that I find the team very good."
Imports from the far north provide for class and stability at the Suchsdorfer SV.
"Their Danes and Finns can even point to bets in the Davis Cup.
And they're also strong in doubles," says Zay, overlooking Harri Heliovaara (Finland), Andre Göransson (Sweden), Sören and Esben Oread, Martin Pedersen and Andreas Bjerrehus (all Denmark).
"This will, as always, be hard for us.
You need a good dose of happiness.'
The Neuss crew for the trip to the far north is handy.
His debut for blue-and-white could be maxim Janvier.
If the Frenchman, who is currently still active in the Challenger tournament in Biella, does not become a Bundesliga member, Zdenek Kolar (Czech Republic) will play in the tournament in the Czech Liberec.
The undefeated Chilean Hans Podlipnik-Castillo was still on the ball with Belarusian Andrei Vasilevski at the ATP tournament in Kitzbühel yesterday.
He should be present in Kiel as well as Botic Van de Zandschulp, Niels Lootsma (both Netherlands) and the Belgian Julien Cagnina.
After his two victories last Sunday against the club at the Alster, Máté Valkusz could also return to the team.
If it is not enough for 18-year-old Hungary, who was still the number one junior world ranking in January 2016, someone from the coaching staff around Marius Zay is filling up the caddie.
How America Can Damage OMV
Donald Trump was not really happy when he signed the law Wednesday night tightening sanctions on Russia.
"In its rush to enact the law," Congress wrapped up a few "unconstitutional regulations," he insisted.
The reaction from Moscow was as sharp as expected, too, and even Brussels balked at the US push.
After all, the draft provides for punishing European companies that help Russians build gas pipelines to the EU.
Accordingly, investors from local OMV, which, together with other European companies, is co-financing the construction of the Russian Baltic pipeline Nord Stream 2.
The drone is huge.
Nevertheless, it is too early to assess the consequences, according to the oil company's official statement.
Indeed, Donald Trump himself would have to bring the sanctions to life by executive order.
Twelve weapons are at his disposal.
"The Press" has looked at which the corporation could fend off and which could really hurt it.
Narco's Season 3 trailer: Without Pablo Escobar, the Cali Cartel will be central to Netflix's hit series
Despite Narcos' second season exposing Pablo Escobar's killer, the Netflix series is far from over.
Seasons three and four have already been confirmed by the streaming service, the first received its first trailer and showed the show's latest villains.
With the third season, the DEA turned its attention to the world’s richest organization of drug trafficking: the Cali cartel.
Led by four powerful punters, they operate "like a Fortune 500 company" only with more government bribes and violent actions.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) is the leader of the cartel, Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) is her head, Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) commands the Mexican compound, and Chepe Santacruz Londono (Pepe Rapazote) is located in New York.
In the newly released trailer, Pedro Pascal returns as Javier Peña, the type who invites American and Colombian law enforcement officials to support the war on drugs.
Other new actors include Matias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishe and Arturo Castro.
The third season of Narcos will begin on September 1.
Role backwards: The city is providing 46 kitchen aids
The town organizes the kita lunch table itself again.
With fixed contacts for children and a team assignment.
In city daycare centers, the clock is turned back.
On September 1, the city of Krefeld takes care of food in the municipal day-care facilities (Kitas).
For Sonja Pommeranz, Deputy Head of the Department of Youth Aid, this is good news: "We were all very pleased."
A caterer takes over this task and delivers freshly cooked chilled.
The town operates 46 day-care centres in the Krefeld area, and in 44 children get a warm meal at lunch time.
In the past kita year, 2800 children sat at the tables each, and demand is growing.
"Mittlerweile not only eat children who are cared for 45 hours of the week, in the kita for lunch," Pommeranz explained.
"The offer also applies to 35-hour care if children stay until 14."
From 1 September, 46 part-time staff will have kitchen services: they will warm the dishes supplied, supplement them with salad, raw food and fruit, individually portion the meal, give out the food, vacate, rinse and clean the kitchen.
"The employees are firmly assigned to a kita," says Pommeranz.
The size - there are two-group as well as seven-group facilities - decides the amount of hours.
"The kitchen assistants are now firmly part of the kita team," Pommeranz says satisfied.
"So they're much more involved and it's easier for kita leaders to implement pedagogical concepts."
It is also about healthy eating and cooking lessons.
"The children are supposed to help prepare the food."
The direct connection of kitchen power to the team makes sense.
For the children, too.
"They have a known force in the kita, a person familiar to them, and not constantly changing people."
This continuity is important for children.
The cleaning of the kita rooms - previously also the task of kitchen staff - will in future be done by special cleaning staff.
This variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - has, in addition to improving the quality of kitchen performance, the charm it has proved to be the most economical in the comparison between self-catering and third-party lending for the city, according to the press office.
And that's despite 46 part-time workers being rehired.
"But those hours don't fall at all in the weight of around 750 people in the education sector," says Sonja Pommeranz.
Afghan democracy depends on women's political role, UN says
Elections can only be representative if all members of society, including women, play a role, the head of the UN mission in Afghanistan said Wednesday.
Nicholas Haysom, acting head of the United Nations mission, said that hundreds of women will run in the council elections in the provinces, with three women running for the role of vice president and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters being women.
"The role of women cannot be overestimated," he said Wednesday in a statement.
Elections can only be truly representative and credible if women participate fully and are involved in all parts of the electoral process.
Afghan elections for the provincial council and presidential elections take place on April 5.
The Taliban have released threats against an election process that coincides with the transition from international combat to an advisory role.
This year, for the first time, elections will hand power peacefully from one democratically elected government to the next.
Haysom said a strong role for women will enhance Afghanistan's democratic success.
The Afghan Independent Election Commission reports that 1.2 million women are registered from a total of 3.6 million voters.

Men try to rob 13-year-old girl
Two young men, aged 19 and 23, were reportedly trying to deprive a 13-year-old girl on Thursday.
According to police, the men spoke to the 13-year-old, who was staying with friends at Kolping Road, at around 14.55, because they wanted to phone the girl's phone.
The 13-year-old refused the request, however, and went on to talk with her friends.
As a result, one of the offenders tried to grab the girl's cell phone and necklace, but that failed.
Without prey, the duo fled.
The two young men were later arrested by police.
The investigation is ongoing.
GMB concerns over investment in McVision factory in Glasgow
A union wants to reassure managers of the biscuit manufacturer McVitie about the long-term commitment to production at their factory in Glasgow.
GMB Scotland said the company was silent about the future of investments at the Tollcross site.
More than 500 employees work at the plant, which produces Hobnobs and Rich Tea biscuits, among other products.
McVities owner Pladis said he had invested more than £5 million in recent years.
He added that staff and union representatives would "be the first to know" if their activities were to change.
In a letter to the company's branch manager, GMB Scotland asked McVitie's to "speak concerns that funding for the modernisation of production lines is not being pushed forward."
GMB senior organizer Drew Duffy, said: "The fact that we can't gain clarity from the general site manager about the business needs and investment plans for the future of Tollcross affects our members deeply.
Generations of families have worked here and the workforce is heavily focused on the local community and the wider Glasgow area, an important pillar of decent employment in an area with high unemployment and social deprivation.
Therefore, from the perspective of jobs, wages and welfare, and against the backdrop of Brexit, rising cost of living and chronic output decline, the east end of Glasgow urgently needs a thriving manufacturing presence at McVitie."
A spokeswoman for Pladis said: "The store manager at Tollcross only received a letter from GMB Scotland yesterday and the company will respond directly as we appreciate the continued engagement with staff and union representatives.
Two months ago, we had a regular meeting with employees and GMB representatives at Tollcross, at which some questions were openly discussed.
We discussed with the employees that, like all companies operating in a highly competitive and uncertain economic climate, we are constantly reviewing our business - and this applies to all our divisions and locations - in order to remain competitive.
She added: "In recent years we have invested more than £5 million in our Tollcross site, particularly in production lines and operational improvements.
We fully recognise the heritage of Tollcross as a production site, and if our operations change at the site, the employees and their union representatives will be the first to know this."
Did PSG alert Barcelona to Neymar three years ago?
La Liga side may regret their interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain will not let up in their pursuit of Neymar after they made an offer of £189 million to trigger his release clause, but did they warn Barcelona three years ago of the world record breach?
The sensational approach has fuelled the transfer window in the summer as the Ligue 1 club are poised to break the world record by more than double the previous mark, with Paul Pogba returning to Manchester United last season for £89 million.
After finishing, Neymar becomes the most expensive player in the world and the highest-paid professional sportsman in the world.PSG offers wages of more than £500,000 a week.
Barcelona are furious at the way Neymar has forced his way out, although a source close to the Catalan board insists the club has always done its best to care for him since arriving from Santos in 2013.
But was the football world warned of this prospect by the PSG president three years ago?
When Manchester City expressed interest in signing Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi had a stern warning for any club who wanted to sign one of PSG's best players.
"I'm not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players then we will be in opposition to them, we will contact their players," Al-Khelaifi said.
"We respect all clubs.
But if they try to have one of our players sign with them, that will have consequences."
Barcelona appear to have crossed that line, with the Spanish club expressing interest in the PSG midfielder Marco Verratti earlier this summer.
PSG made it clear that they would not allow the International from Italy to depart under any circumstances, and Barcelona could feel the consequences of that interest by losing one of their price offers to Neymar.
Roller reversed and damaged

Interview: 'Domspatz report exonerates Pope brother Georg Ratzinger'
The Regensburger Domspatzen report on the abuse cases relieves Pope brother Georg Ratzinger.
According to author and historian Michael Hesemann.
The final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen continues to spark debate.
Christian Weisnder, spokesman for the Reform movement "We are Church", said after publication to the German Press Agency that he expects an apology from the former Regensburg Bishop and present Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as from the Cathedral Chapel master Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of the emeritus Benedict XVI.
It would greatly serve the reputation of the Catholic Church if Müller and Ratzinger expressed their deep regret at their own omissions or their false assessment of what was happening at the time.
The Vatican newspaper Osservatore Romano, on the other hand, criticised the fact that when reporting on violence at the cathedral spies it was measured with "double standards."
Regarding the assaults in Regensburg, no one doubts that they are "disgraceful and shameful acts" that must be punished and prevented in the future; however, it is striking to note the "degree of media manipulation," according to the author Lucetta Scaraffia, historian and member of Italy's national bioethics committee.
"The habit of describing the Catholic Church as a source of all evil is already part of everyday experience and preparing public opinion to consider this to be normal," writes Scaraffia.
Also in the interview with Bayerischer Rundfunk, Princess Gloria von Thurn und Taxis said: "You like to go to the church and this is a found meal".
She also pointed out that in her youth, "slathering was a very normal educational tool" "to deal with cheeky children, like I was one."
They would find it unfair to apply today’s standards to previous decades, because the world has changed.
Pope brother Georg Ratzinger often appeared in connection with reports of abuse.
Quite wrongly, according to the author and historian Michael Hesemann, who wrote with Ratzinger the memoir "My Brother of the Pope" (translated in 12 languages).
"I have to protect Georg Ratzinger," says Hesemann, "because all that had nothing to do with him," he assesses the results of the final report.
What exactly is in the 440-page report presented by lawyer Ulrich Weber, appointed by the diocese of Regensburg to investigate?
A total of 547 Regensburg Cathedral patties were sexually abused between 1945 and the early 1990s "with high plausibility" victims of assaults, 67 dompatches.
The final report says to Georg Ratzinger, who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994: "In summary, it can therefore be said that in many cases forms of physical and psychological violence were used by Domkapellmeister R.
Particularly in the case of high emotionality, the punishment could be more severe for the students.
Nevertheless, unlike many other defendants, it is striking that many victims appreciated the general humanity of R. and therefore in many cases, despite violence, even associate positive memories with him."
In the interview Hesemann explains why he believes the final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger relieves the burden.
Mr Hesemann, the 440-page report on the "incidents of violent acts on guards at the Regensburger Domspatzens" gives a contradictory picture of cathedral master Georg Ratzinger.
For one thing, many students highlight his "humanity."
On the other hand, he also appears as a cholera and perfectionist, who often became tangible when a domicile musically failed to bring top performance.
How do you as his biographer view this final report?
Michael Hesemann: If you take the trouble and read the entire 440-page report from front to back, you have to ask yourself why the name Georg Ratzinger actually appears in it.
He has just eight pages dedicated to him and he is clearly acquitted of any suspicion of complicity or complicity in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.
The excesses of violence at preschool also occurred outside its sphere of influence.
At best, he can be accused of learning about it too late or of not taking initial suggestions seriously enough.
The Domspatzengymnasium on which it worked was perceived by virtually all respondents as - literally - "redemption", "sky" and "better world".
For example, the vast majority of his students Georg Ratzinger gives an excellent testimony, describing him as "warm-hearted," "liked," "sincere," "competent" and "understandable," as an extremely good-natured teacher who regularly supplied the boys with cakes, biscuits and candies and was "always surrounded by grapes of children."
Only a minority complains about his perfectionism and high emotionality, which has sometimes led to riots.
He confessed years ago, deeply regretted and apologized for the fact that he not only punched with chairs and threw the keybone on the floor, but also distributed and drew overly cheeky guys on his hair or ears.
To his salvation of honour, however, it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the period in question, the 1960s and 1970s, both in parents and in teachers.
Do you know any more of these addictive methods?
Of course, I think every one of us born before 1968.
I too have experienced this in a secular school, a state grammar school.
Compared to what this report is really about, namely the appalling sexual abuse and the excesses of violence at pre-school, these are, of course, bagatelles.
One wonders whether it is not more to do with his notoriety and his role as brother of Benedict XVI that many media have just rushed to him.
Many of those who never understood him are still working diligently on the Bavarian Pope.
The truth, though, is that the report exonerates Georg Ratzinger in every respect!
Much has been reported in the media in connection with the report on the subject of abuse at the Regensburger Domspatzen.
Will Georg Ratzinger be accused of any involvement or complicity in sexual abuse in the final report?
Michael Hesemann: Clearly no.
Not one of the 67 victims of sexual assault claims to have been entrusted to the cathedral bandmaster.
Not even the parents were inaugurated.
"I never dared to talk to my father or my mother about it," one concerned deputy said to the others, "It was all very embarrassing to me."
The real problem with investigating sexual abuse was, and is, that most victims remain silent out of shame.
If they did not even entrust themselves to parents and siblings, it would certainly not be a choral conductor who, after all, would have been a colleague of the perpetrators at work.
How do the domicile students assess Ratzinger's role in the abuse cases?
Michael Hesemann: As one student in question put it: "With regard to sexual abuse ... I do not see ... a case in which it is precisely he (Georg Ratzinger) could have had timely findings and stopped the perpetrator.
I also find it really absurd to assume that it is exactly him ... Jacks have opened up more forcefully or more clearly, or even more so, than their parents, boarding schools, trust teachers, etc.
That you talk to him about sex... - unthinkable."
The report therefore comes to the very clear conclusion: 'The fact that pupils and/or their environments were entrusted to him in advance could not be confirmed in the course of the investigation'.
As far as sexual abuse is concerned, Georg Ratzinger is therefore free from any complicity.
Nor can he be accused of not preventing it or of being advertised.
There is therefore no reason to associate his good name with these repugnant crimes, as has unfortunately happened in some cases.
Much has been read in the media of "violent excess" at the Regensburg Cathedral pat-downs.
Former cathedral master Georg Ratzinger is accused in the report of "walking."
Does he have to live with this accusation?
Michael Hesemann: After all, this is the big problem that in the reporting everything was mixed and mixed into a huge melange of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere, right in the middle of it, Georg Ratzinger.
But that, in turn, is an abuse of the report.
After all, there is a neat separation: between the pre-school and the grammar school of the domicile, between sexual abuse and excesses of violence and, let us say, other accusations.
In addition, the report deals with incidents from the period since 1945, including four decades in which Georg Ratzinger was not the conductor of the Cathedral patties.
The whole dreadful pedagogy, the cases in which boys of sadistic teachers were literally harassed and tortured and suffered appallingly, all occurred at the pre-school in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where truly scandalous conditions had to prevail.
But cathedral master Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do with them, because he only got to face the boys when they were already on the Cathedral Patzengymnasium.
On that, as the vast majority of witnesses stress, the subject of "preschool" was taboo.
One was only happy to have escaped her and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even "paradise" conditions.
What was different on the Domspatzengymnasium?
Michael Hesemann: There was discipline, but no sadistic violence.
And this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, in which the report concludes that "many victims appreciated the general humanity of R., and therefore in many cases even positive memories are associated with him despite violence."
At most, this leaves the accusation of looking the other way.
But despite all the efforts, the report could only define two periods in which it was reported the conditions at preschool.
The first time in 1970/71, when he was just starting to establish himself, he did not want to hear anything about what was going on at a school at which he did not act and was responsible (so the witness) and then again around 1993.
Did Georg Ratzinger consistently lock his ears before the conditions?
Michael Hesemann: No, because back in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Cathedral Patzengymnasium, which the report even reproduces.
In it, he points this out "that caning continues in preschool."
Even in view of the risk of negative press releases, he recommended urgent intervention.
This was, of course, at a time when there was legal clarity, when caning penalties were already banned in Bavaria.
Before that, they occurred in a legal grey area, as we all know.
It was also difficult for him to assess where the people concerned were perhaps exaggerated or dramatised and where the permitted limit had really been exceeded.
Nor can we say that he has always looked the other way.
That is simply not true.
It was only in 1980 that caning in schools was officially abolished in Bavaria as well.
Princess Gloria von Thurn und Taxis claimed that it was unfair to apply today's educational standards to the time.
How do you see that?
Michael Hesemann: We historians talk about the "fall trick of anachronism", that is, the danger of judging the past according to today's moral standards.
The princess is right.
But this does not, of course, apply to sexual abuse, which has been abhorrent at all times, nor to what was reported in preschool of repugnance and violence to innocent children's souls, which goes far beyond what was common then.
That's all quite horrible and I'm glad it's finally being worked out.
But at the same time I have to protect Georg Ratzinger, because all that had nothing to do with him.
His means of disciplining and punishing, so slapping and pulling on the hair and ears, were widespread in the 1970s.
When corporal punishment was then banned, he also adhered strictly to it.
What image of his Regensburger period did Georg Ratzinger give in conversations with you for the book "My Brother the Pope"?
Was the issue of caning also raised?
Michael Hesemann: Well, the book is about the life of his brother Joseph, that is, Pope Benedict XVI, telling from his perspective, as the domiciles played only a supporting role.
Nevertheless, I do not conceal the fact that he was leading a strict regiment there.
But this, too, must be said: without this perfectionism, without demanding absolute discipline, it would hardly have been possible for him to form a world-class institution from the hitherto more nationally known Regensburger Domspatzens, true cultural ambassadors of Europe and his musical tradition, which went on tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).
With biscuits and candies alone, you don't make big singers out of recalcitrant kneecaps and stand before every success, no matter what field, but always discipline, passion and self-absorption.
As what kind of person did you see Georg Ratzinger in conversations about her book?
Michael Hesemann: Through the work on the book and beyond, I really got to know Georg Ratzinger very well and experienced him again and again as a wonderful, humorous, gracious, deeply believed and heartfelt person, from whom one cannot imagine that he could do anything even on a fly.
I regularly get to know how many former cathedral patrons still have contact with him today, 23 years after his emeritus, visit him, read him - he is almost blind - and treat him like a member of their family.
So those who have not forgiven him for once being strict with them are clearly in the minority.
Today most domiciles are grateful to him for enriching their lives and bringing the world of music to them.
And that he was always a good, paternal teacher - a strict father, certainly, that may be - but also an adorable person of respect to whom they still look up today and who they almost worship.
And I would like to make it quite clear once again that all they are accused of is educational methods, which were the order of the day at the time.
We can be pleased that we have long since overcome this period.
But it is highly unjust to make a man, just because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother, a media scapegoat.
The evil intention behind this is all too obvious.
Because the report just released relieves it.
Now the decency would dictate that a 93-year-old man who has earned a great deal of credit and, without the outside of Bavaria and perhaps even Germany, probably no one would know the Regensburger Domspatzen would finally be left in peace.
