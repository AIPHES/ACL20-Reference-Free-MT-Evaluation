Munich, 1856: Four cards that change your views of the city 
A Lunatic asylum, where the youth of today want to encounter.
A crypt chapel, where now for the S-Bahn Tunnel is dug.
Small gardener to farm, the former base of farmers.
The oldest official map of Munich promotes exciting stories.
It is not annoying, if the maps are up to date.
Everyone had to get upset ever know, because the car-Navi display instead of a bypass road on a green Meadow.
The historical maps of the digital Bavaria-Atlas, a service of the Geoportal of Bavaria, the state government, are anything other than currently - but that's precisely why very enlightening.
Especially if you compare it with the current Online maps.
Then it becomes clear how cities and municipalities in the distribution area of the Münchner Merkur since the 19th century. Century have changed.
The digital Bavaria-the Atlas is a patchwork that you do not recognize as such.
In the large overview map a more detailed maps for cities and municipalities, so-called to its original position leaves, incorporated.
These were created according to the Bavarian surveying administration between 1810 and 1864, and spring of the first Survey of Bavaria.
Your Client: Napoleon.
The French commander of the army and occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800, during the Second coalition war with Austria.
Napoleon wished to have an Overview of the occupied country and gave a topographic recording of Bavaria, in order, of course, for military purposes.
Even if the French troops with the peace of Lunéville of 9. February 1801 withdrew finally: today's neighbours, have created the idea of a comprehensive, Bavaria map.
The Prince elector Max IV Joseph drove the project, founded by the "Topographical Bureau" - and thus the Bavarian surveying administration.
The to its original position the sheet for Munich dates back to the year 1856, and is like all the others on the website of the Bavarian state library.
The comparison with Earlier/Today on the example of the capital, the most impressive.
The city has expanded in all directions and grow together.
An example of this is sub-Sendling, which appears isolated in the map of 1856 is still relatively.
Sendling was incorporated 21 years after the creation of the map, so in 1877, as a district of Munich.
Today is under Sendling in the middle of the city.
The houses under the sendlings focus to 1856 along the present plinganser street, which was named in 1878 by Georg Sebastian Plinganser, a leader of the uprising of the Bavarian peasants against Austria in 1705.
Where today, the Park is, there is nothing but fields on the first view: When you zoom In a smaller-scale map, with dozens of lines and Figures, with hand-written numbered parcels from the so-called "Uraufnahme," the property tax has been derived is displayed.
Small parcels and documents there today, no farmers, but gardeners, the plant "Land of the sun".
A large green area is to the North of Sendling.
The Theresienwiese since 1810, Oktoberfest grounds, was in the 19th century. Century, in fact, still a Meadow - and no concrete desert.
On the other side of the river Isar, the historic map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.
In to its original position the sheet in the area of today's district of Au-Haidhausen is not only the name of the street "am Gasteig" or of the hill "On the Air" - but also in large letters, "Lunatic asylum".
Yes, here at the Auer field road locked once people with delusions.
There, the Munich circle-lunatic asylum was born 1858/59 "On the Auer Ventilate".
Starting from 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden headed the establishment - the psychiatrist who is brought in connection with the death of king Ludwig II.
"He was progressive for its time and ended, for example, the Chaining of the so-called Wrong.
Besides, he says of the staff, violence against inmates," said Hermann Wilhelm, head of the Museum, Haidhausen, which has a exhibition with the institution.
For 280 patients was initially have been, it was later expanded to 500 seats.
Eventually, this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the circle lunatic asylum in hair in 1905.
The Isar-Amper-Klinikum Munich, since 2006 East, is one of the largest mental hospitals in Germany.
On the Site of the former Auer institution young people face now in the Munich Salesianum.
The order acquired the building complex in 1920 and transformed it into a youth centre with training companies.
To the West of the football is the square of the TSV München Ost, to the East of residential houses from the 1980s.
In 2015 we built the children's house "Casa Don Bosco" - an architectural reference to the original building of the insane asylum that was destroyed in the Second world war bomb attacks.
The Marienplatz was registered in 1856 as the "main square", the Kaufinger street was called "Kaufinger Gasse".
A crucial change in the Second world war brought also in the heart of Munich.
The bombs of the allies cracks in December 1944, many of the holes in the center.
A large remained until today - at the Marienhof.
The English Institute, small business houses and a crypt chapel Dating from the middle ages once stood at the Marienhof, where these days the preparatory work and at the 5. April 2017, the ground-breaking ceremony for the second S-Bahn trunk line.
With the slider the old Munich-map with the aerial image of today to compare and the hole at the Marienhof fill.
The civil rights group released a travel warning for Missouri
The National Association for the advancement of Colored has issued a warning for people of color, due to the discriminatory policies and the racist attacks of the state, according to the Missouri travel.
"The NAACP Travel Advisory for the state of Missouri, up to 28. August of 2017, is expected to enter into force, calls on African-American travelers, visitors, and Missourianer, when traveling through the state special attention and exercise extreme caution, as a number of questionable, race-based incidents in recent times, in the entire state occur and be noted", - stated in the opinion of the group.
A recently passed law in Missouri that makes it harder to win discrimination lawsuits, as well as the law enforcement authorities of the state, which are aimed disproportionately at minorities, led the group, the travel alert, said the NAACP.
"You have to pass civil rights violations, the people.
They are stopped because of the color of their skin, they are beaten or killed," said the President of the Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, the Kansas City Star.
"We hear complaints in such a frequency, we have not heard yet."
It is the first such warning issued by the organization for a state in the United States.
The group cited incidents of racial crimes against black student at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died under questionable circumstances at the beginning of the year, after he has had while traveling through the state not a gas, and of the police of Missouri detained without being accused of a crime.
The Council also points to a recent report from the office of the attorney General of Missouri, in which it is shown that black motorists are stopped in the state, 75 percent more often than White.
"The recommendation is that the people are not aware of and their families, friends, and employees to learn about what could happen in Missouri," said Chapel.
"People need to be ready, whether it will bring bail money, or the Relatives know that you are traveling through the state."
Missouri recorded in 2015 100 hate crime, according to the latest Figures from the hate crime reporting program of the FBI, the state in relation to the number of such injuries on the 16. Rank of the country.
The travel warning is also a response to a new Missouri law that would make it more difficult for a company to sue for housing or employment discrimination.
Previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) travel warnings for Texas and Arizona, had issued after the States had adopted immigration laws, the local law enforcement authorities to arrest people for immigration violations, which will contribute to the view of the ACLU to further racial profiling.
Travel warnings are usually issued by the foreign Ministry of other countries, but in the last times of the measure have used interest groups as a reaction to certain laws, and Trends within the United States.
Pasture fence project is elementary
The fishing Bacher pasture fence project is a success and will be continued in the coming year.
The CDU Bundestag members Peter White and Kordula Kovac have gained a picture.
When you right-grabenhof the family Schwendemann representatives of the fishermen Bacher CDU met-mobile bands along with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two deputies.
Markus Schwendemann granted the first insights into its operation, in the meadows of 55 hectares and 40 hectares of forest managed, 40 milk cows and as many young animals supplied and in five apartments for holiday guests.
The "black forest milk" for him is the alternative channel to market for the milk of his cows, so Schwendemann.
On the table of the guests exclusively Regional.
He is also BLHV-Chairman of Fischer's Bach, he referred to the fence project as a "fundamentally important".
I can't economies on such steep land at a profit.
The green country area of concern for a lot of work, a lot more has to be edited with the brushcutter.
"We have to fight with the conditions and with the topography," said Schwendemann.
In 2003, he took over the family business, and cultivate without chemical pesticides and fertilizers, even if he does not mention any organic farm.
For mayor Thomas Schneider was clear: "The municipality has recognized the importance of the pasture fence project and is glad to have the Leader support".
At a cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare, farmers would have to be supported.
It was hoped that the afforestation of the surfaces could still be a while out.
"The greatest treasure we have are the people who work in agriculture, and worrying about how you will bring your operation to continue", stressed the mayor.
The farmers are because of the support often the subject of criticism
Over the pasture fence promotion were fenced in the year 2013, a total of 25 plots out of the eleven participants.
The open area is 40 hectares, which should not be afforested up to at least 2023.
Of the total cost in the amount of 71 500 euros, half of which was funded by Leader, a quarter wore the municipality of Fischer Creek.
This left the farmers 12 610 Euro, you had to invest in the 16.2-Kilometer fence.
"The big advantage is the longevity of the fences," said Schwendemann.
Kordula Kovac said: "you don't do a really good Job, without farmers and the country women".
Also, for Peter was White: "Here, the best foods are produced".
The landscape management Directive (LPR) of Baden-Württemberg allows for the state support of pasture fences.
Aim of the open attitude of the black forest.
A prerequisite is the presence of a of the LPC-designated funding backdrop.
In addition, the einzuzäunende surface must not be threatened by trawling heritage is managed, be liable (a slope inclination of about 35 per cent) and to the reforestation.
For the fishermen Bacher pasture fence project in 2018, the application of the eight participants, with 24 parcels of land to just build a 16 km fence.
The open area is 35 hectares, the calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros.
Is nothing sacred anymore?
Now, the White house, Trump takes a look at the statue of liberty 
The first signs of a Regime change, it is when you start to attack the statues.
The Americans appreciate this, as well as any other - hence, the carefully staged toppling of Saddam Hussein in the Firdos square in Baghdad in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologues of the Trump regime, certainly knew what he was doing when he took on a symbolic axe in a heated argument with Jim Acosta of CNN about the President's proposals for the drastic reduction of legal immigration with the statue of liberty.
To be fair, Miller the Statue itself is not attacked.
A Horde of boat owners and Liberty-imitators would have had him lynched if he had done it.
But he attacked their meaning, and, in particular, the importance that was attributed to her, as the famous poem by Emma Lazarus in 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, its base was added.
As Miller Acosta scolded: "I don't want to go into a full thing about the story, but the freedom statue, a Symbol of American freedom that enlightens the world.
The poem to which you refer, which was added later and not part of the original freedom statue."
Miller is factually correct, but, as he put it, it's not really about history.
It is the contemporary response to the stirring words of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state is not inviting just any old immigrants, but the Poorest of the poor: "Your Tired, your poor, / your huddled masses, yearning yearning to breathe free, / the wretched waste from your teeming shore."
There was never a time in which the "wretched waste" was to be seen on our screens the better.
Miller is not engaged in literary criticism, he made it clear that these people in Trumps USA are welcome.
This conflict is due to the meaning of a Statue is part of a broader political and cultural conflict: It is in fact a conflict about the meaning of America.
Lazarus, and their friends, struggling to place her words after her death to the base - knew very well that they performed a highly political act.
The sculpture was to show the Connections between French and American republicanism, and presenting in a well-worn classic pictorial representation of the female personification of freedom.
Lazarus changed this meaning: In your poem the female figure is no longer abstract - it has been given a voice.
And she gives herself a different name: mother of exiles.
The connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist Coup, and a devastating attack on American Nativism.
And just like Lazarus, the meaning of the Statue changed, wanted to change the people from the right wing this a long time back.
The big Yeller Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the Coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that the statue of liberty to invite anyone, but rather an early neo-conservative was brought by the American flame in the benighted world: "Lady Liberty goes forward.
You should carry the torch of freedom of the United States in the Rest of the world.
The torch is not to light the way in the United States."
Quite unusual Limbaugh's might be onto something.
The importance of the Statue is entirely a question of the point of view of perception.
The great imaginative act of Lazarus was to see them as she was of the exhausted, miserable, but hopeful people, after long and often terrible travelling on the Decks of ships seen.
It is in the truest sense, therefore, to see the world from the perspective of people who seek refuge and a Chance to improve your life.
To speak your Statue to you the words of hope and of the coming, the you need to wants to hear.
And of course that is not the perspective to acknowledge Miller, and the Trump ever.
Your torch is not to light the way, but the hatred that is their only source of Power, ignite.
World Cup 2017: Neil Black praised Scottish members of the team from the UK
Eilidh Doyle remembers a time when only two Scots were part of the Team of great Britain 
The performance Director of the athletics of the United Kingdom, Neil Black, says that the 16-strong Scottish contingent in the world Cup squad "will make a massive contribution to the Team".
A record number of Scottish athletes selected for London 2017, which starts on Friday.
Black believes that "in Scotland, something Special is developing," and the athletics of the United Kingdom something have to learn of it.
"We welcome it, and we try to understand, and we will continue until we figure it out," said Black.
"I talk to people in the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think that it has something to do with what you have done.
The Scottish athletes think that it has something to do with what you have done.
British athletics: It has something to do with what you have done.
And also with the guy on the street corner.
Whatever the combination of circumstances, it is absolutely brilliant."
Several of the Scottish athletes, medal contenders, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart will compete against Sir Mo Farah in the 5,000 m distance, while Eilidh Doyle was elected by the team to the captain of the team.
"Eilidh is quite modest.
Your captain's speech was incredible," says Black.
"A number of athletes, regardless of whether you were Scots, or wherever they live or train, walked out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated.
The passion and the genuine feeling that won Eilidh, quite naturally, were great."
The Commonwealth silver medal winner of the Championships in their fifth world in the 400 m hurdles will compete, says that it is "unbelievable" that there are 16 Scots in the British team.
Scotland's best-ever total number of athletes at the world championship was reached seven, the 1983 and 2015.
The middle-distance runner Muir leads this way and has established in the past year, five British and two European records.
You will participate in races in the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m.
Chris O'hare, running 1,500 metres, is another Scot, one should observe after a great season that included victory at the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games.
Doyle recalls her first world Championships, as the only other Scot in the Team, Lee McConnell.
The team captain says that she's "enormously proud" of the fact that many of their countrymen-not just from the Team, but in some cases, the medals and the Finals will be involved.
"The special thing about it is the Team to be captain, that she was elected by the other members of the team, so that it anyway was a great honor, but to know that my teammates voted for me, and I have chosen, makes it something very Special for me," she added.
"Obviously I'm very proud of all the Scots that belong to the Team.
It just shows how far we have come.
And are you here as an established athlete, athletes, who want to climb podiums.
What affects my speech as captain?
Yes, I think it went well.
I was just pointing out that we are in this Situation is very happy, because we have a home world Cup.
So it's really important to put on this home with support and to benefit from the fact that we are back in the Olympic stadium.
I get a second Chance, go out there and compete and it will be a great atmosphere out there."
Block from critics, via Facebook: do not Apply to a public office, if you can tolerate the Heat of voters can
The father of our country knew something of a bad press.
The Americans loved George Washington, but it wasn't long until the Newspapers beat him for everything from domestic policy to his political principles.
He railed at the criticism, sure.
But he did not put his critics to Silence.
Because in the year 1783, Washington said: "The freedom of speech can be taken away and, dumb and silent we may be led, like sheep to the slaughter."
Which brings me to Maryland Governor Larry Hogan, who has to work to be more like Washington.
Hogan's employees have blocked the posts of at least 450 people and deleted, which have expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page.
And the American Civil Liberties Union sued him for it at the beginning of this week.
The staff of the Governor, dismissed the action as frivolous, and the Online comment was a response with "so what?" .
"It's just Facebook", said a lot of people.
But it is important.
And it is especially important if it is a guy like Hogan.
This is a Republican Governor in a overwhelmingly democratic state, which is amazingly popular.
He has the second highest approval of the 50 governors of the Nation.
Hogan is not a reactionary hothead.
He has shown a firm Hand in the leadership of the state and strict compliance with the principles.
He was also very adept to take advantage of Facebook as a primary means to connect to his constituents and to debut playing his bald head after chemotherapy on his side.
Therefore, the blocking of people on the side of the Governor - which is a public Forum, which will be referred to as officially and of employees, paid with public tax-Dollars - unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
In an Interview with The Washington Post Hogan's spokeswoman Amelia Chasse defended the actions of the Governor and argued that the blocking of comments was nothing more than a Moderation.
But it is too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hate-filled people, the online the whip swing.
The Post spoke with some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.
And the only real people who can speak with their elected leaders: a teacher, a businessman and a pastor, no trolls.
They all said that your comments respectful, thoughtful and not profane.
The pastor quoted the Bible in his Post and appealed to Hogan's Catholic Faith.
Attorney-at-law Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., was not hateful, but you asked for hate crimes.
"I commented politely that I was disappointed that there was no response to hate crimes and other current news," she wrote in the comment section of the news broadcast, "The Post".
"I guess this idea also, if a number of people on the same topic to take a position, then you will be disrespected by some rather than a so-called collective use, and not as a large group of concerned citizens recognized".
What is referred to the staff of the Governor as a "concentrated Spam attack", others would probably call "intercession".
The Facebook Era makes it easy, a message tailor-made by easily blocked, a critic or a negative comment will be deleted.
It is much cleaner than in the past, if you would have done the same, that employees were sent to collect Newspapers with critical editorials and burn, or to arrest the protesters and to Silence.
But that's exactly what's happening the digital.
Hogan is not the first public official who is criticized for the fact that he has insulted Facebook and other social media.
President Trump is being sued by Twitter users were blocked from his Twitter Feed.
One of the first milestones in this question fell last week in Virginia.
The Chairman of the Board of Supervisors of Loudoun County violated the First Amendment, according to U.S. district judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, as you could have a voters of your Facebook page banned.
And Kentucky Governor-Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit from the ACLU because of its use of Facebook and Twitter.
This should not be so difficult.
At the time of Washington the time the affordable rates had a similar effect, such as the Internet.
The number of Newspapers multiplied, between 1776 and 1800, and the anonymous letter-writer fell on his leadership.
And even then, Washington had anonymous trolls.
The people who used pseudonyms such as "Yuri Cola", "Valerius", "Belisarius" and "Portius", wrote all the letters to Newspapers, the Washington the decisions made.
Petitions that criticized his position on the Treaty of Amity, Commerce and navigation with great Britain, overflowing from his office, according to the historical documents that were collected from the Online Papers of George Washington Project.
But he has not Silenced them.
Freedom of speech, disagreement and discourse belong to the Foundation of our Nation.
And true leadership means to accept.

Less lung cancer deaths from passive Smoking
In the past two decades, less and less people died because of passive Smoking to lung cancer.
This is the result of scientists of the University hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) in a study.
"According to our estimates, 167 lung cancer deaths are due to Smoking per year in passive," said study leader Heiko Becher.
As a comparison he drew on his own study of the subject of 1994.
At that time, there have been 400 deaths from lung cancer due to passive Smoking per year in Germany.
The new study is published in the "International Journal of Public Health".
House connections prove to be very complex
The construction works in the Villinger street are in full swing and "are reasonably in time," says the head of the building yard, which amounts Fred Heinze.
In the area of the house connections, the situation is more complicated than expected, because in the underground, much to hide what was not noted in the plans.
The transport of the disabled time and again, the construction work for the construction crew of the company Stumpp is a big Problem.
"The ignorance of the drivers in front of red traffic lights and Fences is enormous," says Heinze.
The road was closed and only buses were entitled to travel.
Angelo Caruso, Marvin Kostorz and Tim Kostorz of the company Stumpp are busy for weeks with the Work on the bridge.
"The hot days were quite exhausting.
But fortunately, we were supplied by our friend Fritz Matt with cool mineral water," says Marvin Kostorz.
Poverty and death in the Indonesian gold country
If Bardina Degei cooks the dinner, she uses a stove.
You even used a pot.
In your wooden house in of enarotali, the capital of the Paniai Regency in the troubled Indonesian province of Papua, the housewife, normally, a sweet potato known locally as "the nota" is referred to directly in the fireplace.
After a half hour, the charred tuber with eager, unwashed hands is taken and devoured.
Degei is sitting on the dirt floor - she has no furniture - where you will run your daily work, to wash, for example, dresses with turbid water from the nearby swamp.
A bucket in a roof space that serves as a Latrine.
As the youngest of the four wives of her husband were not assigned fields.
Polygamy is common here.
Of course, you can work late, be dangerous: most of The village men are unemployed, and many drink hard, and there are the soldiers.
"No one dares to 17 PM in the village walking around," she says.
It is a rare insight into the daily life in the highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony that was taken in 1969 after a controversial Referendum in Indonesia, as the only 1.026 Oldest should vote through a public survey prior to the occupation forces.
An existing movement, the up for independence against the Dutch rule, quickly turned against the government of Jakarta, which holds the control over the Region and foreign journalists or legal observers of excludes.
In 2003, the province was formally split into Papua and West Papua, where the independent part of Papua new Guinea includes the Eastern part of the island.
Of enarotali is as remote as it is desolate. The trip includes a 90-minute flight from the provincial capital of Jayapura to Nabire and then a morning 5-hour drive with your rental car.
There is no public transport.
The town of about 19,000 inhabitants, consists of wooden houses, which are surrounded by bamboo fences, and corrugated metal roofs, which were converted due to rust in different yellow-brown tones.
Very few Indonesians have made their journey here, let alone journalists, and virtually no foreigners.
Before Christian missionaries arrived, revered Mee Pago Papuans a God named Uga Tamee.
There were also other changes.
"We were not accustomed to wearing these clothes," says Degei, and points to their vibrant, hand-woven Turban, her dark shirt and bright skirt.
"In the past we had only the leaves on our bodies."
Papua is Indonesia's poorest province, where 28 % of people live below the poverty line and some of the worst infant mortality and literacy rates in Asia.
But it is also Indonesia's gold country.
The largest and most profitable gold mine in the world Grasberg, owned by the Freeport McMoran of Phoenix, is located just 60 miles from Paniai, a highland province in the size of New Jersey with 153,000 inhabitants.
Alone in the year 2015 Freeport in the value of 3.1 billion US-Dollar Gold and copper mined.
In addition, Papua has wood resources, worth an estimated 78 billion dollars.
These riches, however, are a source of misery for the indigenous Papuans, who make sure that Indonesia's powerful military maintains a suffocating presence.
A study from 2005 in the New York Times reported that Freeport local military personnel and units between 1998 and 2004, paid almost US $ 20 million, including up to 150,000 US dollars to a single officer.
Papuan demands for greater autonomy and threaten the Golden goose and be mercilessly dealt with.
According to activists, more than 500,000 Papuans have been killed and thousands have been raped since 1969 by the Indonesian military, tortured and imprisoned.
Mass killings in the Papuan Tribe of the highlands in the 1970s were, according to the Asian human rights Commission on the genocide.
Alone in the Region, the Indonesian police have arrested in the past year, more than 3,900 of peaceful demonstrators.
"We Will Lose Everything", says a report by the Archdiocese of Brisbane from the year 2016, in the reports of the atrocities of the previous year are included, such as illegal executions and torture, rape and electric shocks, according to another report especially popular - and the brutal suppression of peaceful demonstrations.
"It is difficult to count the number of victims, since each week's incidents to happen," says Andreas Harsono, Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch.
The screws have increased because of Papua resources to bring an influx of settlers from other Parts of Indonesia.
The population of 3.5 million inhabitants, the province is 83% Christian, but the demographic development is changing, as Muslim economic migrants from the population of the Islands of Java, Borneo, Sumatra, and Sulawesi to the rich.
Javanese Warung-sell canteens, fried chicken and Gado-Gado, mixed vegetables with peanut sauce served.
Local people are struggling to keep up.
"The migrants have started to sell chickens and vegetables on the traditional market is cheaper than the local Papuans," explains Abeth You, a 24-year-old Paniai Native who moved to the provincial capital of Jayapura to work.
"It is the native Papuans - the Mama-Mama [the women] of Papua has cost your market."
The Indonesian President Joko Widodo, popularly called Jokowi is known, promised during his election campaign in 2014, the inequalities, and address the rights violations in Papua.
The former carpenter has secured 27 of a total of 29 districts in Papua, including Paniai - on the way to the presidential Palace in Jakarta.
But in Papua, little has changed, and today the Locals feel cheated.
"Our hearts are broken because we have voted in 2014 for Jokowi, with the expectation that he will fulfill our hopes that justice will be restored," says You.
In fact, Paniai suffered just two months after Jokowis inauguration in October of a low point.
On 7. December 2014 a group of 11 children was outside and sang Christmas songs in front of a camp fire in of enarotali, when two Indonesian soldiers on a motorcycle through the darkness broke.
The frightened children told you that you should turn your headlights on.
One of the soldiers took offense at your tone, and later came back with four soldiers, the local Pastor Yavedt Tebai.
The soldiers, who had been drinking, hunting, and the group hit the piston with your gun, told the victims and witnesses.
Then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children.
A child, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was beaten so severely that he fell into a coma.
A few hours later, the building of the nearby government Commission was set on fire and things escalated the next day.
Approximately 1,000 young Papuan men, women and children gathered on a football field in front of the local police station and the military command centre to demand justice.
They wore ceremonial hunting bows, and led the Waita dance in a circle constantly and a sound of a bird imitating - Papua Mee Pago tribe.
Some protesters launched stones at police and hurling a military post.
As the atmosphere was heated, was sent to the soldiers a command via a built-in radio: "If the masses make more than three times resistance, they shoot you dead," - stated in an official document of the TIME, which was not released to the local media.
Yeremias Kayame, 56, the head of the Kego Koto district of enarotali, saw the impending danger and called for calm and urged the crowd to return home.
Nobody was listening to in the mood.
"As I turned, I was shot suddenly in my left wrist," he said TIME on the porch of his brightly painted wooden house.
Kayame still don't know who fired, but says that the bullet came from the ranks of the assembled soldiers.
"It was crowded, and many shots were fired," he adds.
The local man Alfius Youw, was hit three times, his Cousin, the witness of the shootings.
"I ran up to him and examined his body to make sure he was there," said Yohanes, who like many Indonesians has only one name, the TIME in a foul mood.
"I saw that he was dead ... I kissed him."
The chief inspector of the Papua police, Yotje Mende, told reporters that his officers wanted to maintain their Station"", because you'll be attacked.
"We have to defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us," said the spokesman of the Papua police, Commissioner Pudjo Sulistiyo, in the year 2015.
"It's a matter of life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five young demonstrators were killed and many more injured.
The news of the killings came on the following day, 'filtered' to Jakarta.
Three weeks, Jokowi held in Jayapura has a passionate speech in which he expressed sympathy for the families of the victims and vowed the historic grievances in Papua.
"I want this case to be solved immediately so that it will not happen in the future," he said.
Security Minister Wiranto said in October 2016, that he set-up an out-of-court mechanism for the settlement of historical breaches of human rights.
But the excuses started almost immediately.
"Most of the injuries occurred a long time ago.
Some were in the 90-ies and early 2000-ies.
The point is that we have committed these violations to address, but there are processes to go through," he said.
Then Wiranto made a retreat, as he on 5. June in Jakarta, with the TIME spoke and said he had set no plans in Papua, a complaint mechanism.
Instead, "everything is regulated by law," he said.
Wiranto, the the UN for "crimes against humanity" has been accused of claiming more than 1,000 deaths in East Timor's bloody independence vote in 1999, said that 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua, which is already, including the Paniai incident.
Families of Paniai victims received such statements with grim incredulity.
"I was interviewed in the last three years four times, but there was no progress," says Yohanes.
"I'm tired."
He says that he lives years later, still in fear.
"I'm scared," he says.
"I'm afraid to be in the military detained, have the fear of being shot."
His brother Yacobus repeated the view that people in Paniai afraid to discuss the incident.
He says that he was beaten by the military, after he helped to bury four of the victims.
"After I had buried the bodies, examined the military after me," he says.
The shootings have not stopped.
On Tuesday, the Indonesian police fired on villagers in Paniais neighborhood Deiyai.
During a confrontation between villagers and the Manager of a construction company that refused to bring an unconscious man to the hospital died a Person, and 17 others were injured, including children.
The man, 24-year-old Ravianus Douw, who was drowned, as he fished in a nearby river, died on the way to the hospital.
Agitated villagers staged a protest in front of the site office of the company.
The police said that the villagers threw stones at officers, who responded by fired warning shots.
But Locals say that the mobile Brigade (Indonesian paramilitary police) began to shoot on the crowd and killed.
"We were in a panic, we are afraid that there will be vengeance," says the 29-year-old Dominggu Badii, who was living in the vicinity of the hospital and a witness, the injured were sent up here quickly, so the TIME.
"I've been hiding for two days in my house."
The Deiyai-Parliament has called upon the concerned officers to account, and the mobile Brigade of the police to withdraw from the region.
Paniai was always a source of trouble for the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development strengthens the dissatisfaction of the tribesmen Mee, Moni, Dani and Then, the life in the green highlands of Papua.
Many joined the "Free Papua movement" (OPM), of the rebel army, which claims to defend the rights of the Papuans, by triggering sporadic attacks and kidnapping by Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the Top OPM leaders come from Paniai, including Tadius Yogi, and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
As a reaction, have been arrested in the last few years, thousands of people in Paniai and arbitrarily detained, under the pretext of "safeguarding national sovereignty".
Some are never seen again.
Among the people in Papua Paniai as "a tragic, forgotten place".
Poverty strengthens the dissatisfaction.
The little bit of rice, which is sold in of enarotali, is for Locals to tax.
Bread is just out of range.
The people here grow everything you eat: above all, Nota, and fruit and leaf vegetables.
Agriculture is the task of the women, who can work on four or five fields of the sweet potato.
You keep the majority of the harvest for the family, while the Rest is sold on the local market.
Ten pieces of Nota cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 Cents).
In the course of time, economic inequalities have grown between the native Papuans and new migrants who have arrived since the opening of new flight routes to the airport of Nabire in greater numbers.
The few jobs that there are in the Region, usually go to the better educated and more affluent migrants.
Papua rarely have the capital or the necessary skills to run their own businesses competitive.
"The young people are not interested to stay in the village ... because there are no Jobs or money," says John Gobai, the Chairman of the tribal Council of Paniai.
Insulation keeps the eyes of the world away from the land of Papua.
In addition, restrictions on the reporting of international media remain tense.
At the beginning of the year, the French journalist Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were deported because of the lack of coordination with related institutions from Papua, although the rare permission was given for filming.
According to Phelim Kine, the Deputy Asia Director of Human Rights Watch, have not been realized, to abolish the promises of Jokowis election campaign, the restrictions on reporting, in order to promote transparency and development.
"There are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to report from Indonesia's troubled easternmost provinces of Papua and West Papua to try: Visa refusal and a black list," he said in a statement.
Lack of press, control means that the international pressure on the Indonesian government remains largely on the immediate neighbours in Papua is limited.
In March, six Pacific countries - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands-Islands - called on the UN human rights Council, to investigate the "various and widespread violations" in the land of Papua, including the Paniai shooting.
The same countries have historically seen the OPM.
The spokesman of the Indonesian Ministry of foreign Affairs Arrmanatha Nasir rejected the accusations of the group and said to journalists in Jakarta: "Indonesia is a democratic System still applies, and there is free media, so that it is difficult to cover up the evidence of human rights cases."
The people want more foreign governments take note of this.
As an official Delegation from the Netherlands, under the leadership of the human rights Ambassador Kees Van Baar, Jayapura on 4. May, visited, broke Locals for their Silence, and distressed him, "We want freedom", according to a source, who also participated in the session, but remain anonymous.
Indonesia 2019, a further presidential election, but the Papuans say that they are not likely to vote for Jokowi.
"Jokowi is a man who has good intentions, but he is surrounded by people involved in the Paniai-shots," says Gobai, the Chairman of the tribal Council.
He wants Jokowi knows that the Paniai people, apart from the fact that it lives under the constant threat of a predatory military, poor education and health services.
Gobai says that the Paniai-look at people, like other Papuans, their vote for Jokowi as a "debt" that he must pay back.
"You don't need money, they just want justice," he says.
Despite the threats and intimidation of families of the Paniai-shot victims, carried out a last symbolic act of defiance: the body of one victim was buried on a site just opposite of the police and the military station.
You know that you might never be justice, but at least let the people responsible for their crimes not be forgotten.
"A member of our family was killed," said Yacobus, head bowed.
"What else can we do?"

The President of the International tennis Federation (ITF) is with his great Davis Cup Coup at the annual General meeting.
At the meeting in Ho-Chi-Minh-city the for the Sport as a revolutionary proposal, the Davis Cup was not supported to play only two winning sets, wafer-thin by the necessary Two-thirds majority.

More than 1 in 5 US travellers bringing prohibited items on the plane, finds a survey 
A survey among flight passengers showed that more than 20 percent over smuggled consciously or unconsciously prohibited items at the security checkpoints, the U.S. Transportation Security Administration, including a minimum of 6 percent, the entered the plane, while they wore accidentally banned knives or other objects with a Blade.
Less than 1 percent claimed they had too late discovered that they had mistakenly traveled with firearms, ammunition or explosives.
The survey of more than 1,000 people - from a Jet-Charter service that Stratos Jet Charters, Inc., was carried out also found that younger travellers more the rules.
Of the respondents, to fly the additions that you have tried, knowingly, with something that was prohibited by the TSA, were 19.7 percent Millennials, compared with less than 15 percent, were members of the Generation X.
The most common items that were funneled to the TSA agents deliberately over, were food and liquids.
More than 3 percent admitted to have knowingly objects with a Blade through security, 2.2 percent of the female respondents and 3.7% of the male respondents also confirmed that they had intentionally brought a prohibited drug in the plane.
The company said that it had polled travelers across the country to find out how many people have inadvertently brought contraband through airport security, and how many had done it on purpose.
It is no Surprise that the people most likely contraband - knowingly or unknowingly - through security, were the ones who fly the most.
The company pointed out, however, that the TSA policies are a bit complicated and confusing.
People are often unsure as to what liquids you can bring with you or how much of it.
So it is no Surprise that the greatest amount of TSA-seized items are prohibited liquids.
For a time the people thought the TSA might view the books as contraband.
No liquids are allowed on domestic flights, but on international flights.
Elon Musk, it is no matter: tens of thousands of Tesla customers will cancel Orders
Electro-Jack of all trades Elon Musk likes to brag about the huge number of pre-orders for its new Tesla "Model 3".
He has beat so far, that part of the customer has withdrawn its non-binding reservation.
In addition to the always triumphant Numbers to sales growth and more gigantic scissors sales targets Tesla chief Elon Musk at the announcement of the latest quarterly balance sheet growth for the first time, a different, less glamorous number betrayed: the cancellations of the new mass-market model 3.
Musk had advertised in the past few months, often with more than 500,000 pre-orders for the new car, whose delivery is about to begin.
Now, Musk admits: of the total Of 518.000 pre-orders of 63,000 has already pulled back again.
Critics had repeatedly pointed out that it is only non-binding reservations.
In the case of a cancellation Tesla pays back the 1000 euros (in the USA 1000 US dollars and in the UK 1000 pound) "reservation Deposit" in full.
Currently, such non-binding reservations available 455.000, acknowledged Musk in a conference call with analysts.
That the cancellation of around twelve per cent of all orders could be a Problem, don't believe the Tesla chief.
His Argument: The challenge to the ambitious growth targets, is not in demand, but on the production side.
Last year, Tesla delivered of 84,000 vehicles.
In 2018, it will put all the models together - to 500,000 in 2020, a Million.
The demand is obviously there.
According to Musk 1800 reservations to come each day.
Anyone who orders today is a "Model 3" may at the earliest be expected in the second half of 2018 with the delivery - if Tesla manages to drive his brand-new, never-in practice, tested in production lines without major interruptions with the maximum load.
Many experts doubt that this is possible.
But when it comes to larger delays, then the non-binding nature of the reservations could be a Problem for Tesla.
Since then, the company can not prevent dissatisfied customers in droves to run away.
EPA chief Pruitt pulls back because of the hesitation of the rules of the Obama Era to reduce emissions 
One day, after he had been sued by 15 States, Scott Pruitt, the chief of the environmental protection authority's previous decision to delay implementation of the rules of the Obama-Era, the emissions of Smog-causing to reduce air pollutants.
Pruitt presented the change, as its Agency meet the needs of state environmental agencies more responsive than previous administrations have been proved.
He didn't mention the lawsuit, which was filed against his previous job in a Federal appeals court.
It's going to be a period of time, the on 1. October for countries of delivery, to the Standards of 2015 for ground-level ozone to be observed.
Pruitt announced in June that he would delay compliance by a year to give the authority more time to study the Plan and to avoid "in local decisions interfere with, or hinder the growth of the economy".
Pruitt, who was prior to his appointment by President Donald Trump the state's attorney from Oklahoma, was for a long time been a reliable opponent of stricter environmental regulations.
Since his arrival in Washington, Pruitt has moved repeatedly to block the regulations, or to delay, the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels.
The sudden reversal from the Wednesday is the latest legal setback for the Pruitts regulatory Rollback Agenda.
Last month, a Federal appeals court in Washington has ruled that the EPA administrator exceeded his authority when he tried, the implementation of a rule of the Obama Administration, the Oil and gas companies for Monitoring and reduction of methane leaks undertook to delay.
In a Wednesday evening statement, Pruitt suggested that his turn be amplified in the case of ozone standards, quite simply, the willingness of the EPA to cooperate with the States through the complex process of timely compliance with the new Standards.
"Under previous administrations, the EPA has not complied with often the deadlines for implementation, and then wait to be by activist groups and other accused, and in a unification of the date for the execution," said Pruitt, who sued the EPA more than a dozen Times in his previous Job.
"We do not believe the method to a regulation by the court, and we take seriously the deadlines.
We also take seriously the law, and the authority it gives us."
Nevertheless, said the opinion of the EPA that Pruitt is at some point its "power to delay, and all other legally available powers" to use, to ensure that the regulations "are based on a sound policy and the best available information".
The Republicans in Congress are pushing the rules on a more comprehensive revision of the Ozone.
In the last month approved draft legislation to delay implementation of the rules by 2015, at least eight years.
The measure was not asked in the Senate for a vote.
The New York attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who headed the coalition of States that had sued the EPA this week, said the group did not intend the statutory pressure to maintain.
"The reversal of the EPA - according to our actions - is an important gain for the health and safety of these, 6.7 million New Yorkers and the more than 115 million Americans who are directly affected by the Smog that flows into their communities," said Schneiderman.
New York joined in this case, California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington and the District of Columbia.
Ground-ozone, when pollutants from cars, power plants, oil Refineries, chemical plants and other sources react in the atmosphere to sunlight.
The resulting Smog may cause in sensitive groups of people serious respiratory problems, and to contribute each year Thousands of premature deaths.
Public health advocates and environmentalists cheered about Pruitts surprising change of course.
"It is disturbing how much pressure it takes to this sensible step by the person responsible for the protection of the air, to get the we breathe," said Lori Ann Burd from the Center for Biological Diversity.
"We must continue to fight against the ideological crusade of the Trump government to polluters and special interests imposing on it".

Moore's Ford massacre: activists on the lead racist Lynchakt as a call for justice 
A 1948 Ford Mercury drove through a group of spectators in rural Monroe, Georgia, and rumbled to the Ford bridge, Moore's.
Before the car, which had four black passengers and a white driver, was able to reach the bridge, a group of white men with guns to block his way.
The leader of the mob - a middle-aged man in a pinstripe suit took a long pull on his cigar and gazed quizzically through the windshield.
Inside, the occupants were in fear.
"We want this n ---- r Roger!" yelled the man.
"Get him out of the car!"
Screams ripped the silence, as a young black man from the passenger seat was pulled.
Fortunately, this terrible scene, the on 22. July was played, only a reenactment.
But if then a noose around the neck of "Roger" is thrown, launched almost all in the audience a very real sigh.
Since 2005, activists were coming back to the Moore's Ford Bridge, to the night, to imitate, in the two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and Mae Murray Dorsey - from the Ku Klux Klan in 1946 lynched.
No one was ever indicted for the murders.
"It is really incredible that in all these years, not a single Person was arrested - even though we see them in our communities, although we know who you are," said Tyrone Brooks, who helps with the organization of the reenactment.
"It is a spot of dirt on a story, but it is a burden for our souls."
Brooks is a 71-year-old former Congressman of the state of Georgia and a life-long civil rights activist.
For him, the adjustment serves as a dramatic call-to-Action and represents an annual reminder of the Monroe community, that an injustice has never been corrected.
"We want enforcement, we want to the end, we want healing, we want reconciliation, but first we have to get justice," he said.
"We can't get to healing and reconciliation, until we get justice."

According to FBI files, obtained by NBC News, were more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding count in the Lynch process is suspected.
But none was ever accused of.
Although the Suspects remain for decades on the loose, say civil rights campaigners, the double Motivation for the Lynch actions in the whole of the city was always known for: politics and Sex.
In April 1946 a decision of the Supreme court allowed black citizens in Georgia turning it in for the first Time, at the pre-election campaign in the summer of your voice.
At about the same time as the election, stabbed according to the FBI, the black sharecroppers, Roger Malcom, a white landowner, Barnett Hester, during a fight - reportedly over a woman.
Brooks said that the rumor in town was that Hester, with Malcolm's wife Dorothy slept and the Baby, she wore, it wasn't from her husband.
25. In July 1946, and paid by Loy Harrison, a prominent white landowner, $ 600, to free Malcolm from prison, the FBI.
He was accompanied by Dorothy and her Cousins, Mae Murray and George Dorsey to prison.
But as they turned away from the prison, and the Moore's Ford Bridge approached, surrounded by a Lynch mob the car.
"As it turns out, it was Harrison who has prepared the murders, and arranged", concludes a Federal report.
"It is also obvious that there was a conspiracy between the state and local law enforcement, which was not only involved in the murders, evidence removed, and the identity of witnesses has covered".
Brooks puts it more succinctly.
"It was a choice-massacre," he said.
"They were all killed to send a message to black people in this community: "When you register and when you vote, then you happen to be here."
For almost a decade, Cassandra Greene has headed the annual reenactment of the Moore's Ford Bridge lynching murders.
Your presentation is clear, poignant, and grounded in a kind of deep racism, many believe no longer want it to exist in America.
It is hard to watch, and even harder to look away, but Greene said that is not the point.
"We don't want to talk about the Lynching, because we are then confronted with the ugliness in all of us," she said.
"But I can't build a relationship to you, if you don't want to listen to me or don't want to hear what I've been through".
The samples for this year's production started in June, and on the first day, almost 30 actors - a dozen White and the Rest Black huddled in a room and listened to, as Greene began a well-rehearsed Overview of the piece.
Wade Marbaugh here is Greene's Co-Director.
He has played for years the role of the chief-clan member, but he said that the role will never be easier.
"I don't feel dirty, because I am so," said Marbaugh.
"But I think it is very important to get this story alive, because we don't want to return to these times."
On the other side of the room, the actor Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona rehearsed, Roger Malcolm and Barnett Hester play, your lines.
The piece begins with Malcolm yelling at Hester, and him beset, angry that he has with his wife Dorothy slept.
"I said, n --- er, get off my property!"
Rascona returned fire.
There is a Pause.
And then everyone (at least all the black actor) breaks out in laughter.
Greene laughs the loudest.
"What!?" Rascona asked.
He is alarmed and confused.
I was too hard?
"No," said Greene, still giggling.
"I just don't think that white people back then, 'n - - -, he' said."
"But," quipped one of the other black performers.
"You just have to make the hard 'R'."
And that's exactly where the energy shifts in the room, a sense of camaraderie replaced the discomfort.
Everyone is busy in order to get this right, not only because of the game, but also because of the memory of the four people killed.
The scene begins once again.
This Time, when Rascona the N-word is said, he says it sharply and with emphasis.
Absolutely nobody laughs.
This repetition ends in a violent and fast.
There are screams, gun shots and then silence.
A woman with a mourning dress, dressed, standing over the bodies of the actors and Billie takes grief-stricken Eulogy "Strange Fruit".
Your voice breaks every other word.
About a hundred meters behind a group of about four dozen spectators, sweat, and tears from the eyes wipes.
The audience is almost split evenly between Black and White.
A Few arrived from Ithaca, New York, to see the performance, many of the street come down.
You have experienced all of the nearly eight hours of Georgia, oppressive humidity, when Brooks guides you on a pilgrimage to the tomb of the Malcoms and Dorseys sites.
Up to this point the murders have remained an anecdote, but now, standing on the same Land, where the Lynch-murders took place, feels the air spooky.
When the last notes of the song fade away, invites Greene to the crowd to come closer and inspect the corpses.
Children crouching on their heads to register the fake blood and the silent body and whisper to each other.
"You're not really dead," mutters a little Boy, as he wanted to remember.
After a few minutes Greene the amount is grateful - and all of a sudden it is over.
The actors throw away the Lynch rope and use it to wipe your tears.
Bradshaw embraced Marbaugh, the man in the suit who has played the clan member.
Nick Rascona hugging two of his teammates, and then collapses into her arms crying, the emotional load of the performance, finally, it breaks through with him.
"It's okay," whispers one of the women.
"We know that the is in your heart.
You did this for a reason."
Later, the audience is with the actors to dinner.
At a table a white Couple from Atlanta chatting excited about the re-enactment with a black Couple who you have just met.
Denise Duplinski struggled to find the words, what sense has left the show.
"It is hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... of people who look like themselves and they do that because they look like you," she said.
"What does it really with me, leads me to believe that the Lynching is still continuing," she added, "today, the only police called a shootout."
In the same room Tyrone Brooks holds court at his table, he eats and is reminiscent of the civil rights.
He said he had already started to plan the performance, in the next year.
"The reenactment is in some ways inspirational, as it describes the horrors of what we have to endure, but it is also a Moment of learning," he said.
"It is so, if we don't learn from it, then it can happen again.
Who does not study his own history, who knows his own history is condemned to repeat it."
"Twilight of the gods" reconciling the Wagnerian Bayreuth
In the fourth part of Richard Wagner's monumental work of film Director Frank Castorf puts on a colorful-frivolous staging in front of a gigantic, six-storey backdrop.
The revolving stage (designed by Aleksandar Denic) shows either a shabby street corner office of a wall, and a döner shop in Berlin, a "Plaste and Elaste"Logo from the times of the GDR or the New York stock exchange.
In front of an open Mercedes-Oldtimer, in which the Rhine maidens posing as a rock and girls, or, alternatively, an Isetta parked.
Stacked Oil barrels remind of Castorf's production of the leitmotif - money, Power and greed - that attracts by its "Ring"-production.
The three Rhine maidens - sung by Stephanie Houtzeel, Wiebke Lehmkuhl and Alexandra Steiner - harmonize, as in "Rheingold" is wonderful.
Kess, you seduce Siegfried (Stefan Vinke), pull in Hollywood fashion, a body in the trunk and give the Krawallo-Clique.
Stephen Milling sings the delightfully nasty Hagen, the the Aura of a heavyweight boxer surrounds.
Brutal the scene is when he kills Siegfried.
Later, Gunther (Markus Eiche) must believe in it.
The audience thanked the Ensemble with a vigorous round of applause.
Stormy Foster, Milling, Vinke and conductor Janowski, bows humbly and hands to the Merkel rhombus shaping to be celebrated.
Big applause for the festival orchestra, the shows for the first time on the stage - in view of the large heat in casual clothing.
Eagerly awaiting the appearance of Frank Castorf and his production team had been.
He had to 2013, a braying chorus of whistles endure, there was five years later, a great cheer went up in the occasional "Boo"Calls.
Festival chief Katharina Wagner game should have been pleased about this.
"You can tell that the audience with the "Ring" is grown in a certain way," she had said shortly before the performance of the dpa.
The audience have not only made a Form of peace with Castorf, but also an understanding of whose perspective it is grown.
I draw a positive summary.

The U.S. environmental protection Agency has repealed a decision to delay a regulation of the government of Obama, that the States are bound, the Smog-causing curb emissions. This was a day after 15 States sued the Agency because of the step.
The EPA announced late on Wednesday the decision of the so-called "ozone provisions in 2015," and said, you show the obligation of the Agency, with the States to cooperate.
"We believe in dialogue and the fact that we react to our state partners," said EPA chief Scott Pruitt in a statement.
Pruitt had announced in June the intention of the EPA, the ozone provisions - are to be measured in which a part of the country, pollutant emissions, in order to determine where cuts need to be made to more stringent air quality Standards - to delay by one year, until October 2018.
A group of 15 mostly democratic States, along with the district of Colombia, filed on Tuesday a lawsuit and said that the effort was illegal.

Council wants community room
In the end the decision was clear: With only two votes against decides the municipal Council of Fluorn-Winzeln is the establishment of a community space in the future seniors residential complex.

Although it will take more time, up to the date of the parish, has its area in the municipality of possession, but there is now no planning impediment to the private Investor to stemmende project.
There is a discussion regarding a community space.
One of the two investors, who are still in the boat, has offered to the municipality.
On the ground floor, he would make a living area of around 55 square meters and an adjoining terrace with at least 70 square meters in area for a special price.
The administration and the majority of the municipal Council in mind, such a community space, not as a meeting place for the residents of the senior-friendly housing should be provided, but is open in the municipality.
As an example, the word "Strickcafé made" in the round.
Will sweeten the decision, which was vorentschieden through the provision of funds for the current budget already in the last autumn, through funding opportunities.
The building is located in the redevelopment area.

The proposal is to signal the Investor that you want to throw him in this respect, no stick between the legs, the finding that both saddle - which is similar to the surrounding buildings and shed-roof - which can reduce the eaves height and the construction of economic power - would be possible.
Unnecessarily, only Wilfried Sohmer, says this addition.
If it helps: it Unanimously passed the Committee.
Not so easy to do it in the community room.
Daniela reputation refers to the many own the building, you don't come right ahead, you rest now in the community room from the window, she says: "I have a hard time with it".
Yvonne Staiger speaks for the community room, however, absolutely against local participation.
She looks behind a hidden subsidy already Wealthy or even foreign investors.
This is not so, because with the acquisition of the area, you don't give a grant, but get a real, in case of doubt, indirect value, marketing the counter-speech.
Staigers request, the proposal suffered accordingly split, three advocates.
So it remains with only two votes against in the original program, the Stefan Haller sums up: "If we take the decision, we will make a giant step toward closing a huge gap in our infrastructure".

Fortunas Hoffmann: "three chain works better,"
Andre Hoffmann is hoping after the 2:2 the start of the season against Braunschweig that the optimization of the defense brings formation in Aue points.
With the first game of the season, Andre Hoffmann was not satisfied with the result, even had there been, the two goals against the 2:2 against Braunschweig.
"The two goals against is too much, and we need to be careful in Aue even better," says the defensive player of Fortuna Düsseldorf.
In the ore mountains, the three-chain is to be optimized.
And a goal after a free kick no longer want to capture the Fortunen.
"For the future, it will be in such a way that nobody besides Michael (Rensing) on the line."
Hoffmann is convinced that his team also comes after the experience in the preparation of the three chain better, as the four chain.
"Even I know not to act like we in Aue," says his coach, Friedhelm Funkel, but Hoffmann is sure of his cause, "because we have just in the three-chain on the half-positions in Kaan Ayhan and Niko Gießelmann player, able to build," said Hoffmann.
"A prerequisite is, however, that we can harmonize even better and we have so many players can't afford in the construction of error."
Also, of course, Hoffmann goes to Aue, in order to win the game.
"If you can talk to a draw of a bad Start, don't know.
The performance could well be the case okay," said Hoffmann.
"If we can but stand on Sunday with four points and the Cup to concentrate, we can certainly speak of a decent start to the season."
Of his Trainer wanted to know nothing.
"The Start of the season I will judge only after six to eight game days," said Friedhelm Funkel, who would not speak of an advantage over Aue, only because of the play of Saxony in Heidenheim, Germany had to be aborted because of bad weather canceled.
"Now you can start the season with a home game," said Sparkle, and Hoffmann believes that the players could be from Aue, maybe even a little fresher, since they had no heavy and complete game as Fortuna against a rise of favorites in the bones.
"But you don't know 100% where they currently stand," says the Central defender of the Fortuna.
Although the guests from Rhineland to go as a slight favorite on Sunday in the encounter in the finally (almost) finished the stadium of Aue.
"The fact that we sweep them just because we claim to be one of the first Six, is nonsense," said Sparkle, the balance of which is in the case of only one defeat against Aue from nine Games quite positive.
"There is no team in the 2. Bundesliga, you have to beat from the outset," explains fortune's head coach.
To make "such a statement would be arrogant and presumptuous".
And so Sparkle wants to see his players on Sunday in no case.
New results of the Swedish asylum age assessment tests published
The most recent results of Tests for asylum seekers in Sweden, were subjected to a new method of medical assessment of their age, show that more than 80 percent of the tested persons older than 18 years. But not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results.
The Swedish national Board of forensic medicine (Rättsmedicinalverket) has started the implementation of the Tests in the past year.
You should make during the asylum procedure, the evaluation of the age more precisely, after the Swedish migration authority (Migrationsverket) has been criticized for the errors in the assessment of correct ages of some of the refugees, the minors were of age.
Today Migrationsverket 6.880 sent to the end of the test cases and the Forensic Medicine Agency now has the results of a total of 2.481 Tests from the period from mid-March until the 31. July 2017 published.
Eighty percent (2002) were judged to be 18 or older, while in other 25 cases, the Forensic Medicine Agency assessed that the Person "may have been 18 years of age or older".
In 432 cases, the conclusion that the Person "may be under the age of 18 years old".
The Tests are carried out only in cases in which the age of the Person in question.
According to Johan Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency, the results for the past few months resistant.
"We see no big difference in the statistics of the past few months, the Numbers are pretty constant," he told the journal The Local.
The high proportion of cases in which the Person over 18 years of age has been evaluated, does not necessarily mean that the applicant has about his age lying.
In may, the Agency published the results of 581 Tests and said that there were 442 cases that "suggest that the investigated Person 18 years of age or older".
As the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet, the 581 published results investigated, they found that in 243 of these cases, the Person had openly said that they will be in this year 18 years old.
The method of the medical age assessment, in the case of the x-ray pictures of wisdom teeth and MRI scans of knee joints to be made, which are then analysed by dentists and radiologists, has also been criticised in some areas.
A skeptic of the endocrinologist Claude Marcus, of the Karolinska Institute, whose work includes the assessment of biological maturity of people, to see if they went earlier or later than usual due to puberty.
"I had reason to think about it, and I don't think the type of measurement should be used.
To assess the biological age in this way is very unsafe.
If we can't tell you for sure, we should not do so, as if we could do it," he told the newspaper Metro.
Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency has defended the accuracy of the Tests: "In General, you can say that the risk to assess a child as an adult is incorrect, is low.
The biggest risk is if the Person is just under 18, in this case, this is approximately 10 percent."

The Minister of agriculture in the Interview - How do we protect ourselves from poison eggs, Mr Schmidt?
Germany discussed about the contaminated eggs.
How could this happen to the scandal?
So how to protect the consumer.
Agriculture Minister Christian Schmidt (CSU) in an Interview with the editor-in network in Germany (RND).
Mr Schmidt, How to protect consumers from contaminated eggs?
I can only encourage all consumers, the eggs in your fridge and to check the Stamp.
On the consumer protection portal www.Lebensmittelwarnung.de the länder provide the latest information about the affected egg-batches.
Affected eggs should be destroyed or returned.
Also, if according to what we know currently, a health risk is practically excluded.
Aldi is now taking on the best possible response to a crisis - all the eggs out of the deal -because of the Central role of the educator is not perceived by the state Minister of the economy, really?
The food monitoring is the responsibility of the länder.
Nevertheless, my house immediately and is known to the consternation of Germany has switched in the narrow exchange with the authorities of the countries.
All of the information and the risk assessment for the consumer.
The trade has about the same wear as the manufacturers ensure that the products sold, and harmless to health.
If in the case of eggs, the maximum Residue level of 0.005 mg/kg is exceeded, these are not transport capable.
Unloaded eggs can be consumed and sold.
This Time, the companies are not to blame.
Production companies and consumers sit in the same boat?
According to the current state of knowledge of the production companies is not at immediate fault.
Rather, they must be expected due to the allegedly illegal practices of service companies with economic damage.
As always, it is your in case of emergency, to little control.
It is only the lack of personnel, or the conclusive jurisdiction?
It's the official controls, have uncovered the process were just.
The truth, however, is also that food fraud and criminal energy can never be eliminated 100 percent.
Therefore, a systematic investigation of such Events and the Handing over to the prosecutors in cases where criminal offences may be present are of critical importance.
I have already made it clear on several occasions that I expect the responsible authorities a full investigation.
The regular alarm is in the case of food scandals really necessary?
Consumers have the right to get only safe and marketable food.
If a non-approved insecticide used in the food industry, are consumers right to be outraged.
By the adulterated product manufacturers, retailers and consumers are caught in a Situation, which is absolutely necessary.
In principle, it must be clear: The illegal use of the insecticide Fipronil with the maintenance of food supply of animals is unacceptable and must be ended immediately.
It must be at all levels, consistently, and with high pressure.
I expect all competent authorities, that the facts of the case is quickly and completely cleared up.
How the financial rules of football have an impact on neymar's move to Paris 
The rules, which aim, to prevent unrestricted expenditure of the European football clubs, will not interfere neymar's world record Transfer from Barcelona to the French Paris-Saint Germain.
Any consequences will come for Paris Saint-Germain out of the UEFA, as the leading organization that monitors the European game has the Power to prohibit the teams of the access to the prestigious Champions League tournament.
Financial Fair Play rules, which were created in 2011 by UEFA, will mean that PSG will have to prove that the Transfer of Neymar has been funded without great losses.
Barcelona has paid € 222 million (262 million $), the Brazilian from his contract to buy, and Neymar will receive a salary, the more will amount to tens of millions of dollars per year.
Here are some of the financial aspects of neymar's move to France.
PSG can make the money loose to Neymar's signing and him in a galaxy of other Stars, given the funding of the team by the by the energy-rich ruling family of Qatar.
Clubs are allowed to spend for purchase of players a lot of money, but with legitimate sources of income against taxes, that gives you the Break-Even point in their football-related business 
FFP has been designed by Michel Platini after his election as UEFA President in 2007.
The former French player believed that the associations which had taken in their pursuit of success, enormous debt, effectively cheating and risked ruin if banks or owners withdrew their support.
In 2011, FFP has shifted from concentrating on the debts of the clubs on the Monitoring of their losses.
The Change meant that the business model that Roman Abramovich used originally in 2003 in Chelsea - a Club with potential, bought and then vigorously invested to improve the team and build a global brand - should be a harder matter.
During the current three-year FFP assessment period, which runs until 2018, Clubs suffered losses in the amount of 30 million euros.
And although Platini in 2015 fell from the presidency in disgrace, his UEFA the successor Aleksander Ceferin, of excessive expenditure to deter.
"Certainly FFP is not dead, and we will reinforce the rules for the future," said Andrea Traverso, the UEFA for FFP is responsible, to The Associated Press last week.
Even though the PSG has paid the Buy-out clause of Neymar in a lump sum, you can distribute the amount for financial reporting over the duration of his contract.
Neymar has signed a five-year contract, so the transfer fee can be reported for the next five years in the amount of 44.4 million Euro in the financial statements.
The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014, has taken the PSG, together with Abu Dhabi, which is owned by Manchester City, with the most severe sanctions.
The PSG received a fine of 60 million euros (then $ 82 million), which was later reduced to 20 million euros, and it was arranged that the crew members for the Champions League in the 2014/15 season remains at 21 players instead of the normal 25-player limited.
The UEFA is outwit in search of clubs that might try to your financial supervision, by swelling your revenues by companies that are associated with the owners of the Clubs.
While a Qatari company could sponsor the PSG, when the value of the sponsorship should not exceed the Standard market rates, would make the UEFA this as a legitimate income.
This is what happened in 2014, when UEFA decided that the value of the sponsorship of the PSA was inflated by the Qatar Tourism Authority.
It was reported that a part of the PSG could payments to Neymar on payments of the organizing Committee of the 2022 world Cup in Qatar.
But PSG and Qatar 2022 have denied that Neymar world Cup will be an Ambassador for such a maneuver for the UEFA regulatory authorities could be easy to find out.
The previous sanctions against PSG mean that UEFA will be more attentive, to observe any attempt to circumvent the rules.
The UEFA had no preliminary talks with PSG about neymar's Transfer, sagtem on Thursday, people familiar with the Situation.
They spoke on condition of anonymity with The Associated Press, because they were not authorized to discuss the PSG Situation.
The last published reports indicate that PSG 2015/16 has achieved a turnover of 542,4 million euros, a profit of more than 10 million euros.
The accounts for the last financial year have yet to be released.
PSG expected that neymar's arrival is a blessing for sponsorship Deals, merchandise and shirt sales.
The Association expects that sales will rise after the signing by at least 30 percent.
The Spanish League was clearly irritated to see one of the best football players go, and they tried to prevent neymar's departure by claiming that PSG would be in breach of the FFP.
"It is a clear case of" financial Doping" with the club and the state", - said the President of La League, Javier Tebas, the Spanish daily newspaper AS a reference to Qatar's ultimate ownership of PSG.
Arsenal Manager Arsene Wenger, whose club is owned by an American sports tycoon, shares the reservations of La Liga against a state, of the finances of a club.
"It is the consequence of ownership and has changed the entire landscape of football in the last 15 years," said Wenger on Thursday.
"Once a country has an Association, everything is possible.
It is very difficult to respect Financial fair play, because you go different ways or have different interests you can have, if a country has such a large player to represent a country."

Nostalgia comes in "Wet Hot American Summer" and "Comrade Detective" in the niche
This repetition of history is at the same time nostalgic because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80-ies, 90-ies-filmed-years-Grunge-Era (as the mastermind David Wain and Michael Showalter, the Sketch Comedy "The State" for MTV), and for themselves - that is, for 2001, before the Stars, like Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd went on to bigger things.
As a cultural artifact, it is both a parody and an embodiment of our Facebook-enabled Era of permanent memories.
But as a Franchise, it feels as if the time would just.
"First Day of Camp" worked surprisingly well, not only because of its absurd humor (it contained an original story for a talking can of vegetables, which was spoken by H. Jon Benjamin).
By stiffened to the core of the Gags - an actor of middle age play Horny children grow up - but they managed to nevertheless, the impossibility to win the last part of the joke.
"Ten Years Later", with his adult-the adult is less rooted emotionally, and his parody goes to the watering can principle, including a Riff on the Stalker movies of the 90's such as "The Hand That Rocks the Cradle" ("The Hand that rocks the cradle").
At one point a character rummages through an Apple Powerbook, some Inline Skates, and "a number of other things from the year 1991".
Many of the Central stories are the same.
The gracious Coop (Mr. Showalter), now novelist, has not forgotten Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) has not lost his virginity yet.
And there is another crazy-malignant Plot, in the Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter) is included, which is now supported by George H. W. Bush (a well-done impression of Michael Ian Black).
As always, the digressions are the best part of the Franchise.
It makes a lot of fun to see the eternally young Mr. Rudd, Matt Dillon's lower lips, the beard of the "Singles", the former Big-Man-on-Camp Andy now feels like an old Geezer.
It's the moments of random insanity, which might inflame this Franchise as a kind of repeated "Seven Up!" Series, until it reaches what I assume is his logical conclusion: "Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later", the last scene will show the gang how she will be attending the premiere of the film "Wet Hot American Summer".
"Comrade Detective" on Amazon reminiscent now of a different kind of nostalgia: reviving the Cold war by The Americans, to the Film "the Atomic Blonde" and even "GLOW" with his East-versus-West battle iconography.
By Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka created Comedy, with Rhys Thomas as the Director specifies, to be a recorded TV-series: a Romanian Drama of the eighties, with the two police officers as friends, two officers from Bucharest, the fight for truth, atheism and the path of Marxism-Leninism.
The main roles - a hard-nosed Gregor and an idealistic Iosef - be of Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Ulici played, the dialogs are synchronized by Channing Tatum (also an Executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt in English.
It is a brilliant idea.
But it is not much more than an idea.
There are some nice Gags to the Watch (the police spends the time with chess on TV to see how Americans do it, maybe with a football).
And the list of famous speakers including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny - makes for a decent game of 'Find the voice'.
But "Comrade Detective," engages so much for the truthfulness of a desperate Propaganda drama, a killer wearing a Reagan mask, is included - that it is often how a single plays.
In six long episodes it draws, and the Comedy is not quickly or often enough.
"Comrade Detective", which was edited to a shorter length, could deliver his Agitprop Satire better as to Gregor, and Iosef visiting the American Embassy, whose Lobby is always manned by two thick men, a bunch of Hamburger devour.
The message for the imagined Communist audience is that the Western culture can make to the food for a feast.
The fictional Romanian creators were not wrong: We can make it even with our own recent history and with yours.

The data will be managed, therefore, of about 600 foreigners ' authorities in Germany.
Because the data had not been sufficiently maintained, was not the quality of the data in Parts so far.

Even the European court of human rights (ECtHR) will consider these Commitments to be sufficient.
Other EU countries would send refugees in the framework of the Dublin Convention there.
The interior policy spokesperson of the left faction in the Bundestag, Ulla Jelpke, criticized the decision: "families with children are threatening because of the deficiencies in the Italian asylum system, people illegal shooting conditions, and a danger to the child."

The Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.25 % 
The Bank of England is expected to be revealed later, that interest rates will remain unchanged after the weak economic growth and the slowdown of Inflation have dampened the speculation about an increase.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth "will remain sluggish", as the interest rates on family income retained in the midst of a increasing pressure.
The policy makers of the Monetary Committee (MPC) of the Bank voted 6 to 2 to hold interest rates at 0.25%, wherein in this month less members wanted an increase, as the weak economic growth has weakened the support for an increase.
In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7 % and in 2018 to 1.6%, and warned that the pressure on household incomes to continue, with Inflation expected to rise in the autumn is expected to be just less than 3 %.
But they signaled that in the next few years, increases in interest rates necessary to curb the Brexit heated Inflation, and you said that the cost of credit may be more than expected in the financial markets would have to rise.
The members also voted in favour of a part of the mammoth economic stimulus package to withdraw, which was published a year ago, after the Brexit.
You will require time for the financing plan, from the coming February is a cheaper financial resources for banks, although it has been said that now, it is expected that you will make 15 billion pounds more in the context of this system - with 115 billion pounds Sterling.
Minutes after the decision on the interest rate, the Bank said: "In the Central forecast in the MPC, the gross domestic product (GDP) remains in the short term, is weak, since the pressure on the real income of households remains a burden for the consumer."
To brought the interest rates back to you, that "a certain amount of tightening of monetary policy" for cooling Inflation and a "slightly larger" scale would be required, as the markets expect.
The markets are forecasting the first increase in the third quarter of next year, and another in the year 2020.
The Bank stressed, however, that the increases would be "gradual" and "limited".
The downward revision in growth forecasts by the Bank for this year and next compared to the may forecast of 1.9% and 1.7 %.
It has maintained its growth forecast to 1.8% by the year 2018.
The pound fell after this news, against the Dollar and the Euro.
The pound fell 0.5 % to US $ 1.31 and fell by 0.4% to EUR 1.11.
The decision to not Change comes after the recent disappointing growth, the rising expectations of a rate hike have dampened the GDP increased in the second quarter from 0.2 % in the previous three months, to 0.3%.
The growth in the third quarter, expected at 0.3%, although it will recover to the Bank at the end of the year.
The most recent inflation report offered little enthusiasm for the households that will be affected by rising Inflation and slight salary increases, as the tightening will first get worse before they will improve.
She added that monetary policy "can prevent in the next few years, the income slump", but she added that the wages will recover to the end of their three-year forecast of "significantly".
The economy is also strengthened by the increasing demand for British goods, as a result of the weak pound, which will offset a portion of the lower consumer spending.
The decision comes a year after the reduction in interest rates to 0.25 % last August, according to the shocking EU vote, which caused the Fall of the pound.
The Bank estimates that it will likely take four years, until this will reach the prices and the economy completely.
Before the last judgment of the Bank to the interest rates of the call was increased to a rate hike, as Inflation increased the pressure on hard-pressed households, with three political decision requested carrier in July, an increase of 0.5%.
Inflation fell last month, from 2.9% in June to 2.6%, although the Bank said that this was expected and you'll put on again in the coming months.
The Bank said the excess in proportion to their 2% target was due to "quite" the weak pound.
Andrew Montlake, Director at Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: "in view of the recent decline in Swap Rates is likely to be the mortgage market more competitive because the lenders are looking for loud to the shops and the year in a positive way to finish.
The market looks to be particularly good for those whose existing Deals expire and the new mortgage to complete, and many fee-free options and low Rates becoming more and more popular."

The great life: mezzanine floor, and a clever Designer Tricks have turned this tiny Earls Court apartment into a spacious home 
Joanne Leigh, a former Banker with a passion for real estate, scaled-down in 2014 of a large house in Knightsbridge to Earl's Court Apartment.
It is an elegant Queen Anne terrace is on the first floor - and it is a proof for the new Design, that Joanne has not Packed their bags and sold.
"Before that, I lived with my Ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger space," says Joanne.
"I was looking for something that was in my price comparable.
To me, this apartment was shown in Earl's Court, and she had the same high Ceilings.
I fell in love with you, and to this day, made an offer."
Since the first visit to the 1,000-square-foot apartment has been completely overhauled.
Originally a one-room property with a nested Layout, you had to go through the kitchen to reach the bedroom - wanted Joanne of storage space and a mezzanine to add to take advantage of the generous ceiling height to the optimum.
"I wanted high Ceilings, large Windows, lots of light.
That was my request," she says.
To Ombudsman for this purpose, the architecture and design Studio, Duck & Shed by Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill, the use of a 12.5 foot high Ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Joanne.
The blanket was not big enough to place two spaces one above the other, so the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine where you could stand.
Erfan had to think creatively to solve the default.
"The steel mill is quite complicated," he explains.
"We had to arrange the rooms so that they were stacked one above the other, without that we had to bend down.
It wasn't just about to build a simple platform, but the steel in such a way that he had for the function above or below the correct height."
This arrangement made it possible for Erfan to place two rooms in the full amount on top of each other - with a lot of additional Drama.
For the mezzanine floor of a classic copper look light window of Retrouvius about the glamorous living area down.
Mirrored gold furniture, silver accents, and a Vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program.
The use of Mirrors plays a role when you Add a theatre, space and light.
At both Ends of a short corridor is mirrored to make it act longer.
In the kitchen, the Reflection of a window in another room feels.
At the entrance of the mirrored units provide space for all the Cutlery and glasses from Joanne.
Through the perception of a glamorous space, the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen when not in use.
Collapsible kitchens are nothing New.
The special feature of this is that it is a garage door.
"A bit of engineering went in there," says Irfan of the steel-reinforced, veneered MDF door.
"It is against the weight so that it glides when you push the door up, very slightly."
Thanks to the clever use of space and storage space, Joanne was able to recruit additional 16 m2, additional bedroom, and an improved Layout.
"At the end of the day you will sell the ground area - or how your property is valued," says Erfan.
"In a rudimentary Form, is a real estate agent will occur and a calculation based on the floor size."
Here, they have managed to increase the floor area and use at the same time high quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage.
"The materials are the things that you touch and therefore help to create an emotional bond in a home," said Erfan.
"You don't fall in love with you in all the electrical sockets in the walls.
These are important, but they don't play with your heart."
It shows that an apartment can be transformed through good Design and increased square footage from something standard into something quite Amazing.
In fact, as Joanne, you might decide not to leave.
Brothers fight because of a $ 500 million real estate Empire
Two brothers are four decades after her Italian family, founded the dynasty, in a dispute due to one of the largest real estate empires in Victoria to the value of over $ 500 million.
The former Director of the Carlton Football Club and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a mansion in Toorak, only three doors from his younger brother Paul. This brought him to the Supreme court to clarify, as your property and your business assets is to be divided.
Paul wanted to draw since 2014 from the family business back, but a sharp dispute over the separation takes place in the Supreme court.
Together with her mother Anna, the brothers have 38 real estate worth more than half a billion dollars, accumulated, since then, the family in 1973, bought a shop in Smith Street, Collingwood,.
There the family founded by Westco Jeans and grew to a chain of 160 retail stores.
It was sold in 1999 to 85 million US dollars.
This money was invested in real estate, and the Portfolio of De Lutis now includes offices in the town centre, the development of areas of Brunswick and Sorrento, the Apartments in the Gold Coast and Mt Buller, as well as shopping centres in the suburbs.
According to an agreement with her late father, Colin, has the - of Paul as "the main operator and the dominant personality" in the family De Lutis, about two-thirds of the company's assets and Paul described about a third.
A court file says that this means that Colin owns property to the value of $ 316 million and Paul worth of 176 million dollars.
The division of real estate and cash has proved to be for Paul as a problem point.
"Colin proposed splits have left it with what I thought was the best of objects," he wrote in 2015 in a first Affidavit.
Last Friday, the first hearing of the Supreme court took place after several failed mediations.
The brothers are fighting now for control of the existing business - what Colin, as Paul claims, have ruled him out.
Colin argues that this is true, but accuses Paul, to manage some of the possessions to be incompetent.
In an early Affidavit, which was submitted by Colin, he says, he hopes to resolve the dispute.
"My Italian heritage dictates that the family is the most important priority," he wrote.
The costs rise in the case, with hundreds of pages of Affidavits, E-Mails and Reports of companies, including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and with leading attorneys, including Allan Myers, QC, and from both sides held law firms.
Mrs De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants, the milk bars and Delicatessens in the late 1950s, operated in the early seventies, a business in Brunswick bought.
They took advantage of the security to buy the Collingwood property in the Colin the first pair of jeans in the family shop opened.
Colin says that he began Westco there, as he "was in my last years of High School, when Paul was still a small child (about 10 years old)."
Anna De Lutis says that she and Luigi, who died in the year 2012, hoping that their property amicably to their sons.
"Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to land in court," she wrote.
Two other brothers, Luke and Mark, are no longer part of the De Lutis group of companies, where Colin claims that Mark may have paid when you Leave the company 10 million dollars, and Luke 26 million dollars.
Both Luke as well as Mark had become bitter, so Paul says, "concerning the terms and conditions of your financial separation".
Colin has held up very back, even though he was a former AFL-member of the management Board, and according to a biography from the year 2015 by Eddie McGuire, the best friend of the TV stars.
Fairfax Media took up with Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers contact.
Only Colin replied via SMS to say "I can't really say much," because the case was before the courts.
"It is very, very sad that my brother has chosen Paul to sue me and to drag our family name through the courts," he wrote.
In the middle of 2016, Colin wrote a Letter to the court that he had tried to meet the claims of his brother.
"Our father wouldn't have wanted Paul and I would end up in our current dispute," he said, and added that he "still hope to have a solution".
On Friday, this hope seemed to be over.
"Our issue will be solved in the near future by the courts," wrote Colin.
Trump's new chief of staff plans, the media-abstinence of the President to restrict.
Others have tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly you can actually do it.
If so, he will be the First.
Politico reported that the new White house chief of staff plans, the flow of information on President Trump to restrict - including the reports of the news media in the hope of keeping the boss on a more uniform rate.
Here is a piece from Reporter Josh Dawsey:
"When John F. Kelly, the new White house chief of staff, on his first day of work with the senior staff met, was he a major problem in President Donald Trumps the White house that he wanted to repair: bad information gets in the hands of the President.
Kelly said to the employees that information about him should go - whether on paper or in Briefings because the President would make better decisions if he were to receive good information."
Kelly's diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to tame Trump, by monitoring its media diet.
President Trumps relationship to the television stretches back decades - and now that he is in the White house, his TV advertising is still strong.
"If a candidate Trump was angry because of an unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he received a fair reporting of the Bodies were convincing," said former campaign consultant Sam Nunberg in February to Politico.
Politicos Tara Palmeri wrote at the time, to hold that "the key Trumps Twitter habit under control, according to six former election officials is to ensure that his personal media consumption involves a steady praise."
Okay.
But the idea that trump's Twitter habit was ever "under control", is ridiculous.
Maybe these campaign officials know something we don't know other - that trump's Tweets have included without your intervention even more explosive.
We will probably never know anything about the Tweets, the Trump has not been sent.
If his staff made it a few times already, Trouble to stay away from him, then you have paid off your efforts.
But no one can consistently prevent Trump Controversies.
Part of the problem is that the people in the White house, the competing parties, trying again and again, advance their own Agenda by presenting Trump Material that may benefit your views of the world.
Politico - the whole of this history has reported in may on the preference of the consultant, to the President for strategic reasons, dubious information.
This was an example that was described by Reporter Shane gold makers:
"Current and former Trump officials say that Trump like a volcano can respond to negative press clippings, especially those with damaging leaks, and that he find out himself, where does this come from.
This is what happened at the end of February, as someone gave the President maliciously a printed copy of an article from gotnews.com the Website of the Internet Provocateur Charles C. Johnson, who accused the Deputy chief of Staff Katie Walsh, "to be the source behind a bunch of leaks" in the White house.
Although Johnson was banished due to the bullying permanently from Twitter, or that he has offered no concrete evidence or that he has expressed in the past, false allegations, and revoked.
Trump to read the article and began to question employees about Walsh."
Gold-maker added that the former chief of staff, Reince Priebus, and the General Secretary of the White house, Rob Porter, "have tried to implement a System to manage the paperwork and document the Trump."
How has that worked out?
Kelly tries to three months later to do the same.
Maybe he will prove himself as a more effective Manager as Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive Self, and his advisers are still striving for influence.
These unchangeable factors make Kelly's Mission very difficult.

The Numbers have increased this time and it has even seen a horse in the Park area."
A spokeswoman for the Council of Solihull said: "We are in an unauthorised camp on the Land across the street, brook Road aware and work together with the police of Solihulls. We will take the necessary legal steps, in order to draw as quickly as possible.

The panel had taken in the past few weeks, the work, wrote the "Wall Street Journal", citing persons familiar with the issue.
The newspaper interpreted the move as a sign that Mueller has extended his investigations and intensified.
The transmitter CNN reported that there were already first subpoenas of the Board in connection with a Meeting between trump's oldest son and a Russian lawyer.
U.S. intelligence agencies accuse the Kremlin for some time, specifically in the presidential campaign of 2016 meddled with.

The "Washington Post" wrote a few weeks ago, the special investigator is going to put Trump in person to the centre, and the allegation, whether the President had impeded in the course of the affair may be the judiciary.
The main purpose of Grand juries is to examine this evidence in possible felony cases and to decide whether charges are to be levied.
Grand juries are called, therefore, prosecution chambers.
Most of them are turned on, if it is larger and controversial cases.
The procedure always takes place behind closed doors.

In the midst of new revelations, the President took advantage of on Thursday evening a speech in West Virginia, the Russia-represent the affair as a campaign of his political opponents.
"The Russia story is a total invention," said Trump.
The theme will give the Democrats a chance "to feel good, because you have nothing else, you can talk to."
His special adviser Ty Cobb said in a statement that he knew nothing of the appointment of a Grand Jury.
These work but usually in Secret, he stressed.
The White house support any measures that accelerated the work of the special investigator on "fair" way.
The former FBI chief James Comey told three Times, that is not against the President will be determined.
You have no reason to assume that something has changed, the statement said.
Mueller had been first used, after Trump had fired Comey.
Because of this player being kicked out allegations against Trump had become loud, he didn't want to impede the course of justice.
Comey testified in June before a Senate Committee, Trump asked him a setting of the investigation against the former national security Advisor, Michael Flynn.
The President is due to the investigation under a lot of pressure.
According to US media, the White house was collecting Material against the special Prosecutor and his staff.
The speculations sparked about whether Trump Mueller wool released.
Unlike an independent special investigators of the Congress, such as in the Watergate affair to the later resigned President Richard Nixon, Mueller a Position in which he could theoretically be at the Insistence of the President from the Ministry of justice fired.
Several senators of both parties want to prevent such a step.
Two groups of Republican and democratic senators introduced on Thursday the draft law, according to which the special investigator is no longer so easy to dismiss.
Antarctica: Giant iceberg floating in the Antarctic
In the West Antarctic has solved a gigantic iceberg of almost seven times the size of Berlin from the ice shelf.
The, the Bremerhaven Alfred-Wegener-Institute for Polar - and marine research announced on Wednesday.
Of the more than a trillion tons and the 5800-square-kilometer Behemoth driving now to the North and will probably need two to three years, until it was melted.
It is 175 kilometres in length and a width of up to 50 kilometres, one of the largest ice giants, the registered researchers in the past three decades.
A hazard for people not of him.
The extent to which climate change has a role in the crash of the iceberg played, according to researchers information unclear.
Overall, however, there have been around for 30 years, a series of unusual breakdowns of Eisschelfen in the Region, writes the U.S. center for snow and ice (NSIDC) in a facts background.
According to many researchers, could be related to the global warming.
The broken colossus has been a part of the Larsen-C ice shelf.
Ice shelf floats on the sea and is fed by large glaciers.
It will grow further and further into the sea and breaks off regularly.
The Larsen-C ice shelf lies to the South of South America almost to the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula.
To the North of this ice Shelf was disturbed the balance of waxes and cancel a few years ago.
A complete ice shelf is disintegrating, writes AWI researcher Daniela Jansen.
There is some evidence that the Larsen-C ice shelf was in danger, because the front edge was pulled never so far back as is currently the case.
In addition, the sheet of ice under tension and could decay, if at a key point in a piece of aborting.
The melting of the ice shelf and iceberg does not increase the level of the sea, because you float on the water and ice, so much water it displaces, how it is obtained after melting.
However, the loss of the ice Shelf means that the glaciers can flow into the sea much faster drain than before.
This might increase the sea level may, however, only to a lesser extent, the UK research project for the observation of the Antarctic (Midas).
The Larsen-C ice shelf, according to AWI data with almost 50 000 square kilometres, the fourth largest ice shelf of Antarctica.
At the Transition from the mainland, it is up to 700 metres thick, the front edge of the free ocean to approximately 200 meters.
Where it breaks on a regular basis.
"Although it is a natural Happening and we have no direct connection to climate change is aware of, the ice sheet is now in a more sensitive Position," said Martin O'leary from the UK's Swansea University.
"This is the longest retreat since the beginning of the records," confirmed he.
Among the scientists was controversial whether the Larsen C ice shelf, will now re-grow or in the long term, go back and may be the case, said his colleague, Adrian Luckman, and added: "Our models say that it will be less stable".
But this development will take decades.
Even if these researchers do not attribute the crash of this giant iceberg on climate change, so very many ice shelves of the Antarctic in recent decades, however, half of the island decay.
This long tip of the Antarctic extends in the direction of South America.
According to the data of the research programme, British Antarctic Survey, the ice in the Antarctic has gone back to the Peninsula since the 1950s, to 28 000 square kilometres.
To a decrease in the temperature rise contributed.
The Antarctic Peninsula have warmed in the last 50 years by about three degrees and counting in order to the areas where the temperature is rising the fastest.
The CDU wants to in-house collective of the staff
Because it is increasingly difficult to fill vacant Posts, demands that the CDU, from the employers ' Association to withdraw, in order to be more attractive.
Just before the summer break, the district has 41 new jobs in the administration waved on through.
More than 1100 employees and civil servants working for the district administration of Mettmann.
Now 17 trainees have their first day of work.
The teaching points of the circle are obviously very sought after.
Some 620 applications were reported for this year to be awarded places.
However, more staff is missing from the circle to the increased requirements and tasks.
Currently, there are in the district of Mettmann, as before, 50 is not occupied.
Be sought, among other things, Doctors and engineers, as well as powers of General administration.
The CDU would like to take in the district Council together with the FDP and the UWG, the Initiative and the shortage of skilled workers in the administration.
The administration should develop according to the request of the parties, "a concept for Personnel recruitment and personnel development".
The aim is to cover only short-term needs for skilled employees, but future-oriented counter of the candidate shortage, it says.
The overall concept should be oriented to the inside and the outside, concrete measures for career changers show and an education campaign will include, to the request of the CDU, FDP and the UWG.
The sounds try to find a good approach.
Because the circle has nothing to do with Personal problems, which you knew before.
Other cities attract good civil servants and employees, and offer more attractive terms and conditions.
The talk is of a "competitive public employer".
A high number of employees leaving by age or disease due to service.
It's high time to take Action so that jobs remain unfilled.
But Klaus-Dieter Völker, head of the Faction of the CDU, his party still on the common application.
He was recently in the district Council for a fist-thick Surprise, as he turned the staff cost ceiling to the public in question and the rest of the parties stunned.
Peoples would like to that all the possibilities are checked, the allow a discharge from the municipal employers ' Association.
"If we don't come here in the short term, to a satisfactory solution, it should aim at the district administration with the trade unions, perhaps also in cooperation with the member towns of a home tariff," says peoples.
Thus, the CDU tried to pay the employees and officials, as it is the tariff order provides for the Public service.
The salaries are currently prescribed exactly, increases or more money there are only if you change to a higher level, based on years on the job.
However, the tasks of the circle has grown in recent years, more and more.
Only a few weeks ago, new rooms had to be set up, in which employees take care of the provisions of the new prostitutes-protection law.
Not least due to the increasing number of asylum-seekers district administrator Thomas Hendele and circle Director Martin Richter have a Problem: they have too little staff.
Italy tightened up the sound to NGO-migrants-rescue boats
Italy has warned NGOs that use rescue boats for migrants in the Mediterranean sea, that they may not continue to do that, if you adhere to the new rules for their operations.
"If NGOs don't see the new code of conduct to sign, it is difficult to know how you can continue to work," said Minister of the interior Marco Minniti in an Interview with the Turin daily newspaper La Stampa.
Minnitis warning came a day after the Italian authorities had confiscated a boat of the German charity organisation 'youth Saves', because their team had effectively worked with human traffickers in a manner that facilitated the illegal immigration.
The charity, which is only a year in operation, declined to comment on the detailed allegations of the Italian state Prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.
"For us, the rescue of human life is and remains our top priority. We're so very sorry that we can't operate at the Moment in the Search - and-rescue zone," said the organization in a statement on the social media.
"We can assess all the allegations that are currently collected, only after we have gathered all of the information and the Situation can be assessed."
The Italian authorities had monitored the boat from 'youth Saves', Iuventa, since October.
It is believed that his crew boat taking migrants on Board, which will be delivered to you directly by traffickers, and the smugglers can exit, so that the ships can be used again.
At least one such meeting took place, allegedly, only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast, according to the act of the Prosecutor, the content of the Italian media was published.
The crew is suspected, the authority of the Italian coast guard, the rescue operations in the Zone for humanitarian reasons and not for any other motives monitored.
Under the code of conduct boats like the Iuventa need to have an Italian police officer on Board, which monitors their activities.
Only three of the nine NGOs that are involved in Search - and-rescue operations, have stated that they are prepared to keep to the Code: Save the Children, MOAS from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain.
The latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered to be unnecessary, but acceptable as they would not bring "significant Changes or disabilities" of their rescue operations.
Among those who draw refuse, the Nobel prize laureate organization, Doctors without borders (MSF).
Minniti said that the number of migrants who arrived after the rescue operations in Italy, had declined in the last few weeks, which indicates that the efforts to strengthen the Libyan coast guard and the cooperation with the local mayors fruits've worn.
"In the last few days we have started to see the light at the end of the tunnel," said the Minister.
He announced plans for further talks with Libyan mayors in this month on economic development initiatives, and with Chad, Niger and Mali, on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving these countries in the hope of Europe.

On the second day we went to Bad Dürkheim for the Saline and for the folk festival sausage market.
Again the view point placed at a vantage point, connected by "flowing" Trials and moderate climbs.
On the last two days a lot of height meters were all the rage.
Caves, rocks, towers, castles, ruins and retreat huts brought a welcome break.
In Bad Dürkheim, the bikers inhaled in the open air inhalatorium healing Sole.

Console instead of grass - the Bundesliga is gearing up for E-sports
The sports Stars sit in the future in front of computer consoles, instead of fighting through the sweat in the Wind and weather on the stadium turf?
Fact is E-sports has long since become a serious industry, a lucrative business - the big Stars, millions of Fans and huge tournaments with high fees included.
In the eyes of the first Bundesliga clubs, which have become increasingly involved in this area.
The beginning of the VfL Wolfsburg made it to 2015, and later FC Schalke 04 and, most recently, VfB Stuttgart, founded in mid-July, an E-sports Department and two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17 under contract took, followed.
"We hope to inspire a new, young target groups for the VfB," says Board of management Jochen Röttgermann.
He is sure "that this train several clubs upgrade".
This coming weekend, the world soccer Association FIFA in London, the first "Interactive Club World Cup", where the gamers from different Clubs compete against each other organized.
In addition to Schalke and Wolfsburg, for example, Manchester City, Paris Saint-qualified-Germain and PSV Eindhoven.
Robin Dutt sees great potential in E-sports.
The Ex-coach of Bayer Leverkusen and Werder Bremen advises, in the meantime, an Agency for virtual football players.
"The real football must deal specifically with the 14 to 30 Year-olds, the young people go in the future to the stadium," says the 52-Year-old.
And The clubs tried all the possible markets to conquer, especially the Asian,.
With prominent E-sports under contract, you could be online much more often present in those markets, than to send only once in a year, the Bundesliga team to Asia.
What is it exactly?
E-sports computer be fought games like "League Of Legends", "Dota 2", "Counterstrike", or the football Simulation FIFA on a competitive level.
Long have been well established, as in the normal Sport, the leagues in which the professionals compete against each other.
And at the Asian games in 2022 E-sports is already a part of the official programme.
But it is actually a proper sport?
For many, the idea needs getting used to.
Ingo Froböse has set itself apart with the question.
For the Professor at the German sport University in Cologne, Germany E-Sport is a Sport because it is competitive and many of the biological and physical reactions show that you also find in a classic sports - for example, increased heart rates, stress responses, hormonal changes.
In addition, there is a need for cognitive skills, a technical and tactical understanding and a quick response ability.
A professional Gamer should not only train at the console, but also your body and on the diet.
"The fittest player is a good player."
Froböse but he also sees problems: "Doping is becoming more of an issue".
Checks Play Online difficult to perform, and in the scene, the structures of the classical Sports were missing.
Positively, the scientist highlights the high integrative effect of E-Sports.
The players are traveling internationally, this is like a big global family, since there is no inter-cultural barriers.
A study by the consulting firm Deloitte and the German Federal Association of Interactive entertainment software (BIU) says the E-Sport is a fast-paced growth.
2016 had been implemented in Germany 50 million euros, mainly relating to the advertising, sponsorship and major events.
In three years, sales are expected to be 130 million.
Against approximately € 2.4 billion, the Bundesliga, the is little.
However, the E-Sport not far "distant from the other more established sports such as Handball, Basketball or ice hockey," the Deloitte consultants.
Internationally, many countries that are more advanced.
Big markets are Asia and the USA, where Ex-basketball player Shaquille O'neal and baseball star Alex Rodriguez to participate on the US Team NRG eSports.
Hollywood actor Ashton Kutcher invested in the eSport-betting provider Unikrn.
Also in Europe a lot going on.
In a Norwegian school E-sports as a subject is introduced, says Froböse.
In the Netherlands and in France, the football League clubs are obliged, according to Dutt, in the meantime, an E-sports division.
"In a European comparison, Germany is lagging behind," says VfB management Board Röttgermann.
Only to fall into nostalgia, and to glorify the ancient times, is no longer sufficient today.
It is going to preserve the Tradition of the Association, but the company at the same time, in the modern market.
"We live in a digitized world," says Dutt.
"Since you can't hold on to the fact that only in football, everything stays as it always was."

Michelle Carter, convicted of the texts, the Conrad Roy's urging to suicide, 
A woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years, because she has encouraged her boyfriend through texts and calls to the suicide.
Michelle Carter, now 20, will spend 15 months of their sentencing behind bars and five years were suspended to probation.
Carter was convicted in June of negligent homicide of Conrad Roy, of the 13. July 2014, took the life.
The father of Roy, said on Thursday at the hearing: "My family is heartbroken.
My son was my best friend."
Carter was allowed to remain until the appeal.
She had been faced with a maximum penalty of 20 years, but their legal representatives argued that both she and Mr. Roy were suffering from a mental illness.
In red pants and a cream-colored blouse dressed, stand Carter with tears in their eyes, with folded hands and downward eyes, as she was sentenced.
"Your actions have killed Conrad Roy," said the Prosecutor to the court.
"You ended his life, to make your own better.
She has taken no responsibility," she said.
"She has shown no remorse".
But Carter's lawyer said it was a "terrible circumstance that you regret."
Judge Lawrence Moniz said, however, he had not found out that your "age or degree of maturity or even mental illness have a significant influence on their actions".
A Prosecutor read a statement from Roy's mother, Lynn Roy, said that there "is no day that I mourn the loss of my beloved son.
I would like to, that he is proud of me and how I deal with it all. I'm trying, in spite of all my pain we will carry for eternity with us, to be there for his sisters as," it States.
Roy's sister, Camdyn Roy, said that she will followed by the realization that she would never attend the wedding of her brother or an aunt for his children would be.
To "not have this, the only Person I was since my birth, every day is a pain, I'll keep it for the Rest of my life with me," she said.
The case appears to set a legal precedent, because there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to have a different urge to commit suicide.
Carter was 17 years old when Roy, in the year 2014 dead of carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle was found.
The case drew national attention after Carter's text messages revealed that she had encouraged him to end his life.
"Hang you, jump off a building, stab yourself, I don't know, there are a lot of ways," she said in several messages that she had sent in the two weeks prior to his death, while he was with his family on vacation.
In the moments before his suicide wrote: "You have to do it, Conrad," and "All you have to do is turn on the Generator and you'll be free and happy."
Judge Moniz said that Carter was looking for attention by the death of Roy, and ordered that they should benefit by any press of the case.
The case has divided legal opinion.
Was one of the few that defended Carter, Amanda Knox, who was convicted in 2007 for the murder of her British roommate in Italy, before she was canonized two years ago.
Mrs. Knox, 30 years old, published in the Los Angeles Times to comment: "Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help, not prison."
Joshua Kimmich: Learn from the new Mini-Lahm of FC Bayern
That Joshua Kimmich was allowed to accumulate during the Audi Cup as a captain, is no coincidence.
FC Bayern is confident that the confederations Cup winners have a big season Extra Motivation does not hurt.
Was there something else on its place in the cabin, the Joshua Kimmich saw immediately, even if the additional piece of clothing was very, very small.
But since far and wide on the second day of the Audi Cup, of course, no Philipp Lahm and also no Manuel Neuer was, he made the attributed to binding hold on the Arm.
"The coach has not announced it," explained the confederations Cup winners, after making his first appearance as Bayern captain.
Well, the cost could have been better than that of the 0:2 against Napoli.
But the character from the Coach could suggest Kimmich.
Not the eight years his senior, Arturo Vidal had been selected in the youth players, debutants, and just out of the holiday come professionals existing C-Eleven as a captain chosen, but he.
A treat to spread on loved ones to those they want to much trusts you in a good mood.
Who was so chosen, the legacy of Lame to compete, can use a little Extra Motivation.
Kimmich confirmed: "This is what you want as a player: take on responsibility".
On Wednesday, the 22 sped-Year-old as a Mini-Lahm on the field.
Right rear, now this is his Position, the white bandage on the Arm did the Rest.
And anyway, Kimmich was in this starting lineup as the one who can take the helm of the best in the Hand.
He gave instructions, and tried, the uninvited played to direct force.
He had the eye for the Whole, while many others were busy with themselves.
Vidal, dubbing his lack of Fitness (work); Renato Sanches, come hell or high water, to the benefits of the trip to Asia to build (worked only partially); and Sebastian Rudy and Niklas Süle, in their first appearance in a Bayern Jersey not to stand out negatively.
It worked after all, quite well.
Süle on delivery in addition to Kimmich, the Rudy in front of the defense, both of which were scores.
The naming-studded Napoli-storm fact, often difficult, moreover, Süle also dabbled in game design a few Times successfully.
His colleague Rudy admitted that the result "was so, as we may have hoped for".
But he also showed the debut of a decent performance.
Game relocation, change of pace: "For this style, I was taken, Yes".
How unusual this Bavaria-the world is still for the newcomers, saw you after the game.
Rudy, for example, was not one in the catacombs or two, but six or seven Interviews.
Kimmich said goodbye to a few crisp statements in the back of his new teammates.
There he heard of Süle an interesting sentence: "What's going on here, I noticed now.
At Bayern you have to win every game".
After all, he no longer has to teach the New.

Company praises satisfied with the Rhineland Riesling Minister: economic Wissings pace
It was often unforgiving, the relationship between the country and the regional economy, Eveline Lemke (Green) Minister of economic Affairs of Rhineland-Palatinate.
The shows after more than a year, the new economy Minister, Volker Wissing (FDP) is in the office.
Chambers and companies from the Region speak on T V-request of a change in economic policy and blame at the same time the old Minister.
Frank Natus, the Chairman of the Association of Trier company (VTU), says: "Wissing takes the wishes of the economy, and Lemke has all of them blocked".
The biggest u-turn sees Natus in infrastructure policy: The gap at the end of highway 1 between Kelberg and Adenau is in the priority list of the country now.
This year, the Ministry hopes to have a plan-approval procedure, up to 2021, the construction should be real.
A role in the plans of the country, the West bypass Trier, which is in urgent need of the Federal traffic routes plan plays.
The goal is to take the route in December 2020, in operation, says Ministry spokeswoman Cornelia Holtmann.
Natus sees it as a signpost, to support regional, but internationally competing companies.
The chamber of Commerce and industry (IHK) of Trier is aiming for, like Wissing, a Rheinland-Pfalz suggested that the wine Label, in order to increase the sales in supermarkets and to stop the Trend of the last ten years, the sagging German wine exports.
In addition, Wissing have an open ear for people who want to start your own company, praised the chamber of Commerce and industry.
The chamber of crafts Trier sees in the new master-with the Bonus of an additional incentive for young apprentices, says managing Director Matthias Schwalbach.
Is provided for a premium of 1000 Euro for having passed the master's examination and 2500 Euro, when graduates within ten years after the most training independently.
The homework list for the country, however, remains long.
In the case of the planned road construction quick facts are, at the same time, it lacks the necessary personnel, says Jan Glock Auer, chief Executive of the chamber of industry and Commerce Trier.
Of 56 new engineers who want to set Wissing in the country of operation, mobility, yet only 29 Bodies occupied.
The chamber of Commerce and industry calls for to award more contracts to external agencies.
CDU Deputy Christian Baldauf refers to calculations of the court of auditors, the country is investing in 2017 and 2018, more than 20 million euros less in the maintenance of rural roads as proposed.
Frank Natus is also a concept of the country as it seeks to resolve the shortage of skilled workers in the Region.
Sobering, the current expansion of broadband in the country is also.
In 2016, the regional companies had a rating of the power supply in a chamber of Commerce survey, only with the touch of 3.4.
You dam Internet connections and crashes of stock.
Ex-Minister of economic Affairs Eveline Lemke is currently out of the policy, and still sits on the Supervisory Board of the wind power Pro of Wind.
The Greens left Lemke for April to become President of a private University of applied Sciences in Karlsruhe - where they conceded after only four months due to disagreements already in the field.
Audi should change with 850,000 diesel-powered vehicles - the auto manufacturers see a reaction face
A day before the announcement of Audi, BMW said that it would offer to update the Software in more than 350,000 vehicles.
The BMW Chairman, said the company is of the opinion that "there are smarter options than driving restrictions", and referred to on European cities - including Munich, where BMW is based, to ban diesel vehicles or limit.
Daimler announced Tuesday that it will modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe, in order to reduce its Diesel emissions.
None of the companies described the companies as a callback.
European car manufacturers have encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to the observance of rules for carbon dioxide-in support of emissions.
But the nitrogen oxides, which emit diesel engines are considered carcinogenic and can cause Asthma.
To install the costs for the automotive manufacturer, equipment for the neutralization of diesel vehicles, emission of pollutants, to take also, which makes it difficult to keep the price of the car competitive.
The German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, is also accused of coddling the powerful car companies and to ignore signs of a problem.
The companies try to avoid the mistakes of Volkswagen, driving the use of so-called shut-off devices, which were able to regulate emissions in order to comply with the rules, if a car has been tested, but under normal driving conditions.
In the United States, a number of employees of Volkswagen were accused of, others will be examined on both sides of the Atlantic.
In the past month, the former head of the thermodynamics was arrested in engine development by Audi in Germany.
The former Manager, Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio, is Italian and is therefore not protected prior to delivery and could be made in the United States before the court.
At the beginning of this year, Audi was included in German criminal investigations in the case of Volkswagen, after the authorities Audi accused to have a System installed, in order to circumvent the emission regulations in Europe, and a request, which focused on the United States, has been extended.
The involvement of Audi in the investigation could weigh on Volkswagen hard: The luxury car manufacturer contributes disproportionately to the profits of Volkswagen.

Lavender from the Provence region, threatened by climate change
He has become a Symbol of the Provence in the South of France, but there is a warning that he is threatened by climate change.
The lavender is due to drought-like conditions and because of the diseases-transmitting insects is declining, scientists and farmers are trying to find solutions, big headache.
Eric Chaisse, expert of the agricultural research Institute CRIEPPAM in Provence, said: "The lavender in Provence is effectively compromised, because the Plant was exposed to in the past few years, the effects of climate change, which has brought in the spring, much less rain, and in the autumn a lot more.
This has an impact on the life of lavender.
There is also a small Cicada, a micro bacterium that transmits cicadas Dwarf, and in very dry weather, there are very many of them."
And there is a lot at stake.
Lavender oil not only attracts for vacationers, it is also in demand for perfume and cosmetics.
Eric Chaisse said: "Instead of very long plants ears with a large number of flowers, we have smaller, less developed, and either missing or weakened.
So we have less parts with essential Oil."
Among the solutions that should be considered, a better distribution of water and slowing the evaporation from the soil, but also the Spraying of the plants with a protective mixture of clay and water, and the development of varieties resistance to drought and more resilient.
The town of Geisa in the Thuringian Rhön is celebrating its 1200 anniversary.
Festival highlight this Saturday and Sunday with a medieval festival.
Krämer, guilds, traders, vagabonds, or a Landsknecht to experience these days in the city.

The staff of the weekly newspaper Riodoce normally meet on Wednesdays to check their plans for coverage of the recent Chaos in the state of Sinaloa by organized crime, corrupt officials and incessant drug wars.
But on this day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, came together to talk about safety.
It was communicated to you that it is important to change your routines.
Two senior journalists discuss what feels safe: you should take your children with you to the office, which in 2009 were the target of an attack with grenades, or to leave them at home.
Security experts have written three words on a blackboard at the front of the room: enemy, neutral, ally.
You ask the Reporter, the name for each column to propose - no proof is needed, perceptions, and gut feelings.
There are drug smugglers, politicians, business people, journalists, who are suspected to be on the payroll of the government or the cartels, a catalog of criminals that make the Chaos of Mexico is dangerous.
There is no respite from the violence, and while in the whole country, the bodies pile up, more and more journalists and at least 25 since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012, his office. 589 to attacks and threats under Federal protection, and up to now, this year there were at least seven Dead in seven States.
Among the latter, your editor and inspirer of Riodoce, the co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.
"The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and to be a Journalist," wrote Valdez in one of his numerous books on drug-related violence.
His Absence will be deeply felt, although his presence is everywhere - a large photo of Valdez showing his middle finger with the word "Justice" hangs on the facade of the Riodoce-building. Two reporters in the thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wearing T-Shirts that show his smiling face with glasses or the typical Panama hat.
The Workshop will take place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared issues, the Trauma, nightmares, insomnia, Paranoia.
Although in 2010, a special Federal Prosecutor, was built to process the cases of journalists, has launched, according to the Committee to protect journalists, only two criminal cases.
Like most of the Thousands of murders, which are associated each year with drug trafficking and organised crime, the killers of journalists are rarely in court.
In the case of Riodoce you still insist to deal with the violence of Sinaloa, even though you are heartbroken and although the Terrain is now even more treacherous.
Without information about the killer, without justice, to Use the Meeting to discuss the security of bit, says Ibarra.
"It is very stupid to waste my time in this Workshop", he says.
"As long as we don't know the Why, we distrust all of them."
On the Morning of the 15. May left Valdez, the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the state capital of Culiacan.
He managed only to drive a few Blocks before a red Toyota Corolla between two men was stopped. He was forced out of his car, and 12 Times has a shot on him, probably because of the Name of the newspaper - which is translated with "Twelfth river".
The shooter drove away in his car, and damaged it in the vicinity.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He left behind a wife and two adult children.
Rumors tend to be in Culiacan free to move around.
But on the topic of Valdez, there is practically nothing more than Silence.
Since the Guzmans arrest in the past year, and the extradition to the United States in January of Sinaloa had become one of the bloodiest battle fields of the country, as rival factions fight to fill the vacuum.
It doesn't matter that in Sinaloa, every day someone or multiple people to be shot on the street, or that the cemetery is full of ornate two-story mausoleums for drug kings, which are larger than many of the houses for the Living.
You forget for a Minute that there is a state of "rest", if only one cartel is in control of the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug-trafficking routes in the United States.
Nevertheless, and despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, is Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and Director of Riodoce broken, with the blame for the fact that he couldn't protect his friend.
He believes that there are two misconceptions have contributed to the murder.
First of all, it was in February, the publication of an interview with Damaso Lopez, a leader of one of the rival cartel factions in the war of the sons with the Guzmans.
This publication may have angered the sons, suspected gang members bought every copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to newspaper kiosks.
The second mistake was to force Valdez, after the seizure of a other newspaper that had published the same story, to leave the country for his own safety.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is regarded as a milestone in the Mexico violence against journalists.
He had survived for so long, that his friends and colleagues assumptions, that he would always be there.
He was in 2003, as an experienced Reporter for Noroeste, as he joined with five colleagues to the founding of Riodoce and 50 U.S. dollars investments sold.
In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to pursue journalism without the drugs to encounter Problem," said Bojorquez.
With time, the newspaper has earned a reputation for the courageous and honest reporting, and sales and advertising.
Reporters loved it, to hard striking investigations, without fear of censorship, publishing, and the readers were fascinated by a publication in which you were able to read stories that no one dared to treat otherwise.
Eight years after the founding of Riodoce, she received the prestigious "Maria Moors Cabot prize" for their reporting in Latin America.
In the same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee to protect journalists for his courage in pursuit of the Mexican drug history, wherever she was heading.
He admitted voluntarily that he was afraid.
"I want more life," he said at the time of the CPJ award.
Drug trafficking in Sinaloa "is a way of life," he said last October in an Interview with Rompeviento TV.
"You need to take on the task that falls to you as a Journalist - either that, or they play Dumb.
I don't want to be asked: "What did you do in the face of so many dead done ... why didn't you tell me what was going on?"
The Riodoce Team missed Valdez, the Joker, was like swearing a dock worker, the friend who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.
They trusted his Routine.
He would always wear his hat.
He would always to El Guayabo, the Bar across from the office, and always sit at the same table.
Now you ask: Was his Ruin, his love of Routine?
His death has also forced them to make their own assumptions about it in question, as you do your best work and can stay alive for.
"You don't like it when they with their wives, their children, their clean stores, your home business Start and the country," to move drugs, to deal with.
"These things were not allowed," said Bojorquez.
The result is a high degree of self-censorship and self-preservation, even at the best of times.
His own instincts to trust.
If it smells wrong, stay away from it.
The Trouble is, said the editor of Riodoce Andres Villarreal, that "smell is a sense that can be deceived ... and then the thing with Javier's happened."
The old rules, as he and others say, do not apply in Sinaloa no longer - in the same way as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other States where a toxic mix of lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt government officials home.
The landscape is constantly changing.
In the room In which the employees of Riodoce of the security training met were suddenly no cell phones allowed. Days earlier, it was known that Spyware, which is sold exclusively to governments, has been used to Monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.
Outside, two police officers sought shelter from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shade of a tree.
They were commissioned by the government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-storey building in a middle-class neighborhood of Culiacan.
Half in jest, asked some of the reporters, whether these officers belong to the 50 per cent, of the policemen, the Governor described himself as not trustworthy.
It's been months since the Reporter went to the mountain landscape, where the drug gangs are de facto under control.
For the edition of this week Riodoce has looked at three main stories.
There was the murder of the brother of the former well-known boxer Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.
They also had an Exposé of the state expenditure, which focused on the home city of the Governor.
And there was a group, which is located in one of the most expensive Restaurants in Culiacan, a Block from the office of the state attorney, a kidnapping.
There was no official word about who's been kidnapped or how it happened, so caution was required, as it was time to write what everyone knows in the city: the Restaurant is a favorite haunt of drug dealers and the authorities.
A Reporter learned from public records that the Restaurant was registered under the name of a politician belonging to the ruling Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), the all political levels, dominated almost the whole century.
Recently, several PRI were accused of-governors because of the high profile cases of corruption.
Villarreal asked the Reporter to write about previous incidents in this Local, including one who escaped in the a son of "El Chapo" Guzman, a military RAID.
Only a few months earlier, the readers had seen the column of Valdez as the best-informed source about the abduction.
"In the past, we would have known what happened," said Villarreal, 46, nicknamed "El Flaco" due to his slender body stature.
"Now, all the channels of communication with our sources are broken."
The office of Valdez, was reclassified to the storage room for signs and stickers protesting against the killings of journalists, because the employees are to become something what you would expect to never: activists in the name of the press.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez grabbed a couple of signs and went the next Morning to a Demonstration because of a further journalist to the office of the state attorney.
Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez was killed in the Western state of Michoacan.
A burnt body was discovered and officials say, based on DNA Tests, that it is his.
Across the country, journalists have become loud, they wrote in organized protests, "SOS Press" on sidewalks and buildings.
On this day, the Director Bojorquez is the way in Washington and is trying to gather international support for justice in the case of Valdez.
At a Meeting with the Governor of Sinaloa on the day after the murder of Valdez is accused Ramirez of the authorities, journalists, to spy and to kill you, because you have told the truth.
She has since asked that it is classified by the government again, because she is worried that your anger has hurt your objectivity.
Valdez had repeatedly said that the journalists were surrounded in Mexico of organized crime, involved government officials and an indifferent society "".
In his last book, "Narco-Journalism," he wrote that reporters are not only killed by drug gangs, but also on the orders of politicians and security forces were in League with organized crime under a blanket.
The media-watchdog group "Article 19" has associated with in the past year, more than half of the attacks on journalists by the police and officials.
"In Mexico, you die, because they want you to shut your mouth," said Ramirez.
Obviously the killings have a deterrent effect.
No one can forget the death of the blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the Northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago.
Her body was found along with a note, which was allegedly signed by the Zetas cartel: "I'm Here because of my reports."
A computer keyboard and headphones were next to her severed head.
Some stores have chosen to close, as the newspaper El Norte in the Northern border state of Chihuahua after the murder of the correspondent Miroslava Breach in March.
Others, like El Manana of Nuevo Laredo after the assassination of its Director in 2004.
In 2010, the Diario de Ciudad Juarez, was directed publicly to the drug cartels with an editorial on the front page with the Headline, "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists have fled their home States or even out of the country.
It is a painful decision.
It is difficult to find work in exile, and they'll still be watching the roads and looking for hazards.
And sometimes they are hunted, as Ruben apparently, the photographer Espinosa, was murdered in 2015 together with four women in an apartment in Mexico city, three months after the escape from Veracruz.
For those who stay back and continue the work, it is a daily dance with risk decisions.
Ibarra, who once wanted to be a Poet, admits that the drug trade scared him.
"Mexico is going to hell, and that's why I became a Reporter," he said.
At midnight on the last Friday, when the last edition was already finished, sitting with the editors of Riodoce on the sidewalk in front of the office and drank beer, as all their phones began to buzz.
A series of shootings with band rivals and security forces in the vicinity of the seaside resort of Mazatlan had left 19 confirmed Dead.
The war escalated further, as it was promised by a number of antitrust embassies in the Region.
From the curb you have posted the news on the Website of Riodoce on cell phone.
The title page had to be changed the next day.
Sirens sounded in close proximity to - another shooting in the area.
Bojorquez took a look at the police officers, the guard stopped to see if they were ready for use.
If you ever had fear of not showed you it.
Under the huge portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper, whose middle finger was for the whole of Sinaloa visible, followed by the employees of Riodoce in his footsteps.
"How can you close even to think," said Bojorquez, "if on the same day that Javier was killed, the Intern asked me to send you the reporting on the street."
Dinosaurs used camouflage to his enemies to Dodge
At first glance, it looks like a Statue, albeit a frightening one.
Now, researchers have found out that the first findings of the incredible Rhino, a canadian miner, have been so well preserved, that experts have described it as "the Mona Lisa of dinosaurs".
It was so well preserved that you could even notice that his scaly skin was of a reddish brown and you said you had something of a "troubled past".
The report in the journal "Current Biology" referred to him as "the best-preserved armored dinosaurs ever found, and one of the best dinosaur specimens in the world".
The Fossil is a newly discovered type of Nodosaurier, who lived in the mid-Cretaceous period between 110 million and 112 million years ago.
Its incredibly well-preserved condition has baffled researchers, who describe it as "really remarkable", 
According to Reports in National Geographic, the armored plant-eater is the best-preserved Fossil of its kind.
It was found by Shawn Funk, as he on 21. In March 2011, the Suncor Millennium Mine near Fort McMurray in Northern Alberta, Canada, grub.
He hit on something which seemed to be from the surrounding rocks out of place, and decided to take a closer look.
The discovered Fossil was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paläontology.
They spent the next six years, the wild animal within the 2,500-pound (1,100 kg) heavy Erdklumpens uncover.
After all this hard work, the finished result is now ready to be revealed.
"If you blink just a little with the eyes, you could almost believe that it has slept," said lead author Caleb Brown, a scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where to see the creature.
"It will go down in the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best-preserved dinosaur specimens - the Mona Lisa of dinosaurs."
Researchers have found that this plant-eater, though he is covered with armor and change the armor resembles, probably from meat-eating dinosaurs have been threatened.
The heavily armored dinosaurs used a red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and used a shielding technique, which is called counter-shading is known, which is also used by many modern animals.
This would have allowed it to blend in with his environment and his enemies to avoid, experts say, suggesting that it was threatened by the larger dinosaurs.
The 110-million-year-old creature from the family of Nodosaurier made in may for the first time, the headlines and is now on view in the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.
Researchers have now studied the wild animal and it Borealopelta mark mitchelli after the Museum technician Mark Mitchell called, a Team that has spent more than 7,000 hours, uncover it carefully.
The amazing preservation of the specimen made it possible for Dr. Mitchell and an international Team of scientists to document the pattern and the Form of scales and armor on his body.
They discovered the Counter-shading, a common method of Defense in the animal Kingdom, which means that the top of the creature was darker than your base.
Although the Counter-shading is common, the results are surprising, since the size of Borealopelta far exceeds that of the animals alive today.
It suggests that the dinosaur was hunted by sufficient pressure by carnivorous dinosaurs, and that Evolution favored the concealment of the confrontation as a means of Survival.
But the most contemporary animals use Counter-shading - think of deer, Zebras and armadillos - are much smaller and more vulnerable as prey, indicating that this Nodosaurier was exposed to a real fight for Survival.
"Strong Predator-show behavior on a massive, heavily armored dinosaurs, such as dangerous dinosaurs-predators of the Cretaceous must have been a time," said Brown.
The chemical analysis of organic Compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaur was red-brown.
Scientists continue to study the animal information about his life, including his preserved intestinal contents to find out what it has eaten as his last meal.
They believe that the dinosaur, when he died, fell into a river and into the sea, was driven, where he fell on his back to the sea.
At this time, Alberta is not as warm as South Florida today, and rivers, and the oceans spread is likely to be much further inland than they are today.
"This Nodosaurier is truly remarkable because he is entirely covered with tinned flaky skin, but also in three dimensions and to maintain the original shape of the animal to maintain," said Brown.
"The result is that the animal looks today almost the same as in the early Cretaceous.
You don't need to use a lot of imagination to reconstruct it. If you squint just a little with the eyes, you could almost believe that he is Sleeping."
The Cretaceous period was a time when huge theropods, carnivorous dinosaurs that stood on two legs, the earth moved.
Although the king of them, the Tyrannosaurus Rex that lived millions of years after Borealopelta, was chased by the armored dinosaurs of some of its fearsome ancestor.
The Acrocanthosaurus, a 38-foot (11.5 m) long, six-ton Monster.
The scientists, whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta was sunk after the death in the sea and in the mud mummified.
The creature was found by Shawn Funk, as he on 21. In March 2011, the Suncor Millennium Mine near Fort McMurray in Northern Alberta, Canada, grub.
According to the Museum it is the best preserved armoured dinosaurs of the world, including the skin and the armor, and is complete from the snout to the hip.
The creatures were, on average, about 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).
It contained two 20-inch-long spikes protruding from his shoulders.
The researchers believe that the armored herbivore was swept through the Western Canada, to a flooded river flooded it into the open sea.
But the underwater burial of a dinosaur on his armor, preserved in exquisite Detail.
The fossilized Remains of this particular specimen are so well preserved that the skin remains cover still bumpy armor plates along the dinosaur 
Michael Greshko for National Geographic has written, such a level of conservation as 'rare as winning the lottery.
The more I look at it, the more confusing it is.
Fossilized remains of the skin covering is still on the bumpy armor plates, which carry the skull of the animal.
His right forefoot is at his side, his five fingers splayed upwards.
I can count the dandruff on his sole'.
In Thunderstorms: a mass pile-up on A8: Many of the injured
Severe accident on Thursday evening on the A8: About 30 vehicles are involved in a mass pile-up.
There are numerous injuries, kilometers-long traffic jams, and Gaffer.
On the Stuttgart-Munich motorway (A8) were injured on late Thursday afternoon in a pileup of about 20 people.
According to initial information from the police about 17: 00 hours between Adelzhausen and Odelzhausen (district of Aichach-Friedberg) during a lightning storm, nearly 30 vehicles, including probably also truck, tangled in traffic.
The exact number of injured, no details were available.
It was mild to moderate injuries, said a police spokesman.
A large contingent of emergency vehicles was on a place of accident.
The A8 was locked in the direction of Munich entirely.
In the direction of travel of Munich around ten kilometers long backwater was formed.
As an AZ Reporter reported, it also came on the road to massive disabilities and lots of Gaffer.
The fire Department noted the license plate of the vehicle handlebar, which must now expect severe penalties.
Shortly after 18:45 p.m., a second accident occurred on the A8, this time between Augsburg Dasing.
It had come to a collision between a car Transporter and a Car.
A rescue helicopter was on the way to the crash site.
Deutsche Bahn: the group tests "comfort Check-in"
It's a Moment almost everyone has experienced: not knowing you are sitting in a train and falls asleep.
Or is engrossed in his work and has just had a brilliant thought.
And then pufff.
The conductor comes and wakes up a roughly or tears the passenger in the middle of the Workflow.
Ticket control.
But the times of the breaks are over soon.
The Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the conductor's lots of ticket control.
It is confirmed simply by mobile phone, that has taken its place and cancelled the ticket.
Currently a test running on two routes.
"The offer we are extending it.
It will then be expected to be at the beginning of next year, many other long-distance routes in Germany available," said a railway spokesman.
"Comfort Check-in" calls the train, the ticket validation without a conductor.
To be able to use, however, some requirements have to be fulfilled: You need a Smartphone or a Tablet.
And you must be an Online Ticket booked - what are already the majority of the passengers do.
You must also have the App of the web, the DB Navigator buy what is anyway the most convenient way of ticket booking.
And last, you need a seat reservation.
Because of the "comfort Check-in" works like this: You climb into the train, calling his ticket under "My Tickets".
In the case of the test customer, a Button for the electronic validation.
The train conductor to get on their mobile devices, a message that passenger X is on the train and booked seat Y has taken.
The conductor comes for the tickets to the space Y, he knows that there is a passenger already canceled Online-sitting Ticket.
So you can sleep, more work, more silence.
The "Check-in" has two advantages: one for the customer, one for the railway - which act, in turn, will pass.
"Who wants a relaxed travel without a ticket control by our on-Board staff, a check in the DB Navigator easily by yourself.
This allows the passengers to make their travel time in the train personal," says Michael Peterson, head of Marketing DB long-distance transport.
Second Plus: "our staff have more time than today, to the individual customer needs".
If track, know that in addition to delays and missed trains, the ticket checks are one of the biggest annoyances.
Because often, in any case, but one of the passengers has not all of the documents that you need for cancellation of Online Tickets.
Either the credit card or the identity card or other document, you will have to show is missing.
The result of endless discussions between the conductor and the passenger, which leads to a bad mood in the compartment or greater and delays in the control of its own Tickets and the conductor at the end of the time it takes to take care of other concerns.
Yet only a small number of test customers can use the new Service.
And eating out on the Links ICE 915 of Dortmund-Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart.
For more numbers on the same route are still not unlocked.
To learn how an activist came in, the answer to the question: "Whose Streets?"
On 9. August 2014 was rocked Brittany Ferrell up to your core.
Just a day after she arrived in New York City, sat in the St. Louis-Born on the bed of an Airbnb apartment that you rented and scrolled through Facebook on your phone.
She stumbled over a Post by someone from the High School.
"The police just killed a 18-year-old child, and it is still on the road," it said.
Confused, since no one else had posted on your Feed in the information, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
A user with the Handle @TheePharoah was constantly retweeted on your Timeline.
The Rapper from the area of St. Louis was the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-Year-old by a white police officer in Ferguson, Mo., was killed, to tweet live.
He posted a picture of brown's lifeless body was sprawled on the street and then four hours would remain.
"This is crazy", thought Ferrell.
But the death was for you and your community is nothing New.
You put your phone to return to later in the evening, Tweets about people on Canfield Drive.
There were photos from the police tape, and people were screaming, and a man who claimed to be brown's father, who wore a sign reading: "Ferguson police just killed my unarmed son!"
You are watching a Live Feed, in which a policeman ends in front of a group of protesters with a barking dog.
In another Video, she said, and unlocked another COP, his gun, and cried: "I will make you... animals kill them all."
"This is not common," recalled Ferrell said.
"This is not the kind of murder, to which we have become accustomed and which we can call typical."
In that Moment, I felt chills.
I was angry, and wept."
She booked a return flight and went home the next day.
After landing at 23, she took their 6-year-old daughter from the house of her father, and decided that the next Morning would travel to Ferguson.
What happened in the following three years, with Ferrell and Ferguson, is the subject of a new documentary film, "Whose Streets?", in cinemas from 11.
It is a story of Survival and protest, of love and of loss, the strength and the resistance force is from the point of view of the people living in the community, and the roads filled to have to demand answers.
As Ferrell with her daughter, a floral dress and a matching crown, wore, drove to Ferguson, discussed the conversation they had countless times before this Morning, "about the black experience and the black condition".
"You remember how I taught you, when black people have to fight for what they believe in?" she remembered what you said.
"We go now to Ferguson, because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and that was not right.
I couldn't take you," said Ferrell later.
"What happened today is a culmination of ... what happened in the past.
You need to know and it is therein raised to be see.
You must be well-developed, not only activism and organization, but also the various layers of the black experience and the black Constitution to know and what we need to do to be free, to liberate ourselves.
Also, if I am lucky, to give you an experience that you personally experienced any blatant racism, it is no different than the next black woman a child.
I have the feeling that I would be doing a disservice to keep them away from it."
The first Station you arrived in Ferguson, was located on South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police authority, which was Not a camp area, as the activists were waiting for the possible indictment of Officer Darren Wilson.
There Ferrell and her daughter have with a local business owner, the lunch made.
They prepared the bags and helped them to protesters.
Slowly a new kind of activism for Ferrell began to take shape.
"My activism has 9 the. August totally changed," she said and noticed that she was as a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis President of the Minority Student Nurses Association and focus on food justice and health inequalities in black communities concentrated.
"I had no experience in Organizing.
It all came to this."
Weeks later, Ferrell met during a night Demonstration Sabaah Folayan, one of the Co-Directors of the film.
Folayan said she and her camera man Lucas Alvarado-Farrar just wanted to "document" what happened.
A question came to Ferrell in the sense of: "do you Want to document, or are you trying to find a story that you can exploit?"
This scepticism was fuelled by countless cases of people, often from White - in a community that profited from their pain and their resistance.
How Folayan, said in a recent Interview: "We had heard that people born in Ferguson and raised, have not centered their voices, and we wanted to make it different."
Folayan had already worked with then-Co-Director, Damon Davis, an artist from the area for his activism rum tract to death-occupant known.
His dedication brought a Ferrell the project, along with six other Locals of the Team "Whose Streets?" in the years after brown's shooting.
"This documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks to us. We're talking," said Davis.
"That was the main thing for me, as these people are, because I will be."
The goal was not to focus on Ferrell's experience - to show that it is in the movement "not a Messiah-leader, but a community that comes together," said Folayan - you proved to be the most open Participant of the film.
As a result, show the personal aspects of Ferrell's life, documents of "Whose Streets?" surprisingly, how they fell in love and your woman is getting married.
"I felt like I was naked," said Ferrell and laughed when she saw the finished product for the first Time.
"But I understood that there is a need for this type of work and the humanization of black people a certain amount of vulnerability."
In addition, Ferrell's story repeats the role of black gay women in the wider Black-Lives-Matter-movement.
Two of the three founders of the movement that shaped after the killing of the black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012, the movie "black live matter" in social media, identify themselves as gay.
"Black, gay women in positions of leadership have carried on the movement as a whole," said Ferrell, "and, therefore, we are constantly struggling on various fronts.
Black, gay women have to bear the brunt of it all."
Folayan agreed to note that "the movement is really held by black women and many black women to maintain".
It is, however, that "this is not an affirmative action type of action", in Ferrell, because of their identity as the heart of the film has been selected.
"She was the Person who shook up this energy," she said.
"It is no coincidence, although she was at the forefront, because in the case of a life at these two intersections as a black, gay woman so much is at stake.
You can feel your energy through the screen."
Meanwhile, the news cameras are gone in Ferguson for a long time, but the racial Connections between the municipality and the police.
Ferrell is on probation for 2½ years because of the blocking of a highway during a Demonstration.
It describes the socio-political atmosphere of the area, which she calls her home: "A mess".
Nevertheless, they cling to a song, and she feels this memory bound since she was three years ago, in Ferguson on the street.
"It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It's gain is our duty to.
We need to love each other and support.
We have nothing to lose, except our chains."
From "dream" to "delusions of grandeur": the TV reader discuss Bit gallery
The Bit gallery moves people, although it is not built for a long time.
But the idea of a shopping centre at the southern end of the pedestrian zone splits since the first presentation in 2009, the population into supporters and opponents.
Cold is the theme you can hardly.
Also on our Facebook page "the people's friend Bitburg" is the topic discussed.
During the tell a to the Bit gallery: "That would be a dream" (Anja Becker) or "The class" (Nicole), comes from the other side: "Needs no man" (Siggi Betzen) or quite simply: "delusions of grandeur!" (Lars Scholz).
While proponents of the fact that a gallery of more customers attracts to the city, which the rest of the shops benefit, to fear the opponent, then the pedestrian is bleeding to death.
In addition, The gallery will provide exactly planned on the plot of land on which the farmer's market hall, in the 13 direct marketers of their products.
With the beginning of the construction work will be final.
The gallery-makers want to integrate a market hall in the new building, and to Beda square, with possibility to Sit outside.
Simone room: "We buy for many years, almost weekly in the farmer's market hall.
Mainly our eggs, but also the delicious cakes the country women always like to.
The butcher shop we have discovered for us.
We would like to see that even during and especially after the construction of the gallery is a Chance to get this offer.
In other cities there is also.
Especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting."
Gerd Densing: "If direct marketers to locate in a market hall in the gallery, depends on the amount of rent.
They will not likely be in the new project, but probably just low."
Eva Kilic: "What is the shopping palaces in Bitburg?
Whether clothing, shoes, drugstores or supermarkets: I find this superfluous.
There are already enough in our city.
You can see how many shops are empty - some for months and years.
Since there is not here, but, once again, a decent weekly market, it is all the more important that we, at least, the market hall will be preserved.
After all, the product offered here is fresh, service is mainly provided directly from the producer, and is also inexpensive.
As you can see, the store rented shops in a shopping center, only the larger companies, because the local Rents are for a retailer is often not portable.
A pity, specialty shops, and the, almost, what is left of it, will disappear, too."
Wolf Fandel: "A shopping centre with a market hall doesn't fit for me.
And the gallery doesn't fit to Bitburg.
Mainly: Where is the farmer's market hall during the construction period?
The old Edeka would be the solution - also in the long run, if the Bit gallery is coming because at some point actually.
Or it creates the specter Bit the gallery before, to expel all the shops from Bitburg?"
George Marquet: "This simply will not work.
And a Shopping Center that is empty, also needs no one.
In my view, it would have been better to promote a proper farmer's market, instead of this gallery.
But for a farmer's market hall give it to Yes thanks to the insanely many for me is a senseless construction projects in Bitburg.
If the farmer's market hall is broke, it will go a piece of culture."
A suitable Similarity: artist creates Portraits with Chelsea manning's DNA
In the middle of the room, the Fridman Gallery in New York, many faces can be seen - white, black and brown, the same almost imperceptible - which hang on cables from the ceiling.
The 30 Portraits were created in sections by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from the cheek swabs and hair, sent in by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent the excerpts from the prison in Fort Leavenworth, where the former intelligence analyst serving a 35-year sentence after you made the classified diplomatic messages by the Website WikiLeaks publicly.
The new exhibition at the 2. August was opened, is A Becoming Resemblance (that is, A suitable Similarity).
It is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline, combined their expertise in technology, computer science, and the arts, and Manning, a TRANS woman, and seminal dissident, whose condemnation of Barack Obama was transformed, as he had only three days in his office.
Dewey-Hagborg has been created by the algorithmic analysis of DNA extracted from Manning and from the 30 portraits, as someone with this genome could look like data, a sharp, if somewhat intellectual comment, not only to the malleability of DNA data - the Ways of many, as they can be interpreted, and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also for identity.
Manning was born as Bradley Edward, but since their puberty open about identifying as a woman has spoken of, was convicted of 2013 due to 20 charges, including six violations of the espionage act, computer fraud and theft.
Through the prison, her image was suppressed, so much so that there was only a single photo - a grainy, black-and-white Selfie in which Manning visibly unwell on a driver's seat sits a platinum blonde wig wearing, with which it was associated.
In 2015, Dewey came-Hagborg just from the huge success of the 2012 project, 'Stranger Visions'.
In it, the artist produced portraits of Strangers from forensic artifacts such as cigarette butts and chewing gum, by extracting the DNA from the waste, a picture of how these people might look like.
That was the time you received an E-Mail from a newspaper magazine.
"You did an Interview with Chelsea Manning, while she was in prison, and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," said Dewey-Hagborg at a press preview of the new exhibition.
And you could not be visited at this time and could not be photographed, so they took contact with Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait.
The artist and her imprisoned Muse were unequal letter to friends, exchanged in the course of two years, a number of letters.
They created even a Shoili Kanungo illustrated Comic "Suppressed Images", foresaw a future in which the President of Chelsea verdict would convert and you would be able to see the exhibition in person.
That Obama would actually request just a few days after the book was published, manning's release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas, was a welcome kind of happy together.
There are also now at the opening of the exhibition, something Deep and Strong, because Donald Trump is waging a war against informants from the government and those against Transgender troops, in order to find new, tweet-capable routes, in order to inflame the rigid divisions that he was supposed to fix actually.
As Dewey-Hagborg was asked about the strange Timing of all these things, she said that "things happen for a reason".
In a on the wall of the gallery written artistic statement Manning including requested with your oversized signature (the "i" in her family name is marked with a heart) for an end to the "automatic fragmentation, the basis of gender, race, sexuality, and culture."
On the opposite wall of their mitochondrial DNA sequence - a centipede of Cs and Gs and the As is written in pencil.
Dewey-Hagborg was hoping to show by the inclusion of the 200 letters (or nucleotides to the highly developed scientific lexicon by the artist), as they are remarkably similar, at least in biological terms, we all are.
"What will take people, hopefully, is that our genome to take care of it, who are we and how open genetic data for Interpretation, and how subjectively they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose Video work from 2007, Spurious Memories, to see also.
"DNA data can tell so many different stories, therefore, are 30 of these stories."
The last piece in the exhibition, which is kept in a separate room, is a page from the above-mentioned Comic novel.
It shows Manning, as it appears with a hands-free phone in the Hand from the disciplinary barracks of the United States, such as King Kong.
"If you make your speech cold, then you have won," it says.
"So, not the mouth".
"It came directly from a letter she has written to me," said the artist, who hails from Philadelphia.
"I still get goose bumps when I talk about it."
Manning has not seen the exhibition in person - just as it is with foresight in the comic book anticipated - but if you should do it, then you will be in the middle of the room of the masks is located, of their own genomic Simulacra, the droves, as hordes of protesters.
This was also purposeful, as everything in the exhibition, were written up to the size (5 " 2, of manning's stature), in their genetic haplogroups with a pencil.
"In the past, I had them on the wall, but I wanted you to feel like a crowd of people," said Dewey-Hagborg of the portraits.
"I wanted it to feel like a mass movement, which was formed with Chelsea, as the movement, which was behind their release."

"We will complete the WADA roadmap in the near future", - the Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mutko
The Russian Deputy Prime Minister, Vitaly Mutko said, it will not be long before the remaining criteria of the world Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) will be implemented for the recovery of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA).
"At a certain stage of the fulfilment of the criteria of the roadmap RUSADA has the right to plan, in collaboration with UKAD (UK Anti-Doping) and to test.
The WADA roadmap has been updated in this regard," said Mutko on Thursday.
The PM commented on the second part of the roadmap of the WADA to comply with the Code, which describes the criteria for the reinstatement of RUSADA and, more recently, on the Website of the organization was published.
According to Mutko, it contains nothing, which could give Russia a cause for concern.
"Everything has been announced, all will be implemented.
And the results will be submitted to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA in the near future," he added.
One of the listed criteria notes, however, that the Russian Anti-Doping authorities have to accept the reported results of the WADA-approved inquiry by the canadian lawyer Richard McLaren to alleged state-sponsored doping in Russian Sport to the public.

The Start-Ups that will help your company be the next Uber 
Amy Errett wanted to measure your employees ' happiness in to your e-Commerce Start-up, but the polls were not working.
Answers were often vague, unhelpful, or, worse, fraudulent.
And even if you promised anonymity, did not trust some of the workers in the process.
"There was never consistency, and objectivity," said Errett, who runs the 75-Person San Francisco e-Commerce Hair Care company Madison Reed.
They called in people from the outside to help.
A new breed of Human Resources-Start-ups is Growing, to help companies find out how your employees feel.
Through the creation and licensing of Software, which has the specific purpose of measuring the employee Engagement, it allows companies to conduct surveys of Specific groups and demographic groups, to offer employees anonymity and complaint Hotlines, and, in some cases, whistle-blowers allow you to bypass the C-Suite executives and report directly to the Board of Directors.
"Now you have the tools like Strava and Fitbit for tracking your health, but where is the Fitbit for your company?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and Chief Executive of Redwood City Start-up Glint, the Software Analytics Tools that company uses to measure employee Engagement.
Errett said that they gained a better insight into what your assistants think and feel in the three years, with a Glint.
In addition to the Snap-polls and surveys of certain Teams, it provides a heat map of the company, which shows at a glance which units have the most complaints, and what managers low approval have results - so that you can ream why.
Companies come to see that at the top of the work-culture must remain, in order to be the next Uber, which has been embroiled in scandals since then, a former employee published a Blog Post that describes an environment of harassment in which those who have spoken have been punished.
For Start-Ups such as Glint, this is an Overview of a lucrative business opportunity.
Global Governance, regulatory and Compliance industry could have 2020, more than $ 118,7 billion in value, according to the financial Website, Let's Talk Payments.
Denver, Colorado, Start-up Convercent, the company helps to prevent bad behavior and to recognize, saw a growing interest and activity in the beginning of this year, in the midst of the Uber-case.
Convercent has almost 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft, and Tesla.
Uber has recently signed up as a client.
Such as Glint, Convercent companies tailor-made "pulse" surveys to send confidential reply in real time to collect and the heat-maps of your problem viewing areas.
It also provides an anonymous SMS Hotline to allow employees bad behavior.
And if the chief Executive is involved, the complaints directly to the Supervisory Board.
"The court of public opinion has captured the regulators," said Patrick Quinlan, the founder and CEO of Convercent.
If a company is found that treats its employees poorly or unethical acts, it may experience costly consequences due to a consumer Boycott, employee turnover, and lawsuits, said Quinlan.
Ruby Tuesday, the Restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 locations, Convercent for more than a year, to ensure that employees are aware of the policies and procedures aware of and an easy way to achieve your corporate headquarters.
Previously, if an employee wanted to report a Problem, he had to, or find a phone number or E-Mail for the corporate headquarters, a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously.
It was often an intimidating and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesdays General Counsel, said that there was no good way to track the complaints by employees.
Now that the company is using Convercent, problems that were previously hidden from managers sitting in offices in cities or States, such as discrimination, harassment, or unfair practices - faster and addressed identified.
"I can come closer to this holistic, 360-degree view in the experience with employment," said Vitrano, who heads the risk Management Group of Ruby Tuesday.
"And we protect our shareholders prior to employment litigation."
Companies began to take ethics, values and employee commitment in 2002 is more serious, after the accounting firm Arthur Andersen collapsed due to ethical violations by the Enron scandal, said Quinlan.
But it took until the "Social media came to their right" that companies realized that they could not prevent their dirty Laundry went online.
"Prior to the use of technology to Monitor the ethics, used hope as a strategy," he said.
Both Glint as well as Convercent to provide their Software as a service, and charge the company with recurring charges for the use of their products.
It is a business model and an opportunity, with the agreement of the Venture Capital investors who have supported both Start-ups.
Convercent received $ 10 million in funding in February from companies such as Sapphire Ventures, and Tola Capital, bringing total capital raised to $ 47 million.
Glitter has secured $ 10 million in February, from Bessemer Venture Partners and brought its total financing to $ 60 million.
These investments are hardly surprising, given the networked nature of company, culture and Venture Capital.
There is a growing complex of research that shows that today's employees from their jobs expect more than in the past.
In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high salaries, and interesting projects are only inserts.
The employees want to have the feeling that they are accepted and appreciated, and that you can give your time to a company with a positive Mission.
"If people are happy to be in a company, feel, hear their voices, and that the work you do is worth it, then you feel obliged to make this company a success," said Nina McQueen, Vice President of Global Benefits and Employee Experience at LinkedIn, which is used both Convercent, as well as Glint.
Investors achieve returns when their Portfolio companies are going well. Businesses run well when employees are committed and engaged.
If the Analytics Tools provided by third parties promise to increase commitment and the dedication of the staff, it's no wonder that you can find support.
The data on the level of employee Engagement according to the experts, the workplace culture is important.
But the data are useless, if the administrator of a company to take any action.
In fact, when a company asks employees according to their Feedback, it can have an expectation that Change is on the way.
And if the change is not coming fast enough, or not at all, this can cause disappointments breed, and employees demo.
"If you have any questions after 4,000 suggestions, you must be willing to have 4,000 calls," said Russell Raath, President of Consulting at Business Management company, Kotter International, has seen companies that have relied too much on Collecting data.
"Because if you will not follow the employee to ask, "Did you hear me?
You take care of it?
And whom you don't care, why should I? "
Madison Reed, the now-monthly staff surveys, was in the situation, measures on the same day to initiate, if there is a Problem about Glint is reported, Errett.
And after Collecting Feedback from frustrated employees, it was organize by the speed of decision making and the quality of communication, capable of multiple Teams within the company and communication training to add to the problems.
In the case of Ruby Tuesday, the company always receives new insights about the employees, and it hopes that in the long run, this leads to a better retention of workers in an industry known for high turnover.
"If you are not required to create a culture of transparency, you will lose the people," said Vitrano.
"And if you lose people, you lose customers.
And if you lose customers, you lose business.
The NCAA eliminated the two-day practices and makes a long day for the Bruins
It's 23 o'clock, as a lot of UCLA football players entertain on one side of the new practice fields for the Teams on the Campus.
Some have moved out of their Jersey tops and show the back full of sweat from the first day of training camp.
For a good part of the team, these idle minutes will provide a break for lunch.
Players that are registered to the summer courses, will return after the three-hour Exercise to their final exams, before returning the next Morning at 6:30 p.m. at the Wasserman Football Center.
"This is for the guys the next three days, a real treadmill," said Bruins coach Jim Mora just before the Assembly was on Tuesday.
The NCAA eliminates two-days-Exercises to lighten the load of the player, and they extended their days, or at least until the finals on Friday.
Therefore, the first three Trainings of the UCLA should start at 19:15 to the already Packed schedules of the players.
The compromise away from the two days is more than a day, the Bruins moved to the beginning of the camp nearly a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first Time while Moras six seasons in Westwood and led practical Exercises.
You should hold in the course of the August 18 Exercises. 20 before the start of the formal game preparations for its opener against Texas A & M in September.
Mora said that he you add to the rule change the NCAA's support, even if the busy routes of the players.
"We place this enormous burden for three or four days on it, and it is very challenging," said Mora.
"And you have it down easy, you placken, they are great people.
I think once we come to Saturday and we have more time, it is really great."
UCLA will end its practices, once the Camp is completed, what will be in view of the clear sight lines of its fields from an adjacent Parking lot and the adjacent Luskin Center, a Hotel of superior class, which has already been pelted with footballs, tidy and a protective net behind a goal post, not an easy task.
Bruins player to occupy the Hotel as of this weekend, but Mora admitted that there might be a Problem, as soon as these rooms are, during the season.
"We will use our safety," said Mora.
"This is a real Problem, and it's not far-fetched that people would rent a room and then there is the fact, an Exercise record.
If you have the video tape of a training Exercise, it is a pretty good deal.
But we have security forces there, and we have security forces on the Parking lot 8.
We will do the Best with what we have.
I'm not so much Worry.
We have a Plan."

Creating a graphic novel: A castle in the history of England
In its recent past, the little Scotney Castle was in a Squeeze-music video and was for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970-ies and 1980-ies a loophole.
But Scotney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history, from his cosy seat in the Bewl River valley in Kent, and is now become the Inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes, a mophaarigen Yorkshireman with a penchant for historical documents.
"I think it's so nice to look at the handwriting of someone who's been dead for 300 years," he says wistfully.
To keep "what is a personal relationship, this letter in my Hand."
'A Castle in England' spans the time from the middle ages up to the age of Edward and documented the families who lived in Scotney. Each story was illustrated by a different, emerging British artist Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer, and Isabel Greenberg.
It is not the first book of Rhodes, based on an archive: He wrote in 2014, 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories', a collection that was inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found unexpectedly emotional.
"I was just responding to the thumbprint on the page of a letter, which was written by a double agent in the years of 1700, who worked for the Jacobins," he says.
"This is his thumb print!
And letters always smell of smoke, because at that time you lit a fire because of the light.
For someone that lives 300 years later, the smell has an effect, as he himself would be there, too.
Oh, I love archives!"
To be for someone who is so smitten with old papers, that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England, and almost four months in a castle lived ("honest with you: I have overstated my welcome a little"), this seems all too good to be true.
Rhodes spent his days exploring the Victorian "new" lock, to study the archives to look through and many treasures and curiosities of the castle, such as the assembled hyenas heads on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in a ditch.
He wandered through the grounds and the ruins of the old castle, and spoke with Landscapers, gardeners, and sometimes also with artists who worked on the illustrations of his book.
Then, at night, he drank "to write on Whiskey and began to".
The intimate history of Scotney is relatively unknown, as the National Trust, it was not until 2006, the full-access, when the last heiress, Elizabeth Hussey, who died.
As a Rhodes arrived a decade later, started the employees just in order to take care of the archive, he said, "for hundreds of years, in which aristocrats "Oh, throw it is described on the attic".
Diaries, letters from the time of the English Empires, and maps showing who owned what: "One might think that conflicts over Land would be boring," says Rhodes, "but there's a birch, the two families have fought.
Guys, let all his gear to go!"
Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point, on a broader Basis in the English history of the province, such as 'The Labourer', which follows a man who leaves the newly-built castle to the peasants ' revolt of 1381.
"There is a record of a riot that occurred in 1380, at the castle, in this book, with the title of 'the Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex,' " says Rhodes.
"The peasants' revolt began in the area, and I thought a riot was a good place to start.
Perhaps the two are connected?"
Other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like 'The Priest', which tells the story of the Jesuit priest, the family hid Darrell, for seven years, during the English Reformation.
Or 'The Smuggler', smugglers Arthur, Darrell 18. Century, who staged his own funeral, he was dug up a coffin with stones filled (a discovery that was made only years later, when his coffin).
The Darrell's are Rhodes'favorite family of Scotney: "The gentlemen seemed to be quite a crook, always a debt, and money for things that they could not afford.
Other generations of Darrell-men solved their debt crisis by rich married old women - I present to you me as a bunch of good-guys-looking, with a Talent to promote heirs."
After the completion of the assignment, in the castle of Rhodes is in search of other unique Writing experience
He has brought a two-week stay in the Finnish Wilderness for a Comic novel about Elämänmäki behind, the site of a sanatorium of the early 20th century. Century, has since been challenged by the nature back again.
But Scotney has for him a special place.
"I was sad to go back to," he says.
It was like: "Oh, now I must be again with the fucking life."
Campaign started: Over 300-year-old Marian chapel in Rhöndorf veiled
With the concealment of the 301-year-old Marian chapel in Rhöndorf, the town of Bad Honnef has started on Friday to campaign for the introduction of a new umbrella brand (review from Thursday).
Until Thursday, mayor Otto Neuhoff and his marketing team Nelson Artz want to keep the Logo and the Slogan secret.
At the end of August it should be as the climax of the campaign, a Festival on the island of count Werth.

"But we use this measure to gain your attention.
And to make it clear that some of it is better than it seems.
In fact, we are of the firm Conviction that we know as a Bad Honnefer citizens to the beauty and attractiveness of our city."
If the action is going to be more than "just" a Logo and a Slogan.
"There is a need to formulate a stand-alone promise, one that the city of a distinctive single feature".
Finally, you stand in the competition with other municipalities.
A mid-five-figure amount to the city of Bad Honnef can be your new brand and campaign costs.
Military reforms in Turkey - Erdogan's fear of the army
Every year in early August the Supreme military Council (YAS) advises in Ankara on retirements and promotions in the officer corps.
So, too, this week.
At first glance, a normal part of the operation.
But nothing is Routine for the Turkish armed forces a year after the coup attempt.
The session was held in the building of the General staff, as before, but in the official residence of the Prime Minister.
In the discussions, the five Vice-premiers and the Ministers of defense, Interior, justice and foreign Affairs took part under the chairmanship of the heads of government now.
In order for the civilians in the YAS were in the Majority.
The government pulls in the military the reins.
Chief of the General staff Hulusi Akar remains in office, but the commanders of the army, the air force and the Navy have been discontinued.
Since the failed Coup, the state has fired the chief Erdogan 169 of 326 generals and admirals.
Over 10,000 soldiers have been Gulen removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of alleged Links to the movement of the exiled preacher Fethullah gülen, erdoğan as the mastermind of the coup attempt.
Against 486 persons to be directly in the coup attempt have been involved, is negotiated in since this week in Ankara.
On the day after the coup, Erdogan had referred to the coup as a "gift from God", because he would give him the opportunity to clean the armed forces "fully".
But Erdogan has the army really in control?
At the end of February the newspaper "Hurriyet" published an article titled "unease in the military headquarters".
In the General staff there were concerns about an increasing "Islamization" of the army, who wrote, among other things, the lifting of the headscarf ban for female soldiers manifest, the newspaper said.
The big clean-up in the army and the security forces continue in any case.
In mid-July, Erdogan had, by a decree of further 7395 state servant of fire, including 2303 police officers and 546 soldiers.
It seemed as though Erdogan might have tamed the military.
The generals were earlier than the actual masters of the country.
Three times they staged a coup, citing their role as guardians of the secular state order.
After his election victory in 2002, Erdogan pushed back the Power of the military step by step, not in the least, relying on the reform preferences of the European Union.
Former officers say, Erdogan is pushing a specific Islamization of the armed forces.
In the magazine "Vocal Europe", warned an unnamed officer who was looking after the coup attempt out of fear of persecution abroad, to asylum, the Turkish army will be in a few years, "full of extremists and Salafis".
This is the case, could not allow such a development, Nato cold.
Anyway, there are in the Alliance after the cleansing doubts as to the readiness of the Turkish army.
The management structures and operational capabilities are weakened"", say Nato diplomats.

The rise of Sex robots is real, and should we be Worried 
Just when you thought that it can't be in 2017, even crazier, a new report on the technological developments in the field of Sex robots.
Yes, actually.
Sex robots are currently a big deal.
Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (Foundation for responsible robotics) (FRR) published a report on the development of Sex-robots in the next five to ten years.
According to Noel Sharkey, Emeritus Professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of the FRR, we need to begin to take their rise seriously.
Customers can choose the color of the eyes of the robot, its shape of the nipple and the type of finger nail.
"People make fun of them, but the company can deliver any amount of it, and we will get you a lot more to see," said Mr. Sharkey at the launch of his new report.
Modern sex dolls have developed to the skin of their inflatable partners, robots with a silicone that feels warm - aware of human reactions are achieved by the artificial intelligence.
The user can customize his robot according to his Convictions "" and select all of the eye color of the robot on the shape of the nipples to the type or the color of his finger nails.
But it is even more disturbing, since many robots have "personalities" that would be a Stepford-wife progressive appearance.
Modern sex dolls have developed to skin the robots with a silicone.
The RealBotix-robot makes it possible, for example, its users, and your robots to customize the properties that you find appealing, such as shyness.
And then there are the True Companion developed Roxxxy Gold Sex robot with pre-programmed personalities, such as "Frigid Farrah," which gives the impression of shyness and "Wild Wendy" with an "adventurous" personality.
"Roxxxy Gold has a personality that is matched to your personality as well as possible," says the Website of True Companion.
So you, what you like like, and you don't like what you like, etc.
She has, in the course of the day, their moods - just like real people!
You may be tired of that conversation to be fixed or you can be "in the mood"!"
There are many disturbing aspects in this rise of Sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the submissive female characteristics, the allusions to rape, if it is a step on the Frigid (here: approaching resistive) Farrah, worry a most.
On its Website, True Companion, Roxxxy compared with a Vibrator but for men.
"If women (sic) can have a Vibrator, why men have a Roxxxy?" reads the Website.
However, these Sex robots are not only a fetish or only a different sex toy.
Their origins and their increasing sophistication have on something a little Darker and Deeper in our culture, a retreat from the Ideal of the equality of the genders to a desire for Sex with submission, as an optional addition.
Most of the men are, of course, hold not a Sex robot, and while the FRR noted their rising popularity, they remain provisionally on the edge of the consumer culture.
But what can be made of the edge zones by seeps, in relation to the spirit of the times in which we live, very instructive.
And a lot of people are not strange, or offensive, to them, the free market gives the permission.
There is, however, a certain degree of Overlap that these highly developed Sex-emergence of robots in a time in which the rights of women around the world are threatened, there is in the White house a President who has bragged that, to have women sexually attacked.
The dissuasive aspect of the TV series 'The Handmaid's Tale' ('The Report of the maid'), the graphic images, the winding body and the ausgestochenen eyes, but how realistic is this Vision.
The Republic of Gilead is a leap, but at the moment this feels like a big leap.
The goal behind these Sex robots is a physical Resemblance to actual women as realistic as technically possible (albeit with porn star proportions).
Their builders want them to feel human, to mimic the movement of a real body.
But, to the point, when it comes to their "personalities", represent the robots, not real women.
You can't detach yourself from your companion, or simply go away.
You do not have a placement or a background story, nothing, suggesting independence or anything that might disturb the fantasy of total submission.
In other words: they are compliant slaves.
Or, to put it in the speech of 2017: service girl
Trumps great performance?
He makes Mitt Romney the epitome of common sense
It has become a truism of the Trump Era, the political divisions that have polarized the U.S. electorate, even families divided in a small format.
Around Christmas and thanksgiving, there was in the US Newspapers with advice on how you should with the Horror of Trump's choosing Related to deal.
We strict to all of us, allegedly that our filter bubbles burst.
Less noticed is the Power of Trumps, families bring been together.
I mention this because my cousin, a left-wing poet, who lives in Chicago, and for a long time with the Republicans in our family, visited me in New York this week.
You reminded me that the unit can have against a common enemy, a powerful effect.
With Trump in the White house, everyone knows it, including the Republican relationship, with the they had for decades because of the policies fought, suddenly, and quite strangely, on the same page.
The dining table is certainly a good thing, but it strikes me in a wider context, this also brings significant risks.
The Left was strengthened by Trump, but the disfiguring effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right.
When we speak of the "normalization" and Trump, we are referring to the scary possibility that the us will not repel his antics one day.
However, there is an even scarier long-term scenario in which Trump Republicans of the right wing "normalized", which appear at once in comparison to his Standards suddenly as the epitome of reasonableness.
I find myself today in an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's hilarious Version of the Mad attacked the dog on the roof of the car, both of which occur 14% income tax (but at least we knew how to do his tax return looked like) - in comparison to Trump, in fact, a very mild crime.
If Trump goes, must be the next candidate of the Republicans, only mentally healthy, to qualify as a vast improvement.
When my cousin was in town, we brought our kids to the carousel in Central Park, the largest in the carousels of New York's Park Department, and the best three dollars you can spend in the city, if you need no caffeine.
The horses are enormous, the fiberglass design on the Central cylinder - all Clowns are in a teasing mood, and the animals rotate to look full of anxiety on your own shoulders - very dark, and the tinkling music conveys this in a strange way.
So many of the clichés of a city to disappoint: The views from high buildings are old, the Skylines are familiar, in order to provide a lot of excitement, and the reality of the city is the dream.
Thirty-five years later, and I'm still not quite over the course of the day, when I found out that Swiss Cottage is not, in fact, not Swiss Cottage - themed Pub, Ye Olde Swiss Cottage is one - but there is a large roundabout in the North of London.
The Central Park carousel, however, is still a strange magical experience, because here are two two-year-old, a 11-Year old and two women in the 40-ies, and all have a great time.
If I can rate the carousel, I would have given him the full score, but luckily no one has asked.
On the other hand, I was forced into this week in a Department store, to rate my "experience" with transactions on a scale of one to five stars, before I was able to take my credit card.
In the coffee house on the corner of my street, it is the same, plus the Option valuation with a 15 % drinking corpses money deduction - this, to buy something over the counter.
This not only leads to a slowdown in what's supposed to be a neutral exchange, but also exerts pressure on the Server to personality, in a Situation in which no is required.
The poor woman in the Department store stand apologetically with a grin, while I did get tired of the experience, to give her my credit card with five stars.

Software Update for Diesel vehicles: What you need to know to be Concerned now 
How exactly the Software Update will take place?
Must contribute to Diesel-the driver in on the action?
The most important questions and answers in an Overview.
The Diesel-summit, BMW, Daimler, Opel and VW-group-Software-offered Updates for a total of approximately 5.3 million cars.
To improve the exhaust gas behavior of the cars in the emission classes Euro 5 and, partially, Euro-6.
Euro-4 Diesel or worse, are exempt.
Anja Smetanin by the ACE Auto Club Europa are estimates:
The new action is mandatory?
No, the negotiated Software Updates are on a voluntary basis.
"The mandatory Updates before, apply only to the vehicles, the Cheat software," says Anja Smetanin.
The retrofit has ordered the Federal motor transport authority (KBA).
How and when are customers informed about Updates?
The manufacturers have announced a speedy implementation in the next few months, but still no exact date mentioned.
Daimler has notified each Affected contact.
If already an inspection is due, will be done in the framework.
As long as the conversions are expected to total drag?
"Hard to say," said Smetanin.
This depends on the commitment of the manufacturer as well as from political pressure.
"Because we have not seen, on a voluntary basis the automaker to act on the subject of the environment so far."
How long the Update should take?
The conversion itself could take in the workshop, only three to four hours.
Time-consuming could it be to get an appointment.
What are motorists who drive a car from BMW, Daimler, Opel and VW-group make?
The ACE advises to Wait and see.
Probably, foreign manufacturers would follow suit, so Smetanin.
A massive collapse of Euro-4 cars now threatens?
The ACE fears.
But in the regions where bans threaten.
In rural areas there is, as yet, no losses in value for older Diesel.
The ACE advises, with a sale yet to be seen.

We make the city worth living in
Roland Wacker, Haslachs city Builder, goes in the coming year in pension.
The post is already published - suitable applicants, however, are rare.
For 31 years, Wacker city Builder.
And the work makes him always great fun to do, as he conveys in the press conference.
He reported varied, but also challenging tasks that await his successor.
At the same time surprised him that so far no application of the requirement profile is fulfilled.
The city is seeking an architect or civil engineer.
So to be in compliance with the regular periods of notice - enough time for a learning curve.
Since Haslach for the management of community functions as a Lower construction authority must show the applicant the appropriate financial statements.
Because this function wants to keep the city in any case.
You would not be able to fill them out, have to go to the citizens advice to Offenburg.
But citizens near the city and him self-important, says Wacker, who reported a good working atmosphere and a good mood between the authority and the citizens.
In more than 30 years in office have accumulated a number of significant projects, on the Wacker are Proud to look back.
"We make the city worth living", he is about the Department and its employees safe.
But also in the future, diverse projects are on the Agenda: the transformation of The former Hukla-area and low-hofen car Park, for example, are triggered.
The Kinzig bridge between Bollenbach and Steinach is renewed, also the stadium renovation is still subject.
Alone, the Latter is hit with around 1.5 million euros, "if we do it right," says Wacker.
"All in all, great tasks are waiting for my successor.
The work here is fun."
The design was for a city architect, a large game room.
With Haslachs private yard and gardening could be responding to a Lot of quite flexible.
"You can move a lot," said Wacker, and the design of the green plants mentioned by citizens and visitors often praise.
Since the old town as an Ensemble is a historical monument, it is important "to have an eye for what fits in" when new buildings are approved, says the outgoing city Builder.
Anyway, the city architect, carries a high degree of responsibility.
He is a Builder, "in the end, everything is running here on my table".
When it comes to care and coordination, he can count on many years of staff: Markus Neumaier (building construction) is for ten years, Manfred Schöner (civil engineering) for 15 years.
Also, that his successor remains for a long time, wishes for Wacker: "We are looking for someone who identifies with the place really and would like to stop".
Because continuity is not only important for a good working climate, but also for the further development of the city.
Who would like to inherit from Roland Wacker, should have, according to the city of Haslach a degree as a graduate engineer or Bachelor's degree with a specialization in architecture and good knowledge in the areas of Building law and planning law.
The city building Department are subject to civil and structural engineering, land use planning, land acquisition matters, management of urban real estate, Urban depot with yard and urban gardening, as well as Lower construction law authority, including monument protection.
Bike lines is thrown: the southern railway route locked
According to the police, unknown perpetrators had thrown the blue Bicycle from the train track overpass in the area of Leoben road (B116) on the lines.
These were damaged so severely that the approaching freight train had to be stopped.
The investigators assume that the two male perpetrators and seek since the night hours after you.
Near the scene of the crime, a pink scooter and a Bicycle had been observed by witnesses - driver.
"This goes far beyond a louse, a prank," said ÖBB spokesman Christoph Posch to the APA.
The perpetrator or perpetrators had themselves brought into great danger, and the operation of trains at risk.
In addition to the damage to the locomotive and the plant, as well as the delay in minutes and the cost for the rail replacement service also Penalties of the railway could face the offender.
In total, presumed to be a "substantial" sum, the spokesman said.
The damage was not repaired on Friday afternoon, the railway transport on the southern rail route could be conducted without disabilities.
Almost ten passenger trains on Friday morning were down, two of them related to the long-distance transport.
Goods trains were, however, they had a delay.

Insulators and poles were also damaged.
Red meat, dairy products and chocolate could help, IBD (Inflammatory bowel disease) to relieve
Red meat and chocolate may sound for your digestive system like a nightmare.
But a new study claims just the opposite: A diet that is rich in meat based proteins and dairy products, might alleviate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel disease.
The incurable condition, which affects in the United States, around 1.3 million and in the UK, 300.000, causes stomach cramps and bloating, recurring or bloody diarrhoea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
While the Affected person is usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to relieve their symptoms, found researchers at the Washington University of that the essential amino acid Tryptophan from the proteins contribute to the development of immune cells that promote a tolerant bowel.
The lead researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells patrolling in the intestine, in order to ensure that harmful microbes hiding in the food, penetrate in the body.
Cells that are able to trigger inflammation, can be balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissue.
If the balance tips too far in the direction of inflammation, can result from an inflammatory bowel disease.
In experiments, it was found that a kind of tolerance-promoting occurs immune cell in mice that carry a specific bacterium in their entrails.
And the bacterium requires Tryptophan one of the building blocks of proteins - to the appearance of the cells to trigger.
Professor Colonna said: "We have made a connection between a species of bacteria - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the bowel-Multiple, and the development of a Population of cells that promote tolerance.
The more Tryptophan, the mice in their food had, the more they had of these immune cells".
He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and a Tryptophan-rich food more tolerant, less inflammatory bowel promotes environment, if the same System work for people.
The Post-doctoral researcher Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan under a kind of studied immune cell that promotes tolerance, as you found out that a group of study mice had a such cell, but a different group of the same tribe, which was housed separately, this is not.
She suspected that the difference had to do with the intestinal mikrobi omen of the mice - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi that normally live in the gastrointestinal tract.
The intestines of the mice were sequenced DNA and found six species of bacteria that were in the mice with the immune cells present, but without it you were missing in the mice.
Mice were reared in a sterile environment, so that you have a gut microbiome was missing and you have not developed this type of immune cells, and they received the L. reuteri and the immune cells.
To understand how the bacteria impact on the immune system, the researchers L. reuteri in a fluid grow and transferred small amounts of the fluid without the bacteria on immature immune cells, which were isolated from the mice.
The immune cells developed to the tolerance-promoting cells.
As the active component was purified from the liquid, it proved to be a by-product of the Tryptophan metabolism, as indole-3-lactic acid is known.
When the researchers doubled the amount of Tryptophan in the lining of the mice, increased the number of such cells is about 50 percent, but if the tryptophan values were cut in half, decreased the number of cells by half.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan said that people have the same tolerance promoting cells such as mice, and that most of us protect L. reuteri in our gastro-intestinal tracts.
It is not known whether Tryptophan-develop by-products from L. reuteri cells in humans as in mice, but Defects in genes related to Tryptophan have been found in people with inflammatory bowel disease.
She said: "The development of these cells is probably something that we want to promote, because these cells to inflammation on the inner surface of the bowel control.
Potentially high tryptophan values in the presence of L. reuteri can lead to an expansion of this Population."
Jose Mourinho believes that Manchester United and Nemanja Matic to be a "genius" has committed 
Manchester United signed Nemanja Matic to be a "genius," believes Jose Mourinho, after the midfielder had on Wednesday night made his debut against Sampdoria.
The 40 million pound signature of Chelsea began with a 2:1 victory in Dublin, the last preseason game before the UEFA Super Cup against Real Madrid starts on Tuesday, and impressed in the holder role, as people like Paul Pogba, Andreas Pereira, according to will rise.
Matic, however, was the lead-the Asia tour, the Blues ruled and managed just 45 minutes, which admitted Mourinho, that he had to improve before the start of the Premier League season.
"He needs time, but his experience, intelligence, a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football," said Mourinho.
"We will help him to be sooner than later."
In addition to Matic and Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku in the Aviva launched stadium, Mourinho shaped his starting XI for the start of the season.
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho wanted three more signings, but he insisted that the club have already done a "fantastic job" to meet three of its four priority signings.
"To get three out of four, for which I thank the club," he added.
"I'll be happier if you get for me, four out of four, but you have given great effort."

New low blow to Martin Schulz - Hannover, we have a Problem
As the Wind turns: As Sigmar Gabriel, nor the SPD chief was, looked to the social democratic Prime Minister before elections is always a certain degree of concern to Berlin.
Just no background noise from the party headquarters, just no headwind from the Federal government - the main desire of the choice of fighter was.
Since Martin Schulz leads the party, this has changed fundamentally.
Since then, the staff from the Willy-Brandt watch-house with growing horror the events in the SPD-ruled country's main cities.
What Schulz from there, since the beginning of the year, with wind change in the approach.
There were low blows.
One after the other.
The Federal CDU looks after the surprising end of the red-green majority in lower Saxony, a General Signal against a coalition of the SPD and the Greens.
"This shows once again that Red-and-Green just can't govern reliably," said CDU General Secretary Peter Tauber, the editorial network Germany (RND).
The surprising group of the outlet a Green party member of Parliament has ousted the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) in a serious crisis.
Five months before the state election, his red lost-green coalition to its One-vote-majority to the Opposition from the CDU and the FDP.
The Green-national Director of the Michael Kellner has called on the breakaway lower Saxony's Green MEP, Elke Twesten, your mandate to return.
The Defection to the CDU is a clear falsification of the voters ' will.
Elke Twesten must immediately give their mandate," said Federal Director and campaign Manager of the Green the editorial network Germany (RND).
"This can't be all true," sighs a SPD-campaigner, on Friday morning, the new bad news reached the party headquarters.
Stephan Weil, the SPD Prime Minister of lower Saxony, after the Crossing of the green MEPs, Elke Twesten to the CDU without their own majority government.
It is the culmination of a whole series of large and small crises in SPD-country associations.
And no one knows what comes next.
The misery began with the unexpectedly significant defeat in the Saarland election in March.
A black eye, that's all, he reassured the Comrades at the time.
After the Landtag elections in Schleswig-Holstein and North Rhine-Westphalia will all be different.
It was then, and everything was significantly worse.
The defeat in Kiel brought the SPD into the Tumbling, the Düsseldorf-Bankrupt party to haute smooth.
Tedious the Enjoyed on rappelten in the following weeks.
Then, as they had just drawn new courage that came of the G-20 summit in Hamburg.
And with him, the next blow came.
Mayor Olaf Scholz, the last strong SPD state boss, lost that weekend, his Nimbus, as he sat in the Elbe Philharmonic hall, while his city burned.
And because he is made in the crisis communication after that, pretty much did everything wrong what you can do wrong.
Since then, Scholz's fighting for his political Survival.
So, now, Stephan Weil.
Because of the VW exhaust affair and his role on the Supervisory Board of the lower Saxony Prime Minister stood for some time in the criticism.
Lousy poll numbers were added.
Nevertheless, or perhaps because of it, tried to Because in the past few weeks, increasingly, in the Federal accents.
The efforts of the former mayor of Hanover, his Power in Berlin to expand, remained also Enjoyed in the environment of Martin Schulz is not hidden.
You let him grant, because you saw Because of a stabilization of the party.
Now, the exact opposite could occur.
This is Because hits on the internal party strife of the lower Saxony Greens, basically no debt.
And Schulz.
In the meantime, the Comrades strive, therefore, to keep their ranks closed.
Their anger is directed at the Green, especially on the renegade member of Parliament Twesten.
"It is unbearable, and democracy is harmful, as Mrs Twesten your own career interests above the interests of any other," says Matthias Miersch, head of the party left of the SPD group in the Bundestag, the editors ' network Germany (RND).
Mrs. Twesten has not been because of their Person as a direct candidate, but the country list of the lower Saxony Greens elected to Parliament, of lower Saxony, Deputy.
The logical consequence would be that you are your mandate.
Thomas Oppermann, head of the SPD group in the Bundestag, complained of an "undemocratic maneuvers".
"The will of the electorate four years ago, it was clear that The people have made Stephan Weil, the Prime Minister," says Oppermann, who leads the lower Saxony SPD as the top candidate in the parliamentary elections, the RND.
"The personal career of distorted thinking of a future CDU-members of the outcome of the election," said Oppermann.
He claimed that the backgrounds to educate.
I want to know whether or not there is more or it has given further Commitments of the CDU in lower Saxony.
Funding for the centre III
Who would like to redevelop its aging home, may soon get support from the country.
About mayor Albert Schindler and three representatives of the BRIDGE city development informed on Wednesday in Empfingen, Germany.

In the redevelopment area II from 2005 to 2016, the grant was still at 60 percent.
For Schindler, the current renovations are a "success project" - finally, it is important to promote the inner development, and not only open up new development areas.
On 4. April you have received from the regierungspräsidium Karlsruhe, the Information that there will be a redevelopment area III.
The amount of funding amounts to 833 333 euros 000 euros would be 500 from the country, the Rest of the congregation Received.
How is a redevelopment area?
You will investigate, Schindler, where the "really old" houses.
It also has a role, whether in the scheduled area of interest to redevelop.
If necessary, the area could push the boundaries again.

British inventor uses a Microchip to come with a hand movement in the house and car 
A British inventor is the first in the country, is equipped with a micro chip so he can open his front door, his office, entered, and even with a single hand movement, the car can start.
Steven Northam, 33, had implanted the tiny Chip between the thumb and index finger, and now offers the Service to companies and individuals want to simplify your life with technology through his company BioTeq.

The advertising costs of the White house cost the taxpayer thousands
The decision of the White house, to fly a Navy helicopter to the South Lawn for an event that highlights American manufacturing in the last month, costing taxpayers, according to the military, who were left to TIME magazine, up to 24,000 US dollars.
The green-and-white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One when the President is aboard, was at the heart of the event, on 17. July in the White house with American construction programmes.
President Donald Trump, Vice Chairman Mike Pence, and senior White house officials took a tour of products from all 50 States.
The Connecticut-made helicopter was exhibited next to a Yacht from Maine, a fire truck from Wisconsin and a forklift truck from Mississippi.
The military office of the White house demanded the presence of the helicopter in a fragmentary order, or FRAGO, barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn, according to the records of the Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit for the operation of the helicopter is responsible.
"I just wanted you to are aware of it, because it is such an unusual event with high visibility," wrote the commander of HMX-1, on the eve of the event to his superiors, the Deputy Navy commander for air travel.
The news showed that the helicopter was on 17. July, at 7 o'clock in the morning on the South Lawn for the event at 15 o'clock arrived, and so long remained, until the lawn between 18:00 and 21:00, was cleared this evening.
The Note adds that, if the departure should be delayed from the White house, due to the limitation of the hours of service, a second crew for the return flight would be needed.
The original flight crew was located during the event, in the case of the helicopter, while the security staff of the unit continued during the time on the ground in the plane.
From the TIME provided records did not indicate clearly, whether, ultimately, a second flight crew was required.
The Hatch Act forbids Federal employees to use government property for political purposes.
Records indicate that HMX has asked 1 whether the event could violate the provision.
"One question we asked was whether there was a violation of the Hatch Acts, and we were not informed that this was the case," wrote the commander.
"Sounds as if you're closed," replied the Deputy commander.
The event "Made in America" was designated by the White house as the official event and would not have been from the Hatch Act covered.
But official events have political overtones.
At the event, the President gave an impetus for the Reform of the health care reform was in the Senate in progress, and he called for efforts to reduce government regulations.
The use of the aircraft, the Marine One or Air Force One, politically advantageous purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.
Presidents are obliged to use for travel.
But their use only for a photo-OP is unusual.
Trump led in February to an investigation, as the President's plane made against the Background of his first campaign rally in Melbourne, Florida, taxi services, and his Twitter Account is full of messages about the use of the Presidential plane by his predecessor.
"The White house is inspired by the Show "Made In America" products, from all 50 States shows, which are produced by American workers with American materials," said the Deputy press Secretary of the White house, Lindsay Walters.
HMX-1 crews often conduct training flights in the area around Washington and in the South Lawn, US President in the White house with a precision of inches sets off.
As Trump was at the beginning of July at the G20-summit in Germany, was conducted by HMX-1 in the White house 58 practice landings.
The flight for the "Made in America" event was one of the training needs of the flight crew for the month, an official said.
Helicopter units flew an additional 11 hours on this day for "Non-presidential-support missions".
The White house said that the taxpayers took on the burden for any of the other props, which were presented at the event.
A spokesman for Sikorsky said the company had not been involved in the helicopter on the South Lawn.
HMX-1 has no budget records for the President's flights, and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event.
According to the hourly rates of the U.S. Department of defense for the fiscal year 2017, the DoD reimbursement rate for the VH-3D is, however 24.380 USD per flight hour.
Records of the unit show the time of flight of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of Marine Corps Air Facility in Quantico, Virginia.
The White house argues that the actual costs for the operation of the helicopter are far below this Rate.
"The cost for the taxpayer on the basis of the estimates for reimbursement rates, is highly misleading," said Walters.
"These estimates include personnel, maintenance, and many other hidden costs that are included in the annual budget."
According to a RAND study from the year 2015, the reimbursement rates for DoD does not include the cost of personnel, but take into account the costs for fuel, maintenance, and conclusion of the contract.
To defended this time, the former White house press Secretary, Sean Spicer, the use of the helicopter for the event.
"The idea is to present this week, things that are made in America," said Spicer.
"And I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud of the fact that they contribute to our national security, and I'm going to assume that hundreds, if not thousands of people are dependent on it.
And I think, like most Americans, we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment, for which so many Americans tirelessly worked for.
It is of course appropriate, is the highlight."
It was not clear whether Trump acted with the helicopter as he entered his tour of the South Lawn for the event, but he sat in the driver's seat of a fire truck.
In the White house, Trump spoke to representatives from Sikorsky and joked with the media about his own fleet of company products.
"I know Sikorsky is very good," said the President, "I have three of them."

Interview: "Domspatzen-report discharges of the Pope's brother Georg Ratzinger"
The Regensburger Domspatzen-report to the abuse cases, relieved the Pope's brother, Georg Ratzinger.
The author and historian Michael Hesemann says.
The final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen provides more for discussions.
Christian Weis, spokesman for the reform movement "We are Church", after the publication to the German press Agency that he expects from the former Regensburg's Bishop, and today's cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller, as well as from the Director of music Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother, the Emeritus Pope Benedict XVI, an apology.
It would serve the Reputation of the Catholic Church, if Müller and Ratzinger would Express deep Regret about their own omissions or their incorrect assessment of the operations.
The Vatican newspaper l'osservatore Romano criticized, however, that in reporting on violence in the Domspatzen with "double standards" will be measured.
With regard to the Attacks in Regensburg, nobody doubt that it's "disgraceful and shameful deeds" handle, which would have to be punished and prevented in the future; what is striking is the "degree of media Manipulation", the author, Lucetta Scaraffia, a historian and member of the Italian national bioethics Committee.
"The habit of describing the Catholic Church as the source of all Evil, is already part of the everyday experience, and prepares the public opinion to think it's normal," writes Scaraffia.
Also Gloria, Princess of Thurn and Taxis, said in an Interview with the Bayerischer Rundfunk: "You go to the Church and this is a godsend".
In addition, she noted that in her youth, "beats a normal educational means" were "to be with naughty children as I was a, ready".
You think it would be unfair to today's standards in previous decades to apply, because the world had changed.
In connection with the Reports on abuse cases, Pope's brother, Georg Ratzinger appeared often.
To says completely wrong, author and historian Michael Hesemann, author of with Ratzinger the reminder band "My brother the Pope" (translated into 12 languages).
"I have to take Georg Ratzinger in protection," says Hesemann, "because all of this had nothing to do with him", evaluates the results of the final report.
What exactly is in the 440-page report from the diocese of Regensburg with the enlightenment, the attorney assigned to Ulrich Weber has presented?
A total of 547 Regensburger between 1945 and the early 1990s were Domspatzen "with a high degree of plausibility" who are victims of abuse, 67 Domspatzen sexually abused.
In the final report, it is said to Georg Ratzinger, from 1964 to 1994 in Regensburg, Germany: "in summary, one can conclude, therefore, that of Director of music R. in many cases, physical and psychological forms of violence were applied.
Especially in the case of high emotionality, the punishment for the students could be even harder.
Nevertheless, in contrast to many of the other accused, and that many victims appreciate the common humanity of R, and therefore, in many cases, in spite of violence, even positive memories with him."
In the Interview, Hesemann explains why the final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen relieved Georg Ratzinger, in his opinion.
Mr Hesemann, the 440-page report on the "incidents of violence to ward of the Regensburger Domspatzen", a contradictory picture of Director of music Georg Ratzinger.
For one thing, many students highlight his "humanity".
On the other hand he also appears as a choleric, and a perfectionist, who Often got physical, when a Domspatz brought musically, not Top performance.
How values you as his biographer has this final report?
Michael Hesemann: If one makes the effort, and the entire 440 pages long, the report reads from front to back, you need to ask yourself but rather, why the Name Georg Ratzinger occurs at all in it.
To him are devoted to eight pages, and he is clear from any suspicion of an accomplice or Complicity in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.
The excesses of violence at the pre-school took place outside of its sphere of Action.
You can accuse him of, at best, to late to learn or to have the first suggestions not taken seriously enough.
The domspatzen-gymnasium, on which he worked, was perceived by virtually all respondents as the - so literally - "salvation", "heaven" and "better world".
So, too, the vast majority of his students, Georg Ratzinger made a very excellent witness, describes him as "warm hearted", "popular", "honest", "competent" and "understanding", as a very good-natured teacher who cared for the boys on a regular basis with cake, biscuits and candy and "always of the grapes of children" was surrounded.
Only a minority complains about his perfectionism and his high emotionality, which led to outbursts of anger.
That he banged it with chairs and the keychain on the floor threw, but also slaps to the face, distributed, and too naughty boys by the hair or ears pulled, he has even already admitted to it years ago, deeply regretted and apologised for.
To its credit, however, be said that such methods were widespread at the time in question, the 1960s and 1970s, far, parents and teachers.
You know also that such Punishment methods?
Of course, I think everyone of us that was born before 1968.
Also, I've seen this in a secular school, a state secondary school,.
Compared to what it is actually, in this report, namely, the appalling sexual abuse and Violence on pre-school, are the trifles, of course.
As you wonder whether there is not more to do with his notoriety and his role as the brother of Benedict XVI, that many of the media pounced on him.
The Bavarian Pope, many who have never understood him from working, yet always eager.
But the truth is: The report discharges Georg Ratzinger in every way!
Been reported In the media in connection with the report very much about the issue of abuse at the Regensburger Domspatzen.
Georg Ratzinger in the final report laid out any involvement or Complicity with a view to sexual abuse, to load?
Michael Hesemann: clearly no.
Not a single one of the 67 victims of sexual Assault claims to have the Director of music is entrusted.
Not even the parents were privy to.
"I never dared to speak with my father or my mother about it," said a Concerned representative of the other, "It was all me Yes very embarrassing".
The real Problem in the investigation of sexual abuse was and is that most of the victims out of shame silence.
If you parents and siblings are not entrusted to, then certainly not a choir Director who had been professionally, in a sense, a colleague of the perpetrator.
How to evaluate the Domspatzen student of Ratzinger's role in relation to the cases of abuse?
Michael Hesemann: A Respondent student put it this way: "as for sexual abuse ... I see ... no case in which he, of all people (would have been Georg Ratzinger), timely findings and the relevant offender would be able to stop.
I think it is ... even for the truly absurd, to assume that him, of all people ... boys have more forceful or clear, or rather opened, as compared to their parents, Boarding school leaders, trust in teachers, etc.
Talking with him about Sex ... unthinkable."
The report comes to the clear result: "in the run-up to affected pupils and/or their environment entrusted, could not be confirmed in the framework of the investigation".
What are relates to sexual abuse, is Georg Ratzinger speak so of any Complicity.
He may not be accused, to have him not or on the display is prevented.
Therefore, there is no reason to bring his good name with this vile crime, how it happened, unfortunately, in some cases.
In the media, much of the "Violence" of reading with the Regensburger Domspatzen.
The former Director of music Georg Ratzinger is accused of looking the other way in the report"".
He has to live with this accusation?
Michael Hesemann: Yes, This is the big Problem, that in the reporting, everything is mixed and has been mixed to the excesses of a huge Melange of sexual abuse and Violence, and somewhere in the middle, Georg Ratzinger.
But it is precisely this, again, is a misuse of the report.
There is a clear distinction: Between the Preschool and the high school of the Regensburg Domspatzen, between sexual abuse and Violence, as well as, shall we say, other allegations.
In addition, the report of incidents from the time dealt with since 1945, including four decades in which Georg Ratzinger was choirmaster of the Domspatzen.
All the terrible beatings education, the cases in which boys of sadistic teachers, bullies at times and have been abused to and including horrible suffering, were all on the pre-school in Etterzhausen, and Pielenhofen, where really a scandalous state of Affairs prevailed.
However, with Director of music Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do, because he got the boys to face, as they were already on the Domspatzen high school.
On the topic of "pre-school was like all the stress most of the witnesses," taboo.
You was just happy to be your escape, and enjoyed so much better treatment, and for many, even "Paradise-like" conditions.
What was different on the Domspatzen high school?
Michael Hesemann: There is discipline, but not sadistic violence prevailed already.
And that goes for Georg Ratzinger, the report comes to the conclusion that "many victims appreciated the common humanity of R, and therefore, in many cases, in spite of violence, even positive memories with him."
So, the accusation, to have looked the other way remains.
However, despite all efforts, the report was able to define only two time in which to him of the conditions on the pre-school was reported.
For the first Time in 1970/71 when he began to establish himself just to and from the activities to a school where he worked and was responsible to hear, (the witness) don't want anything, and then not again until around 1993.
Wasting Georg Ratzinger loss before the States consistently with the ears?
Michael Hesemann: no, because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the Director of the domspatzen-gymnasium, in the report reproduced even.
In it, he indicates this to the fact that "in the pre-school continues to be the corporal punishment is practised".
Given the risk of negative publications in the press, he recommended urgent Intervention.
That was, of course, the inventory at a time when clarity in the law, as a spanking long ago were banned also met in Bavaria.
Before that, they occurred in a legal gray zone, as each of us knows well.
There was also an estimate for him, hard, where, Affected, perhaps, exaggerated or dramatized, and where the allowable limit had been exceeded.
You can't say he would have always looked the other way.
That is simply not true.
Only in the year 1980, corporal punishment was abolished in schools in Bavaria officially.
Gloria, Princess of Thurn and Taxis claimed Yes, it was unfair that today's educational standards to the time to apply.
How do you see that?
Michael Hesemann: We historians talk of "the pitfall of anachronism", so the risk, to evaluate the Past by today's moral standards.
Since the Princess is already right.
But, of course, is not for sexual abuse was at all times hateful, and not for what was done in the pre-school in the face of adversity and violence on innocent children's souls, goes far beyond the Usual.
This is all very terrible and I am glad that it is finally worked up.
But at the same time I have to take Georg Ratzinger, because all of this had nothing to do with him.
His discipline and punishment, so slapping and pulling hair and ears, were widespread in the 1970s.
As physical punishment was forbidden, he kept strictly to it.
What is the image of his rain-Burger time has played Georg Ratzinger because in conversations with them, for the book "My brother the Pope"?
The topic of corporal punishment came to language?
Michael Hesemann: Well, in the book of the life of his brother, Joseph, so, Pope Benedict XVI, told from his perspective, as the choir members played only a minor role.
Nevertheless, I deny not, that he led there a strict Regiment.
However, it needs to be said: Without this perfection, without the Demand for unconditional discipline, it would have been hardly possible, from the more nationally well-known, Regensburg is an Institution of the world to forms of rank, true cultural Ambassador of Europe and its musical Tradition, the went twice in the USA (1983 and 1987), and Japan (1988 and 1991) on tour Domspatzen.
With biscuits and sweets alone makes unruly boys, well, not a great singer, and before every success, regardless of the area, but always discipline, passion and self-overcoming.
What a people you have experienced because Georg Ratzinger at the talks to your book?
Michael Hesemann: the work on the book, and in addition, I met Georg Ratzinger really quite good and as a wonderful, humorous, reason, kind, deeply religious and heart of good people have experienced, you cannot imagine that he could also do a Fly harm to anyone.
I get on a regular basis to keep as many of the former Regensburg Domspatzen, even today, 23 years after his retirement, regularly contact him, visit with him, read to him - he is almost blind and have him as a member of your family to treat.
Those who do not forgive him until today that he was strict to them, so they are clearly in the minority.
Most of the choir members are today grateful that he enriched your life and the world of music.
And that he was always a good, a fatherly teacher, a strict father, certainly, it was may be - but also a lovable and a person of respect, to look up to you today and worship them outright.
And please, once again, very clearly: Everything that you accused him of, methods of education, which at that time were on the agenda.
We can be glad that we have overcome, this time for a long time.
But it is most unjust to make a man, just because he's a celebrity, and an even more prominent brother, the media scapegoat.
Because the evil intention behind it is only too obvious.
Because of the report that has just been released, relieved him.
Now, the decency would be to let a 93-year-old man who has acquired great merits, and without the outside Bavaria and maybe even Germany's most no one of the Regensburger Domspatzen would know, finally at peace.
