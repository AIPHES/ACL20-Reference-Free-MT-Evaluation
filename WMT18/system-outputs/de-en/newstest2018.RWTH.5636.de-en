Munich 1856: four maps that change your view of the city
An insane institution where young people are supposed to meet today.
A Gruftkapelle, where the S-Bahn tunnel is now being dug.
Small gardeners manage the former land of farmers.
The oldest official map of Munich reveals exciting stories.
It is annoying when maps are not up to date.
Everyone knows this, because the car navigation system showed a green meadow instead of a bypass.
The historical maps of the digital Bayern-Atlas, an offer of the Geoportals Bayern of the state government, are anything but current - but for this very reason very revealing.
Especially if you compare them with current online maps.
Then it becomes clear how cities and municipalities in the distribution area of Munich Mercury have changed since the 19th century.
The digital Bayern-Atlas is a patchwork that is not immediately recognizable as such.
More detailed maps, so-called primordial maps, have been incorporated into the large overview map for cities and municipalities.
According to the Bayerische Vermessungsverwaltung (Bayerische Vermessungsverwaltung), these were created between 1810 and 1864 and were the result of Bavaria's first survey.
Her client: Napoleon.
The French army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria.
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a topographic recording of Bavaria - for military purposes, of course.
Even though the French troops finally departed with the peace of Lunéville on February 9, 1801, it was the present neighbours who created the idea of a nationwide map of Bavaria.
Elector Max IV. Joseph continued to drive the project forward, founding the "topographic Bureau" - and with it the Bayerische Vermessungsverwaltung.
The original manuscript for Munich dates back to 1856 and, like all others, can be found on the website of the Bayerische Landesbibliothek.
The comparison between past and present is most impressive, using the example of the state capital.
The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.
An example of this is Untersendling, which appears relatively isolated in the map of 1856.
Sendling was incorporated as a district of Munich 21 years after the map was drawn up, i.e. in 1877.
Today, Untersendling is in the middle of the city.
The houses of Untersendling are concentrated around 1856 along what is now Plinganserstrasse, which was only named in 1878 after Georg Sebastian Plinganser, a leader of the uprising of the Bavarian peasants against Austria in 1705.
Where the Westpark is today, you can see nothing but fields - at first glance: when zooming in, a smaller map with dozens of lines and numbers appears: handwritten numbered flurries from the so-called "original photograph," from which the property tax was derived.
Small plots no longer occupy farmers there - but small gardeners of the "land in sun" plant.
A large green area is emerging north of Untersendling.
The Theresienwiese, the site of the Oktoberfest since 1810, was in fact still a meadow in the 19th century - and not a concrete desert.
On the other side of the Isar, the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.
In the original position sheet, in the area of today's Au-Haidhausen district, one reads not only the street name "am Gasteig" or from the hill "auf der Lüften" - but also in large letters "erren Anstalt."
Yes, people with delusions were once locked up here on Auerfeldstrasse.
The Munich Kreis-Irrenanstalt "auf der Auer Lüften" was founded there in 1858/59.
From 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden was in charge of the institution - the psychiatrist brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II.
"He was progressive for his time and ended, for example, the chaining of the so-called irons.
He also prohibited the staff from using violence against the inmates, "says Hermann Wilhelm, head of the Haidhausen Museum, who has been working with the institution for an exhibition.
At first there was room for 280 patients, later it was expanded to 500 places.
At some point, this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the Kreisirrenanstalt in Haar in 1905.
Since 2006, the Isar-Amper-Klinikum München-Ost, one of the largest psychiatrists in Germany, has been located there.
Young people are now meeting in Munich's Salesianum on the site of the former Auer Anstalt.
The Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and converted it into a youth home with training facilities.
To the west lies the football pitch of the TSV München Ost, to the east residential buildings from the 1980s.
In 2015, the children's house "Casa Don Bosco" was built - in architectural reference to the original building of the Irrenanstalt, which was destroyed in bombing raids during the Second World War.
The Marienplatz was listed as "Haupt Platz" around 1856, the Kaufingerstrasse was called "Kaufinger Gasse."
The Second World War also brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich.
The Allied bombs tore many holes in the city centre in December 1944.
A big one remained to this day - at the Marienhof.
The English Institute, small shops and a chapel from the Middle Ages once stood at the Marienhof, where preparatory work is being carried out these days and the ground-breaking ceremony for the second regular S-Bahn line will take place on 5 April 2017.
With the slider, the old Munich map can be compared to the aerial view of today - and the hole at the Marienhof can be filled up.
Civil rights group issues travel warning for Missouri
The National Association for the Promotion of Farms has issued a warning for people of color who travel to Missouri because of the state's discriminatory policies and racist attacks.
"The NAACP Travel Advisory for the State of Missouri, which is scheduled to take effect until August 28, 2017, calls on African-American travelers, visitors and Missourians to pay special attention and exercise extreme caution when traveling through the state, as a number of questionable, race-based incidents have recently occurred throughout the state and are noted here," the group's statement read.
A recent Missouri law that makes it harder for people to win discrimination lawsuits, as well as the state's law enforcement agencies that disproportionately target minorities, prompted the group to issue the travel warning, the NAACP said.
"They have civil rights violations that happen to people.
They are stopped because of their skin color, they are beaten up or killed, "the president of the Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, told the Kansas City Star.
'We're hearing complaints at such frequency that we haven't heard before. '
It is the first such warning issued by the Organization for a State in the United States.
The group cited incidents such as racist offences against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died in questionable circumstances earlier this year after running out of gasoline while traveling through the state and being taken into custody by Missouri police without being charged with a crime.
The council also points to a recent report by the Missouri Attorney General's Office showing that black motorists in the state are 75 percent more likely to be stopped than whites.
"The recommendation is that people be aware and inform their families, friends and co-workers about what might happen in Missouri," chapel said.
"People have to be ready, whether they bring deposit money or let relatives know that they are going through the state."
Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest figures from the FBI's hate crime reporting program, which ranks the state 16th in the country in terms of the number of such violations.
The travel warning is also a response to a new Missouri law that would make it harder to sue a company for housing or employment discrimination.
Earlier, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after states passed immigration laws requiring local law enforcement to arrest people for immigration violations, which the ACLU says will help further racial profiling.
Travel alerts are usually issued by the State Department for other countries, but lately interest groups have used the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the U.S.
Electric fence project is basic
The Fischerbacher Weidezaun-Project is a success and will be continued in the coming year.
The CDU members Peter Weiß and Kordula Kovac got a picture on the spot.
At the Richtgrabenhof of the Schwendemann family, representatives of the Fischerbacher CDU local association met with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two deputies.
Markus Schwendemann initially provided insights into his farm, where he farms 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, supplies 40 dairy cows and just as many young animals, and hosts holiday guests in five apartments.
For him, "Schwarzwaldmilch" is the alternative marketing route for the milk of his cows, says Schwendemann.
Only regional dishes are on the table of holiday guests.
Since he is also BLHV chairman of Fischerbach, he described the electric fence project as "fundamentally important."
I cannot make a profit on such steep areas.
The grassland area provides a lot of work, a lot of work has to be done with the engine sense.
"We are struggling here with the conditions and with the topography," Schwendemann stressed.
In 2003, he took over the parental business and managed it without chemical plant protection and fertilizer, even if he did not run a biofarm.
For Mayor Thomas Schneider, it was clear: "the municipality has recognised the importance of the electric fence project and is pleased with the Leader funding."
Farmers would have to be supported at a cost of between EUR 3 000 and EUR 4 000 per hectare.
It is hoped that the afforestation of the land could be dragged out for quite some time.
"The greatest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and are thinking about how to continue their business," said the mayor.
Farmers are often criticised for their support
In 2013, a total of 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced off via the fence promotion.
The open area thus amounts to 40 hectares, which may not be reforested until at least 2023.
Of the total cost of 71 500 euros, half was supported by Leader, and a quarter was contributed by the municipality of Fischerbach.
As a result, the farmers were left with 12 610 euros, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometres of grazing fence.
"The big advantage is the longevity of the fences," explained Schwendemann.
Kordula Kovac stressed: "you are doing a really good job, without farmers and rural women it is not possible."
For Peter Weiß, too, it was clear: "this is where the best food is produced."
The Land Management Directive (LPR) Baden-Wuerttemberg makes it possible for the state to support fences.
The aim is to keep the Black Forest open.
A prerequisite is the existence of a funding framework defined by the LPR.
In addition, the area to be fenced must not be traceable (slope gradient above 35 percent) and must therefore be threatened by afforestation.
The proposal for the Fischerbacher Weidezaunprojekt 2018 is currently being submitted by eight participants with 24 plots, who want to build almost 16 kilometres of fence.
The disclosure area corresponds to 35 hectares, the calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros.
Is nothing sacred anymore?
Now the Trump White House is taking down the Statue of Liberty
The surest sign of regime change is when they begin to attack the statues.
Americans value them as much as anyone else - hence the carefully orchestrated overthrow of Saddam Hussein in Baghdad's Firdos Square in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologues of the Trump regime, certainly knew what he was doing when he took a symbolic axe in a heated argument with CNN's Jim Acosta over the president's proposals to drastically restrict legal immigration to the Statue of Liberty.
To be fair, Miller did not attack the statue itself.
A horde of boat owners and Liberty imitators would have lynched him if he had done so.
But he attacked its significance, and in particular the importance attributed to it when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus was added to its base in 1903, 17 years after the monument was completed.
As Miller slammed Acosta: "I don't want to go into a complete thing about history here, but the Statue of Liberty is... A symbol of American freedom that illuminates the world.
The poem you're referring to, which was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty. '
Miller is factually correct, but as he put it himself, it's not really about history.
It's about the contemporary resonance of Lazarus' stirring words, the only ones in which a state invites not just any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "your weary, your poor, / your afflicted masses yearning to breathe freely, / the miserable waste of your rich shores."
There was never a time when the "miserable waste" was better seen on our screens.
Miller was not engaged in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people are not welcome in Trump's US.
This conflict over the meaning of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural dispute: it is, in fact, a conflict over the meaning of America.
Lazarus - and her friends who lobbied for her words to be placed at the base after her death - knew very well that she was doing a highly political act.
The sculpture was intended to show the links between French and American republicanism by depicting the female embodiment of freedom in a worn classic pictorial representation.
Lazarus changed this meaning: in her poem, the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice.
And she gives herself a very different name: mother of the exiles.
The poem's association with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American nativism.
And just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, people from the right wing wanted to change it back a long time ago.
The great writer Rush Limbaugh, a sort of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty did not invite anyone, but rather was an early neo-conservative who brought the American flame to the world around: "lady Liberty is moving forward.
It is meant to carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
The torch is not supposed to light the way to the United States. "
Quite unusually, Limbaugh came across something here.
The meaning of the statue is entirely a question of the point of view of perception.
The great imaginative act of Lazarus was to see her as she was seen by the exhausted, miserable but hopeful people after long and often terrible journeys on the decks of ships.
It's literally about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives.
Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome they must hear.
And that, of course, is not the perspective Miller and Trump would ever want to acknowledge.
Their torch is not meant to illuminate the path, but to ignite the hatred that is their only source of power.
World Cup 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish members of Great Britain team
Eilidh Doyle remembers a time when only two Scots were part of the Great Britain team
UK Athletics performance director Neil Black says the 16-strong Scottish contingent in the World Cup squad will "make a massive contribution to the team."
A record number of Scottish athletes have been selected for London 2017, which kicks off on Friday.
Black believes that "something special is developing in Scotland" and UK athletics needs to learn something from it.
"We welcome it, and we're trying to understand it, and we're going to keep it going until we figure it out," black said.
"I talk to people at the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they've done.
The Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done.
British Athletics: it has something to do with what they did.
And also with the type on the street corner.
Whatever the combination of circumstances, it's absolutely brilliant. '
Several of the Scottish athletes are medal contenders, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will face Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000m track, while Eilidh Doyle has been voted team captain by the team.
"Eilidh is pretty modest.
Her captain's speech was unbelievable, "says Black.
"A number of athletes, whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train, walked out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated.
The passion and the real feeling that Eilidh brought in naturally was great. "
The Commonwealth silver medallist, who will compete in the 400m hurdles at her fifth world championships, says it is "unbelievable" that 16 Scots are in the British team.
Scotland's best ever total of athletes at the World Cup was seven, achieved in 1983 and 2015.
Middle-distance runner Muir leads the way, setting five British and two European records last year.
She will take part in the 1,500m and 5,000m races.
Chris O'Hare, who runs 1,500m, is another Scot to watch after a great season that included winning the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games.
Doyle remembers her first world championships when the only other Scot in the team was Lee McConnell.
The team captain says she is "immensely proud" of the fact that many of her compatriots are not only part of the team, but in some cases will also be involved in the medals and finals.
"The special thing about being a team captain is that she was chosen by the other members of the team, so it was a great honour anyway, but knowing that my teammates voted for me and voted for me makes it very special for me," she added.
"Obviously I'm very proud of all the Scots who are part of the team.
It just shows how far we've come.
And they're here as established athletes, athletes who want to get on podiums.
As for my speech as captain?
Yeah, I think she went well.
I just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home World Cup.
So it's really important to put on that home support and benefit from being back at the Olympic Stadium.
I'm getting a second chance to go out there and compete and it's just going to be such a great atmosphere out there. '
Block critics on Facebook: don't bid for public office if you can't stomach swelling voters
The father of our country knew something about bad press.
Americans loved George Washington, but it didn't take long for newspapers to beat him for everything from domestic politics to his political principles.
He chimed in on the criticism, sure.
But he has not silenced his critics.
For in 1783, Washington said, "freedom of speech can be taken away - and, stupid and dumb, we are led to slaughter like sheep."
That brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan, who needs to work to be more like Washington.
Hogan's staff have blocked and deleted the posts of at least 450 people who expressed their opinions on his official Facebook page.
And the American Civil Liberties Union sued him earlier this week.
The governor's staff dismissed the lawsuit as frivolous, and the online comment was full of a backlash with "nah, and?."
"It's just Facebook," a lot of people said.
But it's important.
And it's especially important when it's a guy like Hogan.
This is a Republican governor in an overwhelmingly Democratic state who is surprisingly popular.
He has the second-highest approval rating of the nation's 50 governors.
Hogan is not a reactionary heat head.
He has shown a firm hand in running his state and strict adherence to the principles.
He was also very adept at using Facebook as a primary means of connecting with his constituents and playfully debuting his hairless head after chemotherapy on his page.
So blocking people coming to the governor's side - which is a public forum designated as official and staffers paid with public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan's spokeswoman Amelia Chasse defended the governor's actions, arguing that blocking the comments was nothing more than a moderation.
But it's too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hateful people swinging the whip online.
The Post spoke to some of the real people blocked by Hogan.
And these are just real people talking to their elected leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur and a pastor, not trolls.
They all said their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not profane.
The pastor quoted the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogan's Catholic faith.
Attorney Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., was not hateful, but she asked about hate crimes.
"I politely commented that I was disappointed that there was no response to hate crimes and other recent news," she wrote in the commentary section of The Post.
"I do not appreciate this idea either, when a number of people take a position on the same subject, they are disregarded by some as a so-called collective effort and not recognised as a large group of concerned citizens."
What the governor's aides called a "concentrated spam attack," others would likely call "advocacy."
The Facebook era makes it easy to tailor a message by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment.
It is much cleaner than in the past, if the same thing had been done, that staff were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical editorials, or to arrest and silence protesters.
But that is exactly what is happening digitally.
Hogan is not the first public official to be criticised for slamming Facebook and other social media.
President Trump is being sued by Twitter users who have been blocked by his Twitter feed.
One of the first milestones on the issue fell last week in Virginia.
The chairman of the Loudoun County Board of Supervisors violated the First Amendment, according to U.S. District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when she banned a voter from her Facebook page.
And in Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit from the ACLU for his use of Facebook and Twitter.
It shouldn't be that hard.
At the time of Washington, the time of the affordable port had a similar effect to the Internet.
The number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letter writers appealed to his leadership.
And even then, Washington had anonymous trolls.
The people who used pseudonyms such as "Juricola," "Valerius," "Belisarius" and "Portius" all wrote letters to newspapers that turned down Washington's decisions.
Petitions critical of his position on Amity's contract, trade and shipping with Britain overwhelmed his office, according to historical documents collected by the George Washington Project's Online Papers.
But he did not silence them.
Freedom of speech, disagreement and discourses are the foundation of our nation.
And true leadership means accepting that.
Ronan Rafferty hopes for home comforts at Renaissance Club
Former European No 1 Ronan Rafferty will be hoping for home comforts over the next three days as the Renaissance Club in East Lothian hosts the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open.
Nordire, who led next door at Archerfield Links to the final last year before losing to Paul Eales, is linked to the new venue and acts as a tournament ambassador on behalf of the club's founder and CEO Jerry Sarvadi.
"I saw the renaissance club being built and we see it reaching its glory with this event," Rafferty said.
"The players will see this course at its best, it is in a great state.
Jerry did a great job of fixing this place.
He is a fervent supporter of this game and is proud of his performance here.
This is a great showcase for this course. "
Englishman Eales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time, despite winning both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour in his 32-year career.
"It feels really special," said the Southport-based player.
"I haven't been able to defend the Extremadura Open since it was taken out of the program the year after I won it.
Coming back to this part of the world is magical.
It's a wonderful place to play golf.
The memories from last year are coming back, and it was something special for me and my wife Sharon to win here last year.
It's been a really special time and one we'll always cherish. '
Gary Orr, who joined the European Senior Tour earlier this year after his 50th birthday, returns to action on home soil.
This event will be his first Scottish appearance since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
"It always means a bit more when you play at home," said Orr, the man from Helensburgh.
"You want to do well, but you also feel that extra pressure.
I really enjoyed playing again and I played solid golf.
I'm happy with how it went. "
With the trio on the field are former Masters champion Ian Woosnam and senior major champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are among six Scots in the field, the others being Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
Admission is free, parking costs £5 per car with one occupant and £10 per car with two or more occupants.
All proceeds will go to Prostate Cancer UK.
Less lung cancer deaths from passive smoking
Over the past two decades, fewer and fewer people have died from lung cancer due to passive smoking.
Scientists from the University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) have come to this conclusion in a study.
"According to our estimates, 167 lung cancer deaths per year are due to passive smoking," said study leader Heiko Becher.
By way of comparison, he drew up his own study on this subject in 1994.
At the time, there were still 400 cases of lung cancer deaths due to passive smoking per year in Germany.
The new study is published in the International Journal of Public Health.
Home connections turn out to be very complex
Construction work on Villinger Strasse is in full swing and is "reasonably in time," according to the head of the Bauhof Fred Heinze.
In the area of house connections, the situation is more complicated than expected, as there is a lot of hiding in the underground, which is not mentioned in the plans.
Traffic, which repeatedly obstructs construction work, is a major problem for Stumpp's construction team.
"The ignorance of drivers in front of red traffic lights and grids is already enormous," reports Heinze.
The road is closed and only the buses are allowed to pass through.
Angelo Caruso, Marvin Kostorz and Tim Kostorz from Stumpp have been working on the bridge for weeks.
"The hot days were quite exhausting.
But luckily we were supplied with cool mineral water by our friend Fritz Matt, "says Marvin Kostorz.
Poverty and Death in Indonesia's Gold Country
When Bardina Degei cooks dinner, she doesn't use a stove.
She even rarely uses a pot.
In her wooden house in Enarotali, the capital of Paniai rule in the restive Indonesian province of Papua, the housewife usually places a sweet potato - locally referred to as "nota" - directly in the fireplace.
After half a hour, the charred tuber is removed and swallowed with eager, unwashed hands.
Degei sits on the clay floor - she has no furniture - where she also carries out her daily work, such as washing clothes with murky water from the nearby swamp.
A bucket in a homeless room serves as a latrine.
As the youngest of her husband's four wives, she was not assigned fields.
Polygamy is common here.
Of course, working late can be dangerous: most village men are unemployed, and many drink heavily, and there are soldiers here.
"Nobody dares to walk around the village after 5pm," she says.
It is a rare glimpse into daily life in the highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony that was taken in 1969 after a disputed referendum in Indonesia, when only 1,026 elders were due to vote in front of the occupying forces by a public hit-and-run.
An existing movement agitating for independence against Dutch rule quickly turned against the Jakarta government, which maintains control of the region and excludes foreign journalists or legal observers.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua, with the independent part of Papua New Guinea encompassing the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is as remote as it is barren, the trip includes a 90-minute flight from the provincial capital of Jayapura to Nabire and then a five-hour car ride in the morning.
There is no public transport.
The town of about 19,000 people is made up of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences and corrugated iron roofs converted by rust into various yellow-brown tones.
Very few Indonesians have made their journey here, let alone journalists and virtually no foreigners.
Before Christian missionaries arrived, Mee Pago Papuans worshipped a god called Uga Tamee.
There were other changes, too.
"We weren't used to wearing those clothes," says Degei, pointing to her vibrant hand-woven turban, dark shirt and bright skirt.
"We used to have only leaves on our bodies."
Papua is Indonesia's poorest province, where 28% of people live below the poverty line and have some of the worst child mortality and literacy rates in Asia.
But it is also Indonesia's gold country.
The world's largest and most profitable gold mine, Grasberg, owned by Phoenix's Freeport McMoran, is just 60 miles from Paniai, a highland province the size of New Jersey with 153,000 residents.
In 2015 alone, Freeport mined $3.1 billion worth of gold and copper.
In addition, Papua has timber resources worth an estimated USD 78 billion.
These riches, however, are a source of misery for Papua, ensuring that Indonesia's powerful military maintains a stifling presence.
A 2005 investigation in The New York Times reported that Freeport paid local military personnel and units nearly $20 million between 1998 and 2004, including up to $150,000 to a single officer.
Papuan demands for greater autonomy threaten these golden goose and are treated mercilessly.
According to activists, more than 500,000 Papua have been killed and thousands have been raped, tortured and imprisoned by the Indonesian military since 1969.
Mass killings in Papua's tribal highlands in the 1970s became genocide, according to the Asian Human Rights Commission.
In the region alone, Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful protesters last year.
"We Will Lose Everything," says a 2016 report by the Archdiocese of Brisbane, which included reports of previous year's atrocities, such as unlawful executions and torture - rape and electrocution are particularly popular, according to another report - and the brutal crackdown on peaceful demonstrations.
"It's difficult to count the number of victims because incidents happen every week," says Andreas Harsono, Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch.
The screws have intensified as Papua's resources bring an influx of settlers from other parts of Indonesia.
The population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83% Christian, but the demographics are changing as Muslim economic migrants come from the populous islands of Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Javanese Warung tantines sell fried chicken and Gado-Gado, a mixed vegetable served with peanut sauce.
Local people are fighting to keep up.
"The migrants have started selling chickens and vegetables in the traditional market cheaper than the local Papua," explains Abeth You, a 24-year-old Paniai native who moved to the provincial capital Jayapura for work.
"It has cost the native Papua - the Mama-Mama [the women] of Papua - their market."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, popularly known as Jokowi, promised during his 2014 election campaign to address the inequalities and rights abuses in Papua.
The former carpenter secured 27 of Papua's 29 districts - including Paniai - on the way to the presidential palace in Jakarta.
But little has changed in Papua, and today locals feel betrayed.
"Our hearts are broken because we voted for Jokowi in 2014 with the expectation that he will fulfill our hopes that justice will be restored," says You.
In fact, Paniai suffered a low point just two months after Jokowi's inauguration in October.
On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children were outside singing Christmas carols in front of a campfire in Enarotali when two Indonesian soldiers broke through the darkness on a motorcycle.
The frightened children told them to turn on their headlights.
One of the soldiers took offense at her tone and later returned with four soldiers, according to local pastor Yavedt Tebai.
The soldiers, who had been drinking, chased and beat the group with their rifle butts, victims and witnesses said.
Then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children.
One child, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was so badly beaten that he fell into a coma.
A few hours later, the building of the nearby government commission was set on fire and things escalated the next day.
About 1,000 young Papua men, women and children gathered at a soccer field in front of the local police station and the military command center to demand justice.
They wore ceremonial hunting arches and performed the Waita dance - running in circles and imitating a bird song - by Papua's Mee Pago tribe.
Some protesters began hurling stones at police and military posts.
As the mood heated up, the soldiers were sent a command over an internal radio: "if the crowds resist more than three times, they shoot them dead," according to an official document seen by TIME, which has not been released to local media.
Yeremias Kayame, 56, the head of the Kego Koto district of Enarotali, saw the imminent danger and called for calm and urged the crowd to return home.
No one was in the mood to listen.
"When I turned around, I was suddenly shot in my left wrist," he told TIME on the porch of his brightly painted wooden house.
Kayame still doesn't know who fired, but says the bullet came from the ranks of soldiers gathered here.
"It was crowded, a lot of shots were fired," he adds.
Local man Alfius Youw was hit three times, according to his cousin, who witnessed the shooting.
"I ran to him and examined his body to make sure it was him," Yohanes, who like many Indonesians bears only one name, told TIME in gloomy mood.
"I saw that he was dead... I kissed him."
The chief inspector of the Papua police, Yotje Mende, told reporters that his officers only wanted to "secure" her station because she was being attacked.
"We have to defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us," Papua police spokesman Commissioner Pudjo Sulistiyo said in 2015.
"It's about life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and many more injured.
News of the killings only came "filtered" to Jakarta the following day.
For three weeks, Jokowi gave an impassioned speech in Jayapura, expressing sympathy for the families of the victims and vowing to address the historical grievances in Papua.
"I want this case resolved immediately so it won't happen in the future," he said.
Security Minister Wiranto said in October 2016 that he was establishing an extrajudicial mechanism to resolve historic human rights violations.
But the excuses began almost immediately.
"Most of the injuries occurred a long time ago.
Some were in the 90's and early 2000's.
The point is that we are committed to addressing these violations, but there are processes that need to go through, "he said.
Then Wiranto made a retreat when he spoke to TIME in Jakarta on June 5, saying he had no plans to set up a complaints mechanism in Papua.
Instead, "everything is regulated by law," he said.
Wiranto, whom the U.N. has accused of "crimes against humanity" that claimed more than 1,000 lives in East Timor's bloody 1999 independence vote, said 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua had already been resolved, including the Paniai incident.
Families of the Paniai victims received such claims with grim incredulity.
"I've been interviewed four times in the last three years, but there's been no progress whatsoever," Yohanes says.
"I'm tired."
He says he still lives in fear years later.
"I'm scared," he says.
"I'm afraid of being arrested by the military, I'm afraid of being shot."
His brother Yacobus reiterated the view that people in Paniai are afraid to discuss the incident.
He says he was beaten by the military after he helped bury four of the victims.
"After I buried the bodies, the military searched for me," he says.
The shootings have not stopped.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police shot at villagers in Paniai's Deiyai neighborhood.
During a confrontation between villagers and the manager of a construction company who refused to take an unconscious man to hospital, one person died and 17 others were injured, including children.
The man, 24-year-old Ravianus Douw, who drowned while fishing in a nearby river, died on the way to hospital.
Excited villagers protested outside the company's location office.
Police said the villagers threw stones at officers who responded by firing warning shots.
But locals say the mobile brigade (Indonesian paramilitary police) began shooting at the crowd, killing one.
"We were so panicked, we're afraid there will be revenge," says 29-year-old Dominggu Badii, who lives near the hospital and witnessed the injured being quickly hospitalized here, according to TIME.
"I hid in my house for two days."
The Deiyai parliament has called for the officers involved to be held accountable and for the mobile police brigade to be withdrawn from the area.
Paniai has always been a source of trouble for the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development strengthens the discontent of the tribesmen Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal, who live in the green highlands of Papua.
Many joined the "free Papua Movement" (OPM), the rebel army that claims to defend the rights of Papua by launching sporadic attacks and kidnappings of Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the top OPM leaders are from Paniai, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
In response, thousands of people have been arrested and arbitrarily detained in Paniai in recent years on the pretext of "safeguarding national sovereignty."
Some never appear again.
Among the people of Papua, Paniai is known as "a tragic, forgotten place."
Poverty strengthens discontent.
The bit of rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive for locals.
Bread is just as out of reach.
People here grow everything they eat: especially Nota and fruit and leafy vegetables.
Agriculture is the task of women, who can work on four or five fields of sweet potatoes.
They keep most of the crop for the family, while the rest is sold on the local market.
Ten pieces of Nota cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Over time, economic inequalities have grown between native Papua and the new migrants, who have arrived in greater numbers since the opening of new routes to Nabire airport.
The few jobs that exist in the region tend to go to the better-educated and wealthier migrants.
Papua rarely have the capital or the skills needed to run their own businesses competitively.
"The young people are not interested in staying in the village... Because there are no jobs or money here," says John Gobai, the chairman of the Paniai tribal council.
Isolation keeps the eyes of the world away from Papua.
In addition, restrictions on reporting by international media remain tense.
Earlier this year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were deported from Papua for lack of coordination with related institutions, despite being given rare permission to film.
According to Phelim Kine, the deputy Asia director of Human Rights Watch, the promises of Jokowi's campaign to lift restrictions on reporting to promote transparency and development have not been realized.
"There are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to report from Indonesia's most troubled eastern provinces of Papua and West Papua: visa refusal and a blacklist," he said in a statement.
Lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely confined to Papua's immediate neighbours.
In March, six Pacific states - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - asked the U.N. Human Rights Council to investigate the "various and widespread violations" in Papua, including the Paniai shooting.
The same countries have historically supported OPM.
Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesman Arrmanatha Nasir dismissed the group's allegations, telling journalists in Jakarta: "a democratic system still applies in Indonesia and there is free media, so it is difficult to cover up the evidence of human rights cases."
Local people want more foreign governments to take notice.
When an official delegation from the Netherlands, led by the human rights ambassador Kees Van Baar, visited Jayapura on May 4, locals broke their silence and urged him "we want freedom," according to a source who also attended the meeting but wishes to remain anonymous.
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019, but the Papua say they are unlikely to vote for Jokowi again.
"Jokowi is a person who has good intentions, but he is surrounded by the people involved in the Paniai shootings," says Gobai, the head of the tribal council.
He wants Jokowi to know that the Paniai people, apart from living under the constant threat of a predatory military, are in poor education and health services.
Gobai says that the Paniai people, like other Papuans, see their vote for Jokowi as a "debt" that he must repay.
"They don't need money, they just want justice," he says.
Despite the threats and intimidation, families of the Paniai shooting victims carried out a final symbolic act of defiance: the body of a victim was buried on a site just opposite the police and the military station.
They know that they may never get justice, but at least they do not let those responsible forget their crimes.
"A member of our family was killed," says Yacobus with his head lowered.
"What else can we do?"
Fire engulfs Dubai's "Torch" skyscraper for second time
A fire found its way through one of the world's tallest residential towers in Dubai on Friday, forcing hundreds of residents to flee the 337 metre tall, 79-storey building.
It is the second fire to sweep through the high-rise building, which is coincidentally called the Torch Tower, in just two years.
The building was evacuated, no injuries were reported and there was no direct word on the cause of the blaze.
"We were asleep and we got up at the fire alarm and when people were screaming.
We ran down the stairs and it took about 10 minutes to get down from the 50th floor, "one resident, who gave his name as George, told Reuters.
Dubai's civil protection authorities said anti-fire units extinguished the fire at around 4.00am local time (00am GMT) and cooled the building.
The government said it was working to provide shelter for those affected.
The incident may revive questions about the safety of materials used in outdoor areas of high-rise buildings around the world.
An investigation by the management of the Torch building after its fire in 2015 found that most of the damage came from the cladding, the exterior cladding for decoration or insulation.
In Britain, police said they believe the system of panels for insulation and cladding at London's Grenfell Tower in June may have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire that killed about 80 people.
No Davis Cup reform: further best-of-five
The president of the International Tennis Federation (ITF) fell through with his big Davis Cup coup at the General Assembly.
At the meeting in Ho Chi Minh City, the revolutionary proposal for this sport to play Davis Cup singles on only two sets of wins was not supported by the necessary two-thirds majority.
The five-set classics, which are often very long, but which are also highly appreciated for this reason, are thus preserved in the traditional competition.
63.54 percent of the member states voted in favour of the reform, so the target of ITF president David Haggerty was narrowly missed.
"We respect this decision, but are disappointed that our member nations have not adopted the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and Fed Cup.
We need a change to secure the long-term future of these iconic and historic competitions, "Haggerty said.
They will continue to work to improve the competition.
After many objections, the proposal to hold the final in a neutral place had not even been put to the vote.
New from 2018 are only comparatively minor details: for example, the Davis Cup and Fed Cup finalists will have the right to host in the first round the following year.
In order to reduce the costs for the organisers, the requirements in terms of training places and so on will be made easier and the players will have to make less official media appointments before the Davis Cup.
More than 1 in 5 U.S. travelers bring banned items to plane, poll finds
A survey of airline passengers found that more than 20 percent deliberately or unconsciously smuggled prohibited items past U.S. Transportation Security Administration checkpoints, including at least 6 percent who entered the plane while accidentally carrying banned knives or other items with blades.
Less than 1 percent said they had belatedly discovered they had traveled by mistake with firearms, ammunition or explosives.
The survey of more than 1,000 people - conducted by a jet charter service, Stratos Jet Charters Inc. - Also found that younger travelers are more likely to flout the rules.
Of those surveyed who admitted they knowingly tried to fly with something banned by the TSA, 19.7 percent were millennials, compared with less than 15 percent who were members of Generation X.
The most common items deliberately passed to TSA agents were food and liquids.
More than 3 percent admitted knowingly carrying items with blades through security checkpoints, while 2.2 percent of female respondents and 3.7 percent of male respondents also confirmed that they had deliberately brought banned drugs into the plane.
The company said it interviewed travelers across the country to find out how many had accidentally brought contraband through airport security and how many had done it on purpose.
It's no surprise that the people most likely to carry contraband - knowingly or unknowingly - through security were the ones who fly most frequently.
The company points out, however, that the TSA guidelines are somewhat complicated and confusing.
People are often unsure what liquids they are allowed to take or how much of it.
So it's no surprise that the largest amount of items seized by the TSA are prohibited liquids.
For a while, people thought the TSA could see books as contraband.
Liquids are permitted on domestic flights, but not on international flights.
Elon Musk doesn't care: tens of thousands of Tesla customers cancel order
Elektro-Tausendsassa Elon Musk is happy to announce the huge number of pre-orders for his new Tesla "model 3."
In doing so, he has so far omitted the fact that some of the customers have already withdrawn their non-binding reservation.
In addition to the always triumphant figures on sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets, Tesla CEO Elon Musk revealed for the first time a different, less brilliant figure in the announcement of the latest quarterly results: that of the cancellations of the new mass-market Model 3.
In recent months, Musk has frequently advertised the new car, which is about to be delivered, with more than 500,000 pre-orders.
Now Musk admits: out of a total of 518,000 pre-orders, 63,000 have already been withdrawn.
Critics have repeatedly pointed out that these are only non-binding reservations.
In case of cancellation, Tesla will pay back the 1000 Euro (in the USA 1000 U.S. dollars and in the UK 1000 pounds) "reservation deposit" in full.
There are currently 455,000 such non-binding reservations, Musk acknowledged in a conference call with analysts.
However, the Tesla boss does not believe that cancelling around 12 percent of all orders could be a problem.
His argument is that the challenge of ambitious growth targets lies not in demand, but on the production side.
Last year, Tesla delivered 84,000 vehicles.
In 2018 - all models taken together - it is expected to be 500,000, in 2020 a million.
The demand for this is obviously there.
According to Musk, 1,800 reservations are currently added per day.
Anyone who orders a "model 3" today can expect delivery in the second half of 2018 at the earliest - if Tesla manages to drive its brand new production lines, which have never been tested in practice, with maximum capacity without major interruptions.
Many experts doubt that this is possible.
However, if there are major delays, the non-binding nature of the reservations could become a problem for Tesla.
Because then the company cannot prevent dissatisfied customers from running away in droves.
EPA chief Pruitt resigns over delaying Obama-Era rules to cut emissions
A day after being sued by 15 states, Scott Pruitt, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, reversed his earlier decision to delay implementation of Obama-era rules to reduce emissions of smog-causing air pollutants.
Pruitt presented the change as his agency proved more responsive to the needs of state environmental agencies than previous administrations.
He did not mention the lawsuit that had been filed against his previous job in a federal appeals court.
It is a deadline that expired on 1 October for states to comply with the 2015 standards for ground-level ozone.
Pruitt announced in June that he would delay compliance by a year to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid "interfering with local decisions or impeding economic growth."
Pruitt, who was an Oklahoma prosecutor before being appointed by President Donald Trump, has long been a reliable opponent of tougher environmental regulations.
Since arriving in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly moved to block or delay regulations that the chemical and fossil fuel industries oppose.
Wednesday's sudden reversal is the latest legal setback for the Pruitt's regulatory rollback agenda.
Last month, a federal appeals court in Washington ruled that the EPA administrator overstepped his authority when he tried to delay implementation of an Obama administration rule requiring oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leaks.
In a statement released Wednesday evening, Pruitt suggested that his U-turn on ozone standards simply boosted EPA's willingness to cooperate with states through the complex process of timely compliance with the new standards.
"Under previous administrations, the EPA has often failed to meet implementation deadlines and then waited to be indicted by activist groups and others, and in an agreement to set the date for implementation," said Pruitt, who sued the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job.
"We don't believe in regulation through litigation, and we take deadlines seriously.
We also take seriously the law and the authority that it gives us. "
Still, the EPA's opinion said that at some point Pruitt will use his "power to delay and all other legally available powers" to ensure that the rules are "based on sound policy and the best available information."
Congressional Republicans are pushing for a broader rewrite of the ozone rules.
A bill approved last month is expected to delay implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years.
The measure has not yet been put to a vote in the Senate.
New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who led the coalition of states that sued the EPA this week, said the group plans to maintain legal pressure.
"The EPA's reversal - according to our lawsuits - is an important win for the health and safety of these 6.7 million New Yorkers and the more than 115 million Americans directly affected by the smog pouring into their communities," Schneiderman said.
New York joined California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington and the District of Columbia in this case.
Ground ozone occurs when pollutants from cars, power plants, oil refineries, chemical plants and other sources in the atmosphere react to sunlight.
The resulting smog can cause serious breathing problems in sensitive groups of people, contributing to thousands of premature deaths each year.
Public health officials and environmentalists cheered Pruitt's surprise change of course.
"It's troubling how much pressure it takes to get this sensible move from the person responsible for protecting the air we breathe in," said Lori Ann Burd of the Center for Biological Diversity.
"We must continue to fight the Trump administration's ideological crusade to turn to polluters and their special interests."
Tumlingen celebrates 750 years of St. Hilary's Church
750 years of St. Hilarius Church: on the occasion of the anniversary of the mountain church, a serenade will be invited to the old cemetery area in Tumlingen on Sunday, July 16, at 4.30 p.m.
Whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village, the historic St. Hilarius complex is a popular place to stay.
Visitors to the sixth charity serenade can be enchanted by this powerful place.
The friends and patrons of Tumlingen have made the rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the village their concern.
Walter Martini emphasizes: "it's an unique village gem."
In 1267, the St. Hilarius Chapel was mentioned for the first time in the Württemberg book of documents: Count Hermann von Sulz sold "the mountain with the parish church of Tumlingen and the Vogtei" to Magister Eberhard von Horb and to his brother Dietrich for 20 marks of silver.
According to the text of the document, in addition to the former parish church, there was also a stately court on Tumlinger Berg, to which the church or the right of patronage belonged, and not the other way around.
So there were also people living there.
As can be seen from the description of the Oberamtes Freudenstadt from 1858, next to the Unterdorf and the Oberdorf, which can still be seen today in the townscape of Tumlingen, the "mountain" was the third, the stately settlement centre of the village.
Old maps dating back to around 1600 confirm these historical facts.
The right of patronage arose from the early medieval right of the church.
A gentleman who built, equipped and occupied a church with a pastor remained the owner of the church and was able to inherit the church.
Associated with this was the right to appoint a pastor or to propose a new pastor to the bishop.
There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower.
The largest of the two crumbled on Christmas 1673.
The newly acquired bell first sounded in 1692, but had to be delivered later in the Second World War in 1942.
During the 30-year war (1616 to 1648), the windows were broken and the bell ropes were stolen.
The roof was leaking.
In 1796, French troops camped near the church.
They broke out the pulpit and church chairs and used them as firewood.
Remnants of the church threatened to collapse in 1809.
Until 1869, the Tumlinger Hilarius Cemetery also served as the final resting place for the dead from Hörschweiler.
In 1823, the cemetery was expanded and the Hilarius Church was demolished.
Only the church tower was left standing.
On New Year's Eve 1834, a storm split the church tower and half collapsed.
In order to prevent an accident, the tower was demolished.
Only the tower dwarf, which still exists today, remained as a witness to the 700-year-old history of the church.
Today, Horst Kallenberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem of the "Schaffigen Rentnern" are in charge of the Hilarius plant in place of Dieter Dockhorn.
On Sunday, July 16, the friends and supporters of Tumlingens invite to the sixth serenade in the old cemetery of the St. Hilarius Chapel.
It is designed by the Combo of the Kepler Gymnasium Freudenstadt and with speeches by Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis.
The head of the town, Hartmut Romann, speaks the final word.
The program starts at 4:30 p.m.
Admission is from 3:30 p.m.
At the end of the serenade, a drink will take place in front of the cemetery.
"Enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with the wide view over meadows towards the forest," the organisers point out the fantastic view.
The serenade takes place only in dry weather.
The organizers hope for many supporters to preserve the historic St. Hilarius facility, which is important for Tumlingen and Hörschweiler.
The friends and supporters of Tumlingens are particularly committed to home care, as confirmed by the Serenade organizer Walter Martini.
Association wants approval of wind turbines to be tested
"Boisheim wehrt sich" sees no legal requirement for the construction and has therefore appealed to the county council.
The association "Boisheim wehrt sich" has asked Councillor Andreas Coenen (CDU) to withdraw his approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Boisheimer Nette.
It was done unlawfully.
The association argues that at the time of the approval on December 30, 2016, no wind turbines could have been approved at all in the Boisheimer Nette, since at the time in Viersen there was only a wind power concentration zone at the city border with Schwalmtal.
Within this concentration zone, the construction and operation of wind turbines are basically possible, but at the same time the concentration zone results in the exclusion of the use of wind energy for the rest of the urban area.
Such zones are intended to prevent the "sparing" of the landscape.
A few days earlier, the city of Viersen had decided on a second wind power concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette by amending the land use plan - but it had not been approved by the district government of Düsseldorf due to a defect in form.
"Due to the lack of a planning requirement, the approval decision issued is still illegal and therefore also to be withdrawn," said Christoph Erkens, chairman of "Boisheim wehrt."
Current state of affairs: before the summer break, the city council has once again decided on the wind concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette; approval by the district government is pending.
Erkens: "at this point, the granting of a permit for the construction of wind turbines is excluded from planning law."
The circle confirms the receipt of the call.
"The relevant letters have been received by Viersen County since last week," a spokesman said.
The circle takes it as an opportunity to re-examine the matter.
However, they are not expected to result in the proceedings being halted.
In view of ongoing proceedings at the administrative court, the district did not want to comment on the substance of the argument of the association "Boisheim wehrt sich" on Thursday.
The NEW Re, a subsidiary of NEW, plans to build four wind turbines, each 200 metres high, on an area on the Boisheimer Nette.
Already last year, the company, in which the city of Viersen is indirectly involved, entered into lease agreements with the owner of the approximately 65 hectare site.
With the construction of the four wind turbines, the electricity demand of around 11,400 households is to be met - this corresponds to around one fifth of the electricity demand of all four-seater households.
The NEW Re wants to invest around 20 million euros.
Last summer, Viersen's city council gave the green light to the purchase of three wind turbines at the Linnich wind farm near Aachen and a stake in a wind turbine in Übach-Palenberg in Heinsberg County.
Car and tractor crash: woman dies in horrific accident
A terrible traffic accident occurred on Friday morning at around 10 a.m. on L 333 between Niederwallmenach and Bogel (Rhein-Lahn-Kreis).
One woman was fatally injured.
Two other people were slightly injured.
The state road remained closed for hours.
According to the police, a 17-year-old young woman from Bornich drove the L 333 in the direction of Bogel with her car as part of the accompanied driving with her 53-year-old mother.
City and traders plan "home shopping" weekend
Bad Langensalzaer and people from the region are to rediscover the shopping opportunities in the city centre in September.
The trade association and the city administration want to use the weekend on 8 and 9 September to entice the residents to go shopping in the city centre.
As the chairman of the trade association, Christian König, announced, the "Heimat-Shoppen" weekend is intended to sensitize customers to what offers their own city has aside from the usual supermarket goods.
The plan is for a market with regional suppliers, similar to the weekly market.
In addition, local companies are to present themselves with their training places.
In addition, the shops of the city centre will invite you to "midnight shopping."
The action is aimed not only at residents of the city and the surrounding region.
In preparation are commercials on the radio, an internet video and printed bags that point to the weekend of action, according to Christian König.
The city administration and trade association are cooperating with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry.
As a result, the trade association and the city are entering another stage of the "attractive city centre" project.
This includes new offers such as the first "active Day" for the Well Festival, including a Sunday open for sale, talks with all traders and hosts in order to encourage them to participate actively.
Attractive offers on Saturday and the waiver of parking fees on that day are also part of the concept.
In addition, customer potential is to be reopened or reopened.
This includes spa guests and tourists.
But many locals would also have lost sight of the city centre while shopping.
In the end, everyone would have to help revitalize the city centre - right down to landlords, businesses across the city and clubs.
It was necessary to overcome the lethargy with a network, which had partly spread, King said in the spring.
Birgit Streich, head of the IHK-Center in Mühlhausen, announced that for the first time five Thuringian towns will participate in the third "Heimat-Shoppen" day in Germany.
In addition to Bad Langensalza, these are Weimar, Sömmerda, Heiligenstadt and Bleicherode.
The day should "promote the appreciation of local commerce and emphasize its importance for the common good of our cities," said Stafford.
The action, under the auspices of the Chamber of Industry and Commerce and with many partners, also makes it clear that every citizen can influence his or her own direct environment with his or her purchasing behaviour.
Two dead and several injured after explosion at U.S. school
During construction work, there was a gas explosion in the school building.
New people were injured.
Two people have been killed and nine others injured in a gas explosion in the U.S. city of Minneapolis, some of them seriously.
According to the fire department, one injured person was still in critical condition on Wednesday (local time).
One person died when part of a school building collapsed in the explosion.
A missing person was later also found dead.
The dead were employees of the school.
As a result of the accident, the authorities suspected that work was being carried out on a gas pipeline.
During the holiday period, only a few people stayed in the building of the Minnehaha Academy.
Trump pressured Mexico to pay for border wall after leaked transcripts of phone calls
Transcripts of phone calls between U.S. President Donald Trump and leaders of Mexico and Australia have been published by The Washington Post.
On January 27, in a phone call with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto, Trump called for him to stop saying publicly that he would not pay for a planned border wall.
The U.S. president slammed him for publicly denouncing the wall, reportedly saying to him: "you can't tell the press that."
Trump launched his presidential campaign with a promise to build a wall on the southern U.S. border and vowed to make Mexico pay for the project.
Transcripts of his first call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull were also released, revealing a tense exchange.
Mr. Trump told Mr. Turnbull that a trade for the U.S. to take on refugees who emigrated to Australia was "ridiculous," "Mies" and "stupid," and that insisting on the trade brokered by the Obama administration would make him look like a "Depp" after he proposed a ban on resettling refugees to the U.S.
Mr. Trump ended the call after telling Mr. Turnbull, "this is the most uncomfortable call for the whole day."
Moore's Ford massacre: activists re-enact racist lynching as call for justice
A 1948-car Ford Mercury drove through a group of spectators in rural Monroe, Georgia, and rumbled onto Moore's Ford Bridge.
Before the car, which had four black passengers and a white driver, could reach the bridge, a group of white men with rifles stepped out to block its path.
The leader of the mob - a middle-aged man in a pinstripe suit - took a long train at his cigar and glanced through the windscreen.
Indoors, the inmates hovered in fear.
"We want this n -- -- r Roger!" The man screamed.
"Get him out of the car!"
Screams tore the silence as a young black man was dragged from the passenger seat.
Luckily, this horrific scene, played on July 22, is just an afterthought.
But when a noose is thrown around the neck of "Roger," almost everyone in the audience breathed very real sighs.
Since 2005, civil rights activists have come back to Moore's Ford Bridge to emulate the night two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and Mae Murray Dorsey - were lynched by the Ku Klux Klan in 1946.
No one has ever been charged with the murders.
"It's really inconceivable that not a single person has been arrested in all these years - even though we see them in our communities, even though we know who they are," said Tyrone Brooks, who helps organize the obituary.
'it's a smear on a story, but it's a burden on our souls. '
Brooks is a 71-year-old former congressman from the state of Georgia and a lifelong civil rights activist.
For him, the obituary serves as a dramatic call to action and represents an annual reminder to the Monroe community that an injustice has never been corrected.
"We want prosecution, we want termination, we want healing, we want reconciliation, but first we need to get justice," he said.
"We cannot achieve healing and reconciliation until we get justice."
A forensic doctor places a blanket over the corpse of one of the victims of the Moore-Ford lynching on July 27, 1946.
More than 50 men from Monroe and surrounding counties were suspected in the lynching process, according to FBI files obtained by NBC News.
But none has ever been charged.
Although the suspects have remained at large for decades, civil rights activists say the dual motivation for the Lynch actions has always been known throughout the city: politics and sex.
In April 1946, a Supreme Court decision allowed black citizens in Georgia to vote for the first time in the summer primary.
At about the same time as the election, according to the FBI, black farmer Roger Malcom stabbed a white landowner, Barnett Hester, during a fight - allegedly because of a woman.
Brooks said the rumor in the city was that Hester had slept with Malcom's wife, Dorothy, and that the baby she was carrying was not from her husband.
On July 25, 1946, Loy Harrison, a prominent white landowner, paid $600 to free Malcom from prison, according to the FBI.
He was accompanied to prison by Dorothy and her cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey.
But as they then moved away from the prison and approached Moore's Ford Bridge, a lynch mob surrounded the car.
"As it turns out, it was Harrison who prepared and ordered the killings," concludes a FBI report.
"It is also apparent that there was a plot between the state and local law enforcement, which was not only involved in the killings, removed evidence and covered up the identity of witnesses."
Brooks puts it even more succinctly.
"It was an electoral massacre," he said.
"They were all killed to send a message to black people in this community:" if you register and if you vote, that's going to happen to you here. "
For nearly a decade, Cassandra Greene has presided over the annual re-enactment of the Moore Ford Bridge Lynch murders.
Their depiction is vivid, poignant and grounded in a kind of deep racism that many would like to believe no longer exists in America.
It's hard to watch, and even harder to look away, but Greene said that's the point.
"We don't want to talk about lynching because we are then confronted with its ugliness in all of us," she said.
"But I can't build a relationship with you if you don't want to listen to me or don't want to hear what I've been through."
Rehearsals for this year's production began in June, and on the first day, nearly 30 actors - a dozen whites and the rest blacks - crowded into a room and listened as Greene launched a well-rehearsed overview of the play.
Wade Marbaugh is Greenes co-director here.
He has played the role of chief clan member for years, but he said the role never gets easier.
"I feel dirty because I'm not like that," Marbaugh said.
'But I think it's very important to keep this story alive because we don't want to go back to those times. '
On the other side of the room, actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, who play Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester, rehearsed their lines.
The play begins with Malcom screaming at Hester and heckling him, angry that he slept with his wife Dorothy.
"I said, n -- - er, disappear from my property!"
Rascona reciprocated the fire.
There's a pause.
And then everyone (at least all black actors) erupts in laughter.
Greene laughs the loudest.
"What?!" Asked Rascona.
He is alarmed and confused.
Was I too hard?
"No," Greene said, still giggling.
"I just don't think white people said" n -- - er "at the time."
"Yes," quipped one of the other black performers.
"You just have to hit the hard" R. .""
And that's where the energy in the room shifts, a sense of camaraderie replaces the discomfort.
Everyone is busy getting this right, not only because of the game, but also because of the memory of the four people killed.
The scene begins again.
This time, when Rascona says the N-word, he says it sharply and forcefully.
Absolutely no one laughs.
This repetition ends violently and quickly.
There are screams, shots and then silence.
A woman, dressed in a mourning dress, stands over the bodies of the actors and performs Billie Holidays mourning eulogy "strange Fruit."
Her voice breaks at every second word.
About a hundred metres behind, a group of about four dozen spectators wipes sweat and tears from their eyes.
The audience is split almost evenly between black and white.
A couple has travelled from Ithaca, New York, to see the performance, many just coming down the street.
They have all experienced Georgia's oppressive humidity for nearly eight hours when Brooks takes them on a pilgrimage to the tombs of the Malcoms and Dorseys.
To this point, the killings have remained an anecdote, but now, standing on the same land where the Lynch murders took place, the air feels ghostly.
When the final notes of the song end, Greene invites the crowd to come closer and inspect the corpses.
Children howl at their heads, register the fake blood and the silent bodies and whisper to each other.
"They're not really dead," a little boy mumbles, as if he wanted to remember.
After a few minutes, Greene thanks the crowd - and suddenly it's over.
The actors throw away the lynch rope and wipe away their tears.
Bradshaw hugged Marbaugh, the man in the suit who played the clan member.
Nick Rascona hugs two of his fellow players and then collapses crying in their arms, the emotional burden of the performance finally collapses on him.
"It's okay," whispers one of the women.
"We know that's not in your heart.
You did it for a reason. "
Later, the audience sits down with the actors for dinner.
At a table, a white couple from Atlanta chatted excitedly about the re-enactment with a black couple they had just met.
Denise Duplinski struggled to find words about the feeling the performance left behind.
"It's hard to hear those terrible words and actions... Coming from people who look like yourself and who do that because they look like you," she said.
"What this really does to me makes me think that the lynching is still going on," she added, "today it's just called police shootings."
In the same room, Tyrone Brooks holds court at his table, he eats and recalls civil rights.
He said he had already started planning the performance next year.
"The obituary is inspiring in a way, because it describes the horror of what we've endured, but it's also a moment of learning," he said.
"It's like if we don't learn anything from it, then it can happen again.
Those who do not study their own history, those who do not know their own history, are condemned to repeat it. "
"Götterdämmerung" reconciled the Wagnerians in Bayreuth
Also in the fourth part of Richard Wagner's monumental work, director Frank Castorf puts on a colourful, frivolous staging against a gigantic, six-storey backdrop.
The revolving stage (designed by Aleksandar Denic) optionally shows a shabby street corner with wall rest and dönerbude in Berlin, a "plaste and Elaste" logo from GDR times or the New York Stock Exchange.
In front of it is an open Mercedes classic car, in which the Rhine daughters pose as rockergirls, or alternatively an Isetta.
Stacked oil barrels are reminiscent of Castorf's leitmotif - money, power and greed - which runs through his "ring" staging.
The three Rhine daughters - sung by Stephanie Houtzeel, Wiebke Lehmkuhl and Alexandra Steiner - harmonize beautifully, as in "Rheingold."
Kess seduce Siegfried (Stefan Vinke), drag a corpse into the trunk in Hollywood fashion and give the Krawallo-Clique.
Stephen Milling sings the wonderfully nasty Hagen that surrounds the aura of a heavyweight boxer.
Brutally the scene when he kills Siegfried.
Later, Gunther (Markus Eiche) has to believe in it.
The audience thanks the ensemble with strong applause.
Fiercely celebrated are Foster, Milling, Vinke and conductor Janowski, who modestly bows his hands to the Mercury rattle.
There is great applause for the Festival Orchestra, which is showing itself on stage for the first time - in light of the great heat, again in casual clothes.
The performance of Frank Castorf and his directing team was eagerly awaited.
Five years later, when he had to give a gelling-whistling concert in 2013, there was great cheer, in which the isolated "BuH" cries went down.
Festival Director Katharina Wagner should have been pleased about this.
"You notice that the audience has grown up with the" ring "in a certain way," she said shortly before the performance of the dpa.
The audience had not only made a form of peace with Castorf, but also an understanding of his point of view had grown.
I draw a positive conclusion.
Max Menge works as a volunteer
They work in several places during their volunteer year.
Where to go?
Crowd: normally in Steinfurt in the Furniture Exchange, once a week I help out here in Greven in the Furniture Bridge.
And I have already worked at the school in an open day.
What are your experiences with this?
Crowd: it's a nice, broad spectrum that I see here.
I have to do with different people, with young people, with refugees, with young adults.
They are now 26 years old, so a late-career volunteer.
How does this come about?
Crowd: I graduated from high school.
And then a degree in civil engineering, let's say, successfully aborted.
I realized for myself that it is the wrong thing for me and I want to do something different, work with people.
And then I asked myself, what are you doing?
Make a social year, there is a glimpse, you can see how it really is on the ground, perhaps in the focal point.
And was it?
Crowd: I collected great impressions.
I will start my studies in the social sciences in the winter semester.
I will be studying dual, I will probably be doing social worker training at the Herne Youth Office and I will be studying at the University of Applied Sciences in Hamm.
Is it not unusual to have several different places of work during the volunteer service?
Crowd: yes, it's very variable.
It always depends on where you do your FSJ.
You can do it from retirement homes to youth work - in all sorts of facets of social work.
For me, it was very varied.
I was also partly in the OGS, so in the afternoon care.
For me, it was just the right thing to do, which irritated me.
I was able to see my own strengths and see how it really goes.
Different from studying civil engineering?
Crowd: well, this is not about calculating stats.
You always have other people in front of you, who each have a completely different story behind them.
Whether a refugee or an adolescent who has been taken out of the family - you always have to deal with it individually.
Very interesting.
And you had no fear of touching?
Crowd: I'm not the type for that.
It's an area that gives you a lot.
Lots of love, lots of kindness.
There are sometimes negative moments, but life is just like that.
Pearson cuts another 3,000 jobs and cuts dividend to revive business
British education group Pearson said on Friday it will cut another 3,000 jobs and cut its interim dividend by 72 percent as another restructuring programme is launched to overcome the pressures facing the company.
The job cuts, which director general John Fallon mostly announced for late 2018 and early 2019, comes on top of his previous restructuring, which has already seen 4,000 job losses.
Pearson announced in May, in a third cost-cutting programme, a plan to cut costs by another 300 million pounds ($394 million) to revive a business hit by the rapid move to digital learning.
The company, which sold its stake in Penguin Random House to partner Bertelsmann last month, said the outlook for the financial year was unchanged, having grown 1 percent to £2.05 billion in the first half of the year.
Kabul convoy attack: NATO soldier killed in suicide attack
A suicide bomber has attacked a military convoy in the Afghan capital Kabul, killing one Nato soldier and injuring several others, officials say.
Five soldiers and an interpreter were injured, a statement from NATO said.
Unconfirmed local reports said three civilians also died in the incident in the Qarabagh district.
The bombing is the latest act of violence to hit Afghanistan this month - more than 30 people were killed at a mosque in Herat on Tuesday.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
A statement from Nato said the explosion on Thursday evening occurred when a joint patrol with the Afghan army was attacked by a "man-made improvised explosive device."
The statement says all the injured are in stable condition and are being treated at the U.S. military hospital at Bagram airfield.
Correspondents say the growing strength of the Taliban and the group known as the Islamic State (IS) in Qarabagh is a major concern for NATO forces in nearby Bagram.
According to the United Nations, there were at least 1,662 civilian deaths in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, including about 20% in the capital.
In late July, a suicide car bomb killed at least 30 people in a mainly Shiite district of Kabul.
The Taliban said they carried out that attack.
On May 31, a huge bombing in the center of the city killed more than 150 people with the country's deadliest militant attack since U.S.-led forces ousted the Taliban from power in 2001.
The violence underscores the precarious security situation in Afghanistan as U.S. President Donald Trump weighs increasing the number of U.S. troops supporting the military and police in the country.
Correspondents say the suicide bombings in Kabul in recent weeks have also caused a crisis of public confidence in the government, its policies and, in particular, the reputation of President Ashraf Ghani.
EPA reverses decision to delay smog rule after lawsuits
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has overturned a decision to delay an Obama administration regulation requiring states to curb smog-causing emissions, a day after 15 states sued the agency over the move.
The EPA announced late on Wednesday the decision to advance the so-called "2015 ozone regulations" and said it showed the agency's commitment to working with states.
"We believe in dialogue with and in responding to our state partners," EPA chief Scott Pruitt said in a statement.
Pruitt announced in June the EPA's intention to delay ozone regulations - in which pollutant emissions are to be measured in a part of the country to determine where cuts need to be made to meet stricter air quality standards - for a year until October 2018.
A group of 15 mostly Democratic states, along with the District of Columbia, filed suit Tuesday, saying the effort was illegal.
President Donald Trump's administration has sought to roll back a wide range of environmental regulations imposed by former President Barack Obama as part of a broader agenda that Trump says is intended to boost economic growth.
The effort, however, has prompted pushback from Democrats and conservation groups worried about the impact of larger emissions on public health.
The EPA's website says that inhaling air that contains ozone can "reduce lung function and increase respiratory symptoms" such as asthma.
Local council wants community space
In the end, the decision was clear: with two votes against, the local council of Fluorn-Winzeln decides to set up a community space in the future senior citizens "residence.
Before the discussion, there is an important piece of information: the purchase agreement for the remaining part of the property has been signed, reports Mayor Bernhard Tjaden.
Although it will still take time for the area previously owned by the parish to be owned by the municipality, there is now no obstacle to the planning of the project to be carried out by a private investor.
There is a discussion about a Community area for this.
One of the two investors still in the boat has offered to meet the community.
On the ground floor, he would provide a living space - around 55 square metres - and an adjoining terrace with as much as 70 square metres of space for a special price.
The administration and the majority of the municipal council plan to provide such a community space not only as a meeting place for the residents of senior-friendly housing, but openly into the community.
As an example, the word "knitted café" made the rounds.
The decision, which was made last autumn by the provision of funds for the current budget, will be sweetened by funding opportunities.
The building is located in the redevelopment area.
According to Tjaden, the creation of a common space would be eligible for 60 percent of 30 percent.
The proposal for a decision, in order to signal to the investor that they do not want to throw a spanner between their legs in this respect, provides for the statement that both the saddle - which is based on the surrounding construction - and the pulpit roof - which reduces the height of the truss and makes the construction more economical - would be possible.
It is not only Wilfried Sohmer who thinks that this addition is unnecessary.
If it helps: unanimously, he passes the board.
It is not so easy with the common room.
Daniela Ruf refers to the many buildings of her own, with which you can't really make progress, but now you lean out of the window in the common room, she says: "I'm struggling with it."
Yvonne Staiger is very much in favour of the common space - but absolutely against local participation.
It sees this as a covert subsidy to already wealthy or even foreign investors.
That is not the case, because with the purchase of the area you do not give a subsidy, but you get a real value, which can be sold in case of doubt, says the counter-statement.
Staiger's motion to split the proposed resolution accordingly has three supporters.
This leaves two votes against the original programme, which Stefan Haller summed up as follows: "if we take the decision in this way, we will take a giant step towards closing a huge gap in our infrastructure."
Car collision: cyclist is thrown onto road
While crossing the road, a 82-year-old cyclist was struck by a car in Garath on Wednesday and seriously injured.
According to the police, the 82-year-old Langenfelder had been riding his bike on the Schwarzer Weg cycle path from Hilden at 12.20pm.
The senior wanted to cross the road at the height of the Am Buchholzer Busch road.
A car driver travelling in the same direction gave him priority.
When the Langenfelder drove onto the road, however, he apparently did not pay attention to the oncoming traffic.
He collided with a car driving a 66-year-old Hildenerin.
The man was thrown into the street.
He suffered serious injuries and was taken to hospital with a retouching van.
FC Bayern Munich must do without David Alaba and Thiago in the Supercup against Borussia Dortmund
The Supercup takes place without him: David Alaba has to suck the game against Dortmund.
With personnel concerns, FC Bayern will travel to Dortmund for the first mandatory match of the new season.
Seven pros are missing the defending champion in the Supercup against the Cup winner.
The personnel worries at the German football record-holder Bayern Munich are getting bigger and bigger ahead of the Supercup on Saturday (8.30pm / ZDF and Eurosport) at cup winner Borussia Dortmund.
Coach Carlo Ancelotti has to do without David Alaba in the duel with BVB.
The Italian confirmed this on Friday.
In addition, the miners Manuel Neuer, James, Thiago, Jerome Boateng, Arjen Robben and Juan Bernat are missing.
For the five defeats in the past six Test matches, Ancelotti has blamed the physical condition and lack of balance in his team's game.
"We know we are not in the best physical condition," Ancelotti said, adding: "the most important point is the balance in the team.
It was not good in the end. "
However, the 58-year-old believes in an increase in performance in the first official game of the season.
"Football is also tactics, strategy, personality and motivation.
I have great confidence that my team is showing these qualities.
The team is ready.
We want to play smart, "said Ancelotti, who expects a" difficult, intense game. "
The duel between the two German football heavyweights captivates the fans.
The game is sold out with 81,360 spectators, announced the German Football League (DFL) on Friday.
Walking from star to star in the Harz
In the Harz, the first "star Trail" is to be created nationwide.
This is planned by the association Sternwarte Sankt Andreasberg.
There is a planetary path in Göttingen - since 2003.
A "star trail" meets the information needs of many Harz visitors, it was said.
It combines nature, science, movement and sporting performance.
The members want to set up tables along the planned route and then inform about stars and constellations.
In a first phase until 2018, the association plans "easily accessible installations in five to six locations" in the Upper Harz region.
St. Andreasberg, Braunlage, Hohegeiß and Sieber would be eligible.
The information on the panels is to be supplemented via the Internet.
For this reason, a good mobile network reception plays a role in the selection of locations.
Accessibility is also a criterion.
Later, the star trail is to be extended by train.
"On the stellar path, the viewers will learn a lot of interesting facts, for example, about the physics of the individual stars," explained the association.
They also learned why stars have different colors, or why one star shines more strongly than another, even though it is much farther away.
It also provides information on the constellation in which a selected star is located and when it is best to see it.
The association has been running the highest observatory in northern Germany in the mountain town of St. Andreasberg since 2014.
The site in the middle of the Harz National Park is one of the six darkest regions in Germany, according to the Federal Agency for Nature Conservation.
From there, the Milky Way and even the Andromeda galaxy can often be seen with the naked eye.
Since 2003, on the initiative of the Society for the Promotion of the Planetarium in Göttingen, there has been something similar in the university city to the planned stargazing - the planetary path.
Starting in front of Gebhard's Hotel in the Goetheallee, which forms the interior of our solar system, the planetary path with its stelae leads up to the Hainberg and the observatory - as well as a "alien" location in Diemarden (municipality Gleichen) with the planet Sedna.
The stelae with the individual planets - including Pluto, which has been reduced to a dwarf planet at the end point - are precisely positioned at a distance and scale of one to two billion.
The earth shrinks to a ball of 6.5 millimetres in diameter, while the sun, which is exactly 75 metres away, measures 70 centimetres.
The total distance of the planetary path is about four kilometres.
While the light from the sun to the Pluto takes about eight hours, pedestrians need a good hour to reach the stele with Pluto.
Pedestrians are therefore faster than light in space.
The march to the next fixed star, however, would take another six months.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for the first time, discuss a possible showdown
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who were to be on a collision course to stage the most exciting boxing match under 147 pounds in the near future, met for the first time on Thursday.
They were in separate rooms at ESPN offices in Los Angeles until Garcia, the undefeated World Boxing Council lightweight champion, walked down the hallway to greet Lomachenko, the World Boxing Organization super-featherweight champion.
After Garcia's victory by unanimous decision over former four-division world champion Adrien Broner on Showtime on Saturday, both fighters are members of the top five pound-for-pound list.
Garcia stretched out his right hand and said, "how are you, champion?
I wish you good luck. "
Lomachenko defends his belt against Miguel Marriaga on Saturday night at 7 p.m. on ESPN.
As the pair posed for photos, Lomachenko manager Egis Klima noted that a possible showdown between the fighters would be the "perfect magnitude."
"I'm a former featherweight," Garcia recalled.
"I went up for Broner [to 140 pounds], but I'm not that big.
I'm small for 140.
I want to get down to lightweight.
And he has to move on lightweight [135 pounds] and then we fight.
That's what the fans demand.
Let's give them that. "
Lomachenko agreed.
"Boxing needs this fight."
Klima asked if it should be on pay-per-view, part of a strategy Lomachenko will have to fight with a 135-pound debut this year to agree a date next summer with Garcia (37-0, 30 knockouts) who also has interest in fighting the winner of Jorge Linares-Luke Campbell after their light-heavyweight title fight at the Forum on September 23.
"This fight could take place in pay-per-view mode because all the fans asked for it," Garcia said, later expressing himself openly to fight at the network that offers the best financial package.
We are the best.
No other names can generate this kind of attention.
Whenever they're ready... "
Garcia said he valued Lomachenko as "an enormous fighter," and he may be taking part in his Saturday fight.
But Lomachenko stopped by lavish praise for Garcia, saying that he thinks the three-fight champion from Riverside looks "very slow, sorry Mikey... You wanted to co-opt."
Garcia said the focus is to show batting strength, then boxing.
Both said they could feel the momentum building for their own fight.
"This is the fight that needs to be carried out.
No other fight creates so much attention and enthusiasm.
I'm more than happy to work on it, "Garcia said.
Lomachenko said: "I've been waiting for the top fighters and that's Mikey.
It's going to be a great fight. '
Four injured after tyre burst
Four people were partially seriously injured in an accident on the A7 on Thursday afternoon.
According to initial information, the driver of an Opel Zafira lost control of his vehicle at around 4.30 p.m. shortly before the Marktbreite junction, presumably after a tire burst.
The car slammed to the right into the embankment, where it fell over and then remained on the roof in the green strip.
The four occupants - two adults and two children - were seriously injured in the accident.
During the initial care of the injured by the ambulance service, the A7 northbound was closed for about a hour, after which the traffic on the left lane could be passed by the accident site.
Fortunas Hoffmann: "triple chain works better"
After the 2-2 season opener against Braunschweig, Andre Hoffmann hopes that the optimization of the defensive formation in Aue will bring points.
Andre Hoffmann was satisfied with the first match of the season, and with the result, had it not been for the two opponents in the 2-2 match against Braunschweig.
"That was two goals too much, and we have to be even more careful in Aue," says the defender from Fortuna Düsseldorf.
In the Ore Mountains, the triple chain is to be further optimised.
And a goal after a free-kick, the Fortunen don't want to catch on either.
"For the future, it will be the case that no one will stand next to Michael (Rensing) on the line."
Hoffmann is convinced that even after his experience in preparation, his team can cope better with the triple chain than with the quadruple chain.
"I don't know yet how we're going to operate in Aue," says his coach, Friedhelm Funkel, but Hoffmann is sure of his cause, "because we've just got players in the triple chain on the half-positions in Kaan Ayhan and Niko Gießelmann who can build well," Hoffmann said.
"The prerequisite, however, is that we harmonize even better and that we do not afford so many mistakes in the composition."
Of course, Hoffmann also goes to Aue to win the game.
"But whether you can talk about a failed start after a draw, you don't know.
The performance could be okay, "said Hoffmann.
"But if we can come up with four points on Sunday and concentrate on the cup, we will certainly be able to talk about a proper start to the season."
His coach didn't want to know about that.
"I don't judge the start of the season until six to eight days," said Friedhelm Funkel, who does not want to speak of an advantage over Aue just because the Saxons "match in Heidenheim had to be cancelled prematurely due to a storm.
"Now they can almost start the season with a home game," said Funkel and Hoffmann, believing that the players from Aue might even be a little fresher as they wouldn't have a heavy and complete game like Fortuna against an uphill favorite in the bone.
"But they don't know 100 percent where they are at the moment," says Fortuna's defense attorney.
It is true that the guests from the Rhineland will go to the meeting in the (almost) finished stadium of Aue on Sunday as a slight favourite.
"To sweep them away just because we are entitled to get under the top six is nonsense," says Funkel, whose record of just one defeat against Aue from nine matches is thoroughly positive.
"There is no team in the 2nd Bundesliga that you have to beat from the start," explains Fortuna's head coach.
"To make such a statement would be arrogant and arrogant."
And so Funkel does not want to see his players on Sunday.
New results of Sweden's asylum age assessment tests published
The latest results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden, which have been subjected to a new method of medical assessment of their age, show that more than 80 percent of those tested are over the age of 18, but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results.
The Swedish Agency for Forensic Medicine (Rättsmedicinalverket) started carrying out the tests last year.
They are to make a more accurate assessment of age during the asylum procedure, after the Swedish Migration Agency (Migrationsverket) was criticised for errors in assessing the correct age of some refugees who were underage.
To date, Migrationsverket has sent out 6,880 cases to be tested and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,481 tests from mid-March to July 31, 2017.
Eighty percent (2002) were judged to be 18 or older, while in another 25 cases the Forensic Medicine Agency assessed that the person was "possibly 18 years or older."
In 432 cases, the conclusion was that the person "may be under the age of 18."
The tests are only carried out in cases where the age of the person is questioned.
According to Johan Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency, the results have been consistent over the past few months.
"We don't see much difference in the statistics of the past few months, the numbers are pretty constant," he told The Local magazine.
The high proportion of cases in which the person was judged to be over 18 does not necessarily mean that the asylum seeker lied about his age.
In May, the agency released the results of 581 tests and said there were 442 cases that "suggest that the person under investigation is 18 years or older."
When the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet examined the 581 published results, it found that in 243 of these cases, the person had openly said that he would turn 18 this year.
The method of medical age assessment, which involves X-rays of wisdom teeth and MRI images of knee joints, which are then analysed by dentists and radiologists, has also been criticised in some areas.
One skeptic is the endocrinologist Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute, whose work includes assessing people's biological maturity to see if they went through puberty sooner or later than usual.
"I had reason to think about it, and I don't think the type of measurement should be used.
Judging biological age in this way is very uncertain.
If we can't say it for sure, we shouldn't pretend we can, "he told Metro newspaper.
However, Göransson, of the Forensic Medicine Agency, defended the accuracy of the tests: "in general, you can say that the risk of misjudging a child as an adult is low.
The biggest risk is if the person is just under 18, in this case it's about 10 percent. "
Full on schedule
Work on the three bridges of Landstrasse 108 between Lauterbach and Schramberg is progressing well.
On Wednesday, a seven tonne concrete section was installed at the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lauterbach.
"We're very good at the time, it's going great," says Reinhold Leicht, construction manager at the Department of Road and Transport at the regional council of Freiburg.
In April, work began simultaneously on all three bridges between Schramberg and Lauterbach in need of renovation.
The construction is scheduled to end in October and it is easy to be sure that the schedule will be met.
The first bridge, coming from Schramberg, crosses the Trombach.
It is a concrete arched bridge clad in red sandstone and has a total length of 4.80 metres.
It was built in 1900.
Like the other two bridges, it has now come into its own.
In order to ensure stability and road safety, the three buildings will now be thoroughly renovated.
The other two bridges cross the Lauterbach.
They are made of red sandstone.
Both were built in 1939 and are twelve, or 10.60 metres long.
The bridge at the entrance to the village of Lauterbach has now received a bridge cap, 1.30 metres wide and weighing seven tonnes, on the north side on Wednesday morning.
This is a fringe attachment, which is also used as an operating route.
A 2.20-metre wide bridge cap is to be used on the southern part of the bridge on Friday.
The pedestrian path should then run along it.
The special thing is that these are finished parts, a patent of the Schramberger company Dizwo.
The other two bridges are already equipped with the patented bridge caps.
The laying of pipelines through the building in Lauterbach required a special sensitivity.
This is where a fibre optic cable runs, to which many companies are connected.
The local residents were informed of the project by hand in advance of the work.
In addition, fish and crabs had to be fished first.
For the bridges between the Bauhofgebäude and the Sammelweiher in the direction of Schramberg, traffic is regulated single-lane by a traffic light.
For the construction work on the bridge at the entrance to Lauterbach, the road in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotels "Tannenhof" and "seven Linden" is fully closed.
The total cost of the three bridge renovations is 700 000 euros.
The whole thing is financed by the country.
AFD in Gerolstein: colourful protest at German potato salad
It is not so common for parties to pull together, but when it comes to the Alternative for Germany (AfD), it comes together, which is otherwise difficult to reconcile.
The parties represented in the Kreistag Vulkaneifel (CDU, SPD, Greens, FDP, FWG, Left) belong to a broad alliance, which on this day shows a peaceful flag, because the AfD invites in the Gerolsteiner Stadthalle Rondell to the poster "great campaign launch."
And brings well-known names to the start - such as Alice Weidel, who, along with Alexander Gauland, forms the top duo for the federal election on September 24, and Deputy Federal President Beatrix von Storch.
But those who are on the scene hours before the start of the event do not want to listen to the AfD people, they want to demonstrate.
The motto "the Eifel remains colourful."
Originally, the city picnic was planned under the motto "all at one table" on the Brunnenplatz, but now takes place in the parking lot below the Rondel - and thus directly in front of the eyes of those who come to the AfD event in the Stadthalle.
A colorful picture that offers itself.
And what Christa Karoli, president of the One World Forum and one of the leading organizers, is really pleased: "great how many people have come together here."
There is music and plenty of food, including a "original German potato salad, which the AfD could easily eat," says the woman who brought it.
The police have ordered many officers to Gerolstein, and they are particularly present at the station, which is only a few metres away from the venues.
How did the AfD actually get to Gerolstein?
Mario Hompes of the AfD Vulkaneifel reports that he tried to organise such an event and won the award.
The 45-year-old from Gönnersdorf had initially asked for a parking space in Daun, but was refused there because there were not enough parking spaces because of the Laurentiuskirmes, which had already been built.
So now the Rondell, Hompes is happy that "we can have such a beautiful event here."
Looking at the event on Rondellvorplatz, he says: "this is the right of the people, the main thing is that it remains peaceful."
This is also the case: at around 8 p.m., a band provides entertainment on the Rondellvorplatz, and various speakers in the Stadthalle, including the Rhineland-Palatinate AfD chairman Uwe Junge.
In the hall are about 200 listeners waiting for the top candidate for the Bundestag election, Alice Weidel, and Deputy Federal President Beatrix von Storch to give their speeches.
The police presence remains unchanged, but so far the officers have had a quiet evening.
The AfD event lasts a little more than a hour, the guests on the forecourt have a longer breath, but there is also a need to clean up shortly after 9 p.m.
The police can leave - no special incidents.
Trombone hits trumpet
A rehearsal with the Wolfenstein trombonist Frederic Belli will take place in the Haslacher Klosterkonzerte tomorrow, Sunday, at 8 p.m. in the Klosterkirche.
Together with the Bulgarian trumpeter Miroslav Petkov, he gives a concert under the motto "the Black Sea meets the Black Forest," or even "Balkan folklore" meets a classical German education with roots in brass music.
Both soloists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and hold solo positions in top European orchestras.
Petkov is a solo trumpeter with the renowned Concertgebouw Orchestra Amsterdam and Frederic Belli is a solo trombonist with the SWR Symphony Orchestra.
Both combine the desire not only to transcend the boundaries of their instruments, but also to merge the boundaries of the different genres.
This is how Johann Sebastian Bach sounds to both of them as if in a new guise, Daniel Schnyder's "world Music" combines with Bulgarian folklore, and in the piece "exchange Suite" by jazz musician Nils Wogram, classical, jazz and free playing blend into a fascinating work of art.
This centrepiece of the programme was only premiered in Freiburg this spring with huge success.
The renowned composer Nils Wogram wrote it especially for the two musicians and even more: the Haslacher Klosterkirche with its special acoustics is consciously included in the concert.
Kristen Stewart talks about her bisexuality
"Some people love grilled cheese and will eat it until the end of their lives.
But I want to try everything, "Kristen Stewart said candidly about her bisexuality.
"Once I bite into grilled cheese, I think," Oh that was cool, what's next? .""
The Hollywood star's most famous relationship was with her "twilight" colleague Robert Pattinson, who ultimately fell apart bitterly.
Despite all this, the brunette actress assures the "Harper's Bazaar" magazine: "I was seriously in love with everyone I met.
Or do you think I played it? "
After their split, Kristen admitted that she was bisexual: "I've always lived dualism and seriously believed in it.
So it has never confused or hindered me.
I just never liked not to be taken seriously. "
According to "bang Showbiz," she suffered particularly during school, when she preferred to dress like a lad: "not all girls are typical girls.
It really hurt me a lot.
When I was eleven, the children told me I looked like a lad.
I felt really attacked, scared and ashamed.
Now I look back and think to myself, "Girl, be proud of you!."
She doesn't like to explain her love life to the public in particular: "people expect you to behave in a certain way and that annoys me.
And maybe some people call me ungrateful, but I don't like having to justify myself in front of the whole public. "
West Virginia governor announces he's changing party
. West Virginia's Democratic governor, Jim Justice, announced Thursday night at a rally with President Trump that he would switch sides.
Whether you like it or not, the Democrats have moved away from me, "governor Justice said.
"Today, I'm going to tell you with a lot of prayers and a lot of thought... Today, as a West Virginia resident, I'm going to tell you I can't help you anymore if I'm a Democratic governor."
The rally erupted in jubilation.
"Tomorrow I will change my registration to the Republicans," Justice added.
"As a coach, I would say it's time to play another game."
Mr. Trump previously promised a major announcement at the West Virginia rally.
Mr. Trump won West Virginia by 42 points, and Justice did not approve Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.
Justice, who is the only billionaire in the state, according to Forbes, was elected in 2016.
Forbes notes that he owns coal mines in five states and inherited a coal business from his father.
It is worth about $1.59 billion.
Meanwhile, the Republican National Committee issued a statement Thursday night saying, "governor Justice's party change is another blow to a Democratic Party that would prevent us rather than work to make our country great again."
"With only 15 governorships and control of the fewest legislatures in history, Governor Justice's announcement is just the latest rejection of a party that is devoid of leadership from top to bottom and unable to find a positive, unifying message," RNC Chairman Ronna McDaniel told CBS News in a statement.
Coe praises "honest" Russian apology over doping scandal
World Athletics chief Sebastian Coe on Thursday praised what he described as an apparent apology from Russia over a doping scandal, but he repeated it was not the moment for the country to get back into the sport.
Russia's athletics chief Dmitry Shylakhtin said during the IAAF congress on the eve of the World Athletics Championships that his country's banishment from the sport was correct and that he was determined to fight doping.
He said he was sorry for "all the athletes who were stripped of gold and silver medals in competitions."
Despite his comments, the IAAF Congress voted to uphold the ban, which was imposed in November 2015 after a World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) report found evidence of state-sponsored doping in Russia.
"I thought it was a very open answer today, a very honest presentation," IAAF president Coe told reporters.
"The entire Council and the entire Congress were pleased that the Russian Federation recognized by itself that it has experienced some rather hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is redesigned."
Coe said he was also "pleased" that Russia accepted the criteria for its reinstatement.
"I think it was a very constructive day and I think progress has been made, but Congress supports the task force's recommendations that this is not the moment to reinstate Russia," Coe said.
"We have to do everything in the next few months to normalise this situation.
The guiding principle has always been that we wanted to separate clean athletes from the tainted system, "he added
Nineteen Russian athletes will compete as neutral players at the World Athletics Championships, which begin in London on Friday, according to the strict IAAF criteria.
The head of the IAAF task force, Rune Andersen, said on Monday that Russia had yet to meet some of the criteria for reinstatement.
Drug testing is still inadequate and banned trainers are still operating freely, he told reporters in London after a lecture at the IAAF Council.
Act of mourning for soldiers killed in Mali
At a funeral ceremony in Fritzlar in northern Hesse, around 1000 people thought of the two soldiers killed in a helicopter crash in Mali.
The ceremony took place on Thursday in the cathedral city under high security precautions.
Defence Minister Ursula von der Leyen (CDU) said nothing about the outstanding cause of the crash.
However, she described the two lost pilots as "experts in their field."
"We bow to this highest sacrifice they have made on behalf of the Federal Republic of Germany," she said.
The 33-year-old major and the 47-year-old chief of staff from North Hesse were killed in West African Mali on Wednesday a week ago.
Their coffins were transferred to Germany and brought to the Fritzlarer Dom Sankt Peter on Thursday, accompanied by a death guard of the Bundeswehr.
At noon, at first, only the relatives in the church said goodbye.
After that, the funeral ceremony began in the circle of the family, close friends, representatives of the Bundeswehr and politicians.
Among them were Hesse's prime minister, Volker Bouffier (CDU), and the inspector general of the Bundeswehr, Volker Wieker.
Mourners laid down roses, relatives stood arm in arm at the coffins.
In front of the church, Fritzlarer and numerous soldiers watched the ceremony on a canvas.
Defence Minister von der Leyen described the dead soldiers as "highly decorated" and deployed.
The chief of staff had helped to set up the flight operations of the Tiger helicopter in Fritzlar and was one of the first six trained Tiger pilots in his regiment.
Volker Bauersachs, commander of the regiment, to which the soldiers belong, also declared: "if this crew could not avert the crash, no one would have succeeded."
Minister von der Leyen did not express doubts about the U.N. mission in Mali: the operation was dangerous.
But it is also of high importance "for a country from which we are separated only by two states," she said.
After the funeral, the coffins were taken out of the cathedral.
When and where they will be buried, the Bundeswehr did not provide any information.
Prince Henrik does not want a grave next to his wife
The husband of Queen Margrethe of Denmark (77), Prince Henrik (83), does not want to be buried next to his wife after his death.
The royals announced this on Thursday.
Traditionally, the Danish royal couple is buried in the Cathedral Church of Roskilde.
The sculptor Bjørn Nørgaard already made a sarcophagus for the two.
The Queen agreed with her husband's decision, the statement said.
It is still unclear where Prince Henrik will be buried.
However, he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland.
Prince Henrik had never made a secret of the fact that he was not happy with his title.
After his wife Margrethe ascended the throne in 1972, he would have liked to become king.
He retired in 2016 and is also entitled "Prinzgemahl."
Since Henrik did not get the title and function he wanted in Denmark, he did not consider himself equal to his wife - not even after death, explained Lene Balleby, the chief spokeswoman of the Danish royal house.
Where the 83-year-old's final resting place will ultimately be is still unclear.
However, he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland, but in Denmark.
He likes the country he has worked for over the past 50 years.
Born Henri de Laborde de Monpezat, son of a French noble family, Margrethe met in London in 1965.
He worked on the Thames in the French embassy.
While his later wife always received popular expressions of sympathy, Prince Henrik had a difficult time with the Danes in his almost 50-year reign.
In an autobiography, Henrik said of the first years in Denmark: "a few months after my arrival, everything I did was criticised.
My Danish was fluctuating, I preferred wine instead of beer, silk stockings instead of knitted socks, Citroën instead of Volvo, tennis instead of football.
Even for the Gauloises, whom I smoked instead of Virginia-tobacco and who in this country had the reputation of being the brand of socially critical intellectuals, I could not hope for leniency.
I was different.
I seemed happy with that position and not ashamed.
These were two mistakes! "
Prime Minister Weil wants swift re-election
CDU and FDP ahead of possible majority in Lower Saxony
After the loss of the red-green government majority, Lower Saxony's Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) is in favour of a rapid re-election of the state parliament, but he does not want to resign.
Because spoke on Friday in favour of the dissolution of Parliament.
Previously, the surprise resignation of a Green MP from her parliamentary group in Lower Saxony had plunged the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) into a serious crisis.
Five months before the official date of the state election, the red-green coalition in Hanover lost its narrow one-vote majority in parliament to the opposition from the CDU and FDP.
Former Green MP Elke Twesten justified her move by not nominating for the 2018 election in her constituency in Rotenburg (Wümme).
"I see my political future in the CDU," she declared in Hanover on Friday.
CDU leader Björn Thümler wants to recommend that his group accept them.
As a result, the CDU and the FDP would have a combined 69 seats in the Lower Saxony state parliament, the SPD and the Greens 68.
So far, the relationship has been reversed.
The new parliament will be elected on 14 January next year.
Thümler said the red-green state government must now decide whether it can continue to govern in this situation without a majority.
Stephan Weil believes, however, that it is essential for the Landtag to decide on its own dissolution as quickly as possible.
The CDU group is expected to decide on its next course of action on Tuesday.
The state constitution also provides for the possibility of the state parliament depriving the prime minister of confidence and electing a successor.
"Our Constitution offers several options.
These possibilities must be examined in a legally sound manner, "Thümler said.
"All issues will be discussed calmly if they are properly examined by law."
Thümler called Twesten's move "a little curious."
The politician herself stressed: "I am not a traitor.
I feel very good. "
She described herself as a supporter of black and green.
The Greens called on the breakaway MPs to return their Landtag mandate.
"We assume, of course, that she will return her country mandate, which she received via the Green Land List, with immediate effect," said the regional chairmen, Meta Janssen-Kucz and Stefan Körner.
Greens leader Anja Piel said: "we deeply regret Elke Twesten's decision."
She deliberately chose not to hold a debate in the group.
"Even in the light of the fact that there were no differences in content, we cannot understand this step."
SPD candidate for chancellor Martin Schulz denounces the transfer of Lower Saxony Green MP Elke Twesten to the CDU as a betrayal.
"The behaviour of the former Green deputies in Lower Saxony is not only a betrayal of the voters, but also a betrayal of Red Green," the federal head of the Social Democrats wrote on Facebook on Friday.
He supported the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) to have the Landtag re-elected quickly.
Leaving Twesten costs Rot-Grün the majority in Lower Saxony.
The politician "in her wounded vanity and frustration put her personal interests before the good of the country," criticised SPD Secretary General Hubertus Heil.
"It is a scandal that the CDU in Lower Saxony is involved in this dirty intrigue and is trying to make political capital out of it."
Dutch CDU leader Björn Thümler wants to recommend his deputies to include Elke Twesten in the CDU.
The leader of the SPD in the Bundestag, Thomas Oppermann, accused Tvests of falsifying the result of the 2013 state election with personal career thinking.
At the time, the CDU was the strongest force before the SPD, but the SPD and the Greens had a razor-thin majority of one vote in the parliament.
Minister of Agriculture in interview - How do we protect ourselves from poison eggs, Mr Schmidt?
Germany is discussing contaminated eggs.
How could the scandal happen?
How can consumers protect themselves.
Minister of Agriculture Christian Schmidt (CSU) is interviewed by the RedaktionsNetzwerk Deutschland (RND).
Mr Schmidt, how can consumers protect themselves against poisoned eggs?
I can only encourage all consumers to look closely at the eggs in your fridge and check the stamp.
On the consumer protection portal www.Lebensmittelwarnung.de, the federal states provide the latest information on the affected egg batches.
Affected eggs should be destroyed or returned.
Even if, according to everything we know at the moment, there is virtually no risk to health.
Is Aldi now taking on the best possible crisis response - all eggs out of the range - because the central role of the reconnaissance is not really being played by the Federal Minister of Agriculture?
Food monitoring is the responsibility of the federal states.
Nevertheless, my house immediately opened up and has been in close contact with the authorities of the countries ever since Germany became aware of its concern.
All information and risk assessment are available to consumers.
Retailers, as well as manufacturers, must ensure that the products sold are transportable and harmless to health.
If eggs exceed the maximum residue limit of 0.005mg / kg, they are not transportable.
However, unloaded eggs can be sold and eaten.
This time, it is not the companies that are to blame.
Are production companies and consumers in the same boat?
According to current knowledge, the production companies are not directly responsible.
On the contrary, they are likely to suffer economic damage as a result of alleged illegal practices by service providers.
As always, there are not enough inspectors in case of an emergency.
Is there only a shortage of staff or a lack of coherent competence?
After all, it was the official controls that uncovered the operation.
The truth is, however, that food fraud and criminal energy can never be completely ruled out.
It is precisely for this reason that a consistent investigation of such events and the transfer to the public prosecutor's offices in cases where criminal offences may occur are of crucial importance.
I have already made it clear on several occasions that I expect the responsible authorities to provide full information.
Is regular alarm bells really necessary in food scandals?
Consumers have the right to receive only safe and transportable food.
When an unapproved insecticide is used in the food industry, consumers are rightly outraged.
The adulterated means have put manufacturers, distributors and consumers in a situation that is absolutely unnecessary.
In principle, it must be clear that the illegal use of the insecticide Fipronil in the keeping of food-producing animals is unacceptable and must be stopped immediately.
This must be done consistently and with high pressure at all levels.
I expect all the competent authorities to clarify the situation quickly and completely.
How football's financial rules affect Neymar's move to Paris
The rules, aimed at preventing unfettered spending by European football clubs, will not disrupt Neymar's world-record transfer from Spain's Barcelona to France's Paris-Saint Germain.
Any consequences will still come for Paris Saint-Germain from UEFA, because the governing body that oversees the European game has the power to ban teams from accessing the prestigious Champions League tournament.
Financial fair play rules, created by UEFA in 2011, mean PSG will eventually have to prove that the transfer of Neymar was funded without major losses.
Barcelona have paid 222 million euros ($262 million) to buy the Brazilian out of his contract and Neymar will receive a salary that will be several tens of millions of dollars a year.
Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymar's move to France.
PSG can certainly make the money loose for Neymar to sign and take him to a galaxy of other stars, given the team's funding from Qatar's energy-rich ruling family.
Clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money on acquiring players, but must counteract with legitimate sources of revenue that allow them the break-even point in their football-related business.
FFP was conceived by Michel Platini after his election as UEFA president in 2007.
The former French player believed clubs who had taken on huge debts in their pursuit of success were effectively cheating and risking ruining themselves if banks or owners withdrew their support.
In 2011, FFP shifted from focusing on the club's debt to monitoring its losses.
The change meant that the business model Roman Abramovich originally used at Chelsea in 2003 - buying a club with potential and then investing heavily to improve the squad and build a global brand - should become a tougher affair.
During the current three-year FFP investment period, which runs until 2018, clubs can take losses of 30 million euros.
And although Platini fell out of favor with the presidency in 2015, his UEFA successor, Aleksander Ceferin, remains committed to deterring excessive spending.
"Certainly FFP is not dead and we will certainly strengthen the rules for the future," Andrea Traverso, who is in charge of FFP at UEFA, told The Associated Press last week.
Although PSG paid Neymar's buy-out clause in a lump sum, it can distribute the amount for the accounting over the duration of his contract.
Neymar has signed a five-year contract so that the transfer fee for the next five years of 44.4 million euros can be reported in the annual accounts.
The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 hit PSG with the heaviest sanctions, along with Abu Dhabi, which is owned by Manchester City.
PSG were fined 60 million euros ($82 million at the time), which was later reduced to 20 million euros - and it was ordered that team members remain limited to 21 players for the 2014/15 Champions League season instead of the otherwise normal 25.
UEFA is looking for clubs that could try to outwit its financial watchdog by inflating its revenues through companies linked to the owners of a club.
While a Qatari company could sponsor PSG if the value of the sponsorship exceeded the standard market rates, UEFA would not allow this to be considered a legitimate income.
That's exactly what happened in 2014, when UEFA decided that the value of PSA's sponsorship was inflated by the Qatar Tourism Authority.
It has been reported that some of the PSG payments to Neymar could come via payments from the organising committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.
But PSG and Qatar 2022 have denied that Neymar will become World Cup ambassador and such a maneuver could be easy for UEFA regulators to figure out.
The sanctions against PSG so far mean that UEFA will be even more attentive to any attempt to circumvent the rules.
UEFA had no preliminary discussions with PSG about Neymar's transfer, people familiar with the situation said on Thursday.
They spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to discuss the PSG situation.
The latest published reports show that PSG made a profit of more than 10 million euros in 2015/16 with a turnover of 542.4 million euros.
The accounts for the last financial year have yet to be published.
PSG expects Neymar's arrival to be a boon for sponsorship deals, merchandising and jersey sales.
The association expects sales to increase by at least 30 percent after signing.
The Spanish league was clearly irritated to see one of the best footballers go, and it tried to prevent Neymar's departure by claiming that PSG would breach the FFP.
"It's a clear case of" financial doping "with the club and the state," la Liga president Javier Tebas told Spanish daily AS regarding Qatar's eventual ownership of PSG.
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, whose club is owned by an American sports tycoon, shares La Liga's reservations about a state that funds a club.
"It's the consequence of ownership and that has completely changed the whole landscape of football over the last 15 years," Wenger said on Thursday.
"As soon as a country has an association, everything is possible.
It's going to be very difficult to respect financial fair play because you can go different ways or have different interests when a country has such a big player to represent a country. "
Swiss is looking for a new school supplier
In recent years, Chocolat Frey has produced in-flight chocolate for Swiss.
Now the sweet collaboration is about to come to an end: the airline is rewriting the order.
Swissspokeswoman Meike Fuhlrott, at the request of the news agency sda, confirmed a corresponding report from the newspaper "Nordwestschweiz" on Friday.
According to current plans, the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018.
The products would be inspected every two to three years and subjected to quality control.
"We are very pleased with the current supplier Chocolat Frey," the spokeswoman said.
The flight attendants distribute around 17 million small, red-and-white, 14 grams of shock boards to passengers each year before landing.
Swiss did not want to provide any information on the costs.
According to "Northwest Switzerland," industry insiders estimate the order volume to be between 1.5 and 2 million Swiss francs - the Migros subsidiary generates annual sales of around one billion Swiss francs.
But more important is the advertising effect: it is a prestigious order for a chocolate manufacturer.
Swiss does not want to reveal how many applicants there are in the new tender.
However, only Swiss manufacturers are eligible.
According to the newspaper report, Chocolat Frey is looking to renew the contract beyond the spring of 2018.
For sda, the largest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not available for comment.
Swiss has been distributing chocolate boards on board its flights since 2006.
Before Swiss signed a contract with the Migros subsidiary, Barry Callebaut, in collaboration with Hug, supplied the chocolate tablets.
Swiss introduced the possibility of placing the logo two and a half years ago with the launch of its collaboration with Chocolat Frey.
The airline works with various Swiss chocolate producers.
On long-haul flights, First Class customers are treated to treats from Confiserie Sprüngli, Business Class passengers Schoggi from Lindt and Economy Class Schoggi from Chocolat Frey.
Swiss Schoggi from Chocolat Frey also distributes on the short-haul route, both in business and economy class.
Athletics - Discus Olympic champion Robert Harting reaches World Cup final
The three-time world champion will fight for a medal in the final on Saturday.
His brother Christoph, the 2016 Olympic champion, had failed in the national championship draw and could only watch the discus contest from the stands.
Also with the first attempt, Polish defending champion Piotr Malachowski, who threw 65.13 metres, qualified for the final fight.
Nostalgia goes into the niche in "wet Hot American Summer" and "comrade Detective"
This repetition of the story is simultaneously nostalgic for the glory days of the characters of the 80s, for the 90s grunge era (when the prethinkers David Wain and Michael Showalter were shooting the sketch comedy "the State" for MTV), and for themselves - that is, for 2001, before their stars, such as Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd, went to bigger things.
As a cultural artifact, it is equally a parody and an embodiment of our Facebook-enabled era of permanent memories.
But as a franchise, it feels like time is running out.
"First Day of Camp" worked surprisingly well, not just because of its absurd humor (it included an original story for a talking can of vegetables spoken by H. Jon Benjamin).
By sticking to the core of the gag - middle-aged actors playing horny children who grow up - they nevertheless managed the impossibility of winning back the last part of the joke.
"Ten Years Later," with its adults now playing adults, is less emotionally rooted and its parody goes more to the casting, including a riff on the Stalker films of the 1990s like "the Hand That Rocks the Cradle."
At one point, a character rummages through an Apple Powerbook, some inline skates and "a number of other things from 1991."
Many of the central stories are the same.
The amiable Coop (Mr. Showalter), now a novelist, still hasn't forgotten Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) still hasn't lost his virginity.
And there's another crazy vicious plot involving Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter), now backed by George H. W. Bush (a well-received impression of Michael Ian Black).
As always, the exs are the best part of the franchise.
It's especially fun to see the eternally young Mr. Rudd, who shows Matt Dillon's underbelly of "singles," whose former big-man on-camp Andy now feels like an old knacker.
It's the moments of random madness that could fuel this franchise like a kind of repetitive "seven Up!" Series until it reaches what I assume to be its logical conclusion: "wet Hot American Summer: twenty Years Later," whose final scene will show the gang as they attend the film premiere of "wet Hot American Summer."
"Comrade Detective" on Amazon, meanwhile, recalls a different kind of nostalgia: the Cold War revival of "the Americans," the film "Atomic Blonde," and even "glow," with its east-facing West wrestling iconography.
Created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka, the comedy starring Rhys Thomas as director claims to be a found TV series: a Romanian drama of the 1980s with the two policemen as friends, two officers from Bucharest fighting for truth, atheism and the path of Marxism-Leninism.
The lead roles - a hard-edged Gregor and an idealistic Iosef - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Ulici, whose dialogues are dubbed in English by Channing Tatum (also an executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
It's a brilliant idea.
But it's not much more than an idea.
There are some nice gags to watch (the police spend the time watching chess on TV, as Americans might do with football).
And the list of famous speakers - including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny - makes for a decent game of "Find the Voice Out."
But "comrade Detective" is so committed to the veracity of a desperate propaganda drama - a killer wearing a Reagan mask is included - that it often plays like a single one.
It drags on for six long episodes, and comedy isn't fast or frequent enough.
"Comrade Detective," which has been edited to a lesser length, could better deliver its agitprop satire as Gregor and Iosef repeatedly visit the American Embassy, whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men devouring a pile of hamburgers.
The message for the imagined communist audience is that Western culture can make everything fodder for a laugh.
The fictional Romanian creators were not wrong: we are even doing it with our own recent history and theirs.
Blow to drug mafia in the country
The police have dealt a blow to the Italian mafia in Baden-Württemberg.
On Wednesday morning, numerous objects were searched in the Schwarzwald-Baar-Kreis, in Rottweil, Konstanz, Esslingen and Stuttgart, the public prosecutor's office in Konstanz announced on Friday.
15 defendants, aged between 25 and 77, have been arrested and arrest warrants have already been issued against them.
Officials also secured large quantities of marijuana and cocaine, firearms and several hundred thousand euros.
Two people were arrested in simultaneous raids in Italy.
German arrest warrants were issued against the two Italian suspects.
The two are therefore likely to be extradited to Germany.
Italian and Bavarian investigators were involved in the action.
In total, more than 300 police officers were on duty.
Members of the mafia are accused of organised drug crime, serious violence, attempted murder and robbery and extortion.
The public prosecutor's office in Konstanz has been investigating organised drug trafficking in southern Germany since the summer of 2016.
There was a lively exchange between the prosecutors in Constance and Palermo, and the investigators of Kripo Rottweil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily.
For this reason, four officers from Palermo accompanied the large-scale operation on Wednesday morning.
The investigation focused mainly on Italian nationals with close ties to the Italian mafia.
An incident on May 27 in Hüfingen, where several shots were fired into a restaurant early in the morning, is also likely to be blamed on the gang.
Weise complains of large gaps in the foreign register
"Data of citizens who should not show up": According to one report, the foreign register in Germany has significant shortcomings.
This leads to sometimes serious errors in asylum procedures.
According to a media report, the Federal Government's representative for refugee management, Frank-Jürgen Weise, drew attention to large gaps in the central register of foreigners.
Deficiencies in the data registered there could lead to "sometimes serious wrong decisions" in asylum procedures and deportations, warned Weise in an analysis available to the "Süddeutsche Zeitung."
According to the data, the register covers ten million people of foreign nationality, including around 5.7 million from non-EU countries.
The data will therefore be managed by around 600 foreign authorities in Germany.
Because the data has not been sufficiently maintained, the data quality has not been good in parts.
In individual cases, data from 1921 were found, "of people who are no longer alive, or of citizens who have become German citizens and should not appear in the register."
"Incorrect data input can significantly slow down return processes," the report said.
In addition, the statistics on people who are eligible to leave include EU citizens who do not have to leave at all.
Such incorrect attributions, however, "led to a distorted debate about how to deal with expatriates," according to the analysis.
Meanwhile, the federal government appears to have started sending refugee families with children under 16 back to Italy when they arrived from there.
This is according to an internal paper of the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF), reports the "Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung."
According to the paper, the BAMF has been carrying out such procedures "concerning families with children - with the exception of infants and very young children - to Italy since 1 June 2017."
Since the end of 2014, this has been virtually impossible, according to the newspaper, citing the difficult situation on the ground.
Under the Dublin Convention, refugees are the responsibility of the EU state they first reach.
If a migrant travels to another EU country, that state can send him back to the country of entry.
For reasons, the office now writes: "in the meantime, the reception capacity for families with underage children in Italy has increased significantly."
Italy has provided guarantees for the reception and accommodation of families.
Even the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) considers these commitments to be sufficient.
Other EU states would also send refugees back there under the Dublin agreement.
Ulla Jelpke, spokeswoman for the left-wing party in the Bundestag, criticised the decision: "families with children are threatened with reception conditions that are contrary to human rights and a threat to the welfare of the child due to the shortcomings in the Italian asylum system."
Second best result achieved
A total of 220 litres of blood from people living in Oberreichenbach has already been made available to other people by the blood donation service.
At least of the 12 citizens who were awarded on Friday.
First and foremost, Jürgen Greule, who, with his now 100 donations, now shared 50 litres of blood.
Traditionally, at the council meeting, the congregation pays tribute to the multiple willingness to donate blood.
"It is ingenious how our bodies are designed for this and we pay respect to the donors who provide their blood for strangers, not to mention altruistic ones," underlined Mayor Karlheinz Kistner.
"A single donation of blood helps several people," explained Holger Maisenbacher, director of the German Red Cross (DRK), as the canned food is broken down into its components.
Three people could benefit from a blood donation.
At the same time, Maisenbacher reported on the actions that will be carried out in the spring in Oberreichenbach.
"This year, with 114 donors, we achieved the second best result," said the DRK district director.
Obviously, the move to the theatre a few years ago led to higher numbers of participants.
Even before that, Thomas Bockstadt, Susanne Reichle, Sandra Schöck, Thomas Reichle and Meta Umbeer were among the multiple donors and were awarded for 50 blood donations each.
Half as many as Herbert Mair and Dorothee Riexinger, while Tamara Pfrommer, Petra Schleeh, Stefanie Stoll and Uwe Vetter each gave 500 millilitres of their lifeblood.
The Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged after weak economic growth and weakening inflation dampened speculation of a rise.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain "sluggish" as it kept interest rates on family incomes in the midst of intensifying pressure.
Policymakers on the Bank's Monetary Committee (MPC) voted 6 to 2 to keep interest rates at 0.25%, with fewer members seeking a rise this month as weak economic growth weakened support for an increase.
In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7% and for 2018 to 1.6%, warning that the squeeze on household incomes would continue, with inflation still expected to rise to just under 3% in the autumn.
But she signalled that interest rate rises would become necessary in the next few years to rein in Brexit-fuelled inflation and she said borrowing costs may have to rise more than expected in financial markets.
Members also voted to withdraw part of the mammoth stimulus package issued a year ago after Brexit.
It will call time on the funding plan to provide cheaper funding for banks from next February, although it has been said that it is now expected to provide £15bn more under this scheme - at £115bn.
Minutes after the interest rate decision, the bank said: "in the MPC's central forecast, gross domestic product (GDP) remains weak in the short term as pressure on household real incomes continues to weigh on consumption."
On interest rates, she repeated that "some monetary tightening" would be needed to cool inflation and a "slightly larger" extent than markets expect.
The markets are currently forecasting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020.
However, the bank stressed that increases would be "gradual" and "limited."
The Bank's downwardly revised growth forecasts for this year and next are in line with the 1.9% and 1.7% forecast in May.
It has maintained its growth forecast to 1.8% in 2018.
The pound fell against the dollar and the euro after this news.
The pound fell 0.5% to $1.31 and fell 0.4% to Euro1.11.
The decision to make no change comes after recent disappointing growth figures dampened rising expectations of a rate rise and GDP rose to 0.3% in the second quarter from 0.2% in the previous three months.
Growth is expected to be 0.3% in the third quarter, although it will recover slightly towards the end of the year, according to the bank.
The latest inflation report offered little enthusiasm for households hit by rising inflation and small pay rises, as the tightening gets worse first before it gets better.
It added that monetary policy cannot "prevent" the drop in income over the next few years, but it added that wages will "recover significantly" towards the end of its three-year forecast.
The economy is also bolstered by rising demand for British goods, due to the weak pound, which will offset some of the lower consumer spending.
The decision comes a year after interest rates were cut to 0.25% last August following the shocking EU vote that caused the pound to fall.
The bank estimates that it will probably take four years for this to fully reach prices and the economy.
Before the Bank's latest ruling on interest rates, calls for a rate rise had risen as inflation ratcheted up pressure on hard-pressed households, with three policymakers calling for a rise to 0.5% in July.
Inflation has fallen to 2.6% in the past month from 2.9% in June, although the Bank said this was expected and it will pick up again in the coming months.
The bank said the excess relative to its 2% target was "entirely" attributable to the weak pound.
Andrew Montlake, director at Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: "given the recent drop in swap rates, the mortgage market is likely to become more competitive again as lenders clamor for deals and want to end the year in a positive way.
The market looks particularly good for those who are phasing out existing deals and taking out new mortgages, and many with fee-free options and low rates are becoming more popular. "
NHS (National Health Service) to prescribe controversial HIV drug to 10,000 people
Patients will be given access to "transformative" HIV prevention treatment from September after a High Court battle over funding for the drug in the NHS.
NHS England announced that pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) taken before intercourse, which can reduce the risk of infection in high-risk patients by around 86 percent, is now being delivered by the health service via an initial three-year study for an estimated 10,000 people.
He agreed to fund the trial after the Court of Appeal upheld a Supreme Court ruling last year that the NHS had the power to pay for PrEP despite claims that local authorities should fund it.
The move, announced on Thursday, was hailed by NHS England chief executive Simon Stevens as a "important new intervention," while the National Aids Trust (NAT) described it as a "defining moment."
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to allow people to sign up and more clinics will follow in October before being rolled out across England in April 2018.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a sequence of HIV drugs taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
Studies have shown that PrEP significantly reduces HIV transmission in those at risk of infection.
Taking PReP before intercourse means that there are just enough drugs in a person's body to prevent HIV infection.
Such medications can be taken every day or two hours before sexual intercourse.
Those eligible for treatment include gay or bisexual men, transgender people and those with HIV-positive partners who have not been successfully treated.
Clinics identify suitable participants who agree with the study, including men, women, transgenders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by antiretroviral treatment.
People who live in England and are registered with a family doctor can also sign up for possible attendance at their local participating sex clinic.
The programme will cost £10 million and NHS England signed a contract to supply the drugs this week following an international competitive procurement.
The study is designed to assess the full potential of PrEP by collecting clinical evidence on how it is targeted, recorded and implemented on a large scale.
Stevens said: "this major new intervention should complement and overtake the wide-ranging and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV.
It is another milestone in more than three decades of progress in addressing one of humanity's greatest health challenges. "
Deborah Gold, chief executive at NAT (National Aids Trust), said: "this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV.
PReP, when targeted at needy and vulnerable people, offers the opportunity to change the English HIV epidemic.
From September, people at high risk of HIV will have access to this NHS funded trial in England to develop a new tool that is truly individually controlled and not subject to negotiation with a partner, leading to the improvement of many, many lives.
We warmly welcome this announcement. "
Ian Green, chief executive of the Terrence Higgins Trust, said: "the priority now has to be for the study to be carried out quickly across the country and for no one at risk for HIV to be left behind.
Now that the PrEP test medicine has been procured, we are well on the way to protecting more than 10,000 people infected with HIV. "
Sharon Hodgson, shadow health secretary, said: "the start of the PrEP process is welcome and overdue after months of delays and hesitant implementation by the government.
The evidence shows how transformative this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transmission of this life-changing infection.
This experiment brings us one step closer to understanding the benefits of PrEP.
Now it is important that this study is carried out as quickly as possible across the country to protect people who are infected with HIV and that it will help bring us one step closer to ending the spread of HIV in society ."
Living the big life: mezzanine and clever designer tricks have turned this small Earls Court apartment into a lavish home
Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, downsized from a large house in Knightsbridge to an Earls Court apartment in 2014.
It's on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it's a testament to the new design that Joanne didn't pack and sell her bags.
"Before that, I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger space," says Joanne.
"I was looking for something that was comparable to my price.
I was shown this apartment in Earls Court and it had the same high ceilings.
I fell in love with her and made an offer that day. "
Since the first visit, the 1,000-square-foot apartment has been completely overhauled.
Originally an one-bedroom property with a nested layout - you had to walk through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - Joanne wanted to add storage space and a mezzanine to make the most of the generous ceiling height.
"I wanted high ceilings, big windows, lots of light.
That was my requirement, "she says.
To that end, she commissioned Erfan Azadi's architecture and design studio Duck & Shed, from Notting Hill, to use the 12.5 foot high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development, but also a place to live for Joanne.
The ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms on top of each other, so the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine where you could stand.
Erfan had to think creatively to solve the problem.
"The steel plant is quite complicated," he explains.
"We had to arrange the rooms in such a way that they were stacked on top of each other without us having to bend down.
It was not just a matter of building a simple platform, but of putting the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below. "
This arrangement allowed Erfan to place two rooms at full height above each other - with much additional drama.
For the mezzanine, a classic copper light window by Retrouvius looks down over the glamorous living area.
Mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program.
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre, space and light.
A short corridor is mirrored at both ends to make it look longer.
In the kitchen, the mirroring feels like a window into another room.
At the entrance, mirrored units offer space for all Joanne's cutlery and glasses.
By perceiving a more glamorous space, the beauty of the living room can shut off the kitchen if it is not used.
Collapsible kitchens are nothing new.
The special thing about this is that it is a garage door.
"A bit of engineering went into it," explains Erfan of the steel reinforced, veneered MDF door.
"It's counterweight, so when you push the door up, it glides very easily."
Thanks to the clever use of space and storage space, Joanne was able to gain an extra 16m ², an extra bedroom and an improved layout.
"At the end of the day, you will sell the land - or how your property is valued," says Erfan.
"In a rudimentary form, a real estate agent will come in and make a calculation based on the size of the land."
Here, they have managed to increase the floor area and at the same time use high-quality materials that give the space its luxurious advantage.
"The materials are the things you touch and therefore help to create an emotional bond in a home," says Erfan.
"You don't fall in love with the electrical sockets in the walls.
These are important, but they don't play with your heart. "
It shows that an apartment can be transformed into something amazing by good design and increased square metres of something standard.
In fact, like Joanne, you might choose not to leave this one.
Brothers fight over $500 million property empire
Two brothers are in a dispute over one of Victoria's largest real estate empires, worth more than $500 million, four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty.
Former director of the "Carlton Football Club" and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a villa in Toorak, just three doors away from his younger brother Paul, who has taken him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and business assets are to be shared.
Paul had wanted to retire from the family business since 2014, but a sharp row over the separation is taking place in the Supreme Court.
Along with their mother Anna, the brothers own 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars, accumulated since the family bought a business in Smith Street, Collingwood, in 1973.
There, the family founded Westco Jeans and grew into a chain of 160 retail stores.
It was sold in 1999 for $85 million.
That money has been invested in real estate, and De Lutis' portfolio now includes offices in the city centre, the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento, the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller, and shopping centres in the suburb.
According to an agreement with her late father, Colin - described by Paul as a "principal operator and the dominant figure" in the De Lutis family - owns about two-thirds of the company's assets and Paul about a third.
A court filing says it means Colin owns property worth $316 million and Paul is worth $176 million.
The division of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul.
"The divisions proposed by Colin left him with what I thought were the best objects," he wrote in a first affidavit in 2015.
Last Friday, after several failed conciliations, the first Supreme Court hearing was held.
The brothers are now also fighting for control of the existing business - of which Colin, Paul claims, has ruled him out.
Colin argues this is not true, but accuses Paul of incompetently managing some possessions.
In an early affidavit filed by Colin, he says he hopes to resolve the dispute.
"My Italian heritage dictates that family is the most important priority," he wrote.
Costs are rising in the case, with hundreds of pages of affidavits, emails and reports from companies including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and with top lawyers including Allan Myers, QC, and law firms held by both sides.
Mrs De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who ran milk bars and delicatessen shops from the late 1950s and bought a shop in Brunswick in the early 1970s.
They used security to buy the Collingwood property where Colin opened the family's first jeans store.
Colin says he started Westco there when he was "in my final years of high school, when Paul was still a small child (about 10 years old)."
Anna De Lutis says she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to pass on their property amicably to their sons.
"Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to end up in court," she wrote.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis group of companies, with Colin claiming that Mark was paid $10 million when he left the company and Luke $26 million.
Both Lukas and Mark, Paul says, "have become bitter about the terms of their financial separation."
Colin has held back very much despite being a former AFL board member and the TV star's best friend, according to a 2015 biography of Eddie McGuire.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers.
Only Colin replied by text message to say "I really can't say much" because the case is before the courts.
"It is very, very sad that my brother Paul has decided to sue me and move our family name through the courts," he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote in a letter to the court that he had tried to meet his brother's demands.
"Our father would not have wanted Paul and I to end up in our current dispute," he said, adding that he was "still hoping for a solution."
On Friday, that hope seemed to be over.
"Our matter will be resolved by the courts in the near future," Colin wrote.
Trump's new chief of staff plans to limit the president's media abstinence.
Others have tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.
If so, he will be the first.
Politico reports that the new White House chief of staff plans to restrict the flow of information to President Trump - including news media reports - in hopes of keeping the chief on an even keel.
Here's a piece by reporter Josh Dawsey:
"When John F. Kelly, the new White House chief of staff, met with chief executives on his first day on the job, he presented a major problem in President Donald Trump's White House that he wanted to fix: bad information falling into the hands of the president.
Kelly told staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in briefings - "because the president would make better decisions if he got good information."
Kelly's diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to tame Trump by overseeing his media diet.
President Trump's relationship with television goes back decades - and now that he's in the White House, his television advertising is still going strong.
"If candidate Trump was upset about unfair coverage, it was productive to show him that he received fair coverage from bodies that were to be persuaded," former campaign adviser Sam Nunberg told Politico in February.
Politicos Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that "the key to keeping Trump's Twitter habit under control, according to six former campaign officials, is to make sure his personal media consumption includes steady praise."
Okay.
But the idea that Trump's Twitter habit was ever "under control" is ridiculous.
Perhaps these campaign officials know something we don't know about others - that Trump's tweets would have contained even more spark without their interventions.
We'll probably never know anything about the tweets that Trump didn't send.
If his collaborators have managed to keep him out of trouble a few times, their efforts have paid off.
But no one has consistently been able to prevent Trump from causing controversy.
Part of the problem is that in a White House made up of competing parties, people keep trying to advance their own agenda by presenting material to Trump that may promote their views of the world.
Politico - preoccupied with this story - reported in May on the advisors "preference to provide dubious information to the president for strategic reasons.
This was an example described by reporter Shane Goldmacher:
"Current and former Trump officials say that Trump can respond like a volcano to negative press clippings, especially those with damaging leaks, and that he is eager to find out where they come from.
That's exactly what happened in late February, when someone maliciously gave the president a printed copy of an article by GotNews.com, the website of Internet provocator Charles C. Johnson, who accused Deputy Chief of Staff Katie Walsh of being "the source behind a bunch of leaks" in the White House.
Although Johnson has been permanently banned from Twitter for harassment, or that he has offered no concrete evidence, or that he has made false allegations in the past and revoked them.
Trump read the article and began to question staffers about Walsh. "
Goldmacher added that then-Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and White House Secretary Rob Porter "tried to implement a system to manage and document the paperwork that Trump receives."
How did it work?
Kelly is trying to do the same three months later.
He may prove to be a more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his advisers are still seeking influence.
These immutable factors make Kelly's mission very difficult.
Most wanted criminals get mail from Europol
Since the address is unknown, the help of the population is requested and hoped for.
Police across Europe are sending (virtual) postcards to dangerous criminals on the run this summer.
Since the addresses of the wanted serious criminals are not known by nature, information from the population is hoped for and requested.
Europol reported on Friday the action, which follows the "EU Most Wanted" advent calendar from the winter.
Experience has shown that many fugitives are hiding in holiday destinations, Europol said.
21 postcards were put together for wanted criminals from 21 EU countries.
The website www.eumostwanted has been available since 2016, and has been viewed more than 2.5 million times.
Thirty-six of the online requests have so far been arrested, at least eleven of them on the basis of information posted on the website.
Travellers negotiate a ditch and return to "millionaires" row
Some of the West Midlands "wealthiest homeowners are back at war with some determined travellers who negotiated a ditch pulled by the borough to reclaim a field in front of their mansions.
Travellers have parked their 20 caravans in a field outside a wealthy Solihull street dubbed the "millionaire's row."
They brought horses, babies and an army of vans after they were thrown out only in May, but were not deterred by a ditch excavated by the council to prevent their incursions.
The taciturn group found a gap in the defences and pushed their vehicles through a section that remained unobstructed to find a way.
Angry residents have heckled Solihull council, saying it was "useless to deal with the problem."
One anonymous resident said: "they moved there on Monday evening after being sent on by Bentley Heath, where they threw stones at passers-by.
The Council must be forced into action by shame, because it has been useless in dealing with the problem.
The travellers were there in May, moved on and are now back.
More arrived last night, probably more today. "
She added: "Birmingham council knows how to deal with this by keeping long instructions to protect their parks.
I live on Streetsbrook Road and I'm not happy to continue paying my council tax if the council can't even stop it. '
One resident, who did not want to be named, said: "it's ridiculous we've just seen the last round of these travellers just to be savaged by another round.
The numbers have increased this time and you've even seen a horse in the park area. "
A Solihull council spokeswoman said: "we are aware of an unauthorised camp in the countryside beyond Streetsbrook Road and are working with Solihull Police and we are taking the necessary legal action to allow them to move forward as quickly as possible.
In order to support our collection of evidence, it is very important that as many residents as possible report anti-social or criminal behaviour to the police by calling 101.
This helps to create a picture of the situation in which the court will have to consider when we present our case. "
From Birkenhof, Waldhotel Luise
The former Hotel Birkenhof becomes the Waldhotel Luise.
The house at the gates of Freudenstadt is currently being renovated and is due to reopen on 1 March next year.
This is good news for the city.
After all, with the closure of the Hotel Birkenhof by the former Ambiente Betriebsgesellschaft mbH on 13 April 2014, around 30,000 overnight stays per year were lost at the time, as well as income from the tourist tax.
In the autumn of 2014, in the face of dramatically increasing numbers of refugees coming to the county, the hotel building was offered to the county council as a collective accommodation, which led to controversial discussions.
The city prevented asylum seekers from being accommodated by drawing up a development plan to secure the area as a hotel location.
The decision was not uncontroversial in the local council at the time.
But Freudenstadt's Mayor Julian Osswald, in particular, defended the hotel location and spoke at the time of serious interest in the building.
He should be right.
The Luisenhotels group with managing director Birgit Scherer, based in Bad Bergzabern, acquired the former Hotel Birkenhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to turn it back into a three-star plus hotel under the name Waldhotel Luise.
The group has four houses with the Freudenstadt object.
Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Herrenalb.
They are called Hotel Luise, Luisenpark, Parkhotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise.
At the former Hotel Birkenhof, construction debris containers have been standing in front of the entrance for a long time, and when you enter the house, it becomes clear what extensive renovation work is being carried out.
The floors were torn out, some of the ceilings were dismantled, old bathtubs were removed from the rooms.
The entire hotel building is a single construction site.
There is still much to do between now and March.
"It's actually a nice hotel," says Thomas Scherer in conversation with our newspaper.
Everything is to be renewed in the Black Forest style.
The rooms are equipped with large walk-in showers, the entrance area is redesigned, new windows are installed.
Everything should later become "beautifully close to the citizens," as Thomas Scherer puts it.
"We want to make a piece of jewelry out of it."
Facilities include a swimming pool, spa and a meeting room.
One does not want to position oneself on the high level of the hotels in Lauterbad, but already on an upscale inner-city level, emphasizes Scherer.
The Waldhotel Luise, with its 60 rooms, wants to be spread out, explains Scherer.
Individual holidaymakers, groups or business people should feel at home in the hotel.
He has already held talks with OB Julian Osswald and tourism director Michael Krause, according to Scherer.
The ideas of the city are identical with those of the hotel group.
"We are on the same line."
Asked about the level of investment, Thomas Scherer does not want to be specific.
Just under a million euros, he reckons.
The exterior systems are also being brought to the fore, which is already clearly visible.
In a courtyard, a large terrace will be created, which will be accessible from the restaurant, which is open to the public.
Thomas Scherer is optimistic: "Freudenstadt is a good market."
Russia affair: us special investigator sets up grand jury
Special prosecutor Robert Mueller is said to have appointed a so-called grand jury in the Russia affair involving U.S. President Donald Trump, according to a report.
The panel has begun work in recent weeks, the Wall Street Journal wrote, citing people familiar with the matter.
The newspaper viewed the move as a sign that Mueller had expanded and intensified his investigation.
CNN reported there are already preliminary subpoenas from the panel related to a meeting between Trump's eldest son and a Russian lawyer.
U.S. intelligence agencies have long accused the Kremlin of deliberately interfering in the 2016 presidential campaign.
Mueller is investigating whether there was collusion between Trump's campaign team and Moscow.
The investigation will focus on several men who acted as advisers to the Republican during the campaign.
Mueller also reportedly scrutinized more and more of Trump's private and business environment.
The Washington Post wrote a few weeks ago that the special investigator had personally put Trump at the center and was investigating the allegation of whether the president may have obstructed justice in the course of the affair.
The main task of Grand juries is to examine available evidence in possible criminal cases and to decide whether charges should be brought.
Grand juries are therefore also referred to as chambers of indictment.
In most cases, they are switched on when there are major and controversial cases.
The procedure is always done behind closed doors.
The panel can also be called in by the prosecution to summon people under oath for interrogation.
Subpoenas have already been issued regarding the encounter between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer, according to CNN.
People involved in the meeting were asked to testify, the report said.
They should also provide documents.
In addition to Trump Jr., Mr. Trump's adviser and son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and his then-campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, were also at the conversation.
Legal experts said Thursday evening on U.S. television that the installation showed that Mueller was not intimidated in his work and that he wanted to act quickly if necessary.
However, it did not necessarily mean that the grand jury would be called in at the end to decide whether to bring an indictment.
Nevertheless, the establishment of the panel is the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new cause for concern for President Trump.
Amid the new revelations, the president used a speech in West Virginia on Thursday night to portray the Russia affair as a campaign by his political opponents.
"The Russia story is a total fabrication," Trump said.
The issue gives Democrats a way to "feel good because they have nothing else to talk about."
His special counsel, Ty Cobb, said in a statement that he knew nothing about setting up a grand jury.
But they also usually work in secret, he pointed out.
The White House supports any measures that "fairly" expedited the work of the special investigator.
Former FBI chief James Comey has said three times that it is not investigating the president.
There is no reason to believe that anything has changed, the statement said.
Mueller, however, had only been deployed after Trump fired Comey.
Because of this reproach, accusations had been made against Trump that he wanted to obstruct justice.
Comey testified before a Senate committee in June that Trump had asked him to stop investigating then-national security adviser Michael Flynn.
The president is under a lot of pressure because of the investigation.
According to U.S. media, the White House collected material against the special investigator and his associates.
That sparked speculation about whether Trump planned to fire Mueller.
Unlike an independent congressional special investigator, such as the Watergate case involving the late President Richard Nixon, Mueller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired by the Justice Department at the president's urging.
Several senators from both parties, however, want to prevent such a move.
Two groups of Republican and Democratic senators presented bills Thursday that would make it difficult for the special counsel to be fired.
Antarctica: giant iceberg drives into Antarctica
In West Antarctica, a gigantic iceberg of almost seven times the size of Berlin has dissolved from the ice shelf.
This was announced by the Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research in Bremerhaven on Wednesday.
The colossus, which weighs more than a trillion tonnes and measures 5800 square kilometres, is now heading north and will probably take two or three years to melt.
With a length of 175 kilometres and a width of up to 50 kilometres, it is one of the largest ice giants that researchers have registered in the past three decades.
He does not pose a danger to people.
The extent to which climate change played a role in the collapse of the iceberg is unclear, according to research.
In total, however, there has been a series of unusual collapses of ice elves in the region for around 30 years, writes the U.S. Research Center for Snow and Ice (NSIDC) in a factual background.
According to many researchers, this may be related to global warming.
The colossus, which has now been demolished, has so far been part of the Larsen C Schelfeis.
Schelfeis floats on the sea and is fed by large glaciers.
It therefore grows further and further into the sea and breaks off regularly.
The Larsen C ice shelf lies south of South America almost at the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula.
To the north of this shelf, the balance of waxing and breaking was disturbed a few years ago.
A complete slab fell apart there, writes AWI researcher Daniela Jansen.
There is much to be said for the fact that the Larsen C-Schelfeis are also in danger, because the front edge has never pulled back as far as it is at present.
In addition, the ice sheet is under tension and can fall apart if a piece breaks off at a key point.
The melting of ice and ice does not raise the sea level, as they swim on the water and ice displaces as much water as it produces after melting.
However, the loss of the ice shelf means that the glaciers can flow directly into the sea and drain much faster than before.
This could possibly raise sea levels, but only to a small extent, writes the British Antarctic Observatory (Midas) research project.
According to AWI, the Larsen C ice shelf is the fourth largest ice shelf in Antarctica, covering almost 50,000 square kilometres.
At the transition from the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick, at the front edge to the open ocean about 200 meters.
It breaks down there on a regular basis.
"Although it is a natural occurrence and we are not aware of any direct link to climate change, the ice sheet is now coming into a more dangerous position," said Martin O'Leary of Britain's Swansea University.
"This is the longest withdrawal since records began," he also confirmed.
Among scientists, it is controversial whether the Larsen C shelf will now grow again or decline in the long term and possibly collapse, said his colleague Adrian Luckman, adding: "our models say it will be less stable."
But this development will take decades.
Although these researchers do not attribute the collapse of this gigantic iceberg to climate change, in recent decades a great many ice shelves of the Antarctic Peninsula have disintegrated.
This long stretch of Antarctica stretches towards South America.
According to data from the British Antarctic Survey research programme, the Antarctic Peninsula's ice sheet has fallen by 28,000 square kilometres since the 1950s.
The rise in temperature had contributed to the decline.
The Antarctic Peninsula has warmed by around three degrees in the past 50 years, making it one of the areas where the temperature is rising the fastest.
CDU wants house price on staff
Because it is becoming increasingly difficult to fill vacancies, the CDU is demanding to leave the employers "association in order to become more attractive.
Just before the summer break, Kreistag managed to fill 41 new positions in the administration.
More than 1100 employees and officials work for the district administration in Mettmann.
Now 17 apprentices are back on their first day of work.
The apprenticeships at the county are obviously very much in demand.
Around 620 applications were registered for the places to be awarded this year.
However, the county still lacks staff to cope with the increased demands and tasks.
At present, there are still 50 unfilled positions at Mettmann County.
Among other things, doctors and engineers as well as members of the general administration are being sought.
In Kreistag, the CDU now wants to take the initiative together with the FDP and the UWG and to counter the shortage of skilled workers in the administration.
According to the wishes of the parties, the administration should "develop a concept for recruitment and personnel development."
The aim is not only to meet short-term needs of skilled workers, but also to counteract the shortage of applicants in a future-oriented manner, it says.
The overall concept should be oriented internally and externally, identify concrete measures for newcomers and include a training offensive, demands the CDU, FDP and UWG.
That sounds like a good approach.
Because the circle has to do with personal problems, which you did not know in the past.
Other cities recruit good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions.
There is talk of a veritable "competition of public employers."
In addition, there are a large number of employees who leave the service due to illness or age.
It is high time to act so that more jobs are not left unfilled.
But Klaus-Dieter Völker, leader of the CDU group, goes beyond the joint motion with his party.
He recently caused a rotten surprise in Kreistag when he publicly questioned the cap on personnel costs and stunned the other parties.
Peoples wants to see a review of all possibilities for leaving the municipal employers "association.
"If we do not find a satisfactory solution here in the short term, the district administration should seek a house tariff with the unions - perhaps also in cooperation with the towns in the district," said Völker.
In doing so, the CDU is trying to pay employees and civil servants better than the tariff regulation for the public service actually provides.
Salaries are currently strictly prescribed, increases or more money are only available if you move to a higher level, which is based on professional years.
But the tasks of the circle have grown more and more in recent years.
Only a few weeks ago, new rooms had to be set up in which employees take care of the provisions of the new law on the protection of prostitutes.
Not least because of the increasing number of asylum seekers, Councillor Thomas Hendele and district director Martin Richter have a problem: they have too few staff.
Italy tightens tone on NGO migrant rescue boats
Italy has warned NGOs using rescue boats for migrants in the Mediterranean that they will not be allowed to continue unless they comply with new rules on their operations.
"If NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct, it is difficult to see how they can continue to work," interior Minister Marco Minniti said in an interview with the Turin daily La Stampa.
Minni's warning came a day after Italian authorities seized a boat belonging to the German aid group "Jugend Rettet" because its crew had effectively cooperated with traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration.
The charity, which has only been in operation for a year, declined to comment on detailed allegations made by the Italian prosecutor, Ambrogio Cartosio.
"For us, saving human life is and remains our top priority, so we're very sorry that we can't operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment," the organization said in a statement on social media.
'We can't assess all the allegations that are currently being made until we have gathered all the information and can assess the situation. '
The Italian authorities had been monitoring the boat of "Jugend Rettet," the Iuventa, since October.
Its crew is believed to be taking on board rubber boat migrants, delivered directly to them by traffickers, and that the smugglers can depart to allow the ships to be used again.
At least one such meeting reportedly took place just 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast, according to the prosecutor's file, the contents of which were published by Italian media.
The crew is suspected of flouting the authority of the Italian coastguard, which oversees rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not for any other motives.
Under the code of conduct, boats such as the Iuventa must above all have an Italian police officer on board to monitor their activities.
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have so far agreed to abide by the code: save the Children, MOAS from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain.
The latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary but acceptable as they would not involve "significant changes or impediments" to its bailouts.
Among those who refuse to sign is the Nobel Prize-winning organization Doctors Without Borders (MSF).
Minniti meanwhile said the number of migrants arriving in Italy after the rescue operations had plummeted in recent weeks, suggesting that efforts to strengthen the Libyan coastguard and work with local mayors had borne fruit.
"In the last few days we have started to see light at the end of the tunnel," the minister said.
He announced plans for further talks with Libyan mayors this month on economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving those countries in the hope of reaching Europe.
Climbs and Trials
Nine Weilermer bikers, the "Berlin outpost" and two guest drivers met in Wachenheim in the North Palatinate to enjoy four days of trials and sights.
Three friendly guides were available for this purpose.
The accommodation in the Wachenheimer Valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours.
The Wachenheim Castle and Wine Festival was a welcome extra.
The first tour led to the Chapel of St Michael above Deidesheim in hot summer temperatures along the vineyards.
It was followed by viewpoints, partly on towers, from which one could look far beyond the Pfälzer forest and the upstream plains.
In between, there were always longer climbs, for which long trials were rewarding.
On the second day we went to Bad Dürkheim to the saline and the sausage market.
Once again, vantage points were lined up at vantage points, connected by "flowery" trials and moderate climbs.
On the last two days, many metres of altitude were again required.
Caves, rocks, towers, castles, ruins and refuges brought welcome breaks.
In Bad Dürkheim, the bikers breathed healing brine in the open-air inhaler.
Neustadt was also targeted.
After 173 kilometres and almost 4500 metres of altitude, the group had come to know the Pfälzer Forest at its best - sporty and cultural.
Console instead of lawn - Bundesliga gears up for e-sports
Will the sports stars be sitting in front of computer consoles in the future, instead of fighting sweetly over the stadium lawns in the wind and weather?
The fact is: e-sports has long since become a serious industry, a lucrative business - big stars, millions of fans and huge tournaments with high stakes included.
This has also been recognised by the first Bundesliga clubs, which are increasingly involved in this area.
The VfL Wolfsburg started in 2015, later followed by FC Schalke 04 and, most recently, VfB Stuttgart, which founded an e-sports department in mid-July and contracted two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17.
"We hope this will inspire completely new target groups for the VfB," says board member Jochen Röttgermann.
He is certain that "there are still a number of clubs on this train."
Next weekend, the World Football Association (FIFA) is organising the first "interactive Club World Cup" in London, where the gamers of different clubs compete against each other.
In addition to Schalke and Wolfsburg, Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain and PSV Eindhoven have qualified.
Robin Dutt also sees great potential in e-sports.
The former coach of Bayer Leverkusen and Werder Bremen is now advising an agency for virtual football players.
"Real football has to deal with the 14 to 30-year-olds in particular, that young people will still go to the stadium in the future," says the 52-year-old.
And: the clubs tried to conquer all kinds of markets, especially the Asian ones.
With prominent e-athletes under contract, you could be present in these markets much more often online than just sending the Bundesliga team to Asia once a year.
What exactly is this about?
In e-sports, computer games such as "League Of Legends," "DotA 2," "Counterstrike" or even the football simulation FIFA are fought on a competitive level.
As in normal sports, leagues have long been established in which the pros compete against each other.
And at the 2022 Asian Games, e-sports is already part of the official program.
But is it a proper sport at all?
For many, the idea certainly needs getting used to.
Ingo Froböse also dealt with the question for a long time.
For the professor at the German Sports Academy in Cologne, e-sports is a sport because it is competitive and shows many biological and physical reactions, which can also be found in classical sports - for example, increased heart rates, stress reactions, hormonal changes.
It also requires cognitive skills, technical and tactical understanding, and rapid responsiveness.
Professional gamers should not only train at the console, but also their bodies and pay attention to nutrition.
"The fitter player is a good player."
But Froböse also sees problems: "doping is becoming more and more an issue."
Controls were difficult to carry out in online games, and the scene lacked the structures of classical sport.
On the positive side, the scientist emphasises the high integrative effect of e-sports.
The players are travelling internationally, it's like a big global family, there are no intercultural barriers.
A study by Deloitte management consultancy and the Federal Association of Interactive Entertainment Software (BIU) predicts rapid growth in e-sports.
In 2016, 50 million Euros were implemented in Germany, mainly through advertising, sponsorship and major tournaments.
In three years, the turnover is expected to be 130 million.
Against the almost 2.4 billion euros of the Bundesliga, that is not much.
However, e-sports are "not far from other established sports such as handball, basketball or ice hockey," the Deloitte consultants write.
Internationally, many countries have already moved on.
Major markets are Asia and the USA, where ex-basketball player Shaquille O`Neal and baseball star Alex Rodriguez participate in the U.S. team NRG eSports.
Hollywood actor Ashton Kutcher invests in eSports betting provider Unikrn.
There is also a lot going on in Europe.
In a Norwegian school, e-sports have been introduced as a subject of instruction, says Froböse.
In the Netherlands and France, according to Dutt, first-division football clubs are now obliged to set up an e-sports department.
"Compared to Europe, Germany is lagging behind," explains VfB board member Röttgermann.
Just lapsing into nostalgia, and clearing up the old days, is no longer enough today.
The aim is to preserve the tradition of the association, but at the same time to align the company with the modern market.
"We live in a digitised world," says Dutt.
"You can't hold on to the fact that only football remains as it always has been."
Poison eggs ade - The egg alternatives to cooking and baking
The scandal of poisonous eggs has now affected almost all federal states.
Aldi Süd and Aldi Nord have responded by removing all eggs from sale throughout Germany.
Only eggs that demonstrably do not contain fipronil are to be placed on the shelves.
Michelle Carter convicted of texts urging Conrad Roy to commit suicide
A Massachusetts woman has been sentenced to two and a half years for encouraging her boyfriend to commit suicide through texts and calls.
Michelle Carter, now 20, will spend 15 months of her sentence behind bars and five years have been suspended.
Carter was convicted in June of negligently killing Conrad Roy, who took his life on July 13, 2014.
Roy's father told the hearing on Thursday: "my family is inconsolable.
My son was my best friend. "
Carter was allowed to remain free pending appeal.
She had faced a maximum sentence of 20 years, but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy suffered from a mental illness.
Dressed in red trousers and a cream-colored blouse, Carter stood there with tears in her eyes, with folded hands and downward eyes as she was sentenced.
"Her actions have killed Conrad Roy," the prosecutor told the court.
"She ended his life to make her own better.
She didn't take any responsibility, "she said.
"She showed no remorse."
But Carter's lawyer said it was a "terrible circumstance that she completely regrets."
However, Judge Lawrence Moniz said he did not find out that her "age or maturity or even mental illness have a significant impact on her actions."
A prosecutor read a statement from Roy's mother, Lynn Roy, saying that "there is not a day when I am not mourning the loss of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and how I deal with everything. I try to be there for his sisters, despite all the pain we will carry with us for eternity, "it says.
Roy's sister, Camdyn Roy, said she was "haunted" by the realization that she would never attend her brother's wedding or be an aunt to his children.
"No longer having that single person I've been with every day since I was born is a pain I'll always keep with me for the rest of my life," she said.
The case appears to set a legal precedent because there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to ask another to commit suicide.
Carter was 17 when Roy was found dead from carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle in 2014.
The case attracted national attention after Carter's text messages revealed she had encouraged him to end his life.
"Hang out, spring from a building, stabbing yourself, I don't know, there are many ways," she said in several messages she sent in the two weeks before his death while he was on vacation with his family.
In the moments before his suicide, she wrote, "you have to do it, Conrad" and "all you have to do is turn on the generator and you will be free and happy."
Judge Moniz said that Carter sought attention through Roy's death and ordered that she benefit from the case through some press.
The case has divided legal opinion.
Among the few who defended Carter was Amanda Knox, who was convicted in 2007 of murdering her British co-worker in Italy before being acquitted two years ago.
Ms. Knox, 30, published a comment in the Los Angeles Times: "Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help, not jail."
Joshua Kimmich: learning from the new mini shape of FC Bayern
It is no coincidence that Joshua Kimmich was allowed to captain the Audi Cup.
FC Bayern is confident of a great season for the Confed-Cup winner - there is no harm in extra motivation.
Something was different on his seat in the cabin, Joshua Kimmich saw it immediately, even if the extra piece of clothing was very, very small.
But as far and wide on the second day of the Audi Cup, of course, there was no Philipp Lahm and no Manuel Neuer to be seen, he stuck the tie he was given to his arm.
"The coach didn't announce it," said the Confed-Cup winner afterwards, after his first assignment as Bayern captain.
Well, the standings could have been better than in the 0:2 against the Napoli SSC.
But the sign from the coach could also be interpreted by Kimmich.
It was not Arturo Vidal, who was eight years old, who was chosen to play in the C-Elf, consisting of young players, debutants and professionals who had just come on holiday, but he.
Sugar is best distributed to those to whom you trust a lot, who you want to keep at your whim.
So anyone who has been chosen to take on the legacy of Lahm can only use a little extra motivation.
Kimmich confirmed: "that's what you want as a player: take responsibility."
On Wednesday, the 22-year-old flipped across the field as a mini lad.
Right back, this is now his position, the white tie on the arm did the rest.
And in general, in this starting formation, Kimmich looked like the one who can take the helm in the best possible way.
He gave instructions, tried to steer the untrained squad.
He had the look for the whole thing, while many others were busy with themselves.
Vidal with overplaying his lack of fitness (barely clapped); Renato Sanches with sticking to the achievements of the Asian tour (only partially clapped); and Sebastian Rudy and Niklas Süle with not being negative in their first appearance in the Bavarian jersey.
That, after all, worked out quite well.
Süle ran alongside Kimmich, Rudy in front of the defence, both of them acting confidently.
The well-known Napoli Storm often struggled, and Süle also tried to be successful a few times in the game set-up.
His colleague Rudy admitted that the result was "not as we hoped it would be."
But he, too, showed a decent performance on debut.
Relocation of the game, change of tempo: "I was brought up for this style."
How unusual this Bavarian world is for the newcomers was seen after the match.
Rudy, for example, did not give one or two interviews in the catacombs, but certainly six or seven.
Kimmich said goodbye after a few crisp statements in the back of his new teammates.
There he heard an interesting sentence from Süle: "I have already noticed what is going on here.
At Bayern, you just have to win every game. "
After all, he no longer has to teach the new.
Alaba motivates ÖFB ladies
David Alaba believes in the success of our ÖFB ladies
Austria's most famous footballer took to Twitter shortly before the match and wished the ÖFB ladies well.
The Bayern-Legionaire is, after all, a club colleague of ÖFB captain Schnaderbeck and is fiddling with our lads.
The Austrian footballer of the year and Champions League winner's tweet should be a special motivational splash.
Our ladies might also need the famous Bayern-Dusel.
Company satisfied with Rhineland-Palatinate minister: economy praises Wishing's pace
It was often irreconcilable, the relationship between the country and the regional economy, when Eveline Lemke (Greens) was still Minister of Economy of Rhineland-Palatinate.
This is evident after more than a year in which the new economy minister, Volker Wissing (FDP), is in office.
Chambers and companies from the region talk about a change in economic policy at T V's request - and at the same time blame the old minister.
Frank Natus, chairman of the Association of Trier Enterprises (VTU), says: "Wissing takes up the wishes of the economy, which Lemke has all blocked."
Natus sees the biggest turnaround in infrastructure policy: the closure of Highway 1 between Kelberg and Adenau is now at the top of the country's list of priorities.
Later this year, the ministry is hoping for a planning approval process, and construction legislation is expected to be in place by 2021.
The western bypass of Trier also plays a role in the country's plans, which is in the urgent need of the federal highway plan.
The aim is to get the line up and running in December 2020, says ministry spokeswoman Cornelia Holtmann.
Natus sees it as a signpost to support regional but internationally competing companies.
The Chamber of Commerce and Industry (IHK) Trier, as suggested by Wissing, is aiming for a Rhineland-Palatinate label for wine in order to increase sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of German wine exports, which have been slowing down for ten years.
In addition, Wissing has an open ear for people who want to set up their own company, praises the Chamber of Industry and Commerce.
The Trier Chamber of Crafts sees the new master bonus as an additional incentive for young apprentices, says managing director Matthias Schwalbach.
There will be a bonus of 1000 Euros for the master's examination and 2500 Euros if graduates become self-employed within ten years of the master's training.
The homework list for the country, however, remains long.
According to Jan Glockauer, Chief Executive of the Trier Chamber of Industry and Commerce, the planned road construction is quick to create facts and at the same time the country lacks the necessary personnel.
Of the 56 new engineers Wissing wants to recruit for mobility at the state enterprise, only 29 jobs have been filled so far.
The Chamber of Industry and Commerce is calling for more contracts to be awarded to external offices.
Christian Baldauf, vice-president of the CDU, points to calculations by the Court of Auditors that the country is investing more than 20 million euros less in the maintenance of national roads in 2017 and 2018 than proposed.
Frank Natus also expects a concept of the country to address the shortage of skilled workers in the region.
The previous broadband expansion in the country is also sobering.
In 2016, regional companies rated power supply only 3.4 in an IHK survey.
They complained of stalled internet connections and breakdowns.
Former Minister of Economy Eveline Lemke, on the other hand, is currently out of politics and still sits on the supervisory board of the wind power company Pro Wind.
The Green Group left Lemke in April to become president of a private university in Karlsruhe - where it already cleared the field after four months because of disagreements.
Audi to change 850,000 diesel cars - automakers face backlash
A day before Audi's announcement, BMW said it would offer to update the software in more than 350,000 vehicles.
The BMW chairman said the company believes "there are smarter options than driving restrictions," referring to European cities - including Munich, where BMW is based - to ban or restrict diesel cars.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions.
None of the companies described the ventures as a recall.
European car manufacturers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with rules on carbon dioxide emissions.
But the nitrogen oxides that diesel engines emit are considered carcinogens and can cause asthma.
The cost to car manufacturers of installing systems to neutralise the exhaust gases emitted by diesel vehicles is also increasing, making it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of coddling the powerful car companies and ignoring signs of the problem.
The companies are trying to avoid Volkswagen's mistakes, which include the use of so-called shut-off devices that could regulate emissions to comply with regulations when a car has been tested but roll back in normal driving conditions.
Several Volkswagen employees have been indicted in the United States, while others are being investigated on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former head of thermodynamics in the engine development of Audi was arrested in Germany.
The former manager, Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio, is Italian and is therefore not protected from extradition and could face trial in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi was involved in German criminal investigations at Volkswagen after authorities accused Audi of having installed a system to circumvent emissions regulations in Europe, and a request focused on the United States was expanded.
The inclusion of Audi in the investigation could weigh heavily on Volkswagen: the luxury carmaker contributes disproportionately to Volkswagen's profit.
This is the message of the float on the Isar on Saturday
The city wants to protect the Isar.
In order for the Isar visitors to join in, a raft will pass through Munich tomorrow, which has a special message.
If you go to the Isar again on Saturday, you will see a big raft between Flaucher and Reichenbachbrücke.
And this is not a common raft, with Isar tourists.
Instead, the building department wants to clarify.
On the raft you can see a large information transparent.
It shows a mountain of rubbish.
The start of a public campaign to appeal to the Isar visitors.
With the motto "true love is..." the understanding of the Isar as a wild river worthy of protection is to be sharpened.
The raft crossed the Isar last summer and this year there are further actions and measures to achieve a considerate and environmentally conscious behaviour.
Mordillos boys "noses and laughter at the suffering
Mordillo was at times one of the most published cartoon illustrators, the boy noses of his characters are his trademark.
Even at 85, the Argentine is still drawing and working on a film.
His message: laugh, "because there is too much suffering in the world."
Guillermo Mordillo was born in Buenos Aires on August 4, 1932, the son of Spanish immigrants.
In his first years as an artist, he worked as a draughtsman for greeting cards, among other things - which frustrated him.
"The happiest day in my professional life was the day when I lost in my job," he once said.
After stops in Lima, New York and Paris, he achieved his breakthrough at the end of the 60s: with the publication of his cartoons in "Paris Match" and then also in "Stern" and other leading magazines around the world.
Even in China, Mordillo found many fans.
Time and again, the artist was inspired by cities.
Large, rounded Mordillo figures are tucked into drawings with the Leaning Tower of Pisa, Big Ben in London and Red Square in Moscow.
In the early morning, he reportedly still sits at the drawing table today, working nearly ten hours a day.
On calendars, puzzles, books for young and old, T-shirts, plush toys and watches, his droll figures continue to be widely distributed around the world.
He has also been working on a cartoon and a TV series with his characters for six years.
The main character in the movie "crazy Island" is a giraffe - Mordillo's most popular animal in his drawings - who has a thousand-foot as an opponent.
His characters speak for the first time in the 3D film, which is due to hit the cinema screen in 2019.
"I don't know exactly what they're going to say, it's weird for me," Mordillo says.
The script is not written by him.
That's why he relies more on the TV series, which, like his original drawings, is produced wordless.
Provence lavender threatened by climate change
He has become a symbol of Provence in southern France, but there is a warning that he is at risk of climate change.
Lavender is declining due to drought-like conditions and disease-carrying insects, a major headache for scientists and farmers trying to find solutions.
Eric Chaisse, expert at the agricultural research institute CRIEPPAM in Provence, said: "the lavender in Provence is effectively at risk because in recent years the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change, which has brought much less rain in the spring and much more in the autumn.
This has an impact on the lifespan of lavender.
There is also a small cicade, a microbacterium that transmits dwarf cicadas, and in very dry weather there are a lot of them. "
And the stakes are high.
Lavender oil not only attracts holidaymakers, it is also very popular for perfume and cosmetics.
Eric Chaisse said: "instead of having very long plant ears with a large number of flowers, we have smaller, underdeveloped ones and either missing or weakened ones.
So we have fewer parts with essential oil. "
Solutions being considered include better water distribution and slowing evaporation from the soil, but also spraying the plants with a protective mix of clay and water and developing varieties more resistant to drought.
The town of Geisa in the Thuringian town of Rhön is celebrating its 1200-year anniversary this year.
The highlight of the festival is this Saturday and Sunday with a medieval festival.
Crooks, guilds, dealers, vagrants or a military camp are to be seen in the city centre on these days.
The murder of a journalist highlights the growing threat in Mexico
Employees of the weekly newspaper Riodoce usually meet on Wednesdays to review their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the state of Sinaloa by organized crime, corrupt officials and incessant drug wars.
But that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security.
They have been told it is important to change their routines.
Two senior journalists discuss what feels safer: taking their children to the office, who were the target of a grenade attack in 2009, or leaving them at home.
Security experts have written three words on a blackboard at the front of the room: opponents, neutrals, allies.
They ask reporters to suggest names for each column - no proof is needed, perceptions and gut feelings abound.
There are drug smugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists suspected of being on the payroll of the government or the cartels, a catalogue of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous.
There is no respite from the violence, and while corpses are piling up across the country, more and more journalists are in attendance: at least 25 since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012. 589 are under federal protection after attacks and threats, and so far this year there have been at least seven deaths in seven states.
Among the latter is its editor and its inspirer of Riodoce, the co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.
"The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his numerous books on drug-related violence.
His absence is deeply felt, though his presence is everywhere - a large photo of Valdez pointing his middle finger with the word "Justice" hangs on the facade of the Riodoce building. Two reporters in their thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear T-shirts showing his smiling face with glasses or his typical panamahut.
The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and reporters discuss their shared themes, the trauma, their nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.
Although a special federal prosecutor was set up in 2010 to handle the cases of journalists, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, it has opened only two criminal cases.
As with most of the thousands of murders linked to drug trafficking and organised crime each year, the murderers of journalists are rarely brought to justice.
At Riodoce, they still insist on treating the violence of Sinaloa, though they are inconsolable and though the terrain is now even more treacherous.
Without information about the killers, without justice, the meeting to discuss security has little use, Ibarra says.
"It's very stupid to waste my time in this workshop," he says.
"As long as we don't know why, we distrust everyone."
On the morning of May 15, Valdez left the office of the Riodoce newspaper in the state capital of Culiacan.
He only managed to drive a few blocks before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men, forced out of his car and shot at him 12 times, presumably because of the newspaper's name - which translates to "twelfth River."
The gunman drove away in his car and damaged it nearby.
Valdez was 50.
He left behind a wife and two adult children.
Rumours tend to fly around freely in Culiacan.
But on the subject of Valdez, there is virtually nothing but silence.
Since Guzman's arrest last year and extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa has become one of the country's bloodiest battlegrounds as rival factions here struggle to fill the void.
It doesn't matter that in Sinaloa, one or more people are shot in the street every day, or that the cemetery is full of ornate, two-story mausoleums for drug kingdoms larger than many homes for the living.
Forget for a minute that there is a state of "calm" when only one cartel has control of the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug-trafficking routes to the United States.
Nevertheless, and despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, broke with the guilt that he could not protect his friend.
He believes two misconceptions contributed to the murder.
First, in February, there was the release of an interview with Damaso Lopez, a leader of one of the rival cartel factions in the war with Guzman's sons.
This publication may have angered the sons, suspected gang members bought each copy of the edition as soon as it was delivered to newspaper kiosks.
The second mistake was not to force Valdez to leave the country for his own safety after the seizure of another newspaper that published the same story.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is seen as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists.
He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed he would always be there.
He was an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003 when he joined forces with five colleagues to create Riodoce and sold $50 stakes.
In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to do journalism without encountering the drug problem," Bojorquez said.
Over time, the newspaper earned a reputation for its courageous and honest reporting, and sales and advertising increased.
Reporters loved being able to publish hard-hitting research without fear of censorship, and readers were intrigued by a publication where they could read stories that no one else dared to cover.
Eight years after Riodoce was founded, she was awarded the prestigious "Maria-Moors-Cabot-Prize" for her reporting in Latin America.
That same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award from the Committee to Protect Journalists for his courage in pursuing Mexican drug history wherever it led.
He voluntarily admitted that he was afraid.
"I want to live on," he said at the time of the CPJ award.
Drug trafficking in Sinaloa "is a way of life," he said in an interview with Rompeviento-TV last October.
"You have to do the job that falls to you as a journalist - either that or you play the stupid.
I don't want to be asked, "what did you do in the face of so many deaths... Why didn't you say what was going on?"
The Riodoce team is missing Valdez, the fun bird who could curse like a dockworker, the friend who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.
They trusted in his routine.
He would always wear his hat.
He would always go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, and always sit there at the same table.
Now they ask: was his love of routine his ruin?
His death has also forced them to question their own assumptions about how best to do their jobs and stay alive.
"You don't like it when you're dealing with their wives, their children, their clean shops, their secret runways" to move drugs.
"These things were not allowed," Bojorquez said.
The result, even in the best of times, is a high degree of self-censorship and self-preservation.
Trust his own instincts.
If it smells wrong, stay away from it.
The trouble is, said the editor of Riodoce Andres Villarreal, that "smell a sense that can be deceived... And then the thing happened to Javier."
The old rules, as he and others say, no longer apply in Sinaloa - just as they do in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states, home to a toxic mix of lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt government officials.
The landscape is constantly changing.
In the room where Riodoce employees met for security training, cell phones were suddenly not allowed. Days earlier, it was revealed that spyware sold exclusively to governments was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.
Outside, two policemen sought shelter from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shade of a tree.
They were tasked by the state government with protecting Riodoce's offices in a four-story building in a middle-class neighborhood of Culiacan.
Half joking, some of the reporters wondered if these officers were among the 50 percent of the policemen whom the governor himself described as untrustworthy.
It has been months since the reporters went to the mountain landscape, where the drug gangs are de facto under control.
For this week's edition, Riodoce has looked at three main stories.
There was the murder of the brother of the former well-known boxer Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.
They also had an exposé on government spending that focused on the governor's hometown.
And there was a group that carried out a kidnapping at one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the prosecutor's office.
There was no official word on who was abducted or how it happened, so caution was required when it came time to write what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favorite of drug dealers and authorities.
A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician belonging to the ruling Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), which dominated all political levels for almost the entire century.
Several PRI governors have recently been accused of high-profile corruption cases.
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents at the venue, including one in which a son of "el Chapo" Guzman escaped a military raid.
Just a few months earlier, readers would have viewed Valdez's column as the best-informed source on the kidnapping.
"Before, we would have known what happened," said Villarreal, 46, nicknamed "el Flaco" because of his slim body stature.
"Now all channels of communication with our sources have been broken."
Valdez's office has been turned into a storage room for signs and stickers protesting the killings of journalists because employees have become something they themselves never expected: activists on behalf of the press.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez grabbed a few signs and went to a demonstration the next morning because of another journalist to the prosecutor's office.
Salvador Adame disappeared in the western state of Michoacan three days after Valdez was killed.
A burned body has been discovered and officials say, based on DNA testing, that it is his.
Across the country, journalists have become more vocal, writing "SOS Press" on sidewalks and buildings in organized protests.
On that day, the director Bojorquez is away in Washington, trying to gather international support for the justice system in the Valdez case.
At a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa the day after Valdez's assassination, Ramirez accused the authorities of spying on journalists and killing them for telling the truth.
She has since asked that she be reinstated by the government because she is concerned that her anger has hurt her objectivity.
Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were "surrounded" by organized crime, government officials involved and an indifferent society.
In his last book, "narco-journalism," he wrote that reporters are killed not only by drug gangs, but also on the orders of politicians and security forces, who were caught up in organized crime.
The media watchdog group "articulo 19" has attributed more than half of the attacks on journalists to police and officers in the past year.
"In Mexico, you die because they want you to keep your mouth shut," Ramirez said.
Obviously, the killings have a deterrent effect.
No one forgets the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago.
Her body was found along with a note allegedly signed by the Zeta cartel: "here I am because of my reports."
A computer keyboard and headphones lay next to her severed head.
Some branches have chosen to close, according to the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state of Chihuahua after the murder of correspondent Miroslava Breach in March.
Others continue, as El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did after the assassination of its director in 2004.
In 2010, the Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed the drug cartels with an editorial on the front page with the headline "what do you want from us?"
Some journalists have fled their home countries or even the country.
It's a painful decision.
It's hard to find work in exile, and they're still watching the streets and looking for danger.
And sometimes they are hunted, as appears to be the photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered in 2015 along with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after fleeing Veracruz.
For those who stay behind and continue the work, it's a daily dance with high-risk choices.
Ibarra, who once wanted to be a poet, admits that drug trafficking scares him.
"Mexico is going to hell, and that's why I became a reporter," he said.
At midnight last Friday, when the last issue had already ended, the editors of Riodoce were sitting on the sidewalk in front of the office, drinking beer, when all of a sudden their phones started buzzing.
A series of shootings involving gang rivals and security forces near the seaside resort of Mazatlan had left 19 confirmed dead.
The war continued to escalate, as promised by a series of cartel embassies in the region.
From the edge of the brothel, they posted the news on the website of Riodoce via mobile phone.
The front page had to be changed the next day.
Sirens howled nearby - another shooting in the area.
Bojorquez took a look at the policemen who were holding guard to see if they were on standby.
If they were scared at all, they didn't show it.
Under the enormous portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper, whose middle finger was visible to the whole of Sinaloa, the employees of Riodoce followed in his footsteps.
"How can you even think of closing," Bojorquez said, "when on the same day that Javier was murdered, the intern asked me to send her to the streets for reporting."
Dinosaur used camouflage to evade its enemies
At first glance, it looks like a statue, albeit a terrifying one.
Now researchers have discovered that the first findings of a Canadian miner's incredible rhino have been so well preserved that experts have described it as "the Mona Lisa of the Dinosaurs."
It was so well preserved that they could even find that his scaly skin was of reddish brown - and they said she had had something of a "troubled past."
The report in the journal Current Biology described him as "the best preserved armored dinosaur ever found, and one of the best dinosaur specimens in the world."
The fossil is a newly discovered species of nodosaur that lived in the middle of the Cretaceous period between 110 million and 112 million years ago.
Its incredibly well-preserved condition has baffled researchers who describe it as "truly remarkable."
According to reports in National Geographic, the armored herbivore is the best preserved fossil of its kind.
It was found by Shawn Funk while he was digging at the Suncor Millenium mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011.
He came across something that seemed out of place from the surrounding rock and decided to look more closely.
The fossil he discovered was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.
They spent the next six years uncovering the wild animal within the 2,500 pound (1,100 kg) Earth clump.
After all this hard work, the finished result is now ready to be revealed.
"If you just blink a little with your eyes, you could almost believe it was asleep," said lead author Caleb Brown, a scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature can be seen.
"It will go down in the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaur specimens - the Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs."
Researchers have found that although this herbivore is covered with an armor and resembles a changing tank, it was likely threatened by meat-eating dinosaurs.
The heavily armored dinosaur used a red and white camouflage to hide from predators and used a shielding technique known as counter-shading, which is also used by many modern animals.
This would have allowed it to blend better into its surroundings and evade its enemies, experts say, suggesting it was threatened by larger dinosaurs.
The 110 million-year-old creature from the Nodosaurier family first made headlines in May and is now on display at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.
Researchers have now studied the wild animal and named it Borealopelta markmitchelli after museum technician Mark Mitchell, one of a team that spent more than 7,000 hours carefully uncovering it.
The astounding preservation of the specimen allowed Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and shape of scales and armor across his body.
They discovered the counter shading, a common defence method in the animal kingdom, meaning the top of the creature was darker than its bottom.
Although countershading is common, the results are surprising, as the size of Borealopelta far exceeds that of the animals living today.
It suggests that the dinosaur was chased by enough pressure from meat-eating dinosaurs that evolution favoured the concealment of confrontation as a means of survival.
But most contemporary animals that use the countershading - think deer, zebras or belt animals - are much smaller and more vulnerable than prey, signaling that this nodosaurier was facing a real battle for survival.
"Strong predator behavior on a massive, heavily armored dinosaur shows how dangerous the dinosaur predators of the Cretaceous period must have been," brown said.
Chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the dinosaur's skin was reddish-brown.
Scientists are continuing to examine the animal for clues about its life, including its preserved intestinal tract, to find out what it ate as its last meal.
They believe that when the dinosaur died, it got into a river and was driven out to sea, where it sank on its back to the bottom of the sea.
At the time, Alberta was as warm as South Florida is today, and rivers and oceans probably spread much farther inland than they are today.
"This nodosaur is truly remarkable because it is completely covered with preserved scaly skin, but it is also preserved in three dimensions and maintains the original shape of the animal," brown said.
"The result is that the animal looks almost the same today as it did in the early Cretaceous period.
You don't need to use much imagination to reconstruct it. If you just look a little with your eyes, you might almost think he's asleep. "
The Cretaceous period was a time when giant theropods, carnivorous dinosaurs that stood on two legs, passed through the earth.
Although the king of them, the Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions of years after Borealopelta, the armored dinosaur was hunted by some of its fearsome ancestors.
This includes the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 foot (11.5 m) long, six-ton monster.
The scientists, whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta sank in the sea after death and was mummified in mud.
The creature was found by Shawn Funk while he was digging at the Suncor Millenium mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011.
According to the museum, it is the world's best-preserved armored dinosaur, including skin and armour, and is complete from snout to hip.
The creatures averaged about 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighed as much as 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).
It contained two 20-inch long spikes that raced off his shoulders.
The researchers believe the armored herbivore swam through western Canada until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea.
But the dinosaur's underwater burial preserved its armor in exquisite detail.
The fossilized remains of this particular specimen are so well preserved that the skin remains still cover bumpy tank plates along the dinosaur
As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, such a level of conservation is as "rare as winning a lottery.
The more I look at it, the more confusing it becomes.
Petrified remnants of the skin still cover the hollowed-out tank tops that carry the animal's skull.
His right front foot is on his side, his five fingers are pointed upwards.
I can count the scales on his sole ."
In the storm: mass carnage on A8: many injured
Heavy accident on Thursday evening on the A8: almost 30 vehicles are involved in a mass carambolage.
There are numerous casualties, miles of traffic jams - and gaffers.
Around 20 people were injured in a mass carambolage on the Stuttgart-Munich (A8) motorway late on Thursday afternoon.
According to initial information from the police, around 5 p.m., nearly 30 vehicles, including probably trucks, crashed into each other during a thunderstorm between the Adelzhausen and Odelzhausen junctions (Aichach-Friedberg district).
At first, no information was available on the exact number of casualties.
They were minor to minor injuries, a police spokesman said.
A large number of rescue vehicles were at the scene of the accident.
The A8 was completely blocked in the direction of Munich.
A backlog of around ten kilometres was formed in the direction of travel in Munich.
As an AZ reporter reports, there were also massive obstructions on the opposite carriageway - due to numerous gaffers.
The fire brigade noted the signs of the vehicle drivers, who now face severe penalties.
Shortly after 6:45 p.m., a second accident occurred on the A8, this time between Augsburg and Dasing.
There was a collision between a car transporter and a car.
A rescue helicopter was on its way to the accident site.
Deutsche Bahn: group tests "comfort check-in"
It is a moment that almost everyone has experienced before: unsuspecting, you sit on the train and fall asleep.
Or you are immersed in your work and just have an ingenious thought.
And then: pufff.
Comes the conductor and wakes you up softly or rips the passenger out of the middle of the workflow.
Ticket control.
But the periods of disruption are soon over.
Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the ticket control system.
You simply confirm by mobile phone that you have taken your seat and devalue the ticket.
A test run is currently underway on two routes.
"If the offer arrives, we will expand it.
It is expected to be available on many other long-distance routes in Germany at the beginning of next year, "said a railway spokesman.
"Comfort check-in" is what the train calls the devaluation of tickets without conductors.
In order to be able to use them, however, a number of requirements have to be met: you need a smartphone or a tablet.
And you have to have booked an online ticket - which most passengers do anyway.
You also have to buy it through the app of the train, the DB Navigator, which is the most convenient way of booking tickets anyway.
And last but not least, you need a seat reservation.
Because the "comfort check-in" works like this: you get on the train, call your ticket under "my Tickets."
The test customers will then see a button for electronic devaluation.
The train attendants receive a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is on the train and has taken the booked seat Y.
If the train attendant comes to seat Y at ticket control, he knows that there is a passenger sitting there with an already devalued online ticket.
So you can keep sleeping, keep working, keep quiet.
The "check-in" has two advantages: one for the customer, one for the train - which in turn should benefit the passengers.
"If you want to travel relaxed without ticket control by our accompanying staff, simply check in at the DB Navigator.
This allows passengers to personalise their travel time on the train, "says Michael Peterson, marketing director of DB Fernverkehr.
Second plus: "and our employees have more time than they do today to respond to individual customer needs."
Those who often travel by train know that, in addition to delays and missed trains, ticket checks are one of the biggest annoyances.
Because often you yourself, but in any case one of the passengers does not have all the documents you need to devalue online tickets.
Either the credit card or the identity card is missing, or else a document has to be presented.
The result is endless discussions between train attendants and passengers, which leads to bad mood in the compartment or large room and delays in checking one's own ticket, and the conductor ends up taking the time to attend to other concerns.
Only a small number of test customers can still use the new service.
And only on the ICE 915 Dortmund-Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart-Essen connections.
Further train numbers on the same route have not yet been activated.
How an activist came to learn the answer to the question: "whose Streets?"
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shaken to her core.
Just a day after she arrived in New York City, the St. Louis native sat on the bed of an Airbnb apartment she rented and scrolled through Facebook on her phone.
She stumbled across a post from someone from high school.
"The police have just killed a 18-year-old child and it is still lying on the street," it said.
Confused, as no one else had posted the information on her feed, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
A user with the handle @ TheePharoah was constantly retweeted on her timeline.
The rapper from the St. Louis area was in the process of tweeting live the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Mo.
He posted a picture of Brown's lifeless body stretched out on the street and would stay there for four hours.
"That's wild," Ferrell thought to himself.
But death was nothing new for her and her community.
She put down her cell phone to return to tweets about people on Canfield Drive later in the evening.
There were photos of the police tape and people screaming, and of a man claiming to be Brown's father carrying a sign reading, "Ferguson's police just killed my unarmed son!"
She watched a live feed where a policeman stood in front of a group of protesters with a barking dog.
In another video, she said, another policeman unsecured his rifle and shouted, "I'm going to kill you... Animals all."
"It's not common," Ferrell recalled of her statement.
"This is not the kind of murder that we have become accustomed to and that we can call typical."
At that moment, I felt chills.
I was angry and crying. "
She booked a return flight and went home the next day.
After landing at 11pm, she picked up her 6-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided the two would head to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson in the following three years is the subject of a new documentary, "whose Streets?," in cinemas from the age of 11.
It's a story of survival and protest, of love and loss, of strength and resilience, from the point of view of people who live in the community and have filled the streets to demand answers.
When Ferrell drove to Ferguson with her daughter, who wore a floral dress and matching crown, the two discussed a conversation they had countless times before this morning "about the black experience and the black state."
"You remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe in?" She recalled what she said.
"We're going to Ferguson now because the police killed a 18-year-old boy and that wasn't right.
I couldn't take them, "Ferrell said later.
"What happened today is a culmination of what happened in the past.
She needs to know it and see it and be raised in it.
It needs to be well developed, to know not only activism and organization, but also the different layers of black experience and black constitution, and what we need to do to become free to liberate ourselves.
Even if I'm lucky enough to give her an experience where she doesn't personally experience blatant racism, she's no different from the next black woman child.
I feel like I'm doing her a disservice to keep her away from it. '
The first stop when they arrived in Ferguson was on South Florissant Road, a site opposite the Police Department that became a camp site as campaigners waited for the possible non-prosecution of Officer Darren Wilson.
There, Ferrell and her daughter bonded with a local business owner who made lunch.
They prepared bags and helped pass them on to protesters.
Slowly, a new kind of activism began to take shape for Ferrell.
"My activism changed completely after August 9," she said, noting that as a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis was president of the Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on food justice and health inequalities in black communities.
"I had no experience in organizing.
It's all come. '
Weeks later, during an evening demonstration, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, one of the film's co-directors.
Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar just wanted to "document" what happened.
One question came to Ferrell's mind: "do you want to document or are you trying to find a story you can exploit?"
That skepticism was fuelled by countless cases of people, often whites - in a community that benefited from their pain and resilience.
As Folayan explained in a recent interview, "we had heard that people born and raised in Ferguson didn't center their voices and we wanted to do it differently."
Folayan had already worked with then-co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the field known for his activism around death row inmates.
His involvement brought Ferrell closer to the project, along with six other locals followed the team from "whose Streets?" In the years after Brown's shooting.
"This documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks to us... We're talking," Davis said.
"That was the main thing for me, how these people are portrayed, because that's how I'm going to be portrayed."
The goal was not to focus on Ferrell's experience - to show that the movement is "not a Messiah leader, but a community coming together," Folayan said - she proved to be the film's most open participant.
As a result, documents from "whose Streets?" Reveal surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrell's life as she falls in love and marries her wife.
"I felt like I was naked," Ferrell said, laughing as she saw the finished product for the first time.
"But I understood that there must be some vulnerability in this work and in the humanisation of black people."
In addition, Ferrell's story repeats the role of black gay women in the broader Black Lives Matter movement.
Two of the movement's three founders, who coined the film "BlacklivesMatter" on social media after the 2012 killing of black teenager Trayvon Martin, identify as gay.
"Black, gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement as a whole," Ferrell said, "and so we're constantly fighting on different fronts.
Black, gay women have to bear the brunt of everything. "
Folayan agreed, noting that "the movement is really sustained by black women and many black women."
She insists, however, that "this is not an affirmative type of action," in which Ferrell was chosen as the heart of the film because of her identity.
"She was the person who stirred up that energy," she said.
"It's not a coincidence, even though she was on the front line, because with a life at these crossroads as a black, gay woman, the stakes are so high.
You can feel their energy through the screen. "
Meanwhile, the news cameras in Ferguson have long since disappeared, but the racial links between the community and the police continue to exist.
Ferrell is on probation for 2 ½ years for blocking a highway at a demonstration.
She describes the socio-political atmosphere of the area, which she calls her home: "a mess."
Still, she's clinging to a chant and she's been committed to that memory ever since she took to the streets in Ferguson three years ago.
"It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It is our duty to win.
We must love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose - except our chains. "
From "dream" to "megalomania": TV readers discuss Bit-Gallery
The Bit-Gallery moves people, although it is far from being built.
But the idea of a shopping centre at the southern end of the pedestrian zone has been dividing the population into supporters and opponents since the first presentation in 2009.
The topic hardly leaves you cold.
The topic is also discussed on our Facebook page "Volksfreund Bitburg."
While some say to the Bit-Galerie: "that would be a dream" (Anja Becker) or "that would be really great" (Nicole Schausten), from the other side comes: "no man needs" (Siggi Betzen) or quite simply: "megalomania!" (Lars Scholz).
While supporters are counting on a gallery to attract more customers to the city, which also benefits the rest of the shops, opponents fear that the pedestrian zone will then bleed.
In addition, the gallery is planned precisely on the site where the farmer's market hall is located, where 13 direct marketers offer their products.
This will come to an end with the start of construction work.
The gallery makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - towards Beda Square with the possibility of sitting outside.
Simone Zimmer: "we have been buying in the farmer's market hall almost weekly for many years.
Mainly our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of the country women are always very happy.
We also discovered the butchery for ourselves.
We would like to see an opportunity to maintain this offer during and especially after the construction of the gallery.
In other cities, there is.
The Kleinmarkthalle in Frankfurt is particularly interesting. "
Gerd Densing: "whether direct marketers settle in a market hall in the gallery depends on the amount of rent.
But this will probably not be very low in the new project. "
Eva Kilic: "why shopping palaces in Bitburg?
Whether it's clothing, shoes, drugstores or supermarkets, I find that superfluous.
There are enough of them in our city.
You can see how many shops are empty here - some for months and years.
However, since there is not even a regular weekly market here, it is all the more important that we at least maintain the market hall.
After all, the goods offered there are fresh, mostly offered directly by the producer and, on top of that, are inexpensive.
As you can see, shops in a shopping centre are only rented by larger companies, because the rents there are often not sustainable for a retailer.
What a pity, there are almost no more special shops and what is left of them will probably disappear. "
Wolf Fandel: "a shopping mall with a market hall doesn't fit for me.
And the gallery doesn't fit Bitburg.
Above all: where should the farmer's market hall go during the construction period?
The old Edeka would be the solution - even in the long run, if the Bit-Gallery actually comes at some point.
Or does the spectre of Bit-Galerie manage to evict all shops from Bitburg before? "
George Marquet: "it just won't work.
And no one needs a shopping center that is empty.
In my opinion, it would have been better to promote a real farmers "market instead of this gallery.
But there is no room for a farmer's market hall, thanks to the insane number of - in my opinion - pointless construction projects in Bitburg.
If the farmers "market hall is destroyed, a piece of culture will disappear again."
A fitting similarity: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Manning's DNA
In the middle of the room at the Fridman Gallery in New York, there are many faces - white, black and brown, almost imperceptibly alike - hanging on cables from the ceiling.
The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from cheek tubers and haircuts sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent the excerpts from Fort Leavenworth prison, where the former intelligence analyst was serving a 35-year sentence after she made public classified diplomatic messages through the website WikiLeaks.
The new exhibition, which opened on August 2, is called A Becoming Resemblance.
It is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline combined her expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a transwoman and pioneering dissident whose conviction was commuted by Barack Obama when he had only three days left in office.
Dewey-Hagborg has created a sharp, if somewhat intellectual, commentary not only on the formability of DNA data - the many ways it can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also on identity, through the algorithmic analysis of DNA extracted by Manning, from which 30 portraits were created of what someone might look like with these genomic data.
Manning, who was born Bradley Edward but has already spoken openly about identifying as a woman since her puberty, was convicted in 2013 on 20 charges, including six violations of the espionage law, computer fraud and theft.
Through prison, her image was suppressed, so much so that there was only one photograph - a grainy, black-and-white selfie in which Manning was visibly uncomfortable sitting in a driver's seat wearing a platinum blonde wig - with which she was associated.
In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg just came away from the huge success of her 2012 project "Stranger Visions."
In it, the artist produced portraits of strangers from forensic artifacts such as cigarette butts and chewing gum, extracting DNA from the waste to create a picture of what these people might look like.
That was when she received an email from a newspaper magazine.
"They did an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison, and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," Dewey-Hagborg explained at a press preview of the new exhibition.
And she couldn't visit at the time and she couldn't be photographed, so you contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to do a DNA portrait.
The artist and her imprisoned muse became unequal bridesmaids, who exchanged several letters over the course of two years.
They even created a comic, "suppressed Images," illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, which foresaw a future in which the president would commute Cheltenham's judgment and she would be able to see the exhibition in person.
That Obama would actually demand Manning's release after seven brutal years in a Kansas military prison just days after the book was published was a welcome kind of happy coincidence.
There is also something deep and strong now at the opening of the exhibition, as Donald Trump is waging a war against government camp informants and transgender troops to find new, tweetable ways to further inflame the rigid divisions he was supposed to fix.
When asked about the strange timing of all these things, Dewey-Hagborg said that "things happen for a certain reason."
In an artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery, Manning, with her oversized signature underneath (the "I" in her family name is emblazoned with a heart), called for an end to "automatic fragmentation based on gender, race, sexuality and culture."
On the opposite wall is her mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousand-footer of Cs and Gs and As, written in pencil.
Dewey-Hagborg hoped, by including the 200 letters (or nucleotides according to the artist's advanced scientific lexicon), to show how strikingly similar, at least in biological terms, we all are.
"What people will hopefully take away from this is that our genome doesn't care who we are and how open genetic data is to interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose 2007 video work, Spurious Memories, is also on view.
"DNA data can tell so many different stories, so that's 30 of those stories."
The last piece in the exhibition, which is kept in a separate room, is a page from the comic novella mentioned above.
She shows Manning as she emerges from the United States disciplinary barracks like King-Kong with a hands-free phone in her hand.
"If they cold your speech, they won," it read.
"So never shut your mouth."
"It came directly from a letter she wrote to me," said the artist, who hails from Philadelphia.
"I still get goosebumps when I talk about it."
Manning has not yet seen the exhibition in person - as anticipated in the comic book - but if she were to do so, she will be greeted in the middle of the room by the masks, by her own genomic simulacras, clustered together like hordes of protesters.
This was also purposeful, like everything in the exhibition, down to the size (5 "2, Manning's stature), where her genetic haplogroups were written with pencil.
"In the past, I had them on the wall, but I wanted them to feel like a crowd," Dewey-Hagborg said of the portraits.
"I wanted it to feel like a mass movement formed with Chelsea, like the movement that was also behind its liberation."
Northwestern University professor and Oxford University employee wanted for killing
A nationwide manhunt is underway for a professor at Northwestern University and an Oxford University employee who are wanted as suspects after a man was stabbed with fatal injuries in a luxury Chicago apartment.
On Monday, arrest warrants were issued for Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) for murder for their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, Cook County District Court records show.
The documents say Cornell-Duranleau, 26, passed away after several stitches.
A community alert system released by the Chicago Police Department says the corpse was discovered on July 27.
Officers received a call, arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with multiple injuries to his body.
Cornell-Duranleau was still pronounced dead at the scene, and detectives are investigating the stabbing as murder, while police are actively searching for the two suspects, officials said.
Lathem has been an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, the vice president for university relations, said in an emailed statement that Lathem was now on leave and barred from entering the Northwestern University campus.
"This is now a criminal matter under investigation by the relevant authorities, and Northwestern University is cooperating in this investigation," Cubbage said.
Warren is a senior treasury assistant at Oxford University.
A spokesman for the university and Somerville College said in an emailed statement that "we are in contact with the police in Britain and ready to assist the U.S. investigation authorities in any way we can."
The statement added that Warren's colleagues were shocked and want him to stand up.
Chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Department, Anthony Guglielmi, said he strongly urges the suspects to face the authorities.
"The police have an idea of their whereabouts, and our efforts to locate them are intensifying," Guglielmi said.
Guglielmi said local, regional and national authorities are helping to find the suspects.
Guglielmi said police received a call from the building manager of the Grand Plaza building, who had just received a puzzling tip that said something had happened in apartment 1008.
Police described the scene as very cruel.
Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the incident also took place on July 27.
It was confirmed by security cameras that Lathem and Warren were in the building.
"We believe that Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," Guglielmi said.
Grand Plaza's management team released a statement to residents: "police are currently working on the victim's timeline and background and are exploring a variety of motives, including a possible domestic incident."
"We will complete the WADA roadmap in the near future" - Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mutko
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said it will not be long before the remaining World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) criteria for the restoration of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) are implemented.
"At a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the roadmap, RUSADA has been given the right to plan and test in collaboration with UKAD (UK Anti-Doping).
The WADA roadmap has been updated in this regard, "Mutko said on Thursday.
The PM commented on the second part of WADA's compliance roadmap, which describes the criteria for reinstatement of RUSADA and was recently published on the organisation's website.
According to Mutko, it contains nothing that could give Russia cause for concern.
"Everything has been announced, everything is being implemented.
And the results will be submitted to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA in the near future, "he added.
However, one of the criteria mentioned in the list states that the Russian anti-doping authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the WADA-approved investigation by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren into alleged state-sponsored doping in Russian sport.
Referring to the matter, Mutko said: "we are conducting the investigation as our anti-doping system has admitted a mistake.
All measures have been implemented.
But there were no government programs, and we're not going to admit something that doesn't exist. '
Mutko's words echoed those of Vitaly Smirnov, the head of Russia's independent anti-doping commission.
Speaking to Russian outlet RSport earlier in the day, Smirnov admitted past problems in Russian anti-doping organisations, but then added: "we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations.
No one intends to accept this report unconditionally, "Smirnov added.
Rusada was banned from performing doping controls in Russia by WADA in November 2015 in the wake of the doping scandal.
However, she was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and UK Anti-Doping (UKAD).
After a visit to the organization's headquarters in Moscow in July, WADA director general Olivier Niggli said RUSADA was "moving in the right direction" to be reinstated.
Aldi no longer sells eggs for the time being
This was announced by the business groups.
It was a mere precaution that no health impairment could be expected to continue, the statement said.
From now on, only eggs are likely to be delivered to Aldi, which have been shown to have been tested negative for fipronilous anti-lice drugs.
Aldi wants to create clarity and transparency for its customers.
The start-ups that will help your company not become the next Uber
Amy Errett wanted to measure your employees "happiness with your e-commerce start-up, but the surveys didn't work.
Answers were often vague, unhelpful or - even worse - fraudulent.
And even if you promised anonymity, some workers did not trust the process.
"There just never was consistency and objectivity," said Errett, who runs the 75-person San Francisco e-Commerce Hair Care company Madison Reed.
She called people from outside for help.
A new breed of human resources start-ups is growing to help companies figure out how their employees feel.
By creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement, it allows companies to conduct surveys, target specific groups and demographic groups, provide employees with anonymity and complaint hotlines, and in some cases allow whistleblowers to bypass C-Suite executives and contact the board directly.
"You now have tools like Strava and Fitbit for tracking their health, but where's the Fitbit for your company?" Said Jim Barnett, co-founder and chief executive of Redwood City start-up Glint, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement.
Errett said that she gained a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with Glint.
In addition to the Snap-polls and surveys of specific teams, it offers a heat map of the company that shows at a glance which units have the most complaints and which executives have low approval scores - so you can drill down on why.
Companies come to realise that you have to stay at the top of the workplace culture so that you don't become the next Uber to be caught up in scandals since a former employee published a blog post describing an environment of harassment where those who spoke were punished.
For start-ups like Glint, this desire for an overview is a lucrative business opportunity.
The global governance, regulation and compliance industry could be worth more than $118.7 billion in 2020, according to financial technology website Let's Talk Payments.
Denver, Colorado, start-up Convercent, which helps companies prevent and detect bad behavior, saw a surge in interest and activity earlier this year amid the Uber case in disrepute.
Convercent has nearly 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber has recently signed up as a client.
Like Glint, Convercent lets companies send customized "pulse" surveys, collect confidential responses in real time and view the heat maps of your problem areas.
It also offers an anonymous SMS hotline that lets employees report bad behavior.
And when the chief executive is involved, complaints go directly to the supervisory board.
"The court of public opinion has captured the regulators," said Patrick Quinlan, Convercent's founder and chief executive.
If a company is found to be treating its employees poorly or behaving unethically, it can face costly consequences from consumer boycotts, employee turnover and lawsuits, Quinlan said.
Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 locations, has employed Convercent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of policies and procedures and have an easy way to reach their corporate headquarters.
Previously, if an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a phone number or email for the company's headquarters, file a formal complaint and hope it was taken seriously.
It was often an intimidation and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesdays general counsel, who said there was no good way to track employees "complaints.
Now that the company is using Convercent, problems previously hidden by executives who sat in offices in cities or states - such as discrimination, harassment or unfair practices - can be identified and addressed more quickly.
"I can get closer to this holistic, 360-degree view into the experience of employment," said Vitrano, who heads Ruby Tuesday's Risk Management Group.
"And we protect our shareholders from employment litigation."
Companies began taking ethics, values and employee engagement more seriously in 2002 after accounting firm Arthur Andersen collapsed due to ethics violations caused by the Enron scandal, Quinlan said.
But it took until the "social media came to their right" that companies realised you couldn't stop their dirty laundry going online.
"Before using technology to monitor ethics, people used hope as a strategy," he said.
Both Glint and Convercent offer their software as a service and charge companies with recurring fees for using their products.
It is a business model and an opportunity that has the approval of venture capital investors who have supported both start-ups.
Convercent received $10 million in funding in February from firms such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, raising the total capital to $47 million.
Glitter secured $10 million in November from Bessemer Venture Partners, bringing its total funding to $60 million.
These investments come as little surprise, given the interconnected nature of business, culture and venture capital.
There is a growing body of research showing that today's employees expect more from their jobs than before.
In competitive markets like Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are just stakes.
Employees want to feel that you are accepted and valued and that you are giving your time to a company with a positive mission.
"If people are happy to be in a company, feel that their voices are heard, and that the work you do is worthwhile, then they feel more committed to making this company successful," said Nina McQueen, vice president of Global Benefits and Employee Experience at LinkedIn, which uses both Convercent and Glint.
Investors achieve returns when their portfolio companies are doing well. Companies are doing well when employees are engaged and engaged.
If third-party analytics tools promise to increase engagement and employee engagement, it's no wonder you'll find support.
The data on employee engagement according to the experts of the workplace culture is important.
But the data is useless if the managers of a company do not take action.
In fact, when a company asks employees for their feedback, they may have an expectation that change is on the way.
And if change doesn't come quickly enough, or not at all, it can breed disappointments and demotivate employees.
"If you ask for 4,000 suggestions, you have to be willing to have 4,000 conversations," said Russell Raath, president of consulting at business management firm Kotter International, which has seen companies that rely too much on collecting data.
"Because if you don't follow employees will ask themselves," have you really heard me?
Do you care?
And if you don't care, why should I? "
Madison Reed, who now conducts monthly employee surveys, was able to take action on the same day when a problem is reported about Glint, according to Errett.
And after collecting feedback from frustrated employees, through the speed of decision making and the quality of communication, she was able to reorganize several teams within the company and add a communication training session to address the problems.
At Ruby Tuesday, the company is getting new insights about employees, and it hopes that in the long run, this will lead to better retention of workers in an industry known for high turnover.
"If you're not committed to creating a culture of transparency, you're going to lose people," Vitrano said.
"And if you lose people, you lose customers, too.
And if you lose customers, then you will lose business.
The NCAA eliminates two-day practices and makes a long day for the Bruins
It's approaching 11 p.m. as a crowd of UCLA football players entertain themselves on one side of the team's new practice fields on campus.
Some have pulled out their jersey tops and show their backs full of sweat from the first day of training camp.
For a good part of the team, those idle minutes represent a lunch break.
Players enrolled in the summer courses will return to their final exams after the three-hour practice before returning to the Wasserman Football Center at 6:30 a.m. the next morning.
"This is a real treadmill for the guys the next three days," Bruins coach Jim Mora said just before Monday became Tuesday.
The NCAA eliminated two-day exercises to ease the burden on players, and it actually extended its days - at least until Friday's final.
That's why UCLA's first three workouts should begin at 7:15 p.m. to accommodate the players "already packed schedules.
The compromise away from the two days is more than a day when the Bruins postponed the start of camp nearly a week after last season and practiced during summer school for the first time during Mora's six seasons at Westwood.
They are scheduled to hold 18 exercises over the course of August, 20 before the start of formal game preparations for their opener against Texas A & M in September.
Mora said he supports the NCAA's rule change even as it adds another point to players "busy routes.
"We put this huge burden on them three or four days, and it's very challenging," mora said.
"And they just pushed it through, they keep placating, they're great people.
I think as soon as we get to Saturday and we have more time, it's going to be really great. '
UCLA will end its practices once the camp ends, which will not be an easy task given the clear lines of sight of its fields from an adjacent parking lot and the adjacent Luskin Center, an upscale hotel that has already been pelted with footballs clearing a protective net behind a goalpost.
Bruins players are expected to occupy the hotel starting this weekend, but Mora acknowledged there could be a problem once those rooms are vacant during the season.
"We will use our security," mora said.
"That's a real problem, and it's not far-fetched to think that people rent a room there and then set out there to record an exercise.
If you have the videotape of an exercise, it's a pretty good deal.
But we have security forces there, and we have security forces at parking lot 8.
We're going to do the best we can with what we have.
I am not too worried about that.
We have a plan. "
Facebook to step up factual review in fight against fake news
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with false reports to third-party fact-checkers and then display their results under the original post, the world's largest online social network said on Thursday. It is one of its efforts to combat so-called fake news.
The company said in an opinion piece on its website that it will begin using updated machine learning methods to detect possible false reports and send them to fact-checkers who may be displaying fact-checking results from the original article.
Facebook has been criticised as one of the main distribution points for so-called fake news, which many believe also influenced the 2016 U.S. presidential election.
The problem has also become a major political issue in Europe, with French voters flooded with false stories in the run-up to the presidential election in May, and Germany backing a plan to punish social media networks if they fail to quickly eliminate hateful postings as they did before the September elections there.
On Thursday, Facebook said in a separate statement in German that a test of the new fact-checking will be launched in the US, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
"In addition to recognizing which stories are being challenged by fact-checkers from third parties, people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share," Sara Su, product manager for Facebook news, said in a blog.
She added that Facebook will continue to test its feature on the "related article" and is working on other changes to its news feed to reduce fake news.
Creating a comic novel: a castle in the history of England
In its recent past, little Scotney Castle featured in a squeeze music video and was a loophole for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970s and 1980s.
But Scotney has lived through 700 years of turbulent history from his cosy seat in the Bewl River Valley in Kent, and has now become the inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes, a moped-haired Yorkshireman with a penchant for historical documents.
"I find it so nice to look at the handwriting of someone who has been dead for 300 years," he says wistfully.
"What a personal relationship to hold this letter in my hand."
"A Castle in England" covers the period from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families who lived in Scotney. Each story was illustrated by another emerging British artist - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
It's not Rhodes' first book based on an archive: he wrote "Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories" in 2014, a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project he found unexpectedly emotional.
"I only responded to the thumb print on the side of a letter written by a double agent in the 1700s who worked for the Jacobins," he says.
"That's his thumb!
And letters always smelled of smoke, because at that time a fire was lit because of the light.
For someone who lives 300 years later, the smell has an effect, as if it were there.
Oh, I love archives! "
For someone so smitten with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and Arts Council England and lived in a castle for almost four months ("to be honest: I overstated my welcome a little"), this all seems too nice to be true.
Rhodes spent his days exploring the Victorian "new" castle, browsing the archives and studying the castle's many treasures and curiosities, such as the mounted hyena heads on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the ditch.
He wandered through the grounds and ruins of the old castle and spoke to landscape gardeners, gardeners and sometimes the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book.
Then, at night, he drank "whiskey and started writing."
Scotney's intimate story is relatively unknown, as the National Trust only gained full access in 2006 when the last heir, Elizabeth Hussey, died.
When Rhodes arrived a decade later, employees were just beginning to take care of the archive, which he described as "hundreds of years of aristocrats saying" Oh, throw it in the attic. ""
Diaries, letters from the time of the English Empire, maps showing who owned what: "you might think that land conflicts would be boring," says Rhodes, "but there was a birch that two families fought for.
Guys, let it all go! "
Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to delve into English history on a wider basis, including "The Labourer," which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 1381.
"There is a record of a riot that occurred at the castle in 1380, in this book called" Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex, "" Rhodes says.
"The peasant uprising began in this area and I thought an uprising was a good start.
Maybe the two are connected? "
Other stories are firmly rooted in the castle's history - such as "The Priest," which tells the story of the Jesuit priest whom the Darrell family hid for seven years during the English Reformation.
Or "The Smuggler," depicting 18th-century smuggler Arthur Darrell, who staged his own funeral by stuffing a coffin with stones (a discovery made years later when his coffin was excavated).
The Darrells are Rhodes "favourite family of Scotney:" the gentlemen seemed to be quite crooks, getting into debt and spending money on things they couldn't afford.
Other generations of Darrell men solved their debt crises by marrying rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of good-looking guys, with a talent to recruit heirs. "
After the end of his engagement in the castle, Rhodes is looking for other unique writing experiences
He completed a two-week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about Elämänmäki, the site of an early-20th-century sanatorium that has since been reclaimed by nature.
But Scotney has a special place for him.
"I was sad to go again," he says.
It was like, "ah, now I have to deal with the damn life again."
Campaign launched: St. Mary's Chapel in Rhöndorf shrouded over 300 years old
On Friday, the city of Bad Honnef launched its campaign to introduce a new umbrella brand (Thursday's round-up) with the veiling of the 301 year old St. Mary's Chapel in Rhöndorf.
Mayor Otto Neuhoff and his marketing team around Nelson Artz want to keep the logo and slogan secret until Thursday.
At the end of August, as the highlight of the campaign, there will be a festival on the island of Grafenwerth.
"Too nice for us.
Or? "The makers of the action have been asking on the posters at the Rhöndorfer Chapel since yesterday.
"We don't really think so (of course!)," they write on their website, which was released yesterday.
"But we are using this measure to gain your attention.
And to make it clear that some things are better than they seem.
Basically, we firmly believe that as citizens of Bad Honnefer, we are well aware of the beauty and attractiveness of our city. "
The action is about more than "just" a logo and a slogan, it said.
"It is necessary to formulate a single promise, one that gives the city an unmistakable unique selling point."
After all, it is in competition with other municipalities.
The city of Bad Honnef is costing an average five-figure sum for its new umbrella brand and the campaign.
Military reforms in Turkey - Erdogan's fear of the army
Every year at the beginning of August, in Ankara, the Supreme Military Council (YAS) advises on retirements and promotions in the officer corps.
So did this week.
At first glance, this is a normal procedure.
But nothing is routine with the Turkish armed forces a year after the coup attempt.
The meeting was no longer held in the General Staff building, as it used to be, but in the prime minister's office.
The meeting, chaired by the Head of Government, was now also attended by the five Vice-Presidents and the Ministers for Defence, Home Affairs, Justice and Foreign Affairs.
As a result, the civilians in the YAS were in the majority.
The government is taking the reins in the military.
Chief of Staff Hulusi Akar remains in office, but the commanders of the army, air force and navy have been ousted.
Since the failed coup, head of state Erdogan has fired 169 of the 326 generals and admirals.
More than 10,000 soldiers have been removed from the ranks of the army - mostly for alleged links to the movement of the exiled preacher Fethullah Gülen, whom Erdogan sees as the mastermind behind the coup attempt.
Negotiations have been taking place in Ankara since this week against 486 people who are said to have been directly involved in the coup attempt.
The day after the coup, Erdogan had described the coup attempt as a "gift of God" because it gave him the opportunity to "completely cleanse" the armed forces.
But does Erdogan really have a grip on the army?
At the end of February, the newspaper "Hürriyet" published an article entitled "discomfort in Military Headquarters."
In the General Staff, there are concerns about the increasing "Islamisation" of the army, which is manifested, among other things, in the lifting of the ban on headscarves for female soldiers, the newspaper wrote.
In any case, the large-scale training of the army and the security forces continues.
In mid-July, Erdogan ordered a further 7395 public servants to be fired by decree, including 2303 policemen and 546 soldiers.
It seemed that Erdogan had tamed the military.
The generals used to be considered the real masters of the country.
Three times they putted, citing their role as guardians of the secular state order.
After his election victory in 2002, Erdogan pushed back the power of the military step by step, not least by invoking the reform requirements of the European Union.
Former officers say Erdogan is purposefully driving an Islamisation of the armed forces.
In the "vocal Europe" magazine, an unnamed officer who sought asylum after the coup attempt for fear of persecution abroad warned that the Turkish army would be "full of extremists and Salafists" in a few years.
If that is the case, such a development could not leave NATO cold.
In any case, after the purges, there are doubts in the alliance about the readiness of the Turkish army.
The governance structures and operational capabilities are "weakened," NATO diplomats say.
Washington changes Green Card rules
There will be a new U.S. immigration plan to change the Green Card rules, said President Donald Trump, quoted by the media.
He plans to cut legal immigrants to 50,000 a year, tougher rules on obtaining temporary work permit visas and restrictions on family-oriented visas.
The new rules are proposed by Republicans and supported by the president.
The bill is to be debated in the two chambers of Congress.
"This law will reduce poverty, raise wages and save billions of dollars for taxpayers, and will do so by changing the way green cards are issued to citizens from other countries."
The law will prevent chain migration and replace the current system.
This new application procedure will benefit candidates who speak English, who have the financial means to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy, "Trump said, quoted by the American media.
Ministry to refurbish track for Rennsteigshuttle
Over the past few months, there have been repeated arguments about the future of the Rennsteigshuttles - now things are supposed to go very quickly.
Before the end of the year, the ramshackle track on which the tourist railway runs is to be built.
In order to secure the future of the Rennsteigshuttles in the long term, according to the Ministry of Transport, construction work on the track is to begin later this year.
"With the decision to continue to order and renovate the Ilmenau-Rennsteig route, the country is committed to this link, which is particularly important for tourism," said State Secretary for Transport Klaus Sühl in Erfurt on Friday.
He estimated the cost of repairing the line at around 2.5 million euros.
Of this sum, the country takes over 75 percent.
The contract, on the basis of which the shuttle is to be ordered from the country in the future, is currently being finalized, Sühl said.
The ministry and the Südthüringen Railway as operator have already agreed on the technical details.
"This means that the road map, the vehicles used and the quality standards have been negotiated," said Sühl.
The planned contract between the ministry and the railway company will be concluded for a period of eleven years.
This means that the Rennsteig-Shuttle will be ordered on a regular basis on December 2017.
The Rennsteig-Shuttle is a railway connection between the Ilmenau and Rennsteig stations, which is particularly popular with tourists.
In recent months, during the course of a pilot operation, it has been tested whether the line will be used by enough people to order it regularly again in the future.
In addition, some parts of the route are very dilapidated.
The rise of sex robots is real and we should be worried
Just when you thought it couldn't get any more crazy in 2017, comes a new report on technological developments in the field of sex robots.
Yes, indeed.
Sex robots are a big deal right now.
Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years.
According to Noel Sharkey, emeritus professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of the FRR, we need to start taking their rise seriously.
Customers can choose the eye color of the robot, its shape of the nipple and the type of fingernail.
"People are making fun of them, but companies are delivering a lot of them, and we're going to see them a lot more often," Mr. Sharkey said at the release of his new report.
Modern sex dolls have evolved from their inflatable partners into robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with deliberately human responses achieved through artificial intelligence.
The user can also "customize" his robot according to his or her beliefs, choosing everything from the eye color of the robot to the shape of the nipples to the type or color of his or her fingernails.
But it becomes even more worrying as many robots own the "personalities" that would make a Stepford woman look progressive.
Modern sex dolls have evolved into robots with a silicone skin.
The RealBox robot, for example, allows its users to adapt their robots to the characteristics they find appealing, such as shyness.
And then there's the Roxxxy Gold sex robot developed by True Companion with pre-programmed personalities like "frigid Farrah," which gives the impression of shyness and "wild Wendy" with a "adventurous" personality.
"Roxxxy Gold has a personality that is as suited to your personality as possible," jokes the True Companion website.
So she likes what you like, and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc.
She also has her moods during the day - just like real people!
She can be tired, fixated on conversation, or she can be "in the mood!"
There are many troubling aspects to this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the subservient female traits, the allusions to rape when you take a step towards Frigid (read: reluctant) Farrah, worry one the most.
On its website, True Companion compared Roxxxy to a vibrator, but for men.
"If women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can't men have a Roxxxy?" The website states.
However, these sex robots are not just a fetish or just another sex toy.
Their emergence and increasing sophistication point to something darker and deeper in our culture, a retreat from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with submission as an optional addition.
Most men, of course, will not keep sex robots, and while the FRR notes their rising popularity, they remain on the fringes of consumer culture for the time being.
But what seeps out of the fringe can be very instructive in terms of the spirit of the time we live in.
And many people are not strange or insulting until the free market gives them permission to do so.
There is a certain overlap that these sophisticated sex robots are emerging at a time when women's rights are under threat around the world, when there is a president in the White House who has boasted of sexually assaulting women.
The most dissuasive aspect of the TV series "The Handmaid's Tale" ("The Report of the Magd") is not the graphic images, the tangled bodies and the eyes that are cast out, but how realistic this vision is.
The Republic of Gilead is a leap, but at the moment it does not feel like a great leap.
The goal behind these sex robots is to make a physical resemblance to actual women as realistic as technically possible (albeit with porn star proportions).
Their builders want them to feel human, to imitate the movement of a real body.
But, to the point, when it comes to their "personalities," the robots do not represent real women.
They can't separate from their companion or just walk away.
They have no mediation or a background story, nothing that suggests independence or anything that could disrupt the fantasy of total submission.
In other words, they are fake slaves.
Or to put it in the phrase of 2017: maids
Trump's big achievement?
He makes Mitt Romney the epitome of common sense
It has become a truism of the Trump era that the political divisions that have polarized the U.S. electorate have also divided small-format families.
Around Christmas and Thanksgiving, there were newspapers in the U.S. offering advice on how to deal with the horror of relatives voting for Trump.
We all reportedly make an effort to have our filter bubbles burst.
Less noticed has been the power of Trump to bring families together.
I mention this because my cousin, a left-leaning poet who lives in Chicago and has long dealt with the Republicans in our family, visited me in New York this week.
She reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.
With Trump in the White House, everyone she knows, including the Republican kinship with whom she had fought for decades over politics, is suddenly and strangely on the same page.
This is certainly a good thing around the dining table, but it strikes me in a wider context that it also involves significant risks.
The left has been strengthened by Trump, but the disfiguring effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right.
When we talk about "normalization" and Trump, we are referring to the scary possibility that one day his kittens will no longer repel us.
There is, however, an even more terrifying long-term scenario in which Trump "normalizes" right-wing Republicans who suddenly appear to be the epitome of reasonableness when compared to his standards.
I find myself today haunted by an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's hilarious version of the madman - the dog on the car roof, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew what his tax return looked like) - both of which, compared to Trump, actually appear to be very mild offenses.
If Trump goes, the next Republican nominee just needs to be mentally healthy to qualify as an immeasurable improvement.
When my cousin was in town, we took our kids to the carousel in Central Park, the largest of the New York City park department carousels, and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don't need caffeine.
The horses are enormous, the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are crunchy and the animals twist to look over their own shoulders full of fear - extremely sinister and the climactic music conveys this in a strange way.
So many clichés of a city disappoint: the views of tall buildings are getting old, the skylines are becoming too familiar to offer much excitement, and the reality of the city is not living up to the dream.
Thirty-five years later, and I'm still not quite over the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is in fact not a Swiss cottage - the themed pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage doesn't count - but a big roundabout in north London.
The Central Park carousel, however, is still a strangely magical experience, as here two two-year-olds, a 11-year-old and two women in their 40s can go on it and all have a great time.
If I could have assessed the carousel, I would have given it the full score, but luckily no one asked for it.
On the other hand, in a department store this week, I was forced to rate my "experience" of transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could pull through my credit card.
At the coffee shop on the corner of my street, it's the same, plus the option to match the rating with a 15 percent tip - this to buy something over the counter.
Not only does this slow down what should be a neutral exchange, but it also puts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where none is required.
The poor woman in the department store stood excitedly grinning, while I tired of the experience of giving her my credit card with five stars.
Oscar Pistorius moved from prison to hospital with chest pains
Pistorius has left prison for a second time for a hospital visit.
Last year, he was taken to hospital for treatment of cuts to his wrist, which he reportedly suffered after a fall in his cell, according to prison authorities.
Pistorius was convicted of murder following an appeal by prosecutors against a first-degree manslaughter conviction.
He killed Steenkamp in the early hours of Valentine's Day 2013 by shooting at her several times through a door of the toilet cubicle at his home in Pretoria.
Pistorius claimed that he thought his girlfriend was a late-night intruder who hid in the cabin.
Prosecutors have announced their intention to appeal this time against Pistorius' six-year sentence, which they say is too lenient.
The National Prosecuting Authority said it would appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa and the appeal could be heard this year.
Pistorius risks having his sentence increased to 15 years if prosecutors are successful.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
When farmer Arnold finds a strange egg
As the last of the Blumberg schools, fourth-graders from Fützen and Epfenhofen were released on holiday and into secondary schools.
Three of the school leavers will go to high school in the future, and four to secondary school.
Head of the school Angelika Sitte welcomed the parents and representatives of the public at the Bürgerhaus Biesental in Epfenhofen on Tuesday evening.
As a symbol of the dismissal, the 29 students of the four classes, led by Sophia Schumacher and Regine Meder, chose a young eagle that grows up in the chicken farm but is then released to freedom.
This was followed by a musical called "der Adler im Höhnerhof auf" (the eagle in the chicken farm).
Farmer Arnold found a strange egg and had it hatched by his chickens.
Instead of a chicken coop, a small eagle came out.
But the hope of turning it into a chicken was dashed, the eagle spread its wings on a high mountain and vanished.
After that, classes three and four showed a chicken dance in Yvonne Frank's enrollment.
The hens danced with the young goggles, who wore cylinders, to make the bet.
The eagle stands for integration, said school head Angelika Sitte.
Although the young animal is different from the other young animals (chicks), it is one of them.
But he will never be like a chicken.
His purpose is to be free.
She wished every fourth-grader that he felt accepted at his new school.
It was followed by a word of thanks to the colleagues, the former head of the school, Michael Müller, who repeatedly jumps into teaching bottlenecks, and the parents "representatives.
The kissing season is now over, explained class teacher Sophia Schumacher.
She was very reluctant to release her students after two years of teaching, because it was a really great time.
In the end, she was able to rely on fourth-graders.
At the end, all the students performed a song of summertime and holiday time.
There was great joy among the children.
Eight first-graders have already registered for the new school year.
Two Bulgarians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
Two Bulgarians have been detained for illegal camping in Greece, said the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, quoted by television.
On the morning of 1 August, a group of illegally camping people, including the two Bulgarians, were arrested by the police in Sithonia.
On the same day, they were released while an investigation is under way.
The foreign ministry told bTV that the Bulgarians were later released.
The Greek authorities have tightened controls on free camping and are imposing substantial fines on anyone found to stay in a place not intended for this purpose.
The checks will continue throughout the season.
The ministry said the court can impose a fine.
Software update for diesel vehicles: what those affected need to know now
How exactly does the software update take place?
Do diesel drivers have to take part in the action?
The most important questions and answers at a glance.
At the Diesel Summit, BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW Group offered software updates for a total of around 5.3 million cars.
They are intended to improve the emission performance of Euro 5 and Euro 6 cars.
Euro 4 diesels or worse are excluded.
Anja Smetanin of the ACE Auto Club Europe gives an assessment:
Is the new action mandatory?
No, the negotiated software updates are voluntary.
"The mandatory updates previously only apply to the vehicles that have cheating software," says Anja Smetanin.
The German Federal Motor Transport Authority (KBA) has ordered their retrofitting.
How and from when will customers be informed about updates?
The manufacturers have announced a speedy implementation in the next few months, but have not yet given an exact date.
Daimler has announced that it will write to each person concerned.
If an inspection is due in any case, it will be done within the scope of the inspection.
How long will the overall changeover take?
"Hard to say," says Smetanin.
This depends on the commitment of the manufacturers as well as on political pressure.
"Because we have seen that car manufacturers are not acting voluntarily on the subject of the environment."
How long should the update take?
The conversion itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop.
It could be more time-consuming to get an appointment.
What do drivers who do not drive cars from BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW Group do?
The ACE advises waiting.
Presumably, foreign manufacturers would follow suit, Smetanin said.
Is there a threat of a massive drop in the price of Euro 4 cars?
The ACE fears that.
But it is precisely in the regions where there is a threat of driving bans.
In rural areas, there has been no loss of value for older diesels.
The ACE advises waiting for a sale.
Ll Cool J receives Kennedy Center award
The Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most glamorous events in Washington.
The first awards ceremony under President Trump promises to be political.
One of the prizewinners does not want to come - in protest.
Ll Cool J (49) is the first rapper to receive one of the coveted awards from the renowned Kennedy Center.
As the cultural institution announced on Thursday, this year's honorees include singer Gloria Estefan (59), Lionel Richie (68), choreographer Carmen de Lavallade (86) and TV producer Norman Lear (95).
The awards will be presented at the beginning of December.
Traditionally, U.S. President Donald Trump will host a reception and attend the ceremony along with his wife Melania.
For this reason, Lear, the winner of the progressive TV series, has already announced that he will not attend the gala.
He told The New York Times: "this presidency has chosen to completely neglect the arts and human rights - even to deprive them of the means - and that puts a strain on me."
The 59-year-old Estefan stressed she would use the conversation with Trump to clarify her perspective.
The Kennedy Center, named after former President John F. Kennedy, is the largest cultural institution in the U.S. capital.
Previous winners include Meryl Streep, Aretha Franklin, Robert De Niro, George Lucas, Tom Hanks and Sting.
We make the city worth living
Roland Wacker, Haslach's city builder, will retire next year.
The position has already been advertised, but suitable candidates are rare.
Wacker has been a city builder for 31 years.
And the work is still great fun for him, as he conveys in the press interview.
He reports on varied but also demanding tasks awaiting his successor.
At the same time, he is surprised that so far no application meets the requirements profile.
The city is looking for an architect or civil engineer as soon as possible.
Thus - taking into account the regular periods of notice - there should still be enough time for a familiarisation.
Since Haslach serves as the Lower Building Law Authority for the Administrative Community, the applicant must present appropriate qualifications.
The city definitely wants to keep this function.
If they were no longer able to fill them in, the citizens would have to go to Offenburg for advice.
But proximity to the citizens is important to the city and to itself, says Wacker, who reports on a good working atmosphere as well as good mood between the authority and the citizens.
In more than 30 years in office, a number of important projects have accumulated, which Wacker looks back on with pride.
"We make the city worth living," he is sure of the building office and its employees.
But varied projects are also on the agenda in the future: the remodelling of the former Hukla-area and the Niederhofenparkplatz, for example, has been initiated.
The Kinzigbrücke between Bollenbach and Steinach is being renovated, and the renovation of the stadium is still an issue.
The latter alone will cost around 1.5 million euros, "if we get it right," estimates Wacker.
"All in all, great tasks await my successor.
The work here is fun. "
In terms of design, there is a great deal of room for manoeuvre for a city builder.
With Haslach's own farm and nursery, many things can be responded to quite flexibly.
"You can move a lot," says Wacker, and the design of the green spaces is often praised by citizens and visitors.
As the Old Town is listed as an ensemble, it is important to "keep an eye on what fits in" when new buildings are approved, emphasizes the outgoing city builder.
In any case, the city builder bears a great deal of responsibility.
He's a builder, "in the end, everything runs over my table here."
He can count on many years of support and coordination: Markus Neumaier (civil engineering) has been with us for ten years, while Manfred Schöner (civil engineering) has been with us for 15 years.
Also, Wacker wants his successor to stay for a long time: "we are looking for someone who really identifies with the job and wants to stay."
Continuity is not only important for a good working atmosphere, but also for the further development of the city.
Those who would like to inherit Roland Wacker should, according to the city of Haslach, have completed their studies as a graduate engineer or bachelor with a specialisation in architecture and have good expertise in the fields of building regulations and planning law.
The City Building Office is responsible for building and civil engineering, building management planning, land acquisition issues, management of urban properties, the Municipal Farm with Bauhof and Stadtgärtnerei as well as the Lower Building Law Authority, including monument protection.
Bicycle thrown on lines: southbound carriageway closed
According to police, the previously unknown offenders had thrown the blue bicycle from the railway overpass in the area of Leobener Straße (B116) onto the lines.
These were so badly damaged that the approaching freight train had to be stopped.
Investigators are looking for two male offenders and have been searching for them since the night hours.
Near the scene, a rose-colored scooter and a bicycle driver were observed by witnesses.
"This goes far beyond a coup d'état," said ÖBB spokesman Christoph Posch to the APA.
The perpetrator or the perpetrator would have put himself in great danger and also put train traffic at risk.
In addition to the damage to the locomotive and the plant, as well as the delay of minutes and the cost of rail replacement, the perpetrators could also be penalised by rail customers.
Overall, a "significant" sum is expected, the spokesman said.
The damage was repaired on Friday afternoon, and rail traffic on the southbound carriageway was able to run without any obstructions.
Just under ten passenger trains were cancelled on Friday morning, two of them related to long-distance traffic.
Freight trains were not cancelled, but they were delayed.
According to ÖBB spokesman Christoph Posch, around 200 metres of overhead lines had to be replaced.
Insulators and masts were also damaged.
Red meat, dairy products and chocolate could help alleviate IBD (inflammatory bowel disease) 
Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.
But a new study claims exactly the opposite: a diet rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products could ease the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel disease.
The incurable condition, which affects around 1.3 million in the U.S. and 300,000 in the UK, causes stomach cramps and bloating, recurrent or bloody diarrhoea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
While sufferers are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to alleviate their symptoms, researchers at Washington University found that the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins helps develop immune cells that promote a tolerant intestine.
The lead researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells patrol the intestines to ensure that harmful microbes hiding in food do not enter the body.
Cells capable of triggering inflammation are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissue.
If the balance tilts too far towards inflammation, it can result in inflammatory bowel disease.
Experiments found that a type of tolerance promoting immune cell occurs in mice that carry a specific bacterium in their intestines.
And the bacterium requires tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells.
Professor Colonna said: "we have established a link between a type of bacteria - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the intestinal microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.
The more tryptophan the mice had in their food, the more they had of these immune cells. "
He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and a diet rich in tryptophan promotes more tolerant, less inflammatory bowel milieus, when the same system also works in humans.
Postdoctoral researcher Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan examined a type of immune cell that promotes tolerance when she found out that a group of study mice had such cells, but another group of the same tribe, housed separately, did not.
She suspected that the difference had to do with the intestinal microbiomes of mice - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi that normally live in the gastrointestinal tract.
The intestines of the mice were DNA sequenced and six types of bacteria were found, which were present in the mice with the immune cells, but were missing in the mice without them.
Mice were raised in a sterile environment, so they lacked an intestinal microbiome and they did not develop these types of immune cells, and they were given the L. reuteri and the immune cells formed.
To understand how the bacteria affected the immune system, the researchers allowed L. reuteri to grow in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - to immature immune cells isolated from the mice.
The immune cells developed into tolerant cells.
When the active component was purified from the liquid, it turned out to be a byproduct of tryptophan metabolism, known as indol-3 lactic acid.
When researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the feed of mice, the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent, but when tryptophan levels were halved, the number of cells fell by half.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that humans have the same tolerant cells as mice, and that most of us protect L. reuteri in our gastrointestinal tracts.
It is not known whether tryptophan byproducts from L. reuteri develop the cells in humans as in mice, but defects in genes related to tryptophan have been found in people with inflammatory bowel disease.
She said: "the development of these cells is probably something we would like to encourage as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestine.
Potentially, high tryptophan levels in the presence of L. reuteri can lead to an expansion of this population. "
Jose Mourinho believes Manchester United have committed a "genius" with Nemanja Matic
At Manchester United, a "genius" has signed with Nemanja Matic, Jose Mourinho believes, after the midfielder made his debut against Sampdoria on Wednesday night.
Chelsea's £40m signing began with a 2-1 win in Dublin, the last pre-season match before the UEFA Super Cup against Real Madrid begins on Tuesday, and impressed in the halter-side role as the likes of Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira marched forward at will.
However, Matic had been ruled out of the Blues "pre-season tour of Asia and managed just 45 minutes, which Mourinho admitted he needed to improve before the start of the Premier League season.
"He needs time, but his experience, intelligence, a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football," Mourinho said.
"We will help him to be ready sooner rather than later."
In addition to Matic, Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku also started at the Aviva Stadium as Mourinho formed his starting XI for the start of the season.
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho still wanted three more new commitments, but he insisted the club had already done a "fantastic job" of fulfilling three of its four priority new commitments.
"To get three out of four, I thank the club for that," he added.
'i'll be happier if they get four out of four for me, but they've put in a lot of effort. '
Boeing "paints" Dreamliner into the sky
Us aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the silhouette of a Dreamliner in the sky.
The pilots flew from Seattle in the U.S. state of Washington, but the drawing began in Marquette in the U.S. state of Michigan and moved across the U.S. in the form of a Dreamliner, which is several thousand kilometers.
The action lasted 18 hours and a minute.
On the radar screens was the shape of a Dreamliner.
The whole thing was an endurance test for new engines.
Boeing had previously made such advertising.
So the number "787" and the Boeing logo were painted in the sky.
New low for Martin Schulz - Hannover, we have a problem
How the wind turns: when Sigmar Gabriel was still head of the SPD, social democratic prime ministers always looked to Berlin with some concern before elections.
The most important wish of the campaigners was that there should be no disturbances from the party headquarters, only no headwinds from the federal government.
Since Martin Schulz led the party, that has changed fundamentally.
Since then, the employees of the Willy-Brandt-Haus have been watching the events in the SPD-governed state capitals with growing horror.
What Schulz has received from there since the beginning of the year would not even be described with headwinds.
They were low blows.
One by one.
The Federal CDU sees the surprising end of the red-green majority in Lower Saxony as a general signal against coalitions of the SPD and the Greens.
"This shows once again that red-green simply cannot govern reliably," CDU Secretary General Peter Tauber told the editorial network Deutschland (RND).
The surprise resignation of a Green MP has plunged the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) into a serious crisis.
Five months before the state election, his red-green coalition lost its one-vote majority to the opposition from the CDU and FDP.
Greens leader Michael Kellner has called on the reclusive Lower Saxony Greens MP Elke Twesten to return her mandate.
The transition to the CDU is a clear distortion of the will of the voters.
Elke Twesten must immediately return her mandate, "the federal managing director and campaign manager of the Greens told the RedaktionsNetzwerk Deutschland (RND).
"All this must not be true," sighs one SPD campaigner, as the new message of boos reaches the party headquarters on Friday morning.
Stephan Weil, SPD Prime Minister of Lower Saxony, is without his own government majority after the transfer of the Green MP Elke Twesten to the CDU.
It is the preliminary culmination of a series of major and minor crises in SPD state associations.
And no one knows what comes next.
The plight began with the unexpectedly significant defeat in the Saarland election in March.
A blue eye, nothing more, the comrades calmed down at the time.
After the state elections in Schleswig-Holstein and North Rhine-Westphalia, everything will be different.
That became the case - and it all got much worse.
The defeat in Kiel sent the SPD tumbling, the Düsseldorf-Pleite ruined the party.
The comrades laboriously rapped up again in the weeks that followed.
Then, when they had just taken on new courage, came the G-20 summit in Hamburg.
And with him came the next low blow.
Mayor Olaf Scholz, the last strong SPD leader, lost his nimbus that weekend because he was sitting in the Elbphilharmonie while his town was burning.
And because, in crisis communication, he went on to do pretty much everything that can be done wrong.
Since then, Scholz has been fighting for his political survival.
Now Stephan Weil.
Due to the VW exhaust gas affair and his role on the supervisory board, the Prime Minister of Lower Saxony has been under criticism for some time.
Miese poll numbers were added.
Nevertheless, or perhaps precisely because of this, Weil has been trying more and more in recent weeks to set the accents in the federal government.
The desire of the former mayor of Hanover to increase his power in Berlin was not hidden from comrades around Martin Schulz.
They let him go, because they promised Weil to stabilize the party.
Now the exact opposite could happen.
At the same time, Weil is basically not to blame for the party internal conflict between the Lower Saxon Greens.
And Schulz certainly not.
For the time being, the comrades are trying to keep their own ranks closed.
Her anger is directed at the Greens, and here especially at the disgraced parliamentarian Twesten.
"It is intolerable and damaging to democracy that Ms. Twesten places her own career interests above the interests of everyone else," says Matthias Miersch, head of the party left in the SPD parliamentary group, the RedaktionsNetzwerk Deutschland (RND).
Mrs Twesten was elected to parliament not because she was a direct candidate, but on the Land list of the Lower Saxony Greens, the Lower Saxony MP added.
The logical consequence would be for her to return her mandate.
Thomas Oppermann, head of the SPD parliamentary group, complains of a "undemocratic manoeuvre."
"The will to vote four years ago was clear: the people have made Stephan Weil prime minister," Oppermann, who leads the Lower Saxony SPD as the leading candidate in the Bundestag election, tells the RND.
"Now the personal career thinking of a future CDU member distorts the election result," Oppermann continued.
He called for the background to be clarified.
I want to know whether there has been more or whether there have been further commitments from the CDU of Lower Saxony.
Funding for the town centre III
Those who want to renovate their old house will soon be able to get support from the country.
Mayor Albert Schindler and three representatives of STEG Urban Development informed about this on Wednesday in Sengen.
At the beginning of the information event, Schindler gave a review of what has happened so far.
Since 1991, there have been redevelopment areas in sensitive areas.
At the time, in the renovation area I from 1991 to 2004, the state of Baden-Wuerttemberg still took over two thirds of the funding.
In the renovation area II from 2005 to 2016, the grant was still 60 percent.
For Schindler, the previous renovations are a "success project" - after all, it is important to promote interior development as well, and not just to open up new construction areas.
On April 4, information was received from the Regional Council of Karlsruhe that there will be a redevelopment area III.
The funding amount is 833 333 euros, of which 500 000 euros would come from the country, the rest from the municipality of Sengen.
So how does a redevelopment area come into being?
According to Schindler, they will investigate where the "really old" houses are.
However, it also has a role to play whether there is any interest in the planned area to be rehabilitated.
If necessary, the territorial boundaries could then be shifted again.
The STEG represented Martin Keller, Gaby Pietzschmann and Sarah Gotzel on Wednesday evening.
Keller presented the contents of the federal and state program "social City," in which the renovations would then be carried out.
The core of the programme is the revitalization of inner cities, the improvement of living and working conditions and the maintenance and expansion of infrastructure.
The measures would be carried out on an objective basis, that is, per plot of land.
The redevelopment area would then eventually be defined as a statute.
The funding period runs from 1 January 2017 until 30 April 2026.
By September of this year, however, the inventory would be carried out, in which those involved in the rehabilitation area would receive a questionnaire to fill out.
In November or December, if possible, the articles of association are to be approved, so that the renovation work can begin next year.
Pietzschmann then explained that each municipality had to carry out the said preliminary investigations.
It is a question of assessing the shortcomings of urban planning and deciding when to renovate and to what extent.
A renovation notice will then be entered in the land register for the respective property.
She promised that Pietzschmann would come to his senses once again and get an idea of the situation.
Gotzel stressed that a key success factor for the project was the participation of the participants.
That is why there will be questionnaires that will be sent to citizens by post in the coming weeks and can be completed by the end of the summer holidays.
The yellow questionnaire is the "building and land sheet," which deals, among other things, with the building condition and the renovation plans.
In the grey questionnaire, the "household and Housing Arch," information can be given on the size, distribution and inhabitants of a living room.
The blue "operating sheet" is only to be filled if there are business premises in the building.
However, it should be noted, Gotzel pointed out, that a completed questionnaire is not a request for funding at the same time.
In addition, new construction measures are not eligible.
Schindler also stressed that the distribution of the subsidies works according to the "greyhound principle" - whoever comes first, grinds first.
You can't "reserve" funding for later.
Finally, photos of the project "centre II" were shown, in order to make a renovation "palatable" to those present.
British inventor sets himself a microchip to get into house and car with a hand movement
A British inventor is the first in the country to be fitted with a microchip so he can open his front door, enter his office and even start his car with a hand movement.
Steven Northam, 33, had the tiny chip implanted between his thumb and index finger and is now offering the service to businesses and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology through his company BioTeq.
He has joined forces with Dr Geoff Watson, a consultant anaesthetist at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester, Hants, to ensure the implant procedure is performed to medical standard.
The technology resembles a cat and dog implanted microchip and takes just 30 seconds.
Mr Northam's firm also wants to change the locks on houses and cars to be compatible with the chip, all for an extra £300 per lock.
The married father of one has now fitted technology both at home and at his BMW Z4, which starts when his hand is at the wheel.
The White House's advertising costs cost taxpayers thousands
The White House's decision to fly a Navy helicopter to the South Lawn for an event highlighting American manufacturing last month cost taxpayers as much as $24,000, according to the military, which was left to TIME magazine.
The green-and-white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One when the president is on board, was the centerpiece of the July 17 event at the White House with American construction programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and senior White House officials took a tour of products from all 50 states.
The helicopter, made in Connecticut, was displayed alongside a yacht from Maine, a fire truck from Wisconsin and a forklift from Mississippi.
The White House military office demanded the presence of the helicopter in a piecemeal order, or FRAGO, barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn, according to records from the Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for operating the helicopter.
"I just wanted you to be aware of this because it is such an unusual event with high visibility," the commander of HMX-1 wrote to his superior, the deputy naval commander for aviation, on the eve of the event.
The news indicated that the helicopter arrived on the South Lawn at around 7am on July 17 for the event at 3pm, and stayed until the lawn was cleared between 6pm and 9pm that evening.
The note adds that if the departure from the White House was to be delayed, a second crew would be needed for the return flight due to the limitation of hours of service.
The original flight crew was with the helicopter during the event, while the unit's security staff remained on the ground with the aircraft during the period.
It was not clear from records provided to TIME whether a second flight crew was ultimately required.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using state property for political purposes.
Records indicate that HMX-1 asked if the event could violate the provision.
"One question we asked was whether it was a violation of the Hatch Act and we were informed that it was not," the commander wrote.
"Sounds like you're locked up," the deputy commander replied.
The "made in America" event was designated as an official event by the White House and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act.
But official events also have political overtones.
At the event, the president gave a push for health care reform, which was underway in the Senate, and he touted efforts to curb government regulations.
The use of the aircraft, known as Marine One or Air Force One, for politically advantageous purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.
Presidents are required to use them for travel.
But to request their use only for a photo-op is unusual.
Trump conducted an investigation in February when the presidential plane was providing taxi services against the backdrop of his first campaign rally in Melbourne, Florida, and his Twitter account is full of messages complaining about his predecessor's use of the presidential plane.
"The White House is thrilled with the show" made In America "- which showcases products from all 50 states made by American workers using American materials," said White House deputy press secretary Lindsay Walters.
HMX-1 crews frequently conduct training flights in the Washington area and the South Lawn to drop the U.S. president at the White House with precise centimetres.
When Trump was at the G20 summit in Germany in early July, HMX-1 made 58 practice landings at the White House.
The flight for the "made in America" event counted on the flight crew's training needs for the month, an official said.
Helicopter units flew an additional 11 hours that day for "non-presidential support missions."
The White House said taxpayers accepted the burden for none of the other props presented at the event.
A spokesman for Sikorsky said the company was not involved in issuing the helicopter on the South Lawn.
HMX-1 does not maintain budget records for presidential flights, and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event.
However, according to U.S. Department of Defense hourly rates for the 2017 fiscal year, the DoD reimbursement rate for the VH-3D is $24,380 per hour of flight.
Records of the unit record the plane's flight time as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Facility at Quantico in Virginia.
The White House argues that the actual cost of operating the helicopter is far below that rate.
"Setting the cost to taxpayers based on the estimates for reimbursement rates is highly misleading," Walters said.
"These estimates include personnel, maintenance and many other hidden costs included in the annual funds."
According to a 2015 RAND study, the reimbursement rates for DoD do not include personnel costs, but take into account the cost of fuel, maintenance and contracting.
At the time, former White House press secretary Sean Spicer defended the helicopter's use for the event.
"The idea is to present this week things that are made in America," Spicer said.
"And I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud that they contribute to our national security, and I assume that hundreds, if not thousands, of people depend on it.
And I think, like most Americans, we're all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment that so many Americans have worked tirelessly for.
It is, of course, appropriate to emphasise this. "
It was not clear whether Trump interacted with the helicopter as he entered his tour of the South Lawn for the event, but he sat in the driver's seat of a fire truck.
At the White House, Trump addressed representatives of Sikorsky and joked with the media about his own fleet of company products.
"I know Sikorsky very well," the president said, "I have three of them."
TC BW Neuss facing tricky task
Suchsdorfer SV is one of the top players in the second division of the tennis league.
The TC Blau-Weiss Neuss will start tomorrow at 11 o'clock in Kiel at the Suchsdorfer SV table stage.
Despite a still spotless record after five matches, the second-tier tennis champion has retained a sense of reality.
Team principal Marius Zay certainly has respect for the opponent.
"This is a compact team that always plays in a fairly similar formation.
Especially on the back positions, I think the team is very good. "
Above all, imports from the far north provide class and stability for the Suchsdorfer SV.
"Their Danes and Finns can even point to stakes in the Davis Cup.
And they are also strong in doubles, "says Zay, looking at Harri Heliovaara (Finland), Andre Göransson (Sweden), Sören and Esben Olesen, Martin Pedersen and Andreas Bjerrehus (all Denmark).
"As always, this will be difficult for us.
You need a good dose of luck. "
The Neuss team for the trip to the far north is handy.
Maxime Janvier could make his Blue White debut.
If the Frenchman, who is currently still active in the Challenger tournament in Biella, does not make it to the Bundesliga match, Zdenek Kolar (Czech Republic), who is playing in the tournament in Liberec, Czech Republic, will make his first bet this season.
The previously undefeated Chilean Hans Podlipnik-Castillo was on the ball yesterday with the Belarussian Andrei Vasilevski at the ATP tournament in Kitzbühel.
But he should be in Kiel as well as Botic Van de Zandschulp, Niels Lootsma (both Netherlands) and the Belgian Julien Cagnina.
After his two victories last Sunday against the club at the Alster, Máté Valkusz could join the team again.
If it is not enough for the 18-year-old Hungarian, who was still number one in the junior world rankings in January 2016, someone from the coaching staff around Marius Zay will fill up the squad.
How America Can Damage OMV
Donald Trump was not really happy when he signed the law tightening sanctions against Russia on Wednesday evening.
"In its haste to enact the law," Congress packed in a few "unconstitutional regulations," he estimated.
The reaction from Moscow was also as sharp as expected, and even Brussels was ashamed of the U.S. move.
After all, the draft provides for punishing European companies that help Russians build gas pipelines into the EU.
Investors in the domestic OMV, which, together with other European companies, is co-funding the construction of the Russian Baltic pipeline Nord Stream 2, have been correspondingly worried since then.
The threat level is huge.
However, it is too early to assess the consequences, according to the official statement of the oil company.
In fact, Donald Trump himself would still have to bring the sanctions to life by executive order.
He has twelve weapons to choose from.
"The Press" looked at which the corporation could fend off and which could really hurt it.
Narcos season 3 trailer: without Pablo Escobar, the Cali Cartel will take centre stage in Netflix's hit series
Despite the second season of Narcos, which reveals Pablo Escobar's killer, Netflix's series is far from over.
Seasons three and four have already been confirmed by the streaming service, the first receiving its first trailer and showing the show's latest villains.
With its third season, the DEA has turned its attention to the world's richest drug trafficking organization: the Cali-Kartell.
Led by four powerful punters, they operate "like a Fortune 500 company" only with more government bribery and violent actions.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) is the leader of the cartel, Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) is their head, Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) commands the Mexican connection, and Chepe Santacruz Londono (Pepe Rapazote) is in New York.
In the newly released trailer, Pedro Pascal returns as Javier Peña, the type who invites U.S. and Colombian law enforcement agencies to support the war on drugs.
Other new actors include Matias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishe and Arturo Castro.
The third season of Narcos will begin on September 1.
Roll back: the city is hiring 46 kitchen aids
The city organises the kite lunch table itself.
With permanent contact for the children and an assignment to the team.
In the city nurseries, the clock is turned back.
On 1 September, the city of Krefeld will once again take over the food supply in the city's day-care centres (Kitas) on its own.
For Sonja Pommeranz, Deputy Head of Youth Aid, this is good news: "we were all very pleased."
The food is still cooked outside the house: a caterer takes on this task and delivers freshly cooked food chilled.
The city operates 46 day-care centres in the Krefeld area, and in 44 children receive a warm meal at lunchtime.
Last year, 2800 children sat at the tables, and the demand is constantly growing.
"In the meantime, it is not only children who are cared for 45 hours a week who eat lunch at the Kita," explains Pommeranz.
"The offer also applies to 35-hour care if children stay until 2pm."
As of 1 September, 46 part-time workers will have a kitchen service: they will warm up the food supplied, supplement it with salad, raw food and fruit, portioning the meal individually, dispensing the food, clearing away, rinsing and cleaning the kitchen.
"The employees are firmly assigned to a nursery," says Pommeranz.
The size - there are two groups as well as seven groups - determines the number of hours.
"The kitchen assistants are now firmly part of the Kita-Team," says Pommeranz satisfied.
"So they are much more involved and it is easier for the management to implement pedagogical concepts."
Because that's also what it's all about: healthy eating and cooking classes.
"The children should help prepare the food."
The direct connection of the kitchen power to the team makes sense.
Also for the children.
"They have a known force in the Kita, a person familiar to them, and not constantly changing people."
This continuity is important for the children.
The cleaning of the kita rooms - previously also the task of the kitchen staff - will in future be carried out by special cleaning staff.
This variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - has not only the improvement of the quality of the kitchen service, but also the charm, which it has proved to be the most economical for the city in comparison with the cost of ownership and outsourcing, according to the press office.
This is despite the fact that 46 part-time workers are being recruited.
"But these hours don't really matter so much to about 750 people in the field of education," says Sonja Pommeranz.
Afghan democracy depends on women's political role, U.N. says
Elections can only be representative if all members of society, including women, play a role, said the head of the U.N. mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday.
Nicholas Haysom, acting head of the United Nations mission, said hundreds of women will run in provincial council elections, with three women running for the role of vice-president and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters being women.
"The role of women cannot be overestimated," he said in a statement on Wednesday.
Elections can only be truly representative and credible if women participate fully and are involved in all parts of the electoral process.
Afghan elections for the provincial council and presidential elections will take place on April 5.
The Taliban have issued threats against an electoral process that coincides with the transition from international combat to an advisory role.
This year, for the first time, the elections will pass power peacefully from one democratically elected government to the next.
Haysom said a strong role for women will add to Afghanistan's democratic success.
The Afghan Independent Electoral Commission reports that 1.2 million women are registered out of a total of 3.6 million registered voters.

Men try to rob 13-year-old girl
Two young men, aged 19 and 23, allegedly tried to rob a 13-year-old girl on Thursday.
According to police information, the men approached the 13-year-old, who was staying with friends on Kolping Street, about 2.55pm because they wanted to phone the girl's cell phone.
However, the 13-year-old refused the request and went on with her friends.
One of the offenders then tried to grab the girl's cell phone and necklace, but this failed.
Without loot, the duo fled.
The two young men were later arrested by the police.
The investigation is ongoing.
GMB concerns over investment at McVitie factory in Glasgow
A union wants to check with managers of the biscuit maker McVitie about the long-term commitment to production at its Glasgow plant.
GMB Scotland said the company had remained silent about the future of investment at the Tollcross site.
More than 500 employees work at the plant, which produces Hobnobs and Rich Tea biscuits, among other products.
McVities owner Pladis said he had invested more than £5 million in recent years.
He added that employees and union representatives would be "the first to find out" if their activities changed.
In a letter to the company's branch manager, GMB Scotland urged McVitie's to "raise concerns that funding for the modernisation of production lines is not being driven forward."
GMB senior organiser Drew Duffy said: "the fact that we cannot gain clarity from the general site manager about the business needs and investment plans for the future of Tollcross deeply affects our members.
Generations of families have worked here and the workforce is heavily concentrated in the local community and Greater Glasgow, an important pillar of decent employment in an area of high unemployment and social deprivation.
Therefore, from the perspective of jobs, pay and prosperity, and against the backdrop of Brexit, rising living costs and chronic production decline, the east end of Glasgow desperately needs a thriving manufacturing presence at McVitie. "
A Pladis spokeswoman said: "the branch manager at Tollcross only received a letter from GMB Scotland yesterday and the company will respond directly as we value continued engagement with staff and union representatives.
Two months ago, we had a regular meeting with staff and GMB representatives at Tollcross, where some issues were discussed openly.
We discussed with the employees that, like all companies operating in a highly competitive and uncertain economic climate, we are constantly reviewing our business - and this applies to all our divisions and locations - in order to remain competitive.
She added: "in recent years we have invested more than £5 million in our Tollcross site, particularly in production lines and operational improvements.
We fully recognise the heritage of Tollcross as a manufacturing site. Should our operations at the site change, employees and their union representatives will be the first to know. "
Did PSG warn Barcelona about Neymar three years ago?
La Liga side may regret their interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain will not let up in their pursuit of Neymar after making a £189m bid to trigger his release clause, but did they warn Barcelona of the world record raid three years ago?
The sensational approach has fuelled the summer transfer window as the Ligue 1 club are poised to break the world record by more than double the previous mark, with Paul Pogba returning to Manchester United for £89 million last season.
After finishing, Neymar will become the world's most expensive player and the highest-paid professional sportsman in the world, with PSG offering wages of more than £500,000 a week.
Barcelona are furious at the way Neymar has forced his way out, although a source close to the Catalan board insists the club have always been at their best to look after him since he arrived from Santos in 2013.
But was the football world warned of this prospect by the PSG president three years ago?
When Manchester City expressed interest in signing Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi had a stern warning for any club that wanted to sign one of PSG's best players.
"I'm not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players, then we will be in opposition to them, we will contact their players," Al-Khelaifi said.
"We respect all the clubs.
But if they try to have one of our players sign with them, there will be consequences. "
Barcelona appear to have crossed that line, with the Spanish club expressing interest in PSG midfielder Marco Verratti earlier this summer.
PSG made it clear they would not allow the Italy international to leave under any circumstances and Barcelona could feel the consequences of that interest by losing one of their price offers to Neymar.
Scooter thrown over and damaged
During the night from Friday to Saturday, an unknown offender deliberately overturned a scooter parked in Königsfelder Strasse in front of the number 30 estate, causing more than 200 euros in damage to the vehicle's cladding.
Police Schramberg, phone 07422/27 01-0, are appealing for information.
Police are looking for witnesses to an accident on the B 215 between Stolzenau and Leese.
Because a car came towards him in his lane, the driver of a VW Touran had to evade and hit the guardrail.
On Thursday evening, the 34-year-old from Rehburg-Loccum was travelling in the direction of Leese with his VW on the B 215 from Stolzenau at around 7.55pm.
In the area of the bypass of Stolzenau, a car came towards him in his lane, so he had to turn to the right.
At the same time, the Touran driver touched the control panel.
Property damage was caused to the car.
The driver of the oncoming car, a Mercedes Benz, had overtaken a lorry and continued his journey without taking care of the road accident.
According to the accident victim, it may well be that the Mercedes driver did not even notice the accident.
The police are now appealing for witnesses to the incident, as well as the driver of the cause vehicle, to contact the commissioner's office in Stolzenau on tel. + 49 (0) 5761/92060.
Interview: "Domspatzen report relieves papal brother Georg Ratzinger"
The Regensburg Domspatzen report on the cases of abuse relieves Papst-Bruder Georg Ratzinger.
This is the opinion of author and historian Michael Hesemann.
The final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen continues to provoke discussion.
Christian Weisnder, spokesman for the reform movement "we are Church," said after publication to the German Press Agency that he expected an apology from the former Bishop of Regensburg and now Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller, as well as from the master of the cathedral, Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of the emeritus Pope Benedict XVI.
It would greatly benefit the reputation of the Catholic Church if Müller and Ratzinger expressed their deep regret at their own omissions or their then incorrect assessment of the events.
The Vatican newspaper "Osservatore Romano," on the other hand, criticised "double standards" in the reporting of violence in the cathedral's patron saints.
With regard to the attacks in Regensburg, no one doubts that they are "shameful and shameful acts" that must be punished and prevented in the future, but the "degree of media manipulation" is striking, said the author Lucetta Scaraffia, a historian and member of the Italian national bioethics committee.
"The habit of calling the Catholic Church the source of all evils is already part of everyday experience and prepares public opinion to consider it normal," Scaraffia writes.
In an interview with Bayerischer Rundfunk, Princess Gloria von Thurn und Taxis also said: "you like to go to church and that's a feast you can find."
She also pointed out that, in her youth, "beating was a perfectly normal educational means" to deal with cheeky children, like I was one. "
It would be unfair to apply today's standards to previous decades, because the world has changed.
In connection with the reports of the cases of abuse, papal brother Georg Ratzinger often appeared.
Author and historian Michael Hesemann, who wrote the book "my Brother the Pope" (translated into 12 languages) with Ratzinger, is completely wrong.
"I have to protect Georg Ratzinger," says Hesemann, "because all this had nothing to do with him," he assesses the results of the final report.
What exactly does the 440-page report by the lawyer Ulrich Weber, commissioned by the diocese of Regensburg with the Enlightenment, contain?
A total of 547 Regensburger Domspatzen were sexually abused between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s "with high plausibility" victims of attacks, 67 Domspatzen.
The final report says about Georg Ratzinger, who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994: "to sum up, it can be said that in many cases, Domkapellmeister R. used forms of physical and psychological violence.
Especially with high emotionality, the punishment for the students could be more severe.
Nevertheless, in contrast to many other defendants, it is noticeable that many victims appreciated the general humanity of R. and therefore, in many cases, despite violence, even have positive memories with him. "
In an interview, Hesemann explains why, in his opinion, the final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen relieves Georg Ratzinger.
Mr Hesemann, the 440-page report on the "incidents of violence against defendants at the Regensburger Domspatzen" gives a contradictory picture of the master of the cathedral, Georg Ratzinger.
For one thing, many students highlight his "humanity."
On the other hand, he also appears as a choleric and perfectionist, who often became handy when a cathedral set did not perform well musically.
How do you, as his biographer, view this final report?
Michael Hesemann: if you take the trouble to read the entire 440 page report from the front to the back, you have to ask yourself why the name Georg Ratzinger actually appears in it.
Just eight pages are devoted to him and he is clearly acquitted of any suspicion of complicity or complicity in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.
The violence at the preschool also occurred outside his sphere of influence.
At best, he can be accused of having learned of it too late or of not having taken the first hints seriously enough.
The Domspatzengymnasium, on which he worked, was perceived by virtually all respondents as - so literally - "redemption," "heaven" and "better world."
For example, the vast majority of his pupils Georg Ratzinger gives an excellent testimony, describing him as "warm-hearted," "popular," "sincere," "competent" and "understanding," an extremely good-natured teacher who regularly provided the boys with cakes, biscuits and sweets and was "always surrounded by grapes from children."
Only a minority complains about his perfectionism and his high level of emotionality, which has led to outbursts of rage.
He himself admitted years ago, deeply regretted and apologized for the fact that he not only cracked chairs and threw the keychain on the floor, but also distributed slaps and pulled all too cheeky boys by the hair or ears.
To save his honour, however, it must be said that such methods of education were widespread in the period in question, the 1960s and 1970s, both among parents and teachers.
Do you also know such methods of chastisement?
Of course, I think every one of us born before 1968.
I, too, experienced this in a secular school, a state high school.
However, compared to what this report is actually about, namely the appalling sexual abuse and violence at preschool, these are trivial matters.
One wonders if it is not more to do with his notoriety and his role as the brother of Benedict XVI that a lot of the media were rushing towards him.
Many of those who have never understood him are still working diligently on the Bavarian pope.
But the truth is that the report relieves Georg Ratzinger in every respect!
A great deal has been reported in the media in connection with the report on the subject of abuse at the Regensburger Domspatzen.
In the final report, will Georg Ratzinger also be accused of any involvement or complicity with regard to sexual abuse?
Michael Hesemann: clearly no.
Not a single one of the 67 victims of sexual assault claims to have confided in the Cathedral Chapel Master.
Not even the parents were consecrated.
"I never dared to talk to my father or my mother about it," said one of those concerned, speaking on behalf of the others, "it was all very embarrassing to me."
The real problem with clearing up sexual abuse was, and still is, that most victims remain silent out of shame.
If they did not even entrust themselves to parents and siblings, then certainly not to a choir director, who would have been, in a way, a colleague of the perpetrators professionally.
How do the Domspatzen-Students rate Ratzinger's role in relation to the cases of abuse?
Michael Hesemann: as one student in question put it: "with regard to sexual abuse... I do not see... A case in which he (Georg Ratzinger) of all people would have had timely knowledge and could have stopped the respective perpetrator.
I think it is... Also really absurd to assume that it is him, of all people... Boys have become more intrusive, clearer or even more open, than to their parents, boarding school leaders, confidence teachers, etc.
That you talk to him about sex... - unthinkable. "
Thus, the report comes to the very clear conclusion: "it was not possible to confirm in the course of the investigation that pupils and / or their surroundings were entrusted to him in advance."
As far as sexual abuse is concerned, Georg Ratzinger must therefore be exempted from any complicity.
In this way, he cannot be accused of not having prevented him or brought him to trial.
Therefore, there is no reason to associate his good name with these abominable crimes, as has unfortunately happened in some cases.
Much has been said in the media about "excesses of violence" at the Regensburger Domspatzen.
The report accuses the former master of the cathedral, Georg Ratzinger, of "looking the other way."
Does he have to live with this accusation?
Michael Hesemann: that is the big problem, that in the reporting everything was mixed and mixed into a huge melange of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere, in the middle of it, Georg Ratzinger.
But that, in turn, is an abuse of the report.
There is a clean separation: between the preschool and the grammar school of the cathedral patrons, between sexual abuse and violence and, let us say, other allegations.
In addition, the report deals with incidents from the period since 1945, also from four decades in which Georg Ratzinger was not the choir director of the Domspatzen.
All the terrible caning pedagogy, the cases in which boys were really harassed and maltreated by sadistic teachers and suffered horribly, all occurred at the preschool in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where truly scandalous conditions must have prevailed.
But Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do with them, because he only saw the boys when they were already at the Domspatzengymnasium.
On that, as most witnesses point out, the subject of "preschool" was taboo.
One was only happy to have escaped her and enjoyed so much better treatment and, for many, even "paradise" conditions.
What was different at the Domspatzengymnasium?
Michael Hesemann: there was discipline, but no sadistic violence.
And this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, where the report concludes that "many victims appreciated the general humanity of R. and therefore, in many cases, despite violence, even have positive memories with him."
At most, there remains the accusation of having looked the other way.
But despite all the efforts, the report was able to define only two periods in which it was told of the conditions at the preschool.
The first time in 1970/71, when he was just beginning to establish himself and did not want to hear about the events at a school where he did not work and was responsible (according to the witness), and then again around 1993.
Did Georg Ratzinger consistently close his ears to the conditions?
Michael Hesemann: no, because back in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Domspatzengymnasium, which the report even reproduces.
In it, he points out that "caning continues to be practised in the preschool."
Already in view of the danger of negative press releases, he recommended urgent intervention.
This was, of course, at a time when there was legal clarity, when caning sentences had long been banned in Bavaria, too.
Before that, they occurred in a legal grey area, as we all know.
For him, too, it was difficult to estimate where those affected might have been exaggerated or dramatised and where the permissible limit had really been exceeded.
But you can't say he always looked the other way.
That is simply not true.
It was not until 1980 that caning at schools in Bavaria was officially abolished.
Princess Gloria von Thurn und Taxis claimed that it was unfair to apply today's pedagogical standards to the time.
How do you see it?
Michael Hesemann: we historians are talking about the "pitfall of anachronism," that is, the danger of judging the past according to today's moral standards.
The princess is right.
But this does not, of course, apply to sexual abuse, which was abominable at all times, nor to what was breached in the preschool of adversity and violence against innocent children's souls, which goes far beyond what was common at the time.
It's all very horrible and I'm glad it's finally being worked up.
But at the same time I have to protect Georg Ratzinger, because all this had nothing to do with him.
His means of disciplining and punishing, that is to say, slapping and pulling his hair and ears, were widespread in the 1970s.
When corporal punishment was then banned, he also strictly adhered to it.
What image of his time in Regensburg did Georg Ratzinger give in his talks with you for the book "my Brother the Pope"?
Did the subject of caning also come up?
Michael Hesemann: well, the book is about the life of his brother Joseph, that is, Pope Benedict XVI, tells from his perspective that the cathedral patrons played only a minor role.
Nevertheless, I do not hide the fact that he led a strict regiment there.
But this, too, must be said: without this perfectionism, without demanding absolute discipline, it would hardly have been possible for him to transform the hitherto rather nationally known Regensburg cathedral patrons into an institution of world renown, true cultural ambassadors of Europe and its musical tradition, which went on tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).
With biscuits and sweets alone, you do not turn rebellious boys into great singers and stand before every success, regardless of the field, but always discipline, passion and self-overcoming.
What kind of person did you see Georg Ratzinger talking about her book?
Michael Hesemann: through the work on the book and beyond, I really got to know Georg Ratzinger very well and experienced time and time again as a wonderful, humorous, good-natured, deeply believing and heart-good person, of whom it is impossible to imagine that he could do anything to a fly.
I regularly hear how many former cathedral patrons still maintain regular contact with him, visit him, read to him - he is almost blind - and treat him like a member of their family, 23 years after his retirement.
So those who still do not forgive him for once being strict with them are clearly in the minority.
Most cathedral patrons today are grateful to him for enriching their lives and bringing the world of music to them.
And that he was always a good, paternal teacher - a strict father, of course, that may be - but also a lovely person of respect, to which they still look up today and which they almost worship.
And please, let me be very clear: all he is accused of are methods of education, which were the order of the day at the time.
We can be glad that we have long since overcome this time.
But it is most unfair to make a man a media scapegoat simply because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother.
The evil intent behind it is all too obvious.
Because the report that has just been published relieves him.
Now the decency would dictate that a 93-year-old man, who has earned great merits and without whom no one outside Bavaria and perhaps even Germany would know the Regensburg Cathedral patron saints, should finally be left in peace.
