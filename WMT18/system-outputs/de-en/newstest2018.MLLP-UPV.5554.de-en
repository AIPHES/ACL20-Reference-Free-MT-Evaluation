Munich 1856: Four cards that change your view of the city
A makeshift institution where young people are supposed to meet today.
A pit chapel where is now being dug for the S-Bahn tunnel.
Small gardeners manage the former ground of farmers.
The oldest official map of Munich promotes exciting stories.
It annoys if maps are not up-to-date.
Everyone knows that, because the Auto-Navi showed a green meadow instead of a bypass.
The historical maps of the digital Bavarian atlases, an offer of the geoportal Bavaria of the state government, are far from current - but for this very reason very revealing.
Especially if you compare them with current online cards.
Then it becomes clear how cities and municipalities in the distribution area of Munich Mercury have changed since the 19th century.
The digital Bayern Atlas is a patchwork that cannot be recognized as such.
More detailed maps, so-called primal position sheets, have been incorporated into the large overview map for cities and municipalities.
According to the Bayerische Vermessungsverwaltung, these originated between 1810 and 1864 and originated from the first survey of Bavaria.
Your principal: Napoleon.
The French army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria.
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a topographical recording of Bavaria - for military purposes, of course.
Even though the French troops finally departed with the peace of Lunéville of February 9, 1801: It was today's neighbors who created the idea of a nationwide Bavarian map.
Kurfürst Max IV. Joseph continued to drive the project forward, founded the "Topographical Bureau" - and thus the Bavarian surveying administration.
The original position sheet for Munich dates back to 1856 and, like all others, can be found on the website of the Bayerische Landesbibliothek.
The comparison Early / Today is most impressive by the example of the state capital.
The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.
An example of this is Untersendling, which appears relatively isolated in the map of 1856.
Sendling was founded 21 years after the creation of the map, that is, in 1877, as a district of Munich.
Today, Untersendling lies in the middle of the city.
The houses of Untersendlings are concentrated around 1856 along the current Plinganserstraße, which was named only in 1878 after Georg Sebastian Plinganser, a leader of the uprising of the Bavarian peasants against Austria in 1705.
Where the Westpark is today, you can see nothing but fields - at first glance: When zooming in, a smaller map with dozens of lines and numbers appears: Handwritten numbered flurry pieces from the so-called "primeval" from which the estate tax was derived.
Small plots no longer occupy farmers there today - but small gardeners of the plant "Land in Sun."
A large green area stands out north of Untersendling.
The Theresienwiese, the scene of the Oktoberfest since 1810, was in fact still a meadow in the 19th century - and no concrete desert.
On the other side of the Isar, the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.
In the area of the current district of Au-Haidhausen, one reads not only the street name "at the Gasteig" or the elevation "On the ventilation" - but also in large letters "Irren Anstalt."
Yes, here at Auerfeldstraße, people were once locked in with delusions.
In 1858 / 59 the Munich-Kreis-Irrenanstalt "On the Auer Lüften" was created.
From 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden led the institution - that psychiatrist brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II.
'he was progressive for his time and, for example, ended the chains of so-called errands.
He also banned the staff from using violence against the occupants, "says Hermann Wilhelm, head of the Haidhausen Museum, who has been involved with the institution for an exhibition.
There had initially been room for 280 patients, later expanded to 500 places.
At some point this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the Kreisirrenanstalt in Haar 1905.
Since 2006, the Isar-Amper-Klinik München-Ost, one of Germany's largest psychiatrists, has been located there.
Young people now meet in the Salesianum in Munich on the site of the former Auer Anstalt.
The Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and converted it into a youth home with training facilities.
To the west lies the football field of the TSV Munich East, east residential buildings dating back to the 1980s.
In 2015, the children's house "Casa Don Bosco" was built in an architectural style based on the original building of the Irrenanstalt, which had been destroyed in bomb attacks during the Second World War.
The Marienplatz was listed as "Main Square" around 1856, the Kaufingerstraße was called "Kaufinger Gasse."
The Second World War also brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich.
The Allied bombs ripped many holes into the city centre in December 1944.
A big one remained to this day - at the Marienhof.
The English Institute, small business houses and a mine chapel from the Middle Ages once stood at the Marienhof, where these days the preparatory work takes place and on April 5, 2017 the groundbreaking ceremony for the second main railway line.
With the slider, the old Munich map can be compared to the aerial image of today - and the hole at the Marienhof can be filled up.
Civil rights group releases travel warning for Missouri
The National Association for the Promotion of Farmers has issued a warning for people of color who travel to Missouri due to the state's discriminatory policies and racist attacks.
"The NAACP Travel Advisory for the State of Missouri, which is due to enter into force by August 28, 2017, calls on African-American travelers, visitors and Missourians to pay special attention when traveling through the state and to exercise extreme caution, as a number of questionable, race-based incidents have recently occurred across the state and be noted here," the group's opinion reads.
A recently passed Missouri law that makes it harder for people to win discrimination lawsuits, as well as the state's law enforcement agencies that disproportionately target minorities, prompted the group to issue the travel warning, the NAACP said.
'They've got civil rights violations that happen to people.
They are stopped because of their skin color, they are beaten up or killed, "Missouri NAACP president Rod Chapel told the Kansas City Star.
'we're hearing complaints in such frequency that we haven't heard yet. '
It is the first such warning issued by the Organization for a State in the US.
The group cited incidents such as racist offenses against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died in questionable circumstances earlier in the year after he no longer had gasoline during the trip through the state and was taken into custody by Missouri police without being accused of a crime.
The council also points to a recent report by the Missouri Attorney General's Office showing that black motorists in the state are 75 percent more likely to be stopped than whites.
"The recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families, friends and staff about what might happen in Missouri," Chapel said.
'People need to be ready whether it's bringing bail money or letting relatives know they're traveling through the state. '
Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest figures from the FBI's hate crime reporting program, which ranks the state 16th in the country in terms of the number of such injuries.
The travel warning is also a response to a new Missouri law that would make it harder to sue a company for housing or employment discrimination.
Earlier, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) had issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after states passed immigration laws requiring local law enforcement to arrest people for immigration violations, which the ACLU says will help further racial profiling.
Travel warnings are usually issued by the State Department for other countries, but lately advocacy groups have used the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the U.S.
Weidezaunproject is elementary
The Fischerbacher Weidezaun project is a success project and will continue in the coming year.
CDU federal MPs Peter White and Kordula Kovac took a picture on the spot.
At the right-hand grave of the Schwendemann family, representatives of the Fischerbacher CDU local association met with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two deputies.
Markus Schwendemann initially provided insights into his farm, where he farms 55 acres of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, supplies 40 dairy cows and just as many kittens, and hosts holiday guests in five apartments.
For him, "Black Forest milk" is the alternative marketing route for the milk of his cows, according to Schwendemann.
On the table of the holiday guests comes exclusively regional.
Since he is also BLHV chairman of Fischer bach, he described the WeidezaunProject as "elementary important."
I cannot operate profitably on such steep areas.
The green area provides a lot of work, a lot of things have to be worked on with the engine sense.
"We are struggling with the conditions and topography here," Schwendemann pointed out.
In 2003 he took over the parental farm and managed it without chemical plant protection and fertilizer, even if he did not run a biofarm.
For Mayor Thomas Schneider, it was clear: "The Commune has recognized the importance of the Weidezaunproject and is pleased with the leadership support."
Farmers would have to be supported at a cost of between EUR 3000 and EUR 4000 per hectare.
It is hoped that the reforestation of the land could be extended for quite a while.
"The biggest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and think about how to continue their operations," the mayor pointed out.
Farmers often face criticism for promotion
In 2013, a total of 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced in via the Weidezaunförderung.
The area of disclosure is therefore 40 hectares, which must not be reforested until at least 2023.
Of the total cost of EUR 71 500, half were supported by leaders, and one quarter was carried by the municipality of Fischbach.
Thus, the farmers remained 12 610 euros, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometers of grazing fence.
"The big advantage is the longevity of the fences," Schwendemann explained.
Kordula Kovac stressed: "You're doing a really good job, without farmers and rural women it's not going."
For Peter White, too, it was clear: "This is where the best food is produced."
The Landscape Liability Directive (LPR) Baden-Württemberg makes it possible for the state to promote grazing fences.
The aim is to keep the Black Forest open.
A prerequisite is the presence of a funding backdrop designated by the LPR.
In addition, the area to be fenced must not be manageable (slope above 35 percent) and must therefore be threatened by afforestation.
For the Fischerbacher WeidezaunProject 2018, the application is currently underway for eight participants with 24 plots looking to build just under 16 kilometres of fence.
The disclosure area corresponds to 35 hectares, the calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros.
Is nothing more sacred?
Now the Trump White House is taking the Statue of Liberty
The safest sign of a regime change is when they start attacking the statues.
The Americans appreciate this as much as any other - hence the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein in Firdos Square in Baghdad in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the Trump regime's key ideologues, certainly knew what he was doing when he took a symbolic axe in a heated dispute with CNN's Jim Acosta over the president's proposals to drastically restrict legal immigration with him to the Statue of Liberty.
To stay fair, Miller didn't attack the statue himself.
A horde of boat owners and Liberty imitators would have lynched him if he had done it.
But he seized on its significance, and in particular the importance attributed to it when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus was added to its base in 1903, 17 years after the monument was completed.
When Miller mocked Acosta, "I don't want to go into a complete thing about history here, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the world.
The poem you refer to, which was later added and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty. '
Miller is factually correct, but as he put it himself, it's not really about history.
It's about the contemporary resonance to the stirring words of Lazarus, the only one in which a state not only invites any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "Your efforts, your poor, / your beleaguered masses yearning to breathe freely, / the elusive waste of your rich coasts"
There was never a time when the "miserable waste" was better to see on our screens.
Miller wasn't engaged in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people are not welcome in Trump's US.
This conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural dispute: It is, in fact, a conflict over the importance of America.
Lazarus - and her friends who campaigned to place their words at the base after her death - knew very well that they were performing a highly political act.
The sculpture was intended to show the connections between French and American republicanism by depicting the female embodiment of freedom in a worn-out classical visual representation.
Lazarus changed that meaning: In her poem, the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice.
And she gives herself a very different name: Mother of the exiles.
The poem's connection with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American nativism.
And just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, people from the right wing wanted to change this back for a long time.
The great screeching Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John of the Baptist for the Coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty was not inviting anyone, but rather an early neo-conservative, bringing the American flame to the revered world: "Lady Liberty is moving forward.
It is supposed to carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
The torch is not meant to illuminate the path to the United States. "
Rather unusually, Limbaugh has come across something here.
The significance of the statue is entirely a matter of the point of view of perception.
The great imaginative deed of Lazarus was to see it the way it was seen by the exhausted, elusive but hopeful people after long and often terrible journeys on the decks of ships.
It is, in the truest sense, about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives.
Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome they must hear.
And that, of course, is not the perspective that Miller and Trump would ever want to acknowledge.
Their torch is not meant to light the way, but to ignite the hatred that is their only source of power.
World Cup 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish members of UK team
Eilidh Doyle recalls a time when only two Scots belonged to the UK team
UK athletics performance director Neil Black says the 16-strong Scottish contingent in the World Cup squad will "make a massive contribution to the team."
A record number of Scottish athletes have been selected for London 2017, which kicks off on Friday.
Black believes that "something special is developing in Scotland" and the UK's athletics needs to learn something from it.
"We welcome it, and we're trying to understand it, and we're going to carry it on until we figure it out," Black said.
'i'm talking to people at the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they've done.
The Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they've done.
British athletics: It has something to do with what they've done.
And also with the type on the street corner.
Whatever the combination of circumstances, it's absolutely brilliant. '
Several of the Scottish athletes are medal contenders, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m track, while Eilidh Doyle was voted team captain by the squad.
'Eilidh is pretty modest.
Her captain's speech was incredible, "Black says.
'a number of athletes, whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train, went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated.
The passion and the real feeling that Eilidh brought in naturally was great. "
The Commonwealth silver medal winner, who will compete at the 400m hurdles at her fifth world championships, says it is "incredible" that 16 Scots are in the British squad.
Scotland's best total number of athletes at the World Cup so far was seven, achieved in 1983 and 2015.
Middle-distance runner Muir leads along this path, setting five British and two European records last year.
It will take part in the 1,500 m and 5,000 m runs.
Chris O'Hare, who runs 1,500 metres, is another Scot to watch after a superb season that included victory at the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games.
Doyle remembers her first world championships when the only other Scot in the team was Lee McConnell.
The team captain says she is "enormously proud" of the fact that many of her compatriots not only belong to the team, but in some cases will also be involved in the medals and the finals.
"The special thing about being a team captain is that she was chosen by the other members of the team, so it was a great honour anyway, but knowing that my teammates voted for me and elected me makes it something very special for me," she added.
'Apparently I'm very proud of all the Scots who belong to the team.
It just shows how far we've come.
And they're here as established athletes, athletes who want to rise to podiums.
As for my speech as a captain?
Yeah, I think she went well.
I just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home World Cup.
So it's really important to put on that home support and benefit from being back at the Olympic Stadium.
I get a second chance to go out there and compete and it's just going to be such a great atmosphere out there. '
Blocking critics via Facebook: Don't advertise for public office if you can't tolerate cunning voters
The father of our country knew something of bad press.
Americans loved George Washington, but it didn't take long for newspapers to beat him for everything from domestic politics to his political principles.
He simmered at the criticism, for sure.
But he has not silenced his critics.
Because in 1783, Washington said, "freedom of speech can be taken away - and, stupid and blunt, we are led to slaughter like the sheep."
That brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan, who has to work on being more like Washington.
Hogan's staff have blocked and deleted the posts of at least 450 people who have expressed their opinions on his official Facebook page.
And the American Civil Liberties Union sued him for that earlier this week.
The governor's staff dismissed the lawsuit as frivol, and the online comment was full of a backlash with "Na, and?."
"It's just Facebook," a lot of people said.
But it's important.
And it's especially important when it's a guy like Hogan.
This is a Republican governor in an overwhelmingly Democratic state that is astonishingly popular.
He has the second highest approval of the nation's 50 governors.
Hogan is not a reactionary heat head.
He has shown a firm hand in running his state and strict adherence to principles.
He was also very adept at using Facebook as a primary means to connect with his constituents and playfully debrief his hairless head after chemotherapy on his page.
Therefore, blocking people who come to the governor's side - which is a public forum called official and paid by employees with public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan's spokeswoman Amelia Chasse defended the governor's actions, arguing that blocking the comments was nothing short of a moderation.
But it's too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hateful people swinging the whip online.
The Post spoke to some of the real people blocked by Hogan.
And these are just real people talking to their elected leaders: A teacher, an entrepreneur and a pageant, no trolls.
They all said their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not profan.
The pastor cited the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogan's Catholic faith.
Attorney Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., was not hateful, but she asked about hate crimes.
"I politely commented that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other current news," she wrote in the comments section of the news show "The Post."
'i don't appreciate this idea either, if a number of people take a stand on the same issue, then some disregard it as a so-called collective effort rather than being recognised as a large group of affected citizens. '
What the governor's staff described as a "concentrated spam attack," others would likely call "advocacy."
The Facebook era makes it easy to tailor a message by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment.
It's much cleaner than in earlier times, if you had done the same thing, that staff were dispatched to collect and burn newspapers with critical editorial items, or arrest and silence protesters.
But that is exactly what is happening digitally.
Hogan is not the first public official to be criticized for mocking Facebook and other social media.
President Trump is being sued by Twitter users who have been blocked from his Twitter feed.
One of the first milestones on the issue fell last week in Virginia.
The chairman of the Loudoun County Board of Supervisors violated the First Amendment, according to U.S. District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when she banished a voter from her Facebook page.
And in Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit from the ACLU because of his use of Facebook and Twitter.
That shouldn't be that hard.
At the time of Washington, the time of affordable porn had a similar effect to the internet.
The number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letter writers hit out at his leadership.
And even then, Washington had anonymous trolls.
The people who used pseudonyms like "Juricola," "Valerius," "Belisarius" and "Portius" all wrote letters to newspapers that made Washington's decisions.
Petitions critical of his position on Amity's contract, trade and shipping with Britain overwhelmed his office, according to the historical documents collected by the George Washington Project's Online Papers.
But he didn't silence them.
Freedom of speech, disagreement and discourses are the foundation of our nation.
And true leadership means accepting that.
Ronan Rafferty hopes for home comforts at Renaissance club
Former European No 1 Ronan Rafferty will be hoping for domestic comfort over the next three days as the Renaissance Club in East Lothian hosts the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open.
The Nordire, who led links to the final round last year next door at Archerfield before losing against Paul Eales, is linked to the new venue and acts as a tournament ambassador on behalf of the club's founder and CEO Jerry Sarvadi.
"I've seen the Renaissance club built, and we're seeing him achieve his fame with this event," Rafferty said.
'the players will see this course from his best side, he's in a great state.
Jerry did a great job when he set this place.
He's a ferocious advocate of this game and is proud of his performance here.
This is a great showcase for this course. "
The Englishman Eales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time, despite winning both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour in his 32-year career.
"This feels really special," said the Southport-based player.
'i haven't been able to defend the Extremadura Open as it was taken out of the programme the year after I won it.
Coming back to this part of the world is magical.
It's a wonderful place to play golf.
The memories from last year come back, and it was special for me and my wife Sharon to win here last year.
It's been a really special time and one we'll always appreciate. '
Gary Orr, who came to the European Senior Tour after his 50th birthday earlier this year, returns to action on home soil.
This event will be his first Scottish appearance since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
"It always means a bit more when you play at home," said Orr, the man from Helensburgh.
'you want to do it well, but you also feel that extra pressure.
I really enjoyed playing again, and I played a solid golf.
I'm happy with how it went so far. '
With the trio on the field are former Masters winner Ian Woosnam and senior major champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are among the six Scots on the field, the others being Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
Admission is free, the car park costs £5 per car with one occupant and £10 per car with two or more occupants.

Fewer lung cancer deaths due to passive smoking
Over the past two decades, fewer and fewer people have died from lung cancer because of passive smoking.
Scientists from the University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) come to this conclusion in a study.
"According to our estimates, 167 lung cancer deaths per year are due to passive smoking," said study leader Heiko Becher.
As a comparison, he drew up his own study on this subject from 1994.
At that time, there were still 400 cases of lung cancer due to passive smoking per year in Germany.
The new investigation is published in the International Journal of Public Health.
House connections turn out to be very complex
Construction work in Villinger Street is in full swing and "lies reasonably in time," according to the head of the building yard Fred Heinze.
In the area of house connections, the situation is more complicated than assumed, because there is a lot in the underground, which is not mentioned in the plans.
Traffic, which repeatedly hinders construction work, is a major problem for the Stumpp company's construction staff.
"The ignorance of motorists in front of red traffic lights and lockdown grids is already enormous," Heinze reports.
The road was closed and only the regular buses were allowed to pass through.
Angelo Caruso, Marvin Kostorz and Tim Kostorz of Stumpp's company have been busy working on the bridge for weeks.
"The hot days were already quite exhausting.
But luckily we were provided with cool mineral water by our friend Fritz Matt, "says Marvin Kostorz.
Poverty and death in Indonesian gold country
When Bardina Degei cooks dinner, she doesn't use a stove.
It even rarely uses a pot.
In her wooden house in Enarotali, the capital of the Paniai Regentschaft in the troubled Indonesian province of Papua, the housewife usually puts a sweet potato - locally referred to as "nota" - right in the fireplace.
After half an hour, the cremated scarf is taken from and engulfed with ferocious, unwashed hands.
Degei sits on the clay floor - she has no furniture - where she also performs her daily work, such as washing clothes with deceptive water from the nearby swamp.
A bucket in a dachless room serves as a latrine.
As the youngest of her husband's four wives, no fields were assigned to her.
Polygamy is common here.
Of course, working late can be dangerous: Most village men are unemployed, and many drink heavily, and there are the soldiers here.
"No one dares run around in the village after 5pm," she says.
It is a rare insight into daily life in the highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony recorded in 1969 after a controversial referendum in Indonesia, when only 1,026 elders were due to vote in front of the occupying forces through a public lifting.
An existing movement that stirred up for independence against Dutch rule quickly turned against the Jakarta government, which maintains control of the region and excludes foreign journalists or legal observers from it.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua, with the independent part of Papua New Guinea comprising the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is as remote as it is east.The trip includes a 90-minute flight from the provincial capital Jayapura to Nabire and then a morning 5-hour drive by car.
There is no public transport.
The town, with about 19,000 inhabitants, consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences, and of corrugated roofs converted by rust into various yellow-brown tones.
Very few Indonesians have made their journey here, let alone journalists and virtually no foreigners.
Before Christian missionaries arrived, Mee Pago Papuans revered a god called Uga Tamee.
There were other changes, too.
"We weren't used to wearing these clothes," Degei says, hinting at her busty, hand-woven turban, dark shirt and bright skirt.
"We used to have only leaves on our bodies."
Papua is Indonesia's poorest province, where 28% of people live below the poverty line and have some of the worst child mortality and literacy rates in Asia.
But it's also Indonesia's gold country.
The largest and most profitable gold mine in the world, Grasberg, owned by the Freeport McMoran from Phoenix, lies just 60 miles from Paniai, a highland province the size of New Jersey with 153,000 residents.
In 2015 alone, Freeport mined $3.1 billion worth of gold and copper.
In addition, Papua has wood resources worth an estimated $78 billion.
These riches, however, are a source of misery for the Papua, ensuring that Indonesia's powerful military preserves a stifling presence.
A 2005 investigation in the New York Times reported that Freeport paid local military personnel and units nearly $20 million between 1998 and 2004, including up to $150,000 to a single officer.
Papuan demands for greater autonomy threaten these golden Gans and are treated mercilessly.
According to activists, more than 500,000 Papua have been killed and thousands have been raped, tortured and imprisoned by the Indonesian military since 1969.
Mass killings in Papua's tribal highlands in the 1970 "s became genocide, according to the Asia Human Rights Commission.
In the region alone, Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful protesters last year.
"We are becoming all losing" says a 2016 report by the Archdiocese of Brisbane, which includes reports of last year's atrocities, such as unlawful executions and torture - rape and electric strikes are particularly popular, according to another report - and the brutal crackdown on peaceful demonstrations.
"It's difficult to count the number of victims as incidents happen every week," says Andreas Harsono, Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch.
The screws have intensified as Papua's resources bring an influx of settlers from other parts of Indonesia.
The population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83% Christian, but demographic changes as Muslim economic migrants come from the populous islands of Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Javanesian warung canteens sell roasted chicken and gado gado, a mixed vegetable served with peanut sauce.
Local people are struggling to keep up here.
"The migrants have started selling chicken and vegetables in the traditional market cheaper than the local Papua," explains Abeth You, a 24-year-old Paniai local who moved to the provincial capital Jayapura for work.
'it's cost native Papua - the mum mum [the women] of Papua - their market. '
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, popularly known as Jokowi, promised during his 2014 election campaign to address the inequalities and legal violations in Papua.
The former carpenter secured 27 of Papua's 29 districts in total - including Paniai - en route to the presidential palace in Jakarta.
But little has changed in Papua, and today locals feel cheated.
"Our hearts are broken because we voted for Jokowi in 2014, with the expectation that he will fulfill our hopes that justice will be restored," You says.
In fact, Paniai suffered a low point just two months after Jokov's inauguration in October.
On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children were out and singing Christmas songs in front of a bonfire in Enarotali when two Indonesian soldiers broke through darkness on a motorbike.
The terrified children told them to turn on their headlights.
One of the soldiers took impetus to their tone and later came back with four soldiers, according to local pastor Yavedt Tebai.
The soldiers who had been drinking chased and beat the group with their rifle pistons, victims and witnesses said.
Then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children.
One child, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was beaten so badly he fell into the coma.
A few hours later, the building of the nearby government commission was set on fire and things escalated the next day.
About 1,000 young Papua men, women and children gathered on a football pitch in front of the local police station and military command centre to demand justice.
They wore ceremonial hunting arches and performed the Waita dance - running in the circle and imitating a birdsong - by Papua's Mee Pago tribe.
Some protesters began towing stones at police and military posts.
As the mood heated up, the soldiers were sent an order via an internal radio: "If the crowds resist more than three times, they shoot them dead," an official document from TIME reads, which was not released to local media.
Yeremias Kayame, 56, the head of Enarotali's Kego Koto district, saw the looming danger and called for calm and urged the crowd to return home.
No one was in the mood to listen.
"When I turned around, I was suddenly shot into my left wrist," he told TIME on the porch of his colorful painted wooden house.
Kayame still doesn't know who fired, but says the bullet came from the ranks of soldiers gathered here.
"It was crowded, a lot of shots were fired," he adds.
Local man Alfius Youw was hit three times, according to his cousin, who witnessed the shootings.
"I ran to him and examined his body to make sure he was," Yohanes, who like many Indonesians carries only one name, told TIME in grim mood.
'i saw he was dead... I kissed him. '
Papua Police Chief Inspector Yotje Mende told reporters that his officers only wanted to "secure" their station because it was being attacked.
"We have to defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us," Papua Police spokesman Pudjo Sulistiyo said in 2015.
'it's about life and death. '
Five young protesters were killed and many more injured, according to Human Rights Watch.
News of the killings only came to Jakarta the following day 'filtered'.
For three weeks, Jokowi gave a passionate speech in Jayapura in which he expressed sympathies for the families of the victims and vowed to address the historic grievances in Papua.
"I want this case to be resolved immediately so it won't happen in the future," he said.
Security Minister Wiranto said in October 2016 that he was establishing an out-of-court mechanism to settle historic human rights abuses.
But the excuses started almost immediately.
'most injuries occurred a long time ago.
Some were in the 90's and early 2000's.
The point is that we have committed to addressing these violations, but there are processes that need to go through, "he said.
Then Wiranto made a withdrawal when he spoke to TIME in Jakarta on June 5, saying he had no plans to set up a complaint mechanism in Papua.
Instead, "everything is regulated by law," he said.
Wiranto, whom the UN has accused of "crimes against humanity" that claimed more than 1,000 lives in East Timor's bloody independence vote of 1999, said 11 cases of human rights abuses in Papua had already been settled, including the Paniai incident.
Families of the Paniai victims countered such claims with grim disbelief.
"I've been interviewed four times over the last three years, but there has been no progress whatsoever," says Yohanes.
'i'm tired. '
He says he still lives in fear years later.
"I'm scared," he says.
'i'm afraid of being arrested by the military, I'm afraid of being shot. '
His brother Yacobus repeated the view that people in Paniai are afraid to discuss the incident.
He says he was beaten by the military after he helped bury four of the victims.
"After I buried the bodies, the military was looking for me," he says.
The shootings have not stopped.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police shot at villagers in Paniai's Deiyai neighborhood.
During a confrontation between villagers and the manager of a construction company who refused to take a unconscious man to hospital, one person died and 17 others were injured, including children.
The man, 24-year-old Ravianus Douw, who drowned when he was fishing in a nearby river, died en route to hospital.
Excited villagers protested in front of the company's location office.
Police said villagers threw stones at officers who responded by firing off warning shots.
But locals say the mobile brigade (Indonesian paramilitary police) began shooting at the crowd, killing one.
"We were so in panic, we're afraid there will be revenge," says 29-year-old Dominggu Badii, who lives near the hospital and witnessed how the injured people were quickly hospitalized here, according to the TIME.
'i've been hiding in my house for two days. '
The Deiyai Parliament has called for the officers involved to be held accountable and the police's mobile brigade to be withdrawn from the area.
Paniai has always been a troublemaker for the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development strengthens the discontent of tribal members Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal, who live in the green highlands of Papua.
Many joined the "Free Papua Movement" (OPM), the rebel army that claims to defend the rights of Papua by inciting sporadic attacks and kidnappings of Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the top OPM leaders are from Paniai, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
In response, thousands of people have been arrested and arbitrarily remanded in Paniai in recent years on the pretext of "securing national sovereignty."
Some never show up again.
Among the people of Papua, Paniai is known as "a tragic, forgotten place."
Poverty strengthens discontent.
The bit of rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive for locals.
Bread is just as out of reach.
People here are building everything they eat: Especially nota and fruit and leaf vegetables.
Agriculture is the task of women, who can work on four or five fields of sweet potatoes each.
They retain most of the crop for the family, while the rest is sold in the local market.
Ten pieces of Nota cost just 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Over time, economic inequalities have grown between native Papua and the new migrants, who have arrived in greater numbers since the opening of new routes to Nabire Airport.
The few jobs there are in the region usually go to the better-educated and wealthier migrants.
Papua rarely have the capital or the necessary skills to run their own businesses competitively.
"The young people are not interested in staying in the village... because there are no jobs or money here," says John Gobai, the chairman of Paniai's tribal council.
Isolation keeps the eyes of the world away from Papua.
In addition, restrictions on reporting remain strained international media.
Earlier in the year, French journalists Franck ESCUDIE and Basille Longchamp were deported from Papua for lack of coordination with related institutions, although they were given rare permission to film.
According to Phelim Kine, Human Rights Watch's deputy Asia director, the promises of Jokov's campaign to lift restrictions on reporting to promote transparency and development have not been realised.
"There are new dangers to foreign journalists trying to report from Indonesia's most troubled eastern provinces of Papua and Western Papua: Visa denial and a blacklist," he said in a statement.
Lack of press control means international pressure on the Indonesian government remains largely confined to Papua's immediate neighbours.
In March, six Pacific states - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the "various and widespread injuries" in Papua including the Paniai shooting.
The same countries have historically supported the OPM.
Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesman Arrmanatha Nasir dismissed the group's allegations, telling journalists in Jakarta: "A democratic system still applies in Indonesia and there is free media so it is difficult to cover up the evidence of human rights cases."
Local people want more foreign governments to take note of this.
When an official delegation from the Netherlands, led by human rights ambassador Kees Van Baar, visited Jayapura on May 4, locals broke their silence and urged him "We want freedom," according to a source who also attended the meeting but wants to remain anonymous.
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019, but the Papua say they are unlikely to vote for Jokowi again.
"Jokowi is a person who has good intentions, but he is surrounded by the people involved in the Paniai shots," says Gobai, the chairman of the tribal council.
He wants Jokowi to know that the Paniai people, apart from living under the constant threat of a predatory military, are in poor education and health services.
Gobai says the Paniai people, like other Papua, view their vote for Jokowi as a "debt" he has to pay back.
"They don't need money, they just want justice," he says.
Despite the threats and intimidation, families of the Paniai gunshot victims carried out a final symbolic act of defiance: A victim's corpse was buried on a site just opposite the police and military station.
They know that they may never get justice, but at least they don't let those responsible forget their crimes.
"A member of our family was killed," says Yacobus with his head lowered.
"What else can we do?"
Fire captures Dubai's' torch 'skyscraper for second time
A fire found its diary in one of the world's tallest residential towers in Dubai on Friday, forcing hundreds of residents to flee the 337-metre-high, 79-storey building.
It's the second fire to sweep through the high-rise building in just two years, which is randomly called the Torch Tower (torch tower).
The building was evacuated, injuries were not reported, and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame.
'we slept and we got up at the fire alarm and screaming people.
We ran down the stairs, and it took about 10 minutes to get down from the 50th floor, "a resident who indicated his name as George told Reuters.
Dubai's civil protection authorities said fire fighting units extinguished the fire at around 4.00 a.m. local time (00am GMT) and cooled down the building.
The government said it was working to provide shelter for those affected.
The incident can revive questions about the safety of materials used in outdoor areas of high-rise buildings around the world.
An investigation by the management of the Torch building after its fire in 2015 found that most of the damage came from the cladding, the exterior cladding for decoration or insulation.
In Britain, police said they believe the system of plates for insulation and cladding at London's Grenfell Tower in June may have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire in which about 80 people died.
No Davis Cup reform: Continue best-of-five
The president of the International Tennis Federation (ITF) has fallen through with his big Davis Cup coup at the General Assembly.
At the meeting in Ho-Chi-Minh City, the revolutionary proposal for this sport to play Davis Cup single only on two winning sets was not supported by the required two-thirds majority.
The five-set classics, which are often very long but also very appreciated for this reason, are thus preserved in the traditional application.
63.54 percent of member countries voted for the reform, so ITF President David Haggerty's goal was narrowly missed.
'we respect this decision but are disappointed that our member nations have not adopted the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and Fed Cup.
We need a change to secure the long-term future of these iconic and historic contests, "Haggerty said.
We will continue to work to improve the application.
After many objections, the proposal to hold the final in a neutral place had not even been put to the vote.
New from 2018 are only comparatively minor details: In future, the finalists in the Davis Cup and Fed Cup will have the host right in the first round the following year.
In order to reduce the costs for the organisers, the requirements in terms of training places etc. will be made easier and players will have to make fewer official media appointments before the Davis Cup.
More than 1 in 5 US travellers bring banned items to the plane, a survey finds
A survey among airline passengers found that more than 20 percent deliberately or unconsciously smuggled prohibited items past the U.S. Transportation Security Administration checkpoints, including at least 6 percent who entered the plane while accidentally carrying prohibited knives or other items with blades.
Less than 1 percent claimed they had belatedly discovered they had mistakenly travelled with firearms, ammunition or explosives.
The survey among more than 1,000 people - conducted by a jet charter service, the Stratos Jet Charters Inc. - also found that younger travelers were more likely to flout the rules.
Of those surveyed who admitted they knowingly tried to fly with something banned by the TSA, 19.7 per cent were Millennials, compared with less than 15 per cent who were members of Generation X.
The most common items intentionally passed by TSA agents were food and liquids.
More than 3 per cent admitted knowingly carrying items with blades through security control, while 2.2 per cent of female respondents and 3.7 per cent of male respondents also confirmed they had deliberately brought banned drugs into the plane.
The company said it had questioned travelers across the country to find out how many had accidentally brought contraband goods through airport security and how many had done it intentionally.
It's no surprise that the people most likely to carry contraband goods - knowingly or unknowingly - through security were the ones who fly most often.
However, the company points out that the TSA guidelines are somewhat complicated and confusing.
People are often unsure what liquids they are allowed to take or how much of it.
So it's no surprise that the largest amount of items seized by the TSA are prohibited liquids.
For a time, people thought the TSA could view books as contraband.
Liquids are allowed on domestic flights, but not on international flights.
Elon Musk doesn't care: Tens of thousands of Tesla customers cancel order
Electro-thousand sassa Elon Musk likes to announce with the huge number of pre-orders for his new Tesla "Model 3."
In doing so, he has so far denied that some of the customers have already withdrawn their non-binding reservation.
In addition to the ever-triumphant figures on sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets, Tesla chief executive Elon Musk betrayed a different, less glancing figure for the first time in announcing the latest quarterly balance: That of cancellations to the new mass-market Model 3.
Musk had frequently advertised in recent months with the more than 500,000 pre-orders for the new car, whose delivery is just beginning.
Now Musk admits: Of the 518,000 pre-orders in total, 63,000 have already been withdrawn.
Critics had repeatedly pointed out that these were merely non-binding reservations.
In case of cancellation, Tesla will fully refund the 1000 Euro (US $1000 and £1000 in the UK) "reservation deposit."
Currently, 455,000 such non-binding reservations were available, Musk acknowledged in a conference call with analysts.
However, the Tesla boss does not believe that cancelling around 12 percent of all orders so far could become a problem.
His argument: The challenge of ambitious growth targets lies not with demand, but on the production side.
Last year, Tesla delivered 84,000 vehicles.
In 2018, it is supposed to be - all models taken together - 500,000, a million in 2020.
The demand for this is obviously there.
According to Musk, there are currently 1800 reservations per day.
Those who order a "Model 3" today will not be allowed to expect delivery until the second half of 2018 at the earliest - if Tesla manages to drive its brand-new, never-before-tested production lines with maximum capacity utilization without major interruptions.
Many experts doubt that is possible.
If there are major delays, however, then the non-binding nature of the reservations could become the problem for Tesla.
After all, the company cannot prevent dissatisfied customers from running away in droves.
EPA chief Pruitt withdraws because of delaying Obama Era rules to reduce emissions
A day after being sued by 15 states, Scott Pruitt, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, took back his earlier decision to delay implementation of Obama-era rules to reduce emissions of smog-causing air pollutants.
Pruitt presented the change as his agency proved more responsive to the needs of state environmental agencies than previous administrations.
He did not mention the lawsuit, which had been brought against his previous post in a federal appeals court.
It's about a deadline that expired on October 1 for states to meet 2015 standards for ground-level ozone.
Pruitt announced in June that he would delay compliance by a year to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid "interfering in local decisions or impeding economic growth."
Pruitt, who was Oklahoma's prosecutor before his appointment by President Donald Trump, has long been a reliable opponent of stricter environmental regulations.
Since arriving in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly moved to block or delay regulations that the chemical industry and fossil fuel industry oppose.
Wednesday's sudden reversal is the latest legal setback for Pruitt's regulatory rollback agenda.
Last month, a federal appeals court in Washington ruled that the EPA administrator overstepped his authority as he sought to delay the implementation of an Obama administration rule that required oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leaks.
In an opinion released Wednesday night, Pruitt suggested that his U-turn on ozone standards quite simply reinforces EPA's willingness to cooperate with the states through the complex process of timely compliance with the new standards.
"Under previous administrations, the EPA has often failed to meet deadlines for implementation and then waited to be indicted by activist groups and others, and in an agreement to set the date for implementation," said Pruitt, who sued the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job.
'we don't believe in regulation through court proceedings, and we take deadlines seriously.
We also take the law and authority it gives us seriously. '
Still, the EPA's opinion said that at some point Pruitt will use his "authority to delay and all other legally available powers" to ensure the regulations are "based on sound policy and the best available information."
Republicans in Congress are pushing for a broader rewrite of ozone rules.
A bill approved last month is expected to delay implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years.
The measure has not yet been put to a vote in the Senate.
New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who led the coalition of states that had sued the EPA this week, said the group intended to maintain legal pressure.
"The EPA's reversal - according to our lawsuits - is an important win for health and safety from these 6.7 million New Yorkers and the over 115 million Americans directly affected by the smog pouring into their communities," Schneiderman said.
New York joined California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington and the District of Columbia in this case.
Soil ozone occurs when pollutants from cars, power plants, oil refineries, chemical plants and other sources in the atmosphere respond to sunlight.
The resulting smog can cause serious breathing problems in sensitive groups of people, and contribute to thousands of premature deaths each year.
Public health officials and environmentalists cheered on Pruitt's surprise change of course.
"It's troubling how much pressure it takes to get this reasonable step from the person responsible for protecting the air we inhale," said Lori Ann Burd of the Center for Biological Diversity.
"We must continue to fight the ideological crusade of the Trump administration to turn to polluters and their special interests."
Tumours celebrates 750 years of St Hilarius Church
750 years of St. Hilarius Church: On the occasion of the anniversary of the mountain church, a serenade is invited to the old cemetery area in Tumlingen on Sunday, July 16, at 4.30 p.m.
Whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village, the historic St. Hilarius complex is a popular place to stay.
Visitors to the sixth Benefiz Serenade can be enchanted by this powerful place.
The rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the place have made the friends and promoters Tumlingens their concern.
Walter Martini emphasizes: "It's a unique village gem."
In 1267, the St. Hilarius Chapel was first mentioned in the book of documents in Württemberg: Graf Hermann von Sulz sold "the mountain with the parish church on it to Tumlingen including the Vogtei" to Magister Eberhard von Horb and to his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark Silver..
According to the text of the document, on Tumlinger Berg, apart from the former parish church, there was also a magnificent courtyard, to which the church or the patronage law belonged and not the other way round.
So people lived there, too.
As can be seen from the description of the Oberamt Freudenstadt of 1858, in addition to the lower village and the upper village, which are still visible today in the cityscape of Tumlingen, the "mountain" was the third, the ruling settlement center of the village.
Old maps from around the year 1600 underpin these historical conditions.
The right of patronage arose from the early medieval right of the church.
A gentleman who built, equipped and occupied a church with a parish priest remained the owner of this church and was able to inherit this own church.
This entailed the right to appoint a pastor or to propose a new pastor to the bishop.
There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower.
The Greater of the two crumbled on Christmas 1673.
The newly created bell then first tweeted in 1692, but had to be delivered later in World War II in 1942.
In the 30-year war (1616 to 1648), the window panes were knocked in and the bell ropes were stolen.
The roof was leaking.
In 1796, French troops camped near the church.
They broke out the pulpit and church chairs and used them as firewood.
Remains of the church threatened to collapse in 1809.
Until 1869, the Tumlinger Hilarius cemetery also served as a final resting place for the dead from Hörschweiler.
In 1823 the cemetery was expanded and the Hilarius church was demolished.
Only the church tower was left standing.
In New Year's Night in 1834, a storm split the church tower and half crashed in.
To prevent an accident, the tower was broken down.
Only the tower dwarf that still exists today was preserved as a witness to the 750-year-old church history.
Today Horst Kallenberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem maintain the Hilarius facility as the successor of Dieter Dockhorn.
As organizers, the friends and promoters invite Tumlingens to the sixth Serenade on Sunday, July 16, to the old cemetery to the St. Hilarius Chapel.
This is designed by the combo of the Kepler-Gymnasium Freudenstadt and with contributions from Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis.
Local leader Hartmut Romann speaks the final word.
The program starts at 4: 30 p.m.
Admission is from 3: 30 p.m.
At the end of the Serenade there is a trunk in front of the cemetery.
"Enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with a wide view over meadows towards the forest," the organizers put out the fantastic view.
The serenade takes place only in dry weather.
The organizers are hoping for many supporters to preserve the historic St. Hilarius facility, which is important for tumours and hearing Swiss.
The friends and sponsors of Tumlingens feel particularly committed to home care, as Serenade organizer Walter Martini affirms.
Association wants to have approval of wind turbines checked
"Boisheim defends itself" does not see a legal requirement for the construction and has therefore approached the county council.
The association "Boisheim defends itself" has asked Landrat Andreas Coenen (CDU) to withdraw its approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Boisheimer Nette.
It was unlawful.
The association argues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 no wind turbines could have been approved at all in the Boisheimer Nette, since at the time in Viersen only a wind power concentration zone existed at the city border with Schwalmtal.
Within this concentration zone, construction and operation of wind turbines are basically possible, but at the same time the concentration zone causes an exclusion of the use of wind energy for the rest of the city.
Such zones are intended to prevent a "saving" of the landscape.
The city of Viersen had decided a second wind power concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette a few days earlier by amending the land use plan - but the district government of Düsseldorf had not approved it because of a lack of form.
"Due to the lack of planning requirements, the granted approval notice is still illegal and therefore also to be withdrawn," said Christoph Erkens, Chairman of "Boisheim is resisting."
Current state of affairs: Before the summer break, the city council once again decided on the wind concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette; a permit from the district government is still pending.
Erkens: "At this point, the granting of a permit for the construction of wind turbines is excluded under planning law."
The circle confirms the receipt of the invitation.
"The corresponding letters have been received by Viersen County since last week," a spokesman explained.
The circle takes them as an opportunity to re-examine the matter.
However, they are not expected to stop the proceedings.
In view of ongoing proceedings at the Administrative Court on Thursday, the district did not want to comment on the content of the association's argument "Boisheim defends itself."
NEW Re, a subsidiary of NEW, plans to build four wind turbines, each 200 metres high, on an area at Boisheimer Nette.
As early as last year, the company, in which the city of Viersen is indirectly involved, had entered into lease agreements with the owner of the roughly 65-hectare site.
The four wind turbines are designed to meet the electricity needs of around 11 400 households - equivalent to around one-fifth of the electricity needs of all four households.
NEW Re wants to invest around 20 million euros.
Last summer, Viersen's city council gave the green light to the purchase of three wind turbines at the Linnich wind farm near Aachen, as well as a stake in a wind turbine in Übach-Palenberg in Heinsberg County.
Car and tractor crash together: Woman dies in horrific accident
A terrible traffic accident occurred on Friday morning at around 10am on the L 333 between Niederwallmenach and Bogel (Rhein-Lahn-Kreis).
A woman was fatally injured in the process.
Two other people were slightly injured.
The state road remained closed for hours.
According to police data, a 17-year-old young woman from Bornich drove the L 333 towards Bogel with her car as part of the accompanied driving with her 53-year-old mother as a companion.
City and traders plan 'home shopping' weekend
Bad Langensalzaer and people from the region are due to rediscover shopping in the city centre in September.
The commercial association and the city administration want to use the weekend on 8 and 9 September to lure the residents into the city centre for a shopping spree.
As the chairman of the trade association, Christian König, announced, the "home shopping" weekend is intended to make customers aware of what offers their own city offers away from the usual supermarket goods.
As a result, a market with regional suppliers is planned, similar to the weekly market.
In addition, domestic companies are to present themselves with their apprenticeships.
In addition, downtown shops are supposed to invite for "midnight shopping."
In doing so, the action is not only aimed at residents of the city and the nearby region.
In preparation were commercials on the radio, an internet video and printed bags pointing to the action weekend, according to Christian König.
Municipal administration and trade association cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry.
Thus the commercial association and the city go into another stage of the project "Attractive city centre."
These include new offers such as the first "Active Day" at the Brunnenfest and sold Sunday, talks with all traders and hosts to get them to participate actively.
Attractive offers on Saturday and the waiver of parking fees on that day are also part of the concept.
In addition, customer potential is to be reopened or reopened.
This includes spa guests and tourists.
But many locals would also have lost sight of the city centre while shopping.
In the end, everyone would have to help invigorate the city centre - down to landlords, the businesses of the whole city and clubs.
It was necessary to overcome with a network the lethargy, which had partly spread, King had said in the spring.
Birgit Streich, head of the IHK Center in Mühlhausen, announced that five Thuringian cities will participate for the first time on the third "home shopping" day in Germany.
In addition to Bad Langensalza, these are Weimar, Sömmerda, Heiligenstadt and Bleicherode.
The day should "promote the appreciation of local trade and emphasize its importance to the common good of our cities," according to Streich.
The action under the auspices of the IHK and with many partners also makes it clear that every citizen with his / her purchasing behaviour can influence his / her own direct environment.
Two dead and several injured after explosion at US school
During construction work, a gas explosion occurred in the school building.
New people were injured.

According to the fire department, an injured man was still in critical condition on Wednesday (local time).
One person died when part of a school building crashed in the explosion.
A first missing man was later also found dead.
The dead were employees of the school.
As an accident, the authorities suspected work on a gas pipeline.
At the time of the holiday, only a few people stayed in the building of Cincinnati Academy.
Trump pressured Mexico for paying border wall after leaked transcripts of phone calls
Transcripts of phone calls between US President Donald Trump and leaders of Mexico and Australia have been published by The Washington Post.
On January 27, Trump called in a phone call with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto to stop saying publicly that he would not pay for a planned border wall.
The US president mocked him for publicly denouncing the wall. According to reports, he said to him, "You can't tell the press that."
Trump launched his presidential campaign with a promise to build a wall on the southern border of the U.S. and vowed to let Mexico pay for the project.
Transcripts of his first call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull were also released, revealing a tense exchange.
Mr. Trump told Mr. Turnbull that a trade for the U.S. to take on refugees who emigrated to Australia was "ridiculous," "mies" and "stupid" and that insisting on trade brokered by the Obama administration would make him look like a "Depp" after he proposed a ban on refugee resettlement to the U.S. had.
Mr. Trump ended the call after telling Mr. Turnbull "that's the most unpleasant call for the whole day."
Moore's Ford massacre: Activists resume racist lynching act as call for justice
A 1948 Ford Mercury drove through a group of spectators in rural Monroe, Georgia, and rumbled toward Moore's Ford Bridge.
Before the car, which had four black passengers and a white driver, could reach the bridge, a group of white men stepped out with rifles to block its path.
The mob's leader - a middle-aged man in a needle stripe suit - took a long train at his cigar and looked testing through the windscreen.
Inside, the occupants hovered in fear.
"We want this n ---- r Roger!" The man brushed.
"Get him out of the car!"
Screams ripped the silence as a young black man was crushed by the passenger seat.
Luckily, this horrific scene, played on July 22, is just an afterthought.
But when a noose is thrown around the neck of "Roger," almost everyone in the audience punched out very real sigh.
Civil rights activists have been coming back to Moore's Ford Bridge since 2005 to emulate the night two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom, as well as George and Mae Murray Dorsey - were lured by the Ku Klux Klan in 1946.
No one has ever been charged with the murders.
"It's really unfathomable that not a single person has been arrested in all these years - even though we see them in our communities, even though we know who they are," said Tyrone Brooks, who helps organize the rendition.
'it's a dirt spot on a story, but it's a strain on our souls. '
Brooks is a 71-year-old former Georgia state congressman and a lifetime civil rights activist.
For him, the rendition serves as a dramatic call to action and represents an annual reminder to the Monroe community that an injustice has never been corrected.
"We want law enforcement, we want the termination, we want healing, we want reconciliation, but first we need to get justice," he said.
'we can't get to healing and reconciliation until we get justice. '
A court doctor lays a duvet over the corpse of one of the victims of the Moore-Ford lynching on July 27, 1946.
More than 50 men from Monroe and surrounding counties were suspected in the lynching process, according to FBI files obtained by NBC News.
But none have ever been charged.
Although the suspects have remained on the open foot for decades, civil rights advocates say the dual motivation for the Lynch actions across the city has always been known: Politics and sex.
In April 1946, a Supreme Court decision allowed black citizens in Georgia to cast their ballots for the first time at the pre-election campaign in the summer.
Roughly at the same time as the election, according to the FBI, black color advocate Roger Malcom stabbed a white landowner, Barnett Hester, during a fight - allegedly because of a woman.
Brooks said the rumour in the city had been that Hester had slept with Malcoms's wife Dorothy and that the baby she was carrying was not from her husband.
On July 25, 1946, Loy Harrison, a prominent white landowner, paid $600 to free Malcom from prison, according to the FBI.
He was escorted to prison by Dorothy and her cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey.
But when they then removed themselves from prison and approached Moore's Ford Bridge, a lynchmob surrounded the car.
"As it turns out, it was Harrison who prepared and ordered the killings," an FBI report concludes.
'it's also obvious that there was a plot between state and local law enforcement that was not only involved in the killings, removed evidence and covered up the identity of witnesses. '
Brooks formulates it even more succinctly.
"It was a suffrage massacre," he said.
"They were all killed to send a message to black people in this community:" If you register and if you vote, then that will happen to you here. "
For nearly a decade, Cassandra Greene has presided over the annual rendition of the Moore Ford Bridge Lynch murders.
Their portrayal is vivid, poignant and grounded in a kind of deep racism that many would like to believe no longer exists in America.
It's hard to watch, and even harder to look away, but Greene said that's the point.
"We don't want to talk about lynching because then we are confronted with its ugliness in all of us," she said.
'but I can't build a relationship with you if you don't want to listen to me or don't want to hear what I've been through. '
Rehearsals for this year's production began in June, and on the first day, nearly 30 actors - a dozen whites and the rest of blacks - pushed themselves into a room and lurched as Greene launched a well-rehearsed overview of the piece.
Wade Marbaugh is Greene's co-director here.
He has played the role of chief clan member for years, but he said the role never gets easier.
"I feel dirty because I'm not like that," Marbaugh said.
'but I think it's very important to keep this story alive because we don't want to go back to those times. '
On the other side of the room, actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, who play Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester, rehearsed their lines.
The piece begins with Malcom shouting at Hester and pushing him, angry that he slept with his wife Dorothy.
'i said n --- er, disappearing from my property! '
Rascona reciprocates the fire.
There's a break.
And then everyone (at least all black actors) breaks out in laughter.
Greene laughs loudest.
"What?!" Asked Rascona.
He's alarmed and confused.
Was I too hard?
"No," Greene said, still kichernd.
'i just don't think white people said 'n --- he' at the time. '
"Yet," witted one of the other black performers.
'you just have to hit the hard 'R.'. '
And right there, the energy shifts in space, a sense of camaraderie replaces the unease.
Everyone is busy getting this right, not just because of the game, but also because of the memory of the four people killed.
The scene begins again.
This time, when Rascona says the N-word, he says it sharply and emphatically.
Absolutely no one laughs.
This repetition ends violently and quickly.
There are screams, shots and then silence.
A woman, dressed with a mourning dress, stands over the bodies of the actors and performs Billie Holiday's mourning praise speech "Strange Fruit."
Her voice breaks at every second word.
About a hundred meters behind it, a group of about four dozen spectators wipes sweat and tears out of their eyes.
The audience is split almost evenly between black and white.
A couple have arrived from Ithaca, New York, to see the performance, many just coming down the street.
They have all experienced Georgia's crushing moisture for nearly eight hours when Brooks leads them on a pilgrimage to the burial sites of the Malcoms and Dorseys.
By this point, the killings have remained an anecdote, but now, standing in the same country where the Lynch murders took place, the air feels ghostly.
When the song's final notes ring out, Greene invites the crowd to get closer and inspect the corpse.
Children hock at their heads, register the fake blood and the silent bodies and whisper to each other.
"They're not really dead," a little boy mumbles as if he wanted to remember.
After a few minutes, Greene thanks the crowd - and all of a sudden it's over.
The actors throw away the lynch rope and wipe off their tears.
Bradshaw hugs Marbaugh, the man in the suit who played the clan member.
Nick Rascona hugs two of his fellow players and then breaks down in their arms crying, the emotional burden of the performance eventually breaks through at him.
"It's okay," whispers one of the women.
'we know that's not in your heart.
You did that for a reason. '
Later, the audience sit down with the actors for dinner.
At one table, a white couple from Atlanta chat animatedly about the juxtaposition with a black pair they've just met.
Denise Duplinski struggled to find words about what feeling the performance left behind.
"It's hard to hear these horrible words and actions... coming from people who look like you yourself and who do that because they look like you," she said.
"What this really does with me makes me believe the lynching is still going on," she added, "today the only police shooting is called."
In the same room, Tyrone Brooks holds court at his table, he eats and recalls civil rights.
He said he had already started planning the performance next year.
"The rendition is inspiring in a way, because it describes the horror of what we've endured, but it's also a moment of learning," he said.
'it's like, if we don't learn anything from it, then it can happen again.
Those who do not study their own history, those who do not know their own history, are condemned to repeat it. "
'Gods dusk 'reconciled the Wagnerians in Bayreuth
Also in the fourth part of Richard Wagner's monumental work, director Frank Castorf puts on a colorful-frivole staging in front of gigantic, six-story backdrop.
The shooting stage (designed by Aleksandar Denic) optionally shows a shamed street corner including Mauerrest and Dönerbude in Berlin, a "Plaste and Elaste" logo from GDR times or the New York Stock Exchange.
Before that, an open Mercedes classic car parks in which the Rhine daughters pose as rockergirls, or alternatively an isetta.
Stacked oil barrels recall Castorf's leitmotif - money, power and greed - which draws through its "ring" staging.
The three Rhine daughters - sung by Stephanie Houtzeel, Wiebke Lehmkuhl and Alexandra Steiner - harmonize wonderfully as they did in "Rheingold."
Kess seduce them Siegfried (Stefan Vinke), smash a corpse into the suitcase room in Hollywood manners and give the Krawallo clique.
Stephen Milling sings the gloriously fiery hagen that surrounds the aura of a heavyweight boxer.
Bruising the scene as he slaps Siegfried.
Later Gunther (Markus Eiche) has to believe in it.
The audience thanks the ensemble with strong applause.
Stormily celebrated are Foster, Milling, Vinke and conductor Janowski, who modestly and formally bends hands to the Merkel rout.
There is great applause for the Festival Orchestra, which shows itself on stage for the first time - in light of the great heat again in empty leisure clothes.
The performance of Frank Castorf and his team of directors had been eagerly awaited.
If in 2013 he had to make a grand pipe concert, five years later there were great cheers in which the isolated "buh" calls went down.
Festival chefin Katharina Wagner is likely to have been pleased about this.
"You realise that the audience has grown together with the" ring "in a way," she had said shortly before the dpa's performance.
The audience had not only made a form of peace with Castorf, but had also grown an understanding of his point of view.
I draw a positive conclusion.
Max Menge works as a volunteer
They work in several places during their volunteer year.
Where everywhere?
Crowd: Usually in stone strap in the furniture exchange, once a week I help out here in Greven in the furniture bridge.
And I also worked at the school in the open whole day.
What are your experiences with this?
Crowd: It's a nice, broad spectrum I see here.
I have to do with different people, with young people, with refugees, with young adults.
They are now 26 years, so a late-time volunteer.
How does this come about?
Crowd: I did Abitur.
And then a civil engineering degree, let's say, successfully aborted.
I realized for myself that it's the wrong thing for me and I want to do something different, work with people.
And then I asked myself what do you do.
Do a social year, there is an insight, you can see how it really is on the ground, maybe in the focal point.
And was it like that?
Crowd: I've collected great impressions.
I will start my studies in social affairs in the winter semester.
I will study dual, probably do a social worker training at the Herne Youth Office and study in Hamm at the University of Applied Sciences.
Isn't it a bit unusual to have several different locations during the volunteer service?
Lot: Yeah, it's very variable.
It probably always depends on where you do your FSJ.
You can do it from retirement home to youth work - in all sorts of facets of social work.
With me it was very varied.
I was also partly in the OGS, so in the afternoon care.
For me, that was exactly the right thing that irritated me.
I could recognise my own strengths and see how it really goes off.
Unlike in civil engineering studies?
Lot: Well, this isn't about calculating stats.
You always have other people in front of you, who each have a completely different story behind them.
Whether a refugee, whether a juvenile who has been taken out of the family - you always have to deal with it individually.
Very interesting.
And you didn't have any touch fears?
Crowd: I'm not the type for that.
It's an area that gives you a lot.
A lot of love, a lot of kindness.
There are also negative moments, but that's how life is.
Pearson cuts another 3,000 jobs and cuts dividend to revive business
British education group Pearson said on Friday it would cut another 3,000 jobs and cut its interim dividend by 72 per cent as another restructuring programme was launched to overcome the pressure the company faced.
The job cut, which general manager John Fallon mostly announced for late 2018 and early 2019, comes on top of its previous restructuring, which has already seen 4,000 jobs lost.
Pearson announced a plan to cut costs by a further £300 million (US $394 million) in a third cost-cutting programme in May to revive a business hit by the rapid move to digital learning.
The company, which last month divested its stake in Penguin Random House to partner Bertelsmann, said the outlook for the financial year was unchanged after it posted a 1 per cent increase to £2.05 billion in the first half.
Kabul convoy attack: NATO soldier killed in suicide attack
A suicide bomber has attacked a military convoy in the Afghan capital Kabul, killing a Nato soldier and wounding several others, officials say.
Five soldiers and an interpreter had been injured, a statement from Nato shared.
Unconfirmed local reports said three civilians also died in the incident in the Qarabagh district.
The bombing is the latest violence to hit Afghanistan this month - more than 30 people were killed at a mosque in Herat on Tuesday.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
A Nato statement said the explosion happened on Thursday night when a joint patrol with the Afghan army was "attacked" by a "person-worn improvised explosive device."
The statement says all those injured are in stable condition and are being treated at the US military hospital on Bagram airfield.
Correspondents say the growing strength of the Taliban and the group known as the so-called Islamic State (IS) in Qarabagh is a major concern for NATO troops in nearby Bagram.
According to the United Nations, there were at least 1,662 civilian deaths in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, about 20% of them in the capital.
In late July, a suicide car bomb killed at least 30 people in a mainly Shiite district of Kabul.
The Taliban said they carried out that attack.
On May 31, a massive bombing in the center of the city killed more than 150 people with the country's deadliest militant attack since U.S.-led troops ousted the Taliban from power in 2001.
The violence underscores the precarious security situation in Afghanistan as US President Donald Trump weighs up the number of US troops supporting the military and police in the country.
Correspondents say the suicide bombing in Kabul in recent weeks has also caused a crisis of public confidence in the government, its policies and, in particular, the reputation of President Ashraf Ghani.
EPA reverses decision to delay smog rule after lawsuits
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has overturned a decision to delay regulation of the Obama administration requiring states to curb smog-causing emissions, a day after 15 states sued the agency for the move.
The EPA announced late on Wednesday the decision to press ahead with the so-called "ozone provisions 2015," and said it showed the agency's commitment to cooperate with states.
"We believe in dialogue with and in responding to our state partners," EPA chief Scott Pruitt said in a statement.
Pruitt had announced in June the EPA's intention to delay ozone provisions - in which pollutant emissions are to be measured in part of the country to determine where cuts must be made to meet stricter air quality standards - by a year to October 2018.
A group of 15 largely Democratic states, along with the District of Columbia, filed suit Tuesday, saying the effort was illegal.
President Donald Trump's administration has sought to scale back a wide range of environmental requirements imposed by former President Barack Obama as part of a broader agenda designed to boost economic growth, according to Trump.
The effort, however, has sparked the backlash from Democrats and conservation groups, who are worried about the impact of larger emissions on public health.
The EPA's website says inhaling air that contains ozone can "reduce lung function and amplify breathing symptoms" such as asthma.
Local council wants community space
In the end, the decision was clear: In the case of two votes against, the Municipal Council of Fluorn-Winzel decides to set up a common area in the future senior housing estate.
Before the discussion there is an important information: The purchase contract for the still missing part of the property is signed, reports Mayor Bernhard Tjaden.
Although it will still take time for the area belonging to the church community to date to be in municipal ownership, there is now no longer any barrier to planning for the project to be stemmed by a private investor.
For this, there is a discussion on a Community area.
One of the two investors still in the boat has offered to meet the community.
On the ground floor, he would provide a living space - around 55 square feet - and an adjacent terrace with at least 70 square metres of space for a special price.
The administration and the majority of the municipal council prefers not to provide such a communal space as a meeting place only for the inhabitants of seniority-oriented housing, but to enter the commune openly.
As an example, the word from the "knitting café" made the rounds.
The decision, which was decided by the provision of funds for the current budget as early as last autumn, will be missed by means of funding opportunities.
The building is located in the redevelopment area.
Setting up a community space would be eligible, Tjaden reports, with 60 per cent of 30 per cent.
In order to signal to the investor that he does not want to throw a nudge between his legs in this respect, the proposal provides for the conclusion that both saddle - which is due to the environmental construction - and pulse roof - which reduces the height of the elevation and makes the construction more economical - would be possible.
Needless to say, not only Wilfried Sohmer thinks, is this addition.
If it helps: Unanimously, it happens to the body.
The common area is not as simple as that.
Daniela Ruf refers to the many buildings you don't really get along with, but now you're leaning out of the window at the common room, she says, "I'm struggling with it."
Yvonne Staiger is absolutely in favour of the Community area - but absolutely against communal participation.
It sees behind it a covert subsidy to already wealthy or even foreign investors.
This is not the case, because with the acquisition of the area one does not give a grant, but gets a real countervalue, which can be marketed in case of doubt, is the counter-speech.
Staiger's request to split the resolution accordingly finds three supporters.
So it remains with two votes against the original programme, which Stefan Haller summarizes as follows: "If we take the decision in this way, we are taking a giant step towards closing a huge gap in our infrastructure."
Car collision: Cyclist is slammed on road
When crossing the road, an 82-year-old cyclist was apprehended by a car in Garath on Wednesday and seriously injured.
As the police reported, the 82-year-old Langenfeld had been travelling by bike on the bike path of the road Schwarzer Weg from the direction of Hilden at 12.20am.
The senior wanted to cross the carriageway at the height of the road Am Buchholzer Busch.
A car driver driving in the same direction gave him priority.
When the Langenfeld took to the road, however, he apparently did not pay attention to the counter-traffic.
He paused with a car steering a 66-year-old aide.
The man was shunned onto the street.
He suffered serious injuries and was taken to a hospital with a return car.
FC Bayern Munich must forego David Alaba and Thiago at the Supercup against Borussia Dortmund
The Supercup takes place without him: David Alaba must have the game sucked against Dortmund.
With personnel worries, FC Bayern travel to Dortmund for the first mandatory game of the new season.
Seven pros are missing the title defender in the Supercup against the cup winner.
Staff worries at German football record-breaking champion Bayern Munich are getting bigger and bigger ahead of Saturday's Supercup (8.30pm / ZDF and Eurosport) at cup winners Borussia Dortmund.
Coach Carlo Ancelotti must also waive David Alaba in the duel with the BVB.
That was confirmed by the Italian on Friday.
Also missing are the miners Manuel Neuer, James, Thiago, Jerome Boateng, Arjen Robben and Juan Bernat.
For the five defeats in the past six Test matches, Ancelotti has blamed the physical condition and lack of balance in his team's game.
"We know we're not in the best physical constitution," Ancelotti said, adding: "The most important point is the balance in the team.
That was not good at last. "
However, the 58-year-old believes in a performance boost in the first official mandatory game of the season.
"Football is also tactics, strategy, personality and motivation.
I have great confidence that my team is showing these qualities.
The squad is ready.
We want to play intelligently, "said Ancelotti, who expects a" difficult, intense game. "
The duel of the two German football heavyweights captivates the fans.
The match is sold out with 81,360 spectators, the German Football League (DFL) announced on Friday.
Wandering from star to star in the resin
In the Harz, the first "star path" is to be created nationwide.
This is planned by the association Sternwarte Sankt Andreasberg.
There is a planetary path in Göttingen - since 2003.
A "star trail" meets the information needs of many resin visitors, it was said.
It combines nature, science, movement and athletic performance.
The members want to set up tables along the planned route and inform them about stars and star pictures.
In a first phase until 2018, the association plans "well-reachable installations in five to six locations" in the Oberharz.
In question would be St. Andreasberg, Braunlage, Hohegeiß and Sieber.
The information on the boards is to be supplemented via the Internet.
This is why a good mobile network reception plays a role in the selection of locations.
Accessibility is also a criterion.
Later, the star-studded train path is to be expanded by train.
"On the star path, the viewers learn a lot of interesting things, for example about the physics of the individual stars," explained the association.
In addition, they learned why stars have different colors or why one star shines more strongly than another, although it lies much further away.
It also conveys the star image in which a selected star is located and when it is best to see.
The association has been operating the highest-lying observatory in northern Germany since 2014 in the mountain town of St. Andreasberg.
The location in the middle of the Harz National Park is one of the six darkest regions in Germany, according to the Federal Office for Nature Conservation.
Often from there, the Milky Way and even the Andromeda galaxy can be seen clearly with a naked eye.
Since 2003, at the initiative of the Planetarium Göttingen funding association, there has been something similar to the planned startup - the planetary path.
Starting in front of Gebhards Hotel in the Goetheallee, which forms the interior of our solar system, the planetary path with its stems leads up to the Hainberg and the observatory - as well as an "extraterrestrial" location in Diemarden (community equals) with the planet Sedna.
The stems with the individual planets - including the Pluto degraded to the dwarf planet at the end point - are positioned exactly at the distance and scale of one to two billion.
The earth shrinks to a sphere of 6.5 millimetres in diameter, while the sun, which is exactly 75 metres away, measures 70 centimetres.
The entire distance of the planetary path is about four kilometers.
While the light from sun to the Pluto takes about eight hours, pedestrians need a good hour up to the stele with Pluto.
So pedestrians are faster than the light in space.
The march to the next fixture star, however, would take another six months.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for the first time, discuss a possible showdown
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who were due to stand in a collision course to stage the most exciting boxing fight in the near future under £147, met for the first time on Thursday.
They were in separate rooms at ESPN offices in Los Angeles until Garcia, the unbeaten World Boxing Council lightweight champion, walked down the hallway to greet Lomachenko, the World Boxing Organization super-featherweight champion.
After Garcia's victory by unanimous decision over former four-division world champion Adrien Broner on Saturday on Showtime, both fighters are members of the top-five Pound-for-Pound list.
Garcia stretched out the right hand and said, "How do you, champion?
I wish you good luck. "
Lomachenko defends his belt against Miguel Marriaga on Saturday night at 7pm on ESPN.
As the pair posed for photos, Lomachenko manager Egis Klimas noted that a possible showdown between the fighters would be the "perfect magnitude."
"I'm a former featherweight," Garcia recalled.
'i've gone up for Broner [to £140] but I'm not that big.
I'm small for 140.
I want to get down to lightweight.
And he has to move on lightweight [135 pounds] and then we fight.
That's what the fans are asking for.
Let's give them that. '
Lomachenko agreed.
"Boxing needs this fight."
Klimas asked if it should be on pay-per-view, part of a strategy Lomachenko has to contend with a 135-pound debut this year to agree a date next summer with Garcia (37-0, 30 knockouts) who is also interested in fighting the winner of Jorge Linares-Luke Campbell after their recklessness weight title fight in the forum on September 23.
"This fight could take place in pay-per-view mode because all the fans asked for it," Garcia said, later openly expressing himself to fight at the network offering the best financial package.
We are the best.
No other names can generate that kind of attention.
Whenever they are ready... "
Garcia said he values Lomachenko as "an enormous fighter," and he would potentially take part in his Saturday fight.
But Lomachenko stopped by the generous praise for Garcia, saying that he thinks the three-fight champion from Riverside looks "very slow, I'm sorry Mikey... you wanted the co-off after all."
Garcia said the focus was to show impact strength, then boxing.
Both said they could feel the momentum building up for their own fight.
'This is the fight that needs to be done.
No other fight creates so much attention and enthusiasm.
I'm more than happy to work on it, "Garcia said.
Lomachenko said: 'I've been waiting for the top fighters and that's Mikey.
It's going to be a great fight. '
Four injured after tyre burst
Four people were partially seriously injured in an accident on the A7 on Thursday afternoon.
According to initial information, the driver of an Opel Zafira lost control of his vehicle at about 4.30pm shortly before the market-wide connection point, presumably after a tire burner.
The car dragged to the right into the embankment, where it fell over and then remained on the roof in the green strip.
The four occupants - two adults and two children - were partially seriously injured in the accident.
During the initial supply of the injured by the rescue service, the A7 was locked towards the north for about an hour, then traffic on the left lane could be passed by the accident site.
Fortunas Hoffmann: "Triple chain works better"
Andre Hoffmann hopes after the 2: 2 at the start of the season against Braunschweig that the optimization of the defensive formation in Aue brings points.
Andre Hoffmann was satisfied with the first game of the season, with the result as well, would not have been the two opponents at 2: 2 against Braunschweig.
"These were two counters too much, and we have to take even better care in Aue," says Fortuna Düsseldorf's defensive player.
In the Erzgebirge, the triangular chain should also be further optimised.
And a goal after a free-kick the Fortunes don't want to catch up any more.
'for the future, it's going to be that no one else puts themselves on the line alongside Michael (Rensing). '
Hoffmann is convinced that even after the experience in the preparation with the triangle, his team will cope better than with the quadruple chain.
"I don't know how we will act in Aue yet," says his coach Friedhelm Funkel, but Hoffmann is sure of his cause, "because we have players who can build up well just in the triangle on the half-positions in Kaan Ayhan and Niko Gießelmann," Hoffmann said.
"The prerequisite is, but that we harmonise even better and we don't afford so many playback errors in the build-up."
Of course, Hoffmann also heads to Aue to win the game.
'Whether you can talk about a failed start after a draw, though, doesn't know.
The performance could well be okay, "Hoffmann said.
'However, if we can stand by four points on Sunday and focus on the cup, we'll certainly be able to talk about a proper start to the season. '
His coach didn't want to know anything about that.
"I don't judge the start of the season until after six to eight days of play," said Friedhelm Funkel, who doesn't want to speak of an advantage over Aue, just because the game of Saxony in Heidenheim had to be canceled prematurely because of an accident.
"Now they can virtually start the season with a home game," said Funkel and Hoffmann believes the players from Aue might even be a little fresher as they wouldn't have a heavy and complete game like Fortuna against an up-and-coming favourite in the bones.
"But they don't know as 100 percent where they currently stand," says the Fortuna's interior defender.
Although the guests from the Rhineland as a slight favourite go into the encounter on Sunday at the finally (almost) finished stadium of Aue.
"That we sweep them away just because we are entitled to get under the first six is nonsense," says Funkel, whose record is quite positive in just one defeat against Aue from nine games.
"There is no team in the 2nd Bundesliga that you have to beat from the start," explains Fortuna's chief coach.
"Making such a statement would be arrogant and arrogant."
And so Funkel doesn't want to experience his players on Sunday by any means.
New results of Sweden's asylum age assessment tests released
Recent results from tests for asylum seekers in Sweden, which have undergone a new method of medical assessment of their age, show that more than 80 per cent of people tested are older than 18, but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results.
The Swedish Authority for Forensic Medicine (council medicinalverket) started carrying out the tests last year.
They are to make the assessment of age more accurate during the asylum process after the Swedish Migration Authority (Migrationsverket) was criticised for errors in assessing the correct age of some refugees who were underage.
To date, Migrationsverket has shipped 6,880 cases to be tested and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now released the results of a total of 2,481 tests from the period from mid-March to July 31, 2017.
Eighty per cent (2002) were assessed as 18 or older, while in another 25 cases the Forensic Medicine Agency assessed that the person was "possibly 18 years or older."
In 432 cases, the conclusion was that the person "may be under the age of 18."
The tests are only carried out in cases where the person's age is questioned.
According to Johan Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency, the results have been steady over the past few months.
"We don't see a big difference in statistics over the past few months, the numbers are pretty constant," he told The Local magazine.
The high proportion of cases where the person was assessed as over 18 does not necessarily mean the asylum seeker lied about his age.
In May, the agency published the results of 581 tests, saying there were 442 cases that "suggest the person under investigation was 18 years or older."
When the Svenska Dagbladet newspaper investigated the 581 published results, it found that in 243 of those cases, the person had frankly said she was turning 18 this year.
The method of medical age assessment, where X-rays of wisdom teeth and MRI recordings of knee joints are made, which are then analysed by dentists and radiologists, has also been criticised in some areas.
A skeptic is endocrinologist Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute, whose work includes assessing people's biological maturity to see if they went through puberty sooner or later than usual.
'i had reason to think about it and I don't think the type of measurement should be used.
Judging biological age in this way is very uncertain.
If we can't say it for sure, we shouldn't pretend we could, "he told the Metro newspaper.
However, Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency defended the accuracy of the tests: "In general, you can say that the risk of misjudging a child as an adult is low.
The biggest risk is when the person is just under 18, in which case this is about 10 per cent. '
Full in the plan
Work on the three bridges of Landstrasse 108 between Lauterbach and Schramberg is progressing well.
On Wednesday, a seven-ton heavy concrete part was installed on the bridge at the eastern village entrance of Lauterbach.
"We're very good at the time, it's going super," says Reinhold Leicht, construction manager at the Department of Road and Transport at the Freiburg Government Bureau.
In April, work began simultaneously on all three bridges in need of renovation between Schramberg and Lauterbach.
The construction end is scheduled for October and Leicht is sure that the schedule will be met.
The first bridge, coming from Schramberg, leads over the Trombach.
It is a vaulted arch bridge made of concrete, which is clad with red Buntsandstein and has a total length of 4.80 metres.
It was built in 1900.
Like the other two bridges, it has come into the years.
In order to ensure stability and traffic safety, the three buildings will now be thoroughly refurbished.
The other two bridges lead over the Lauterbach.
They are built from red Buntsandstein.
Both were built in 1939 and are twelve, respectively 10.60 metres long.
The bridge at the local entrance of Lauterbach has now received a 1.30-metre-wide and seven-tonne so-called bridge cap on the north side on Wednesday morning.
This is a border fortification, which is also used as an operating route.
A 2.20-metre-wide bridge cap is to be used on the southern part of the bridge on Friday.
The pedestrian path is then to be followed.
The special thing is that these are finished parts, a patent of the Schramberger company Dizwo.
The other two bridges are already equipped with the patented bridge caps.
The laying of lines through the building in Lauterbach has required a special sense of touch.
There is also a fibre optic cable, to which many companies are connected.
Local residents were informed of the project by hand in advance of the work.
In addition, fish and cancer had to be fished first.
For the bridges between the Bauhof building and the Sammelweiher in the direction of Schramberg, traffic is regulated by a traffic light.
For the construction work on the bridge at the Lauterbacher village entrance, the road in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotels "Tannenhof" and "Seven Linden" is fully closed.
The cost of the three bridge renovations amounts to a total of EUR 700 000.
The whole thing is financed by the country.
AFD in Gerolstein: Colorful protest at German potato salad
It is not so common for parties to pull together, but when it comes to the Alternative for Germany (AfD), it comes together, which is otherwise difficult to reconcile.
The parties represented in the Vulkaneifel County Day (CDU, SPD, Greens, FDP, FWG, Left) are among a broad alliance that peacefully displays a flag that day because the AfD invites Rondell to the "big campaign kick-off" in the Gerolsteiner Stadthalle, according to the poster.
And brings well-known names to the launch - such as Alice Weidel, who, along with Alexander Gauland, forms the top duo for the federal election on September 24, and Deputy Federal President Beatrix of Storch.
But those who are on the ground hours before the event begins don't want to listen to the AfD people but demonstrate.
The motto "The Eifel remains colourful."
Originally, the city picnic was planned under the motto "All at a Table" on Brunnenplatz, but now takes place in the parking lot below the Rondells - and thus right in front of the eyes of those who come to the AfD event in the Stadthalle.
A colourful picture that can be found there.
And what Christa Karoli, Chairman of the Forum One World and one of the leading organizers, is really pleased: "Great how many people have come together here."
There's music and plenty of food, including an "urgerine potato salad that the AfD could also eat without any problems," says the woman who brought him.
Police have ordered many officials to Gerolstein, it shows presence especially at the station, which is just a few metres from the venues.
How did the AfD actually get on Gerolstein?
Mario Hompes of the AfD Vulkaneifel reports he has struggled for such an event and got the surcharge.
The 45-year-old from Gönnersdorf had initially asked in Daun, but got a cancellation there, because because of the already built Laurentiuskirmes there were not enough parking spaces.
So now the Rondell, Hompes is pleased that "we can have such a beautiful event here."
Looking at the event at the Rondellvorplatz, he says: "That's the good right of people, main thing, it stays peaceful."
That's what it does: At around 8pm, a band provides entertainment on the Rondellvorplatz, in which Stadthalle has various speakers, including the Rhineland-Palatinate AfD leader Uwe Junge.
In the hall are about 200 listeners waiting for the top candidate for the federal election, Alice Weidel, and Deputy Federal President Beatrix von Storch to deliver their speeches.
The police presence is unchanged, but so far the officials have had a quiet evening.
Just over an hour the AfD event lasts, guests on the forecourt have a longer breath, but also there is scheduled to clean up shortly after 9pm.
Police can step down - no special occurrences.
Posaune meets trumpet
There is a rehearing with the Wolfacher Posaunist Frederic Belli in the series Haslacher Monastery Concerts tomorrow, Sunday, at 8pm in the monastery church.
Together with the Bulgarian trumpeter Miroslav Petkov, he gives a concert under the motto "Black Sea meets Black Forest," or even "Balkan folklore" meets a classical German education with roots in brass music.
Both soloists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and have held solo positions in top European orchestras.
So is Petkov Solotrompeter at the prestigious Concertgebouw Orchestra Amsterdam and Frederic Belli is soloposaunist of the SWR Symphony Orchestra.
Both combine the desire not only to cross the boundaries on their instruments, but also to merge the boundaries of the different genres.
This is how Johann Sebastian Bach sounds at the two as in a new garment, Daniel Schnyder's "world music" unites with Bulgarian folklore, and in the piece "Exchange Suite" by the Jazzechopreisträger Nils Wogram, classics, jazz and free playing blend into a fascinating overall artwork..
This centrepiece of the programme was only premiered this spring with huge success in Freiburg.
The renowned composer Nils Wogram wrote it especially for the two musicians and even more: The Haslacher Klosterkirche with its special acoustics is consciously included in the concert.
Kristen Stewart talks about her bisexuality
'Some people love grilled cheese and will eat it until the end of their lives.
But I want to try it all out, "Kristen Stewart said bluntly about her bisexuality.
'When I bite in grilled cheese once, I think, 'Oh this was cool, what comes next?'.
Arguably the Hollywood star's best-known relationship was that of her "Twilight" colleague Robert Pattinson, who ultimately went bitterly apart.
Despite all this, the fraternal performer assures to "Harper's Bazaar" magazine: "I was seriously in love with everyone I datet.
Or do you think I'd played it? '
After her separation, Kristen admitted she was bisexual: 'I've always lived dualism and seriously believed in it.
So it has never confused or hindered me.
I just never liked not being taken seriously. '
She suffered particularly from it, according to "Bang Showbiz," but in school time, when she preferred to dress like a bub: "Not all girls are typical girls.
That really hurt me a lot.
When I was eleven, the kids told me I would look like a bub.
I felt really attacked, scared and ashamed.
Now I look back and think to myself: 'Girl, be proud of you!'.
Especially to the public, they don't like to explain their love life: "People expect you to relate in a certain way and that annoys me.
And maybe some describe me as ungrateful, but I don't like having to justify myself in front of the whole public. '
West Virginia governor announces he is changing party
. West Virginia's Democratic governor, Jim Justice, announced Thursday night at a rally with President Trump that he would change the party.
Whether you like it or not, the Democrats have moved away from me, "Governor Justice said.
'today I'll tell you with a lot of prayers and a lot of thought... today I'll tell you as a resident of West Virginia, I can't help you anymore if I'm a Democratic governor. '
The rally erupted in cheers.
"Tomorrow I will change my registration to the Republicans," Justice added.
'as a coach, I'd say it's time to play another game. '
Mr. Trump previously promised a major announcement at the West Virginia rally.
Mr. Trump won West Virginia with 42 points, and Justice did not approve Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice, who according to Forbes is the only billionaire in the state, was elected in 2016.
Forbes notes that he owns coal mines in five states, and inherited a coal business from his father.
It is worth about $1.59 billion.
Meanwhile, the Republican National Committee issued a statement Thursday night saying "Governor Justice's party change is another blow to a Democratic Party that would prevent us rather than work to make our country great again."
"With only 15 governors and the control of the fewest legislative bodies in history, Governor Justice's announcement is just the last rejection of a party that is without leadership from top to bottom and unable to find a positive, unifying message," RNC Chairman Ronna McDaniel said in a statement to CBS News.
Coe praises' honest 'Russian apology for doping scandal
The world's head of athletics, Sebastian Coe, on Thursday praised what he described as an outspoken apology from Russia to a doping scandal, but he reiterated it was not the moment for the country to be re-admitted to the sport.
Russia's athletics chief Dmitry Shylakhtin said during the IAAF congress on the eve of the World Athletics Championships that his country's banishment from the sport was correct and that he was determined to fight doping.
He said he was sorry for "all the athletes who were snapped away gold and silver medals in competitions."
Despite his comments, the IAAF Congress voted to uphold the ban, which was imposed in November 2015, after a report by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) found evidence of state-sponsored doping in Russia.
"I thought it was a very open response today, a very honest presentation," IAAF President Coe told reporters.
"The entire Council and the entire Congress were pleased that the Russian Federation has recognized with itself that it has experienced some pretty hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is redesigned."
Coe said he was also "pleased" that Russia accepted the criteria for its reintroduction.
"I think it was a very constructive day and I think progress has been made, but Congress supports the task force's recommendations that this is not the moment to reinstate Russia," Coe said.
'we've got to do everything in the next few months to normalise this situation.
The guiding principle has always been that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the spoiled system, "he added
Nineteen Russian athletes will compete as neutral players at the World Athletics Championships, which begin in London on Friday, according to the strict IAAF criteria.
The head of the IAAF task force, Rune Andersen, said Monday that Russia still needed to meet some of the criteria for re-establishment.
Drug tests were still inadequate and banned coaches were still operating freely, he told reporters in London after a talk at the IAAF Council.
Funeral act for soldiers downed in Mali
At a funeral ceremony in Fritzlar, North Hesse, about 1000 people of the two soldiers who were killed in a helicopter crash in Mali thought.
The ceremony took place in the cathedral city on Thursday under high security precautions.
Defence Minister Ursula von der Leyen (CDU) said nothing about the outstanding cause of the crash.
However, she described the two inverted pilots as "patrons of their expertise."
"We bow to this highest sacrifice they have made on behalf of the Federal Republic of Germany," she explained.
The 33-year-old major and 47-year-old Stabshauptmann from North Hessen had died in West African Mali on Wednesday a week ago.
Their coffins were transferred to Germany and brought to the Fritzlarer Dom Sankt Peter on Thursday accompanied by a death guard of the Bundeswehr.
At lunchtime, only the members of the church departed.
After that, the funeral ceremony began in the circle of the family, close friends, representatives of the Bundeswehr and politics.
Among them were Hesse's Prime Minister Volker Bouffier (CDU) and the inspector general of the Bundeswehr Volker Wieker.
Mourning guests laid down roses, the relatives stood arm-in-arm at the coffins.
In front of the church, Fritzlarer and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on a canvas.
Defence Minister von der Leyen described the inverted soldiers as "highly decorated" and deployed.
The Stabshauptmann had built up the flight operation of the Tiger fighter helicopter in Fritzlar and was one of the first six trained Tiger pilots of his regiment.
Volker Bauersachs, commander of the regiment, which includes the soldiers, also declared: "If this crew could not avert the crash, then none would have been able to."
Doubts about the UN mission in Mali did not show Minister von der Leyen: The deployment was dangerous.
But he was also of high importance "to a country from which we are separated only by two states," she said.
After the funeral, the coffins were brought out of the cathedral.
When and where they are buried, the Bundeswehr did not provide any information on this.
Prince Henrik doesn't want a grave next to his wife
Danish Queen Margrethe's husband (77), Prince Henrik (83), does not want to be buried next to his wife after his death.
That was shared by the Royal House on Thursday.
Traditionally, the Danish royal couple is buried in the cathedral church of Roskilde.
Sculptor Bjørn Nørgaard already completed a sarcophagus for the two.
The Queen agreed with her husband's decision, it was further stated in the notice.
Where Prince Henrik will be buried is still unclear.
But he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland.
Prince Henrik had never made a haze from the fact that he wasn't happy with his title.
After the throne ascent of his wife Margrethe in 1972, he would have liked to have become king.
He retired in 2016 and, in doing so, also puts off the title of "princess beam."
Since Henrik did not get the title and function he wanted in Denmark, he does not see himself as equivalent to his wife - even after death, explained Lene Balleby, the chief spokeswoman for the Danish Royal House.
Where the 83-year-old's final resting place will ultimately be is still unclear.
But he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland, but in Denmark.
He likes the country he has worked for over the past 50 years.
The native Henri de Laborde de Monpezat, son of a French noble sex, had met Margrethe in London in 1965.
On the Thames, he worked in the French embassy.
During his later wife the expressions of sympathy of the people always flowed, Prince Henrik had a heavy stand in his nearly 50-year reign with the Danes.
In an autobiography, Henrik commented about the first few years in Denmark: "A few months after I arrived, everything I did was criticised.
My Danish was fluctuating, I preferred wine instead of beer, silk straps instead of knitted socks, Citroën instead of Volvo, tennis instead of football.
Even for the Gauloises I smoked instead of Virginia tobacco and who in this country had a reputation for being the brand of socially critical intellectuals, I couldn't hope for leniency.
I was different.
I seemed content with that position and not ashamed.
These were two mistakes! "
Prime Minister Weil wants swift new election
CDU and FDP ahead of possible majority in Lower Saxony
Lower Saxony's Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) is in favour of a swift re-election of the country's parliament after the loss of the red-green government majority, but he does not want to resign.
Because spoke out on Friday in favour of the dissolution of Parliament.
Earlier, the surprise exit of a Green MP from her state parliament faction in Lower Saxony had plunged Prime Minister Stephan Weil's (SPD) government into a severe crisis.
Five months before the official date of the state election, the red-green coalition in Hanover lost its narrow one-vote majority in parliament to the opposition from CDU and FDP.
Previous Greens MP Elke Twesten justified her move with the non-nomination for the 2018 election in her constituency in Rotenburg (Wümme).
"I see my political future in the CDU," she declared in Hanover on Friday.
CDU group leader Björn Thümler wants to recommend to his group that they be included.
With that, CDU and FDP together would have 69 seats in Lower Saxony's Landtag, SPD and Greens 68.
So far, the relationship has been reversed.
The new Landtag will be elected regularly on 14 January next year.
Thümler said the red-green state government must now decide whether it could continue to govern in this situation without a majority.
Stephan Weil believes, however, that it is essential for the Landtag to decide its self-resolution as quickly as possible.
The CDU Group is expected to decide on its way forward on Tuesday.
The state constitution also provides for the possibility of the Land Day depriving the prime minister of confidence and electing a successor.
"Our Constitution offers several options.
These opportunities need to be looked at legally cleanly, "Thümler said.
"All questions will be discussed calmly if they are legally properly examined."
Thümler called Twesten's move "somewhat curious after all."
The politician herself stressed: 'I'm not a traitor.
I feel very good. '
She described herself as a follower of black-green.
The Greens called on the breakaway MPs to return their country parliament mandate.
"We assume, of course, that she will return her Landtagsmandat, which she has received via the Green Land List, with immediate effect," state chairmen Meta Janssen-Kucz and Stefan Körner shared.
Greens leader Anja Piel said: "We deeply regret Elke Twesten's decision."
She deliberately chose not to have a debate in the group.
"Even against the background that there were no differences in content, we cannot understand this step."
SPD chancellor candidate Martin Schulz condemns the transition of Lower Saxony Greens MP Elke Twesten to the CDU as a betrayal.
"The behavior of former Greens MPs in Lower Saxony is not only betrayal of voters, but also betrayal of red-green," the Social Democrats "federal chief wrote on Facebook on Friday.
He supports Prime Minister Stephan Weil's (SPD) decision to have the Landtag quickly re-elected.
Leaving Twestens costs red-green in Lower Saxony the majority.
The politician "in her hurt vanity and in her frustration put her personal interests before the welfare of the country," criticised SPD Secretary General Hubertus Heil.
"It is a scandal that the CDU in Lower Saxony is taking part in this dirty game of intrigue and is trying to make political capital out of it."
Lower Saxony's CDU group leader Björn Thümler wants to recommend his MPs include Elke Twesten in the CDU.
The SPD's group leader in the Bundestag, Thomas Oppermann, accused Twesten of falsifying the outcome of the 2013 state election with personal career thinking.
The CDU was the strongest force in front of the SPD at the time, but SPD and Greens had a skin-thin majority of one vote in the country's parliament.
Agriculture Minister in the interview - How do we protect ourselves from poison eggs, Mr Schmidt?
Germany discusses contaminated eggs.
How could the scandal happen?
How can consumers protect themselves.
Agriculture Minister Christian Schmidt (CSU) speaks and answers in an interview with the German editorial network (RND).
Mr Schmidt, how can consumers protect themselves from poisoned eggs?
I can only encourage all consumers to look closely at the eggs in your fridge and check the stamp print.
The Federal States provide the latest information on the affected egg batches on the consumer protection portal www.Lebensmittelwarungs.de.
Affected eggs should be destroyed or returned.
Even if, according to everything we currently know, a health hazard is practically excluded.
Is Aldi now taking on the best possible crisis response - all eggs out of supply - because the central role of the reconnaissance is not really perceived by the federal agriculture minister?
Food monitoring is the responsibility of the federal states.
Nevertheless, my house has opened up immediately and has been in close contact with the authorities of the countries since it became known that Germany was affected.
All information and risk assessment are available to consumers.
Trade, like manufacturers, must ensure that the products sold are marketable and safe for health.
If the maximum residue level of 0.005mg / kg is exceeded in the case of eggs, these are not controllable.
However, unloaded eggs can be sold and consumed.
This time, businesses are not to blame.
Are production companies and consumers sitting in the same boat?
According to the current state of knowledge, the production plants are not directly responsible.
On the contrary, they have to face economic damage as a result of alleged illegal practices by service providers.
As always, there are too few controllers in the event of an emergency.
Is there only a lack of staff or a coherent competence?
It was precisely the official controls that exposed the process.
The truth, however, is that food fraud and criminal energy can never be 100 percent excluded.
It is precisely for this reason that a consistent investigation of such events and the transfer to the public prosecutor's offices in cases where criminal offences may occur are of crucial importance.
I have already made it clear on several occasions that I expect full information from the responsible authorities.
Is regular alarmism really necessary in food scandals?
Consumers have the right to obtain only safe and marketable food.
When an unauthorised insecticide is used in the food industry, consumers are rightly outraged.
The armoured means have put manufacturers, traders and consumers in a situation that is absolutely not necessary.
In principle, it must be clear that the illegal use of the insecticide Fipronil in the keeping of food-supplying animals is unacceptable and must be terminated without delay.
This must be done consistently and with high pressure at all levels.
I expect all the competent authorities to provide a speedy and complete explanation of the facts.
How football's financial rules affect Neymar's move to Paris
The rules, aimed at preventing unfettered spending by European football clubs, will not disrupt Neymar's world record transfer from Spain's Barcelona to France's Paris-Saint Germain.
Any consequences will still come for Paris Saint-Germain from UEFA, as the senior organisation overseeing the European game has the power to ban teams from accessing the prestigious Champions League tournament.
Financial fair play rules, launched by UEFA in 2011, mean PSG will have to prove at some point that Neymar's transfer was funded without major losses.
Barcelona have paid 222 million euros ($262 million) to buy the Brazilian out of his contract and Neymar will receive a salary that will be several ten million dollars a year.
Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymar's move to France.
PSG can certainly make the money loose for Neymar to sign and take him to a galaxy of other stars, given the team's funding from Qatar's energy-rich ruling family.
Clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money on acquiring players, but must counter with legitimate sources of revenue that allow them the break-even point in their football-related business.
FFP was conceived by Michel Platini after his election as UEFA president in 2007.
The former French player believed that clubs that had taken on huge debts in their pursuit of success effectively cheated and risked ruining themselves when banks or owners withdrew their support.
In 2011, FFP shifted from focusing on clubs "debt to monitoring their losses.
The change meant that the business model that Roman Abramovich originally used at Chelsea in 2003 - bought a club with potential and then invested heavily to improve the squad and build a global brand - should become a tougher affair.
Clubs can accept losses of €30 million during the current three-year FFP investment period, which runs until 2018.
And although Platini fell into disgrace from the presidency in 2015, his UEFA successor Aleksander Ceferin remains committed to deterring from excessive spending.
"Certainly FFP is not dead and we will certainly reinforce the rules for the future," Andrea Traverso, who is in charge of FFP at UEFA, told The Associated Press last week.
Although PSG have paid Neymar's buy-out clause in a lump sum, it can distribute the amount for accounting over the duration of his contract.
Neymar has signed a five-year contract so that the redemption envelope for the next five years, amounting to €44.4 million, can be expelled in the annual financial statements.
The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 hit PSG, along with Abu Dhabi, which is owned by Manchester City, with the heaviest sanctions.
PSG received a €60 million (then $82 million) fine, which was later slashed to €20 million - and it was ordered that team members for the 2014 / 15 Champions League season remain limited to 21 players instead of the otherwise normal 25 players.
UEFA are looking for clubs that could try to outlist their financial oversight by inflating their revenue through companies linked to the owners of a club.
While a Qatari company could sponsor PSG if the value of sponsorship were to exceed standard market rates, UEFA would not let this be considered a legitimate income.
That is exactly what happened in 2014, when UEFA decided that the value of PSA's sponsorship was inflated by the Qatar Tourism Authority.
It has been reported that part of PSG's payments to Neymar could come via payments from the 2022 World Cup organising committee in Qatar.
But PSG and Qatar 2022 have disputed that Neymar will become World Cup ambassadors and such a maneuver for UEFA regulators could be easy to figure out.
The previous sanctions against PSG mean UEFA will be even more attentive to any attempt to circumvent the rules.
UEFA had no preparatory talks with PSG over Neymar's transfer, saying on Thursday the people familiar with the situation.
They spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to discuss the PSG situation.
The latest published reports show PSG made a profit of more than 10 million euros in 2015 / 16 with sales of 542.4 million euros.
The accounts for the last financial year have yet to be released.
PSG expect Neymar's arrival to be a boon for sponsorship deals, merchandising and jersey sales.
The club expects sales to rise by at least 30 per cent after signing.
The Spanish league was clearly irritated to see one of the best footballers go and it tried to prevent Neymar's move away by claiming that PSG would hurt the FFP.
"It's a clear case of" financial doping "with the club and the state," La Liga president Javier Tebas told Spanish daily AS regarding Qatar's eventual ownership of PSG.
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, whose club are owned by an American sports tycoon, shares La Liga's reservations against a state that funds a club.
"It's the consequence of ownership and that has completely changed the entire landscape of football over the last 15 years," Wenger said on Thursday.
"Once a country has an association, everything is possible.
It's going to be very difficult to respect the financial fair play because you can go different ways or have different interests when a country has such a big player to represent a country. '
Swiss is looking for a new shock supplier
In recent years, Chocolat Frey has made board chocolate for Swiss.
Now the sweet collaboration is coming to an end: The airline is rewriting the order.
Swiss spokeswoman Meike Fuhlrott confirmed, at the request of the news agency sda, a corresponding report from Friday's newspaper "Northwest Switzerland."
According to current planning, the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018.
The products would be checked every two to three years and subjected to quality control.
"We are very pleased with current supplier Chocolat Frey," the spokeswoman said.
Around 17 million small red-white packed shock panels at 14 grams each year distribute the flight attendants to passengers before landing.
Swiss did not want to provide details about the costs.
According to "Northwest Switzerland," industry insiders estimate the order volume at 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the Migros subsidiary generates annual sales of around 1 billion Swiss francs.
But the advertising effect is all the more important: It is a prestigious order for a Schoggie manufacturer.
Swiss does not want to reveal how many applicants there are in the new tender.
Only Swiss manufacturers are eligible.
According to the newspaper report, Chocolat Frey wants to seek a renewal of the contract beyond spring 2018.
For sda, the largest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not available for comment.
Swiss has been distributing chocolate panels on board its flights since 2006.
Before the Swiss signed a contract with the Migros daughter, Barry Callebaut had delivered the chocolate tablets in collaboration with Hug.
The opportunity to place the logo was introduced by Swiss two and a half years ago with the launch of the collaboration with Chocolat Frey.
The airline works with different Swiss chocolate producers.
On long-haul flights, First Class customers are pampered with treats from Confiserie Sprüngli, in business class wet passengers Schoggi of Lindt and in economy class Schoggi by Chocolat Frey.
Swiss Schoggi from Chocolat Frey also distributes on the short circuit, both in business and economy class.
Athletics - Discus Olympic champion Robert Harting reaches World Cup final
The three-time world champion is fighting for a medal in the final on Saturday.
His brother Christoph, Olympic champion of 2016, had failed in the national World Cup standoff and could only look at the discus contest from the grandstand.
Also with the first try, Polish defending champion Piotr Malachowski, who threw 65.13 yards wide, qualified for the final fight.
Nostalgia goes into the niche in "Wet Hot American Summer" and "Comrade Detective"
This repetition of the story is simultaneously nostalgic because of the glorious days of characters of the 80's, for the 90-year grunge era (when presenters David Wain and Michael Showalter turned the sketch comedy "The State" for MTV), and for themselves - that is, for 2001, before her stars, as Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd went to bigger things.
As a cultural artifact, it is equally a parody and an embodiment of our Facebook-enabled era of permanent memories.
But as a franchise, it feels like time is running short.
"First Day of Camp" worked surprisingly well, not just because of its absurd humor (it included an original story for a talking can of vegetables spoken by H. Jon Benjamin).
By stiffening to the core of the gags - middle-aged actors play spirited children who will grow up - they nevertheless managed the impossibility of winning back the last part of the joke.
"Ten Years Later," with its adults now playing adults, is less emotionally ingrained and its parody goes more by the watering-edge principle, including a reef on the stalker films of the 90's like "The Hand That Rocks the Cradle" ("The Hand Who Wins the Cradle").
At one point, a character buzzes through an Apple powerbook, some inline skates and "a bunch of other things from 1991."
Many of the central stories are the same.
The adorable Coop (Mr. Showalter), now a novelist, still hasn't forgotten Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) still hasn't lost his virginity.
And there's another crazy-maligned plot in which Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter) is included, now backed by George H. W. Bush (a well-managed impression of Michael Ian Black).
As always, the excourses are the best part of the franchise.
It's especially fun to see the eternally young Mr. Rudd showing Matt Dillon's underlip beard of "singles," whose former big-man-on-camp Andy now feels like an old cracker.
It's the moments of random madness that could fuel this franchise like a kind of repetitive "Seven Up!" Series, until he reaches what I take as his logical conclusion: "Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later," whose final scene will show the gang as they watch the film premiere of "Wet Hot American Summer" will visit.
"Comrade Detective" on Amazon, meanwhile, recalls a different kind of nostalgia: The Cold War revival of "The Americans," the film "Atomic Blonde" and even "GLOW" with its East-versus-West wrestling iconography.
Created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka, the comedy with Rhys Thomas as director admits to being a found TV series: A Romanian drama of the Eighties with the two policemen as friends, two officers from Bucharest fighting for truth, atheism and the path of Marxism-Leninism.
The main roles - a hard-pressed Gregor and an idealistic Iosef - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu ulici, whose dialogues are synchronised in English by Channing Tatum (also an executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
It's an ingenious idea.
But it's not much more than an idea.
There are some nice gags to watch (the police spend the time watching chess on TV, as Americans might do with football).
And the list of famous speakers - including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny - makes for a decent play 'Find the Voice out'.
But "Comrade Detective" is so committed to the veracity of a desperate propaganda drama - a killer wearing a Reagan mask is included - that it often plays like a single.
At six long episodes, it pulls away, and comedy isn't fast or frequent enough.
"Comrade Detective," which has been edited to a lesser length, could better deliver its agitprop satire as Gregor and Iosef repeatedly visit the American Embassy, whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men engulfing a bunch of hamburgers.
The message for the imagined communist audience is that Western culture can make everything a fodder for a money.
The fictional Romanian creators were not wrong: We even do it with our own recent history and with theirs.
Blow to drug mafia in country
The police succeeded in a blow against the Italian mafia in Baden-Württemberg.
On Wednesday morning, numerous objects were searched in the Schwarzwald-Baar-Kreis, in Rottweil, Konstanz, Esslingen and Stuttgart, as the prosecutor Konstanz announced on Friday.
15 defendants between the ages of 25 and 77 were arrested and arrest warrants have already been issued against them.
Officials also secured larger amounts of marijuana and cocaine, firearms, as well as several hundred thousand euros.
Two people were arrested during simultaneous raids in Italy.
There were German arrest warrants against the two suspects Italians.
The two are therefore likely to be shipped to Germany.
Italian and Bavarian investigators were involved in the action.
In total, more than 300 police officers were on duty.
Members of the Mafia are accused of organised drug crime, serious violence, attempted murder and robbery and extortion.
Since the summer of 2016, the Prosecutor's Office has been investigating Constance against organised drug trafficking in southern Germany.
There was a lively exchange between the prosecutors in Konstanz and Palermo and the investigators of Kripo Rottweil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily.
As a result, the large-scale operation was also accompanied by four officials from Palermo on Wednesday morning.
The investigation focused mainly on Italian nationals with close ties to the Italian mafia.
An incident on May 27 in Hüfingen, where several shots were fired into a restaurant early in the morning, is also likely to go to the gang's account.
Weise laments big gaps in foreigner register
"Data from citizens who should not show up": According to a report, the foreigner register in Germany has significant shortcomings.
This leads to some serious errors in asylum procedures.
According to a media report, the Federal Government Commissioner for Refugee Management, Frank-Jürgen Weise, has drawn attention to major gaps in the immigration central register.
Deficiencies in the data registered there could lead to "partly serious misdecisions" in asylum procedures and deportations, Weise warned in an analysis available to the "Süddeutsche Zeitung."
According to the data, the register covers ten million people of foreign nationality, including about 5.7 million from non-EU countries.
The data is therefore managed by about 600 immigration authorities in Germany.
Because the data had not been sufficiently maintained, the data quality had not been good in parts so far.
In individual cases, data from 1921 had been found, "by people who have long since ceased to be alive, or by citizens who have become German citizens and should not appear in the register."
"Faulty data input can significantly slow return processes," the report continues.
In addition, the statistics on people subject to leave include EU citizens who do not have to leave at all.
Such false assignments, however, "led to a distorted debate about how to deal with expatriates," the analysis reads.
Meanwhile, the federal government has apparently begun sending refugee families with under-16-year-old children back to Italy when they have entered from there.
This is evident from an internal paper by the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF), reports the "Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung."
The paper therefore states that the BAMF has been carrying out such procedures "concerning families with children - with the exception of infants and infants - back to Italy since 1 June 2017."
This was virtually impossible since the end of 2014, according to the newspaper, referring to the difficult situation on the ground.
Under the Dublin agreement, refugees are in charge of the EU state they reach first.
If a migrant travels to another EU country, that state can send him back to the country of entry.
On the grounds, the Office now writes: "In the meantime, the reception capacity for families with underage children in Italy has increased considerably."
Italy has provided guarantees for the reception and accommodation of families.
Even the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) considers these commitments to be sufficient.
Other EU states would also send refugees back there under the Dublin agreement.
The internal political spokeswoman for the left faction in the Bundestag, Ulla Jelpke, criticised this decision: "Families with children are in danger of receiving conditions that are contrary to human rights and of endangering the welfare of children because of the deficiencies in the Italian asylum system."
Second best result achieved
A total of 220 litres of blood from people living in Oberreichenbach has already been provided by the blood donation service for other people.
At least of the twelve citizens who were awarded Friday.
Especially Jürgen Greule, who now shared 50 litres of blood with his 100 donations.
Traditionally, at the local council meeting, the community appreciates the multiple willingness to donate blood.
"It's ingenious how our body is designed for it and we pay respect to the donors who provide their blood to strangers, even more unselfishly," underlined Mayor Karlheinz Kistner.
"A single donation of blood helps several people," explained the head of the German Red Cross (DRC), Holger Maisenbacher, as the reserves are broken down into their components.
For example, three people could benefit from a blood donation.
At the same time, Maisenbacher reported on the actions that will be carried out in Oberreichenbach in the spring.
"This year, we scored the second-best result with 114 donors," the DRK county preparedness manager said.
Obviously the change to the theatre house a few years ago led to higher numbers of participants.
Even before that, Thomas Bockstadt, Susanne Reichle, Sandra Schöck, Thomas Reichle and Meta Umbeer were among the multiple donors and were awarded for 50 blood donations each.
Half as many book Herbert Mair and Dorothee Riexinger, while Tamara Pfrommer, Petra Schleeh, Stefanie Stoll and Uwe Vetter gave off their life juice ten times each 500 millilitres.
The Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged after weak economic growth and weakening inflation dampened speculation of a rise.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain "sluggish" as it kept interest rates on family incomes amid mounting pressure.
Policymakers on the Bank's Monetary Committee (MPC) voted 6 to 2 to keep interest rates at 0.25%, with fewer members aiming for a rise this month as weak economic growth weakened support for an increase.
In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank reduced its 2017 growth forecasts to 1.7% and 1.6% for 2018, warning that pressure on household incomes would continue, with inflation expected to rise to just under 3% in the autumn.
But it signalled that interest rate hikes would become necessary in the next few years to rein in Brexit-fuelled inflation and it said borrowing costs may have to rise more than expected in financial markets.
Members also voted to withdraw part of the mammoth stimulus package issued a year ago after Brexit.
It will call for time for the funding plan to provide cheaper funding for banks from next February, although it has been said that it is now expected to provide £15 billion more under this scheme - with £115 billion of sterling.
Minutes after the decision on the interest rate, the bank said: "In the MPC's central forecast, gross domestic product (GDP) remains weak in the short term as pressure on household real incomes continues to weigh on consumption."
On interest rates, she repeated that "some tightening of monetary policy" would be needed to cool inflation and a "slightly larger" scale than markets expect.
Markets are currently forecasting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020.
However, the bank stressed that increases would be "gradual" and "limited."
The bank's downward adjusted growth forecasts for this year and next are compared to the 1.9% and 1.7% forecast in May.
It maintained its growth forecast to 1.8% in 2018.
The pound fell against the dollar and the euro after those news.
The pound fell 0.5% to $1.31 and fell 0.4% to €1.11.
The decision to make no change comes after recent disappointing growth figures dampened rising expectations for an interest rate hike and GDP rose to 0.3% in the second quarter from 0.2% in the previous three months.
Growth is expected to be 0.3% in the third quarter, although it will recover slightly after the bank towards the end of the year.
The latest inflation report offered little enthusiasm for households affected by rising inflation and minor pay rises as the tightening first gets worse before it will then improve.
She added that monetary policy cannot "prevent" the drop in income over the next few years, but added that wages will recover "significantly" at the end of their three-year forecast.
The economy is also boosted by rising demand for British goods, due to the weak pound, which will offset some of the lower consumer spending.
The decision comes a year after cutting interest rates to 0.25% last August following the shock EU vote that caused the fall in the pound.
The bank estimates it is likely to take four years for this to fully reach prices and the economy.
Ahead of the Bank's latest ruling on interest rates, the call for an interest rate hike had risen as inflation ratcheted up pressure on hard-pressed households, with three policymakers calling for a rise to 0.5% in July.
Inflation fell to 2.6% last month from 2.9% in June, although the bank said it was expected to do so and will pull it back in the coming months.
The bank said the overreach relative to its 2% target was "entirely" attributable to the weak pound.
Andrew Montlake, director at Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: "Given the recent drop in swap rates, the mortgage market is likely to become more competitive again as lenders look loudly for deals and want to end the year in a positive way.
The market looks particularly good for those where existing deals are phasing out and the new mortgages are closing, and many with fee-free options and low rates are becoming increasingly popular. '
NHS (The National Health Service) is to prescribe controversial HIV drug 10,000 people
Patients will be given access to "transformative" HIV prevention treatment from September after a fight in the High Court against funding the drug in the NHS.
NHS England announced that a preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) taken before intercourse, which can reduce the risk of infection in high-risk patients by around 86 per cent, will now be delivered by the health service via a first three-year study for an estimated 10,000 people.
He agreed to fund the trial after the Court of Appeal upheld a High Court ruling last year that the NHS had the authority to pay for the PrEP despite claims that local authorities should fund it.
The move, announced on Thursday, was hailed as an "important new intervention" by NHS England chief executive Simon Stevens, while the National Aids Trust (NAT) described this as a "crucial moment."
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to allow people to register and more clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced across England in April 2018.
Preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a consequence of HIV preparations taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
Studies have shown that PrEP significantly reduces HIV transmission in those at risk of infection.
Taking prep before intercourse means that just enough drugs are present in a person's body to prevent HIV infection.
Such medications can be taken every day or so already two hours before sexual intercourse.
Those eligible for treatment include gay or bisexual men, transsexuals and people with HIV-positive partners who have not been successfully treated.
In clinics, suitable participants are identified who agree to the study, including men, women, transgenders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by antiretroviral treatment.
People who live in England and are registered with a family doctor can also sign up for possible participation in their local participating sex clinic.
The programme will be £10 million and NHS England signed a contract to supply the drugs this week following an international competitive procurement.
The study aims to assess the full potential of PrEP by gathering clinical evidence on how it is targeted, absorbed and implemented on a large scale.
Stevens said: "This major new intervention should complement and overhaul the far-reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV.
It is another milestone in the more than three decades of sustained progress in addressing one of humanity's greatest health challenges. "
Deborah Gold, chief executive at NAT (National Aids Trust), said: "This is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV.
Prep, if targeted at needy and vulnerable people, offers the opportunity to change the English HIV epidemic.
From September onwards, people at high risk of HIV will have access to this NHS-funded attempt in England to develop a new tool that is truly individually controlled and not subject to negotiation with a partner, leading to the improvement of many, many lives.
We warmly welcome this announcement. "
Ian Green, chief executive of the Terrence Higgins Trust, said: "The priority must now be for the study to be carried out quickly across the country and for no one at risk of HIV to be left behind.
Now that the PrEP test medicine has been procured, we are on track to protect more than 10,000 people infected with HIV. "
Sharon Hodgson, shadow health minister, said: "The start of the PrEP process is welcome and overdue after months of delays and hesitant implementation by the government.
The evidence shows how transformative this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and end the transmission of this life-changing infection.
This attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the benefits of PrEP.
Now it's important that this study is carried out as soon as possible across the country to protect people who are HIV-infected and that it will help us get a step closer to ending the spread of HIV in society. '
Living the big life: Upstairs and clever designer tricks have turned this little Earls Court apartment into a generous home
Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, downsized from a large house in Knightsbridge to an Earls Court apartment in 2014.
It's on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it's proof of the new design that Joanne hasn't packed and sold her bags.
"Before that, I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger room," Joanne says.
'i was looking for something comparable to my price.
I was shown this apartment in Earls Court, and she had the same high ceilings.
I fell in love with her and made an offer that day. '
Since the first visit, the 1,000 square foot apartment has been completely overhauled.
Originally a one-bedroom estate with a nested layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - Joanne wanted to add storage space and an intermediate floor to make the most of the generous ceiling height.
'i wanted high ceilings, big windows, lots of light.
That was my requirement, "she says.
To that end, she commissioned Erfan Azadi's architecture and design studio Duck & Shed from Notting Hill to use the 12.5-foot-tall ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Joanne.
The ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms on top of each other, so the architectural challenge was to create an intermediate floor where you could stand.
Erfan had to think creatively to solve the pretence.
"The steelwork is quite complicated," he explains.
'we had to arrange the rooms in such a way that they were stacked on top of each other without us having to blink.
It wasn't just about building a simple platform, but putting the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below. '
That arrangement allowed Erfan to place two rooms at full height on top of each other - with plenty of extra drama.
For the intermediate floor, a classic copper light window from Retrouvius looks down over the glamorous living area.
Mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program.
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre, space and light.
At both ends, a short corridor is mirrored to make it work longer.
In the kitchen, mirroring feels like a window into another room.
At the entrance, mirrored units provide space for all of Joanne's bricks and glasses.
By perceiving a more glamorous space, the beauty of the living room can lock up the kitchen if it is not used.
Foldable kitchens are nothing new.
The special thing about this is that it is a garage door.
"A bit of engineering went in there," Erfan explains of the steel-reinforced, furry MDF door.
'it's counterweight, so when you push the door up it glides very easily. '
Thanks to the clever use of space and storage space, Joanne was able to gain an extra 16 m ², an extra bedroom and an improved layout.
"At the end of the day, you're going to sell the floor space - or how your property is valued," Erfan says.
'in a rudimentary form, a real estate agent will enter and perform a calculation based on the floor size. '
Here, they have managed to enlarge the floor space while using high-quality materials that give the space its luxurious advantage.
"The materials are the things that touch you and that therefore help create an emotional bond in a home," Erfan says.
'you don't fall in love with the electric sockets in the walls.
These are important, but they don't play with your heart. '
It shows that an apartment can transform itself by good design and increased square meters of something by default into something quite amazing.
In fact, like Joanne, you might decide not to leave this one.
Brothers fight over $500 million property empire
Two brothers are in contention for one of Victoria's biggest real estate empires worth over $500 million four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty.
Former director of the Carlton Football Club and developer Colin De LUTIS lives in a villa in Toorak, just three doors away from his younger brother Paul, who took him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and business assets should be shared.
Paul had wanted to withdraw from the family business since 2014, but a sharp dispute over the separation is taking place in the Supreme Court.
Along with her mother Anna, the brothers own 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars, accumulated since the family bought a store in Smith Street, Collingwood, in 1973.
There, the Westco family founded jeans and grew into a chain of 160 retail stores.
It was sold for $85 million in 1999.
That money has been invested in real estate, and De LUTIS's portfolio now includes offices in the city centre, the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento, the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller, as well as shopping centres in the suburb.
According to an agreement with her late father, Colin - described by Paul as a "principal operator and the dominant personality" in the De LUTIS family - owns about two-thirds of the company's assets and Paul about a third.
A court file says this means Colin owns property worth $316 million and Paul worth $176 million.
The division of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem point for Paul.
"The divisions proposed by Colin left him with what I thought was the best objects," he wrote in a first affidavit in 2015.
Last Friday, after several failed meditations, the Supreme Court's first hearing took place.
The brothers are also now struggling to control the existing business - of which Colin, Paul claims, ruled him out.
Colin argues this is not true, but accuses Paul of incompetently managing some possessions.
In an early affidavit filed by Colin, he says he hopes to settle the dispute.
"My Italian heritage dictates that the family is the most important priority," he wrote.
Costs are rising in the case, with hundreds of pages containing affidavits, emails and reports from companies including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and with leading lawyers including Allan Myers, QC, and law firms held by both sides.
Ms De LUTIS and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated milk bars and delicacy shops from the late 1950 "s and bought a shop in Brunswick in the early seventies.
They used security to buy the Collingwood property where Colin opened the family's first Jeansladen.
Colin says he started Westco there when he was "in my last years of high school when Paul was still a young child (about 10 years old)."
Anna De LUTIS says she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to pass on their property amicably to their sons.
'Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to land in court, 'she wrote.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De LUTIS corporate group, with Colin claiming that Mark was paid $10 million and Luke $26 million when leaving the company.
Both Luke and Mark were, Paul says, "embittered about the terms of their financial separation."
Colin has held back very much despite being a former AFL board member and being the TV star's best friend, according to a 2015 biography by Eddie McGuire.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De LUTIS and their lawyers.
Only Colin responded by text message to say "I really can't say much" because the case was before the courts.
"It is very, very sad that my brother Paul has decided to sue me and pull our family name through the courts," he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote in a letter to the court that he had tried to meet his brother's demands.
"Our father would not have wanted Paul and I to end up in our current dispute," he said, adding that he "still hopes for a solution."
On Friday, that hope seemed to be over.
"Our matter will be resolved by the courts in the near future," Colin wrote.
Trump's new chief of staff plans to curb the president's media abstinence.
Others have tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.
If so, he will be the first.
Politico reports that the new White House chief of staff plans to restrict the flow of information on President Trump - including news media reports - in hopes of keeping the chief executive on a more even course.
Here's a piece by reporter Josh Dawsey:
"When John F. Kelly, the new White House chief of staff, met with senior staff on his first day of work, he posed a major problem in President Donald Trump's White House that he wanted to fix: Bad information getting into the president's hands.
Kelly told staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in briefings - because the president would make better decisions if he received good information. '
Kelly's diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to tame Trump by overseeing his media diet.
President Trump's relationship with television stretches back decades - and now that he's in the White House, his television ad is still strong.
"If candidate Trump was upset because of unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he received fair coverage from posts that were to be persuaded," former campaign adviser Sam Nunberg told Politico in February.
Politico's Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that "the key to keeping Trump's Twitter habit under control, according to six former campaign officials, is to make sure his personal media consumption includes a steady praise."
Okay.
But the idea that Trump's Twitter habit has ever been "under control" is ridiculous.
Perhaps these campaign officials know something we don't know to others - that without their interventions, Trump's tweets would have contained even more ignition.
We're probably never going to learn anything about the tweets that Trump didn't send.
If his employees have managed to keep him out of trouble a few times, then their efforts have paid off.
But no one has consistently prevented Trump from causing controversy.
Part of the problem is that people in a White House made up of competing parties keep trying to advance their own agenda by presenting material to Trump that may promote their views from the world.
Politico - quite busy with this story - reported in May on advisers "preference to provide dubious information to the president for strategic reasons.
This was an example described by reporter Shane Goldmacher:
'Current and former Trump officials say that like a volcano, Trump can respond to negative press clippings, especially those with damaging leaks, and that he's bent on figuring out where those come from.
That is exactly what happened in late February, when someone maliciously gave the president a printed copy of an article by GotNews.com, the website of internet provocateurs Charles C. Johnson, who accused deputy chief of staff Katie Walsh of being "the source behind a heap of leaks" at the White House.
Although Johnson has been permanently banned from Twitter for harassment or that he has offered no concrete evidence or that he has made false allegations in the past and revoked them.
Trump read the article and started questioning employees about Walsh. '
Goldmacher added that then-Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and White House Secretary-General Rob Porter "tried to implement a system to manage and document the paperwork Trump receives."
How did that work out?
Kelly tries to do the same three months later.
Perhaps he will prove himself to be a more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his advisers are still striving for influence.
These immutable factors make Kelly's mission very difficult.
Most wanted criminals get mail from Europol
Since the address is unknown, the help of the population is requested and hoped for.
Police across Europe are sending (virtual) postcards to dangerous criminals on the run this summer.
Since the addresses of the wanted serious criminals are not known by nature, indications from the population are hoped for and requested.
Europol on Friday reported the action, which follows the "EU Most Wanted" advent calendar of winter.
Experience has shown that many refugees are hiding at holiday destinations, said Europol.
21 postcards were compiled for wanted criminals from 21 EU countries.
Since 2016 there has been the website www.eumostwanted, more than 2.5 million times it has been viewed.
36 of the online searches have been detained so far, at least eleven of them on the basis of post-publication notices on the website.
Travellers negotiate a ditch and return to 'millionaires' row
Some of the West Midlands's wealthiest homeowners are back on war footing with some determined travellers who negotiated a ditch drawn by the community to reclaim a field in front of their mansions.
Travellers have parked their 20 caravans in a field outside a wealthy street of Solihull called the "millionaire row."
They have brought horses, babies and an army of vans after they were only thrown out in May, but without being deterred by a ditch excavated by the council to prevent their incursions.
The tactful group found a gap in defence facilities and pushed their vehicles through a section that remained unobstructed to find a way.
Angry residents have urged the advice of Solihull, who said it was "useless to deal with the problem."
An anonymous resident said: 'They moved there on Monday night after being sent on by Bentley Heath where they threw stones at the passers-by.
The Council must be forced into action by shame, because it was useless in dealing with the problem.
The travellers were there in May, were moved on and are now back.
More arrived last night, probably even more today. "
She added: "Birmingham Council knows how to deal with this by keeping long instructions to protect their parks.
I live on Streetsbrook Road and I'm not happy to continue paying my community tax if the council can't even stop that. '
One local resident, who did not want to be named, said: 'It's ridiculous, we've only just seen the last round of these travellers just to be bullied by another round.
The numbers have increased this time and you've even seen a horse in the parking area. '
A Solihull Council spokeswoman said: "We are aware of an unauthorised camp on land beyond Streetsbrook Road and are working with Solihulls Police. We are taking the necessary legal action to allow them to move on as soon as possible.
To support our collection of evidence, it is very important that as many residents as possible report anti-social or criminal behaviour to the police by calling 101.
This helps to create a picture of the situation in which the court must consider when to present our case. "
From Birkenhof, Waldhotel Luise
From the former Hotel Birkenhof will be the Waldhotel Luise.
The house outside the gates of Freudenstadts is currently being renovated and is due to reopen on March 1 next year.
These are good news for the city.
After all, with the closure of the Hotel Birkenhof by the then Ambiente Betriebsgesellschaft mbH on April 13, 2014, around 30,000 overnight stays per year were lost at the time and revenue from the tourist tax was also lost.
In the autumn of 2014, in the face of dramatically rising numbers of refugees coming to the county, the hotel building was offered to the county council office as a collection shelter, causing controversial discussions.
The city prevented the accommodation of asylum seekers by setting up a building plan to secure the area as a hotel location.
The decision was not uncontroversial in the local council at the time.
But above all Freudenstadt's Lord Mayor Julian Osswald defended the hotel location and spoke at that time of serious interest in the house.
He should be right.
The group Luisenhotels with managing director Birgit Scherer, based in Bad Bergzabern, acquired the former Hotel Birkenhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it again a house of the three-star plus category under the name Waldhotel Luise.
The group has four houses with the Freudenstadt object.
Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Herrenalb.
They are called Hotel Luise, Luisenpark, Parkhotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise.
At the former Hotel Birkenhof, construction bags have been standing in front of the entrance for a long time, and when you enter the house, it becomes clear what extensive renovations are being carried out.
Floors were ripped out, blankets partially dismantled, old bathtubs removed from rooms.
The entire hotel building is a single construction site.
There is still a lot of work to be done by March.
"It's actually a nice hotel," Thomas Scherer says in conversation with our newspaper.
Everything is to be renewed in the Black Forest style.
The rooms are equipped with large walk-in showers, the entrance area is redesigned, new windows are installed.
Everything should later become "nicely close to the citizens," as Thomas Scherer puts it.
"We want to make a piece of jewelry out of it."
The facilities include a swimming pool, a wellness area and a meeting room.
One does not want to position oneself at the high level of the hotels in Lauterbad, but already at an upscale downtown level, Scherer points out.
The Waldhotel Luise, with its approximately 60 rooms, wants to set itself up broadly, Scherer explains further.
Both individual holidaymakers, groups or businessmen should feel comfortable in the hotel.
He has already had discussions with OB Julian Osswald and tourism director Michael Krause, according to Scherer.
The city's ideas are identical to those of the hotel group.
'we're on the same line. '
Asked about the level of investment, Thomas Scherer does not want to set himself exactly.
Just under a million euros, he reckons.
The exterior systems are also brought to the front, which is already clearly visible.
A large terrace is created in a courtyard, which will be accessible from the restaurant, which is open to the public.
Thomas Scherer is optimistic: "Freudenstadt is a good market."
Russia affair: Us special agent sets up Grand Jury
Special agent Robert Mueller is said to have deployed a so-called Grand Jury in the Russia affair surrounding US President Donald Trump, according to a report.
The body had started work in recent weeks, the Wall Street Journal wrote, citing people familiar with the matter.
The newspaper evaluated the move as a sign that Mueller had expanded and intensified his investigation.
The broadcaster CNN reported there were already initial subpoenas from the body in connection with a meeting between Trump's eldest son and a Russian lawyer.
Us intelligence agencies have long accused the Kremlin of deliberately interfering in the 2016 presidential race.
Mueller is investigating whether there was collusion between Trump's campaign team and Moscow in the process.
The focus of the investigation is on several men who acted as advisers to the Republican during the election campaign.
According to reports, Mueller also took more and more of Trump's private and business environment under scrutiny.
The "Washington Post" wrote a few weeks ago that the special counsel had personally brought Trump to the center, investigating the accusation of whether the president may have obstructed justice in the course of the affair.
The main task of Grand Jurys is to examine present evidence in possible criminal cases and to decide whether to bring charges.
Grand juries are therefore also called prosecution chambers.
Most of the time, they are switched on when they are major and controversial cases.
The procedure always takes place behind closed doors.
The body can also be turned on by the Public Prosecutor's Office to pre-load people for questioning under oath.
Subpoenas have already been issued around the encounter between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer, according to broadcaster CNN.
People involved in the meeting had been asked to make a statement, the report said.
They should also provide documents.
In addition to Trump Jr., Trump's adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner, as well as his then-campaign chief, Paul Manafort, were also in attendance at the conversation.
Legal experts said on US television on Thursday night that the deployment showed that Mueller did not let himself be intimidated in his work and that, if necessary, he wanted to act quickly.
It did not necessarily mean, however, that the Grand Jury would end up being turned on to decide on the prosecution.
Still, setting up the body is the start of a new phase in the investigations and a new cause for concern for President Trump.
Amid the new revelations, the president used a speech in West Virginia on Thursday night to portray the Russia affair as a campaign by his political opponents.
"The Russia story is a total invention," Trump said.
The issue gives Democrats a way to "feel good because they have nothing else they can talk about."
His special counsel, Ty Cobb, stated in an opinion piece that he knew nothing about setting up a Grand Jury.
But this also usually works in secret, he stressed.
The White House favours any action that accelerated the special counsel's work in a "fair" way.
Former FBI chief James Comey has said three times that it is not being investigated against the president.
There was no reason to assume that this had changed, the statement continued.
Mueller, though, had only been deployed after Trump fired Comey.
Because of that reprimand, allegations against Trump had become loud that he wanted to obstruct justice.
Comey said in June before a Senate committee that Trump had asked him to stop investigating then-national security adviser Michael Flynn.
The president is under great pressure because of the investigation.
According to U.S. media outlets, the White House collected material against the special counsel and his associates.
That sparked speculation about whether Trump wanted Mueller fired.
Unlike an independent congressional special counsel, such as in the Watergate affair surrounding later-resigned President Richard Nixon, Mueller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired by the Justice Department at the president's insistence.
Several senators from both parties, however, want to prevent such a move.
Two groups of Republican and Democratic senators presented draft legislation Thursday, after which the special counsel could no longer be dismissed as simply.
Antarctica: Giant iceberg drives in Antarctica
In Western Antarctica, a gigantic iceberg has detached itself from the scarcely seven-fold size of Berlin from the Schelfeis.
That was shared by the Bremerhavener Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday.
The colossus, weighing more than one trillion tonnes and 5800 square kilometres, will now travel north and will probably take two or three years until it has melted.
At 175 kilometres in length and a width of up to 50 kilometres, it is one of the biggest ice giants that researchers have registered over the past three decades.
A danger to people does not emanate from him.
The extent to which climate change has played a role in the demolition of the iceberg is unclear, according to research data.
Overall, however, there has been a series of unusual breakdowns of ice skulls in the region for around 30 years, the US Research Center for Snow and Ice (NSIDC) writes in a fact background.
According to many researchers, this could be related to global warming.
The now broken colossus has been a part of the Larsen-C-Schelfeis.
Schelfeis floats on the sea and is fed by large glaciers.
It grows further and further into the sea and breaks down regularly.
The Larsen-C Schelfeis is almost at the top of the Antarctic Peninsula south of South America.
North of this pedestal, the balance of waxes and breakdowns was disrupted several years ago.
A complete Schelfeis had disintegrated there, writes AWI researcher Daniela Jansen.
There is a lot to be said for the Larsen-C-Schelfeis to be in danger, because the front edge has never withdrawn as far as it is at present.
In addition, the ice sheet is under tension and can disintegrate if a piece breaks down at a key point.
Melting Schelfeis and iceberg doesn't increase sea levels as they swim on the water and displace ice as much water as it results after melting itself.
However, the loss of the pedestal causes the glaciers to flow directly into the sea and much faster than before.
This could possibly increase sea levels, but only to a small extent, writes the British research project on the observation of Antarctica (Midas).
According to AWI, the Larsen C-Schelfeis is Antarctica's fourth-largest scarf with almost 50,000 square kilometres.
At the transition from the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick, at the front edge to the free ocean about 200 meters.
It regularly breaks down there.
"Although it is a natural occurrence and we are not aware of any direct link to climate change, the ice shield is now coming into a more dangerous position," said Martin O'Leary of Britain's Swansea University.
"This is the furthest withdrawal since records began," he also confirmed.
Among scientists, it was controversial whether the Larsen-C Schelfeis will now grow again or return in the long term and possibly collapse, his colleague Adrian Luckman said, adding: "Our models say it will be less stable."
But this development will take decades.
Even though these researchers do not bring the demolition of this gigantic iceberg back to climate change, in recent decades a great many ice skates of the Antarctic Peninsula have disintegrated.
This long summit of Antarctica stretches towards South America.
According to data from the British Antarctic Survey research programme, the Antarctic Peninsula's ice surface has declined by 28 000 square miles since the 1950s.
The rise in temperature had contributed to the decline.
The Antarctic Peninsula has warmed by around three degrees over the past 50 years, making it one of the areas where the temperature rises the fastest.
CDU wants house rate at staff
Because it is becoming increasingly difficult to fill vacant jobs, the CDU is demanding to leave the employers "association in order to become more attractive.
It was only shortly before the summer break that the county day leaked 41 new posts in the administration.
More than 1100 employees and officials work for the county administration in Mettmann.
Now another 17 apprentices have their first day of work behind them.
The apprenticeships at the circle are obviously very much sought after.
There were around 620 applications for the places to be awarded this year.
Nevertheless, the circle still lacks staff to cope with the increased demands and tasks.
At present, there are still 50 unfilled positions in the Mettmann district.
Among other things, doctors and engineers as well as general administration forces are being sought.
The CDU wants to take the initiative together with the FDP and the UWG in the county day and to address the shortage of skilled workers in the administration.
According to the wishes of the parties, the administration should "develop a concept for personnel recruitment and personnel development."
The aim is not only to meet short-term needs for skilled workers, but to counteract the shortage of applicants in a future-oriented manner, it says.
The overall concept should be oriented internally and externally, show concrete measures for cross-entrants and include a training offensive, demand CDU, FDP and UWG.
That sounds like a good approach.
Because the circle has to do with personnel problems that you didn't know before.
Other cities advertise good officials and employees and offer more attractive terms.
There is talk of a genuine "competition of public employers."
In addition, there are a large number of employees who leave the service due to illness or age.
It is high time to act so that more jobs are not left unfilled.
But Klaus-Dieter Völker, head of the CDU group, goes further than the joint motion with his party.
He recently caused a fist-thick surprise in the county day, when he publicly questioned the staffing costs cap and stunned the other parties.
Peoples wants all options to be reviewed that allow for an exit from the municipal employers "association.
"If we do not come to a satisfactory solution here in the short term, the district administration with the trade unions - perhaps also in cooperation with the local towns - should aim for a house tariff," says Völker.
In doing so, the CDU is trying to pay the employees and officials better than the Public Service Tariff Regulations actually provide.
Salaries are currently strictly prescribed, increases or more money are only available if one changes to a higher level, which is oriented towards professional years.
But the tasks of the circle have grown more and more in recent years.
Only a few weeks ago, new rooms had to be set up in which employees took care of the provisions of the new prostitution protection law.
Not least because of the increasing number of asylum seekers, county councillor Thomas Hendele and county director Martin Richter have a problem: They have too little staff.
Italy tightens tone on NGO migrant rescue boats
Italy has warned NGOs using lifeboats for migrants in the Mediterranean that they will not be allowed to continue doing so unless they abide by new rules for their operations.
"If NGOs don't sign a new code of conduct, it's difficult to see how they can continue to work," Interior Minister Marco Minniti said in an interview with Turin daily La Stampa.
Minnitis's warning came a day after Italian authorities seized a boat belonging to the German aid organisation 'Jugend Rettet' because its team had effectively worked with traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration.
The aid organisation, which has only been in operation for a year, declined to comment on detailed allegations made by Italian prosecutor Ambrogio CARTOSIO.
"For us, saving human life is and remains our top priority, so we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment," the organisation said in a statement on social media.
'we can't judge any allegations currently being made until we have gathered all the information and can assess the situation. '
Italian authorities had been monitoring the boat of 'Youth Rettet', the Iuventa, since Oct.
Its crew are believed to be taking hose boat migrants on board, delivered directly to them by traffickers, and that the smugglers can depart so the ships can be used again.
At least one such meeting reportedly took place just 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast, according to the prosecutor's file, the contents of which were published by Italian media.
The crew are suspected of being beyond the authority of the Italian Coast Guard, which oversees rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons rather than any other motives.
Under the code of conduct, boats such as the Iuventa must above all have an Italian police officer on board overseeing their activities.
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have so far agreed to abide by the code: Save the Children, Moas from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain.
The latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be seen as unnecessary but acceptable as they would not involve "significant changes or disabilities" to their bailouts.
Among those who refuse to sign, the Nobel Prize-winning organization is Doctors Without Borders (MSF).
Minniti, meanwhile, said the number of migrants arriving in Italy after the rescue operations had fallen sharply in recent weeks, indicating that efforts to strengthen Libya's coastguard and cooperate with local mayors had borne fruit.
"In the last few days we have started to see light at the end of the tunnel," the minister said.
He announced plans for further talks with Libyan mayors this month on economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving those countries hoping to reach Europe.
Climbs and Trials
Nine Weilermer bikers, the "Berlin outpost" and two guest drivers met at Wachenheim in the North Palatinate to enjoy trials and sights for four days.
Three friendly guides were available for this purpose.
The accommodation in the Wachenheim Valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours.
Wachenheim's castle and wine festival was a welcome extra.
The first tour led to the Michaelskapelle above Deidesheim at hot summer temperatures along the vineyards.
It was followed by vantage points, partly on towers, from which one could look far beyond the Pfälzer forest and the upstream plains.
In between, there were always longer climbs, for which long trials rewarded.
On the second day we went to Bad Dürkheim to the Saline and the Volksfest Wurstmarkt.
Again, the vantage point was at the vantage point, connected by "flowery" trials and moderate climbs.
On the last two days many meters of altitude were announced again.
Caves, rocks, towers, castles, ruins and returnees brought welcome breaks.
In Bad Dürkheim, the bikers breathed in the open-air inhalation board healing sole.
Neustadt was also taxed.
After 173 kilometres and almost 4500 metres of altitude, the group had met the Palatinate Forest from its best side - sporting and cultural.
Console instead of turf - Bundesliga gears up for e-sports
Are the sports stars sitting in front of computer consoles in the future, instead of fighting through the wind and the weather over the stadium ramps?
The fact is: E-sports has long since become a serious industry, a lucrative business - including big stars, millions of fans and huge high-stakes tournaments.
This has also been recognised by the first federal league clubs, which are increasingly engaged in this area.
The VfL Wolfsburg started in 2015, later followed FC Schalke 04 and most recently VfB Stuttgart, which founded an e-sports department in mid-July and contracted two professionals for the FIFA 17 computer game.
"We hope that this will inspire completely new young target groups for the VfB," says Managing Director Jochen Röttgermann.
He is sure "that there are still a number of clubs on this train."
Next weekend, FIFA is organising the first "Interactive Club World Cup" in London, where the gamers of different clubs compete against each other.
In addition to Schalke and Wolfsburg, for example, Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain or the PSV Eindhoven qualified.
Robin Dutt also sees great potential in e-sports.
The ex-coach of Bayer Leverkusen and Werder Bremen, meanwhile, is advising an agency for virtual footballers.
"Real football has to deal with the 14 to 30-year-olds in particular, that the young people are still going to the stadium in the future," says the 52-year-old.
And: The clubs tried to conquer all sorts of markets, especially the Asian ones.
With prominent e-athletes under contract, you could be present online far more often in these markets than just sending the Bundesligamannschaft to Asia once a year.
What exactly is it about?
In the field of e-sports, computer games such as "League Of Legends," "Dota 2," "Counterstrike" or the football simulation FIFA are being fought at the competition level.
For a long time, as in normal sport, leagues have been established in which the professionals compete against each other.
And at the 2022 Asian Games, e-sports is already part of the official program.
But is it a proper sport at all?
For many, the notion is certainly in need of getting used to.
Ingo Frobous, too, has long grappled with the question.
For the professor at the German Sports University in Cologne, e-sports is a sport because it is competitive and shows many biological and physical reactions that are also found in classical sports - for example, increased heart rates, stress reactions, hormonal changes.
It also needs cognitive skills, a technical and tactical understanding and a rapid response capability.
Professional gamers should not only train at the console but also their bodies and pay attention to nutrition.
'the fitte player is a good player. '
However, Frobous also sees problems: "Doping is becoming more and more an issue."
Controls were difficult to carry out in online games, and the structures of classical sport were lacking in the scene.
The scientist positively emphasises the high integrative effect of e-sports.
The players are travelling internationally, this is like a big global family, there are no intercultural barriers.
A study by management consultancy Deloitte and the Federal Association of Interactive Entertainment Software (BIU) predicts rapid growth in e-sports.
In 2016, 50 million euros had been implemented in Germany, mainly through advertising, sponsorship and major tournaments.
In three years, sales are expected to reach 130 million.
This is little against the almost 2.4 billion euros of the Bundesliga.
However, e-sports are "no longer far from the other established sports such as handball, basketball or ice hockey," the Deloitte advisers write.
Internationally, many countries are already on.
Big markets are Asia and the US, where ex-basketball player Shaquille O'Neal and baseball star Alex Rodriguez join US team NRG eSports.
Hollywood actor Ashton Kutcher invests in eSport betting provider Unikrn.
There is also a lot going on in Europe.
In a Norwegian school, e-sports had been introduced as a teaching subject, Froböse says.
In the Netherlands and France, according to Dutt, first-league football clubs are now required to set up an e-sports department.
"Germany lags behind in European comparison," explains VfB board member Röttgermann.
Only to decay into nostalgia, and to clarify the old times, is no longer enough today.
The aim is to preserve the tradition of the association, but at the same time to align the company in the modern market.
"We live in a digitized world," Dutt also thinks.
'Here you can't hold on to the fact that only in football everything stays the same as it always was. '
Poison eggs ade - The egg alternatives to cooking and baking
In the meantime, almost all federal states have been affected by the scandal over poison-laden eggs.
Aldi Süd and Aldi North have responded and taken all eggs out of sale across Germany.
Only eggs are to be taken into the shelves, which demonstrably do not contain fipronil.
Michelle Carter convicted of texts pushing Conrad Roy to suicide
A woman from Massachusetts has been sentenced to two and a half years for encouraging her boyfriend to suicide through texts and calls.
Michelle Carter, now 20, will spend 15 months of her sentencing behind bars and five years have been suspended on probation.
Carter was convicted in June of negligent killing of Conrad Roy, who took his life on July 13, 2014.
Roy's father said at the hearing on Thursday: 'My family is uncomforting.
My son was my best friend. '
Carter was allowed to remain free until the appeal.
She had been faced with a maximum sentence of 20 years, but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy suffered from a mental illness.
Dressed in red trousers and a cream-coloured blouse, Carter stood there with tears in her eyes, with folded hands and down-facing eyes as she was convicted.
"Her actions have killed Conrad Roy," the prosecutor told the court.
'she ended his life to make her own better.
She didn't take any responsibility, "she said.
'she didn't show any remorse. '
But Carter's attorney said it was a "terrible circumstance she completely regrets."
However, Judge Lawrence Moniz said he did not find out that her "age or maturity or even her mental illness has a significant impact on her actions."
A prosecutor read a statement from Roy's mother Lynn Roy that said there is "no day I don't mourn the loss of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and how I deal with everything. I try to be there for his sisters despite all my pain that we will carry with us for eternity, "it reads.
Roy's sister, Camdyn Roy, said she was "haunted" by the realisation that she would never attend her brother's wedding or be an aunt for his children.
"No longer having this only person I've been with every day since I was born is a pain I will always keep with me for the rest of my life," she said.
The case appears to set a legal precedent as there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to call on another to commit suicide.
Carter was 17 when Roy was found dead from a carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle in 2014.
The case drew national attention after Carter's text messages revealed she had encouraged him to end his life.
"Hang up, spring from a building, catch yourself, I don't know, there are many ways," she said in several messages she had sent in the two weeks before his death while he was on holiday with his family.
In the moments before his suicide, she wrote, "You have to do it, Conrad" and "All you have to do is turn the generator on and you're going to be free and happy."
Judge Moniz said Carter sought attention through Roy's death and ordered that she should benefit from the case through any press.
The case has divided legal opinion.
Among the few defending Carter was Amanda Knox, who was convicted of murdering her British roommate in Italy in 2007 before being acquitted two years ago.
Ms. Knox, 30, posted a comment in the Los Angeles Times: "Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help, not prison."
Joshua Kimmich: Learning from FC Bayern's new mini-lamb
That Joshua Kimmich was allowed to run up as captain at the Audi Cup is no coincidence.
FC Bayern dare the Confed Cup winner a big season - extra motivation doesn't hurt there.
Something was different on his place in the cabin, that saw Joshua Kimmich immediately, even if the extra garment was very, very small.
But as far and wide on the second day of the Audi Cup, of course, there was no Philipp Lahm and no Manuel Neuer to be seen, he made the bind assigned to him stop at the arm.
"The coach hasn't announced it," the Confed Cup winner tweeted afterwards, following his first deployment as Bayern captain.
Well, the one-off could have run better than the 0: 2 against the SSC Naples.
But the sign from the coach could also interpret Kimmich like that.
Not the eight-year-old Arturo Vidal had been chosen as a game leader in the C-Elf, consisting of youth players, debaters and professionals just coming out of the holiday, but he.
The best way to distribute sugar is to those who have a lot of confidence that you want to keep at a whim.
So anyone who has been selected to take on the legacy of Lahm can only use a little extra motivation well.
Kimmich confirmed: 'That's what you want as a player: Take responsibility.'
On Wednesday, the 22-year-old flipped across the field as a mini lamb.
Right back, that's now his position, the white bind at the arm did its rest.
And at all, Kimmich acted in this starting formation like the one who can best take the rudder in his hand.
He gave instructions, tried to direct the uninked troupe.
He had a look for the whole thing, while many others were busy with themselves.
Vidal was able to overplay his lack of fitness (hardly worked); Renato Sanches was able to connect to the achievements of the Asia trip on the devil's way out (also worked only conditionally); and Sebastian Rudy and Niklas Süle did not turn up negatively in their first appearance in the Bayern jersey.
After all, that worked out quite well.
Süle ran up alongside Kimmich, Rudy from the standoff, both acting sovereign.
The well-known Napoli Storm often struggled, and Süle also tried to succeed a few times in the build-up of the game.
His colleague Rudy admitted that the result was "not as we hoped."
But he, too, showed a neat performance at the debut.
Game relocation, speed change: "For this style I was also brought."
How unusual this Bavarian world is for the new entrants was seen after the match.
Rudy, for example, did not give one or two in the catacombs, but determined six or seven interviews.
Kimmich said goodbye after a few crisp statements in the back of his new fellow players.
There he heard an interesting sentence from Süle: "I have already noticed what is going on here.
At Bayern you just have to win every game. '
After all, he no longer has to teach the new.
Alaba motivates ÖFB ladies
David Alaba believes in the success of our ÖFB ladies
Austria's best-known footballer signed up via Twitter shortly before the match and wished the ÖFB ladies all the best.
After all, the Bavarian Legionnaire is almost a club-mate of ÖFB captain Schnaderbeck and fiebert with our Ladys.
The Austrian football player's tweet of the year and Champions League winner should be a special motivational splash.
Our ladies might also need the famous Bayern Dusel well.
Company satisfied with Rhineland-Palatinate minister: Economy praises Wissing's pace
It was often irreconcilable, the relationship between the country and the regional economy, when Eveline Lemke (Green) was still Minister of Economy of Rhineland-Palatinate.
This is evident after more than a year in which the new economy minister, Volker Wissing (FDP), is in office.
At T V's request, chambers and companies from the region talk about a change in economic policy - and at the same time blame the old minister.
Frank Natus, chairman of the Association of Trier Companies (VTU), says: "Wissing takes up the wishes of the economy that Lemke has all blocked."
Natus sees the biggest U-turn in infrastructure policy: The closing of motorway 1 between Kelberg and Adenau is now at the top of the country's list of priorities.
Later this year, the ministry is hoping for a planning process, with construction law expected to stand by 2021.
The West bypass Trier also plays a role in the country's plans, which is in the urgent need of the federal transport plan.
The aim is to put the route into operation in December 2020, says ministry spokeswoman Cornelia Holtmann.
Natus sees this as a guide to supporting regional but internationally competing companies.
The Chamber of Commerce and Industry (IHK) Trier, as suggested by Wissing, is aiming for a Rhineland-Palatinate label for wine in order to increase sales in supermarkets and to halt the trend of German wine exports, which have been sacking for ten years.
In addition, Wissing has an open ear for people who want to start their own company, the IHK praises.
The Trier Chamber of Crafts sees an additional incentive for young apprentices in the new Masters bonus, says managing director Matthias Schwalbach.
It provides for a premium of 1000 euros for the passed master's examination and 2500 euros if graduates become self-employed within ten years of master training.
The homework list for the country, however, remains long.
At the same time, the country lacks the necessary personnel, says Jan Glockauer, chief executive of the IHK Trier.
Of 56 new engineers Wissing plans to hire mobility at the state-owned company, only 29 positions have been filled so far.
The IHK calls for more contracts to be awarded to external offices.
CDU group vize Christian Baldauf points to calculations by the Court of Auditors that the country is investing more than 20 million euros less in the maintenance of national roads than proposed in 2017 and 2018.
Frank Natus also expects a concept of the country to address the shortage of skilled workers in the region.
The previous broadband expansion in the country was also sobering.
In 2016, regional companies had rated network supply only at the Note 3.4 in an IHK survey.
They complained about stocky internet connections and breakdowns.
Ex-Minister of Economics Eveline Lemke, on the other hand, is currently out of politics and is still on the supervisory board of the wind power company Pro Wind.
The Green Group left Lemke on April to become president of a private college in Karlsruhe - where she already cleared the field again after four months due to inconsistencies.
Audi is to change 850,000 diesel cars - car makers face backlash
A day before Audi's announcement, BMW said it would offer to update the software in more than 350,000 vehicles.
The BMW chairman said the company believes "there are smarter options than driving restrictions," referring to European cities - including Munich, where BMW is based - to ban or restrict diesel cars.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it would modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions.
None of the companies described the ventures as a recall.
European automakers have strongly promoted the use of diesel cars in Europe and the United States to support compliance with rules on carbon dioxide emissions.
But the nitrogen oxides that emit diesel engines are considered carcinogens and can cause asthma.
The cost to automakers to install plants to neutralise exhaust gases emitted by diesel vehicles is also increasing, making it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of groping the powerful car companies and ignoring signs of the problem.
The companies are trying to avoid Volkswagen's mistakes, which include the use of so-called shut-off devices that could regulate emissions to comply with regulations when a car has been tested but are driving back in normal driving conditions.
Several Volkswagen employees have been charged in the United States, while others are being investigated on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former head of thermodynamics was arrested in Audi's engine development in Germany.
The former manager, Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio, is Italian and is therefore not protected from extradition and could face trial in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi was involved in German criminal investigations at Volkswagen after authorities accused Audi of having installed a system to circumvent emissions regulations in Europe, and a request focused on the United States was expanded.
The inclusion of Audi in the investigation could put a heavy burden on Volkswagen: The luxury automaker is disproportionately contributing to Volkswagen's profit.
This message has the raft on Saturday on the Isar
The city wants to protect the Isar.
In order for the Isar visitors to take part, a raft passes through Munich tomorrow Saturday, which has a special message.
If you go to the Isar again on Saturday, you will see a big raft between Flaucher and Reichenbach Bridge.
And that's not a usual raft, with Isar tourists.
But the construction department wants to clarify.
On the raft you can see a large infotrancy agent.
It shows a garbage mountain.
The kick-off to a publicity campaign to appeal to the Isar visitors.
With the motto "True Love is..." the understanding of the Isar as a protective wild flow should be sharpened.
Last summer the raft went over the Isar and again this year there are other actions and measures to achieve a considerate and environmentally conscious behaviour.
Mordillos Knollennasen and the laughter against suffering
Mordillo was, at times, one of the most publicized cartoon draftsmen, the knollennases of his figures are his trademark.
Even at 85, the Argentine is still drawing and working on a film.
His message: Laugh, "because there's too much suffering in the world."
Guillermo Mordillo was born on August 4, 1932, as the son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires.
In his first years as an artist, he beat himself through, among other things, as a draftsman for congratulatory cards - which frustrated him.
"The happiest day in my professional life was the day when lost into my job," he once said.
After stations in Lima, New York and Paris, he made the breakthrough in the late 60s: With the release of his cartoons in "Paris Match" and then also in "Stern" and other leading magazines around the world.
Even in China, Mordillo found many fans.
Time and again, the artist was inspired by cities.
Large, round Mordillo figures tumble into drawings with the sliding tower of Pisa, Big Ben in London and Red Square in Moscow.
In the early morning, according to his own data, he still sits at the drawing table today, working almost ten hours a day.
About calendars, puzzles, books for adults and children, T-shirts, plush animals and watches, his droll figures continue to find much spread around the world.
For six years he has also been working on a cartoon film and a TV series with his characters.
The main person in the film "Crazy Island" is a giraffe - Mordillo's most popular animal in his drawings - that has a thousand-filler as a counterplayer.
For the first time, his figures speak in the 3D film, which is due to come onto the cinema screen in 2019.
"I don't know exactly what they're going to say, it's weird for me," Mordillo says.
The script is not written by him.
That's why he's more likely to rely on the TV series, which, like its original drawings, is produced wordless.
Lavender from Provence threatened by climate change
He has become a symbol of Provence in southern France, but there is a warning that he is at risk of climate change.
Lavender is declining because of drought-reminiscent conditions and disease-borne insects, causing major headaches for scientists and farmers trying to find solutions.
Eric Chaisse, an expert at the Agricultural Research Institute CRIEPPAM in Provence, said: "The lavender in Provence is effectively at risk because the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change in recent years, which has brought much less rain in the spring and much more in the autumn.
This has an impact on the lifespan of lavender.
There's also a small zikade, a microbacterium that transmits dwarf zikades, and in very dry weather, there's a lot of it. '
And there's a lot at stake.
Lavender oil not only attracts holidaymakers, it is also very much in demand for perfume and cosmetics.
Eric Chaisse said: "Instead of having very long plant clocks with a large number of flowers, we have smaller, underdeveloped and either missing or weakened.
So we have fewer parts with essential oil. "
Solutions being considered include better water distribution and slowing evaporation from the ground, but also spraying the plants with a protective mix of clay and water and developing varieties more resistant to drought.
The town of Geisa in the Thuringian Rhön celebrates its 1200-year anniversary this year.
The highlight is this Saturday and Sunday with a medieval festival.
Krämer, guilds, dealers, vagants or a country hospital camp are to be experienced in the city centre these days.
The murder of a journalist underscores the growing threat in Mexico
The employees of the weekly Riodoce usually meet on Wednesdays to review their plans for reporting the recent chaos in the state of Sinaloa through organized crime, corrupt officials and incessant drug wars.
But that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security.
They have been told it is important to change their routines.
Two senior journalists are discussing what feels safer: They are supposed to take their children to the office, who were the target of an attack with grenades in 2009, or leave them at home.
Security experts have written three words on a panel at the front of the room: Opponents, neutrals, allies.
They ask reporters to suggest names for each column - no proof is needed, perceptions and abdominal feelings range.
There are drug smugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists suspected of being on the government's payroll or the cartels, a catalogue of criminals making the chaos of Mexico dangerous.
There is no rest from the violence, and while the bodies are piling up across the country, more and more journalists are in attendance: At least 25 since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012. 589 are under federal protection after attacks and threats, and so far this year there have been at least seven deaths in seven states.
Among the latter is her editor and inspirator of Riodoce, co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.
"The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs.
His absence is deeply felt, though his presence is present everywhere - a large photo of Valdez showing his middle finger with the word "Justice" hangs on the facade of the Riodoce building. Two reporters in the thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear T-shirts bearing his smiling face show with glasses or its typical panamahut.
The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and reporters discuss their shared themes, the trauma, their nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.
Although a Special Federal Prosecutor was established in 2010 to deal with the cases of journalists, according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists, only two criminal cases have been initiated.
As with most of the thousands of murders linked to drug trafficking and organised crime each year, journalists "killers are rarely brought to justice.
At Riodoce, they still insist on treating Sinaloa's violence, although they are uncomforting and although the terrain is now even more treacherous.
Without information about the killers, without justice, the meeting to discuss security has little benefit, Ibarra says.
"It's very stupid to waste my time in this workshop," he says.
'as long as we don't know the Why, we distrust everyone. '
On the morning of May 15, Valdez left the Riodoce newspaper's office in the state capital of Culiacan.
He only managed to drive a few blocks wide before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men. He was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot at him, presumably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with "Twelve River."
The gunman drove away in his car and damaged it nearby.
Valdez was 50.
He left behind a woman and two adult children.
Rumors tend to fly around freely in Culiacan.
But on the subject of Valdez, there is virtually nothing but silence.
Sinaloa had become one of the country's bloodiest battlefields since Guzman's arrest last year and extradition to the United States in January, as rival factions here struggle to fill the vacuum.
It doesn't matter that in Sinaloa, someone or several people are shot in the street every day or that the cemetery is full of ornate, two-story mausoleen for drug kings larger than many homes for the living.
Forget for a minute that there is a state of "calm" when only one cartel has control of the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trade routes to the United States.
Despite this, and despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, has crumbled with the guilt that he could not protect his friend.
He believes two misconceptions contributed to the murder.
First, there was the release in February of an interview with Damaso Lopez, a leader of one of the rival antitrust factions in the war with Guzman's sons.
This release may have angered the sons, suspected gang members bought up every copy of the issue once it was delivered to newspaper kiosks.
The second mistake was not to force Valdez to leave the country for his own safety after the seizure of another newspaper that published the same story.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is seen as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists.
He had survived for so long that his friends and colleagues assumed he would always be there.
He served as an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003, when he joined forces with five colleagues to set up Riodoce and sold $50 worth of holdings.
In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to conduct journalism without encountering the drug problem," Bojorquez said.
Over time, the newspaper earned a reputation for courageous and honest reporting, and sales and advertising increased.
Reporters loved being able to publish hard-hitting investigations without fear of censorship, and readers were intrigued by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else dared treat.
Eight years after Riodoce was founded, she received the prestigious "Maria Moors Cabot Award" for her coverage in Latin America.
That same year, Valdez won the Committee's International Press Freedom Award for Protecting Journalists for his courage in pursuing Mexican drug history, wherever it led.
He voluntarily admitted he was scared.
"I want to live on," he said at the time of the CPJ award.
Drug trafficking in Sinaloa "is a way of life," he said last October in an interview with Rompeviento-TV.
'you've got to take on the task that falls to you as a journalist - either that or you're playing the dummies.
I don't want to be asked, "What did you do in the face of so many toters... why didn't you say what was going on?"
The Riodoce team misses Valdez, the fun bird who could curse like a dockworker, the friend who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.
They trusted his routine.
He would always wear his hat.
He would always go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, and always sit there at the same table.
Now they ask: Was his love of routine his spoiling?
His death has also forced them to question their own assumptions about how best to do their job and stay alive in the process.
"They don't like it when you deal with their wives, their children, their clean shops, their clandestine runways" to move drugs.
"These things were not allowed," Bojorquez said.
The result, even in the best of times, is a high level of self-censorship and self-preservation.
Trust his own instincts.
If it smells wrong, stay away from it.
The hassle is, the editor of the Riodoce Andres Villarreal said, that "smell a sense that can be deceived... and then the thing happened to Javier."
The old rules, as he and others say, no longer apply in Sinaloa - just as they do in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states where a toxic mix of lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home.
The landscape is constantly changing.
In the room where Riodoce employees met for security training, no cell phones were suddenly allowed. Days earlier, it became known that spyware sold exclusively to governments was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.
Outside, two police officers sought shelter from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shadow of a tree.
They were commissioned by the state government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-story building in a middle-class neighborhood of Culiacan.
Half in the joke, some of the reporters wondered if these officers are among the 50 percent of police officers the governor himself described as untrustworthy.
It's been months since reporters went to the mountain landscape, where drug gangs are de facto under control.
For this week's edition, Riodoce has latched on to three main stories.
There was the murder of the brother of former well-known boxer Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.
They also had an exposé to government spending that focused on the governor's hometown.
And there was a group carrying out a kidnapping at one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the prosecutor's office.
There was no official word on who was kidnapped or how it happened, so caution was required when it became time to write what everyone in the city knows: That the restaurant is a favorite local of drug dealers and authorities.
A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician belonging to the ruling Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), which dominated all political levels almost the entire century.
Several PRI governors have recently been accused of high-profile cases of corruption.
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents at that local, including one in which a son of "El Chapo" Guzman escaped a military raid.
Just a few months earlier, readers would have viewed Valdez's column as the best-informed source about the kidnapping.
"We would have known before what happened," said Villarreal, 46, nicknamed "El Flaco" because of his slim body stature.
'Now all channels of communication with our sources are broken. '
Valdez's office has been rededicated to the storage room for signs and stickers protesting the killings of journalists because staff have become something they themselves would never have expected: Activists on behalf of the press.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez snapped a few signs and went to the prosecutor's office the next morning for a demonstration because of another journalist.
Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez was killed, in the western state of Michoacan.
A burned body has been discovered and officials say based on DNA tests that it is his.
Across the country, journalists have become louder by writing down "SOS Press" on sidewalks and buildings in organized protests.
That day, the director Bojorquez is away in Washington, trying there to gather international support for the judiciary in the Valdez case.
At a meeting with Sinaloa's governor the day after Valdez's assassination, Ramirez accused the authorities of spying out journalists and letting them kill them for telling the truth.
She has since asked for her to be reassigned by the government because she is concerned that her anger has hurt her objectivity.
Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were "surrounded" by organized crime, government officials involved in it and an indifferent society.
In his latest book, "Narco-Journalism," he wrote that reporters are not only killed by drug gangs, but also on the orders of politicians and security forces who stuck under a blanket with organized crime.
The media watchdog group "Articulo 19" assigned more than half of the attacks on journalists to police and officials last year.
"In Mexico, you die because they want you to keep your mouth," Ramirez said.
Obviously, the killings have a deterrent effect.
No one forgets the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago.
Her body was found along with a note allegedly signed by the Zetas cartel: "Here I am because of my reports."
A computer keyboard and headphones lay next to her severed head.
Some branches have chosen to close, such as the El Norte newspaper in the northern border state of Chihuahua after the murder of correspondent Miroslava Breach in March.
Others continue, as El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did after her director's assassination in 2004.
In 2010, the Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed the drug cartels with a lead article on the front page with the caption, "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists have fled their home states, or even the country.
It's a painful decision.
It's hard to find work in exile, and they're still watching the streets and looking for dangers.
And sometimes they are hunted as it appears to photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered in 2015 along with four women at an apartment in Mexico City three months after fleeing Veracruz.
For those who stay behind and continue work, it's a daily dance with high-risk choices.
Ibarra, who once wanted to be a poet, admits the drug trade frightens him.
"Mexico goes to hell, and that's why I became a reporter," he said.
At midnight last Friday, when the last issue had already ended, Riodoce's editors sat on the sidewalk in front of the office and drank beer when at once all their phones started toting.
A series of shootings involving gang rivals and security forces near the seaside resort of Mazatlan had left 19 confirmed dead.
The war continued to escalate, as promised by a series of cartel embassies in the region.
From the brothel edge, they posted the news on Riodoce's website via mobile phone.
The front page had to be changed the next day.
Sirens heaped up nearby - another shooting in the area.
Bojorquez took a look at the cops holding guard to see if they were in readiness.
If they were afraid at all, they didn't show it.
Under the formidable portrait of the newspaper's fallen founder, whose middle finger was visible to the whole of Sinaloa, Riodoce's staff followed his tracks.
"How can you just think of closing, too," Bojorquez said, "when on the same day that Javier was murdered, the intern asked me to send her to the streets for coverage."
Dinosaur used camouflage to evade its enemies
At first glance, it looks like a statue, albeit a terrifying one.
Now, researchers have found that the first findings of a Canadian miner's incredible rhino were so well preserved that experts described it as "Mona Lisa the dinosaurs."
It was so well preserved that they could even find that his scruffy skin was of reddish brown - and they said she had had something of an "awkward past."
The report in the journal "Current Biology" described it as "the preserved armored dinosaur ever found, and one of the best dinosaur specimens in the world."
The fossil is a newly discovered type of nodosaur that lived in the middle of the chalk period between 110 million and 112 million years ago.
His incredibly well-preserved condition has stunned researchers who describe it as' truly remarkable '
According to reports in National Geographic, the armored plant eater is the best preserved fossil of its kind.
It was found by Shawn Funk when he grub at the Suncor Millenium mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011.
He encountered something that seemed out of place from the surrounding rock, and decided to look more closely.
The fossil he discovered was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.
They spent the next six years uncovering the wild animal within the 2,500 pound (1,100 kg) heavy ground clump.
After all this hard work, the finished result is now ready to be revealed.
"If you're just flashing a little with your eyes, you could almost believe it has slept," said lead author Caleb Brown, a scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature can be seen.
'it will enter science history as one of the most beautiful and best-preserved dinosaur specimens - the Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs. '
Researchers have found that although this plant eater is covered with an armor and resembles a changing tank, it was likely threatened by meat-eating dinosaurs.
The heavily armored dinosaur used a red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and used a shielding technique known as counter-shading, which is also used by many modern animals.
This would have allowed it to blend better into its surroundings and evade its enemies, experts say, suggesting it was threatened by larger dinosaurs.
The 110 million-year-old creature from the Nodosaurs family first made headlines in May and is now on display at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.
Researchers have now studied the wild animal and called it Borealopelta markmitchelli after museum technician Mark Mitchell, one of a team that has spent more than 7,000 hours carefully uncovering it.
The astonishing preservation of the specimen enabled Dr Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and shape of shed and armour across his body.
They discovered the counter-shading, a common method of defence in the animal kingdom, meaning the top of the creature was darker than its bottom.
Although countershading is common, the results are surprising, as the size of borealopelta far exceeds that of the animals living today.
It suggests that the dinosaur was chased by enough pressure from flesh-eating dinosaurs that evolution favored concealing confrontation as a means of survival.
But most contemporary animals that employ the counter-shading - think of Rehe, Zebras or belt animals - are much smaller and more vulnerable than prey, signaling that this nodosaur was exposed to a real struggle for survival.
"Strong predator behavior on a massive, heavily armored dinosaur shows just how dangerous the dinosaur predators of the chalk age must have been," Brown said.
Chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the dinosaur's skin was red brown.
Scientists continue to examine the animal for clues about its life, including its preserved intestine content, to find out what it has eaten as its last meal.
They believe the dinosaur, when it died, ripped into a river and driven out into the sea, where it sank on its back to the seabed.
At the time, Alberta was as warm as South Florida today, and rivers and oceans probably spread far further inland than they are today.
"This nodosaur is really remarkable because it is completely covered with preserved puppy skin, but is also preserved in three dimensions and retains the animal's original shape," Brown said.
'the result is that the animal looks almost the same today as it did in the early chalk age.
You don't need to use much imagination to reconstruct it. If you're just shivering a little with your eyes, you could almost believe he's at sleep. '
The chalk time was a time when huge theropods, flesh-eating dinosaurs standing on two legs traversed the earth.
Although the king of them, the Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions of years after Borealopelta, the armored dinosaur was chased by some of its fearsome ancestors.
These include the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38-foot (11.5m) long, six-ton heavy monster.
The scientists, whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology, believe Borealopelta was sunk in the sea after death and mumified in the mud.
The creature was found by Shawn Funk when he grub at the Suncor Millenium mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011.
According to the museum, it is the world's preserved armored dinosaur, including skin and armour, and is complete from the snout to the hip.
The creatures were on average about 18 feet (5 feet) long and have weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).
It featured two 20-inch-long laces that ran off his shoulders.
The researchers believe the armored plant eater was swamped through western Canada until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea.
But the dinosaur's underwater burial preserved its armour in exquisite detail.
The petrified remains of this particular specimen are so well preserved that the skin remains still cover hollow armoured panels along the dinosaur
As Michael Greshko has written for National Geographic, such a level of conservation is as' rare as a win in the lotto.
The more I look at it, the more confusing it becomes.
Petrified remnants of the skin still cover the hollow armoured panels that carry the animal's skull.
His right front foot is by his side, his five fingers are priced upwards.
I can count the scales at his sole. '
In the thunderstorm: Mass carambolage on A8: Many injured
Violent accident on Thursday night on the A8: Just under 30 vehicles are involved in a mass carambolage.
There are numerous injured, kilometre-long traffic jams - and gaffers.
About 20 people were injured in a mass carambolage on the Stuttgart-Munich (A8) motorway late Thursday afternoon.
According to the police, about 5 p.m. between the connecting points of Adelzhausen and Odelzhausen (district of Aichach-Friedberg), nearly 30 vehicles were interconnected during a thunderstorm, including probably trucks.
At first there was no information on the exact number of people injured.
It was light to medium-serious injuries, a police spokesman said.
A large supply of emergency vehicles was at the scene of the accident.
The A8 was completely blocked in the direction of Munich.
In the direction of Munich, a backlog of about ten kilometres was formed.
As an AZ reporter reports, massive disabilities also occurred on the counter-carriageway - through numerous gaffers.
The fire brigade noted the hallmarks of the vehicle drivers, who are now expected to face severe penalties.
Shortly after 6: 45 p.m., a second accident occurred on the A8, this time between Augsburg and Dasing.
There had been a collision between a car transporter and a passenger car.
A rescue helicopter was on the way to the accident site.
German Railways: Group tests' comfort check-in '
It's a moment that almost everyone has experienced before: Nothing punishing you sit in the train and sleep.
Or one is deepened into his work and just has an ingenious thought.
And then: Pufff.
Comes the creator and wakes an unsanft or rips the passenger in the middle of the workflow.
Ticket control.
But the times of interruptions are soon over.
Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the merciless ticket control.
One simply confirms by mobile phone that one takes his place and thus devalues the ticket.
A test operation is currently underway on two routes.
"If the offer arrives, we extend it.
It is then expected to be available on many more long-distance routes in Germany early next year, "a rail spokesman said.
"Comfort Check-in" calls the train the ticket devaluation without a creator.
In order to be able to use them, however, some prerequisites have to be met: You need a smartphone or a tablet.
And you have to have an online ticket booked - which is what most passengers already do.
You also have to buy it via the train's app, the DB Navigator, which is anyway the most convenient way to book tickets.
And last but not least, you need a seat reservation.
Because the "comfort check-in" works like this: You climb into the train, call your ticket under "My Tickets."
A button for electronic devaluation will then appear with the test customers.
The train attendants receive a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is on the train and has taken the booked seat Y.
When the train attendant comes to square Y during ticket control, he knows that there is a passenger sitting there with already devalued online ticket.
So you can continue to sleep, keep working, keep silent.
The "check-in" has two advantages: One for the customer, one for the train - which in turn should be used by passengers.
"Those who want to travel relaxed without ticket control by our train attendants simply check in on their own in the DB Navigator.
This allows passengers to make their travel time on the train more personal, "says Michael Peterson, DB Fernverkehr's marketing board.
Second plus: "And our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs."
Those who often travel by train know that in addition to delays and missed trains, ticket checks are among the biggest annoyances.
Because often you have, but in any case one of the passengers does not have all the documents you need to devalue online tickets.
Either the credit card or the identity card is missing or otherwise a document to be presented.
The result is endless discussions between train attendants and passengers, which leads to poor mood in the compartment or large room and delays in controlling one's own ticket, and ends up taking the Schaffner the time to take care of other concerns.
Only a small number of test customers can still use the new service.
And that also only on the connections ICE 915 Dortmund-Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart-Essen.
Other train numbers on the same route are not yet unlocked.
How an activist came to learn the answer to the question: "Whose Streets?"
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shaken up to her core.
Just a day after she arrived in New York City, the St. Louis-born sat on the bed of an Airbnb apartment she rented and scrolled through Facebook on her phone.
She stumbled across a post from someone from high school.
"Police have just killed an 18-year-old child and it's still lying in the street," it was said there.
Confused as no one else had posted the information on her feed, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
A user with the handle @ TheePharoah was constantly retweeted on her timeline.
The rapper from the St. Louis area was in the process of tweeting live the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old who was killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Mo.
He posted a picture of Brown's lifeless body stretched out in the street and would stay there for four hours.
"That's wild," Ferrell thought to himself.
But death was nothing new to her and her community.
She put off her mobile phone to return to tweets about people on Canfield Drive later in the evening.
There were photos of the police tape and people screaming, and of a man claiming to be Brown's father wearing a sign with the caption: "Ferguson's police just killed my unarmed son!"
She watched a live feed where a policeman stood in front of a group of protesters with a barking dog.
In another video, she said, another policeman unsecured his rifle and shouted, "I'm going to kill you... animals all."
"This is not common," Ferrell recalled her statement.
'that's not the kind of murder we've become accustomed to and that we can call typical. '
At that moment, I felt shaking frost.
I was angry and crying. '
She booked a return flight and went home the next day.
After landing at 11 p.m., she picked up her 6-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided the two would head to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson in the following three years is the subject of a new documentary, "Whose Streets?," in cinemas from 11.
It is a story of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and resilience that exists from the point of view of the people who live in the community and have filled the streets to demand answers.
As Ferrell drove to Ferguson with her daughter, who wore a floral dress and matching gown, the two discussed a conversation they had countless times before that morning "about the black experience and black condition."
"You remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe in?" She recalled what she said.
'we're going to Ferguson now because police killed an 18-year-old boy and that wasn't right.
I couldn't take them, "Ferrell said later.
'the thing that happened today is a culmination of what happened in the past.
She needs to know it and see it and be raised in it.
It must be well developed, know not only activism and organization, but also the different layers of black experience and black constitution, and what we need to do to become free to free ourselves.
Even though I'm lucky enough to give her an experience where she personally doesn't experience blatant racism, she's no different from the next black women's child.
I feel like I would do her a disservice to keep her away from it. '
The first station when they arrived in Ferguson was at South Florissant Road, a location opposite the police authority that became a camp area as campaigners waited for the possible non-charge of Officer Darren Wilson.
There, Ferrell and her daughter connected with a local business owner who was doing lunch.
They prepared bags and helped pass them on to protesters.
Slowly, a new kind of activism for Ferrell began to take shape.
"My activism totally changed after August 9," she said, noting that as a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, she was president of the Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on food justice and health inequalities in black communities.
"I had no experience in organizing.
It's all come. '
Weeks later, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, one of the film's co-directors, during an evening demonstration.
Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar just wanted to "document" what happened.
One question came to Ferrell's mind: "Do you want to document or are you trying to find a story you can exploit?"
That skepticism was nurtured by countless cases of people, often whites - in a community that benefited from their pain and resilience.
As Folayan explained in a recent interview, "We had heard that people born and raised in Ferguson didn't centered their voices and we wanted to do it differently."
Folayan had already worked with then-co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the field known for his activism around Todestrakt occupants.
His engagement brought Ferrell closer to the project, along with six other locals, the team followed by "Whose Streets?" In the years after Brown's shooting.
"This documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks to us. We talk," Davis said.
'that was the main thing for me, how these people are portrayed, because that's how I'm going to be portrayed. '
The goal was not to focus on Ferrell's experience - to show that the movement is "not a Messiah leader, but a community coming together," Folayan said - she proved to be the film's most open participant.
As a result, documents from "Whose Streets?" Show surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrell's life as she falls in love and marries her wife.
"I felt like I was naked," Ferrell said, laughing as she saw the finished product for the first time.
'but I've understood there needs to be some vulnerability in this work and in the humanization of black people. '
In addition, Ferrell's story repeats the role of black gay women in the broader Black Lives Matter movement.
Two of the movement's three founders, who coined the film "BlackLivesMatter" on social media after the killing of black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012, identify as gay.
"Black, gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement overall," Ferrell said, "and therefore we are constantly fighting on different fronts.
Black, gay women have to bear the brunt of everything. '
Folayan agreed to note that "the movement is really held up by black women and many black women."
She insists, however, that "this is not an affirmatic type of action," in which Ferrell was selected as the heart of the film due to her identity.
"She was the person who was shaking up that energy," she said.
'it's no coincidence, even though she was on the front lines because there's so much at stake in a life at these intersections as a black, gay woman.
You can feel their energy through the screen. "
Meanwhile, the news cameras in Ferguson have long since disappeared, but the racial links between the community and police continue to exist.
Ferrell is on probation for 2 ½ years because of blocking a highway at a demonstration.
She describes the socio-political atmosphere of the area she calls her home: "A mess."
Still, she clings to a chant and she feels committed to that memory since she took to the streets in Ferguson three years ago.
'it's our duty to fight for our freedom.
It's our duty to win.
We have to love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose - except our chains. "
From 'dream' to 'size craze': TV readers discuss bit gallery
The bit gallery moves people, though it's far from built.
But the idea of a shopping centre on the south end of the pedestrian zone has been dividing the population into advocates and opponents since the first presentation in 2009.
Cold leaves the subject barely one.
The topic is also discussed on our Facebook page "Volksfreund Bitburg."
While some say to the bit gallery, "That would be a dream" (Anja Becker) or "That would be really great" (Nicole Schausten), comes from the other side: "Don't need a human being" (Siggi Betzen) or quite simply, "Size Wahn!" (Lars Scholz).
While proponents rely on a gallery to attract more customers to the city, which the rest of the shops also benefit from, opponents fear that the pedestrian zone will then bleed out.
In addition, the gallery is planned on the site of the Farmers Market Hall, where 13 direct marketers offer their products.
This will end with the start of construction work.
The gallery makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - to Beda Square with possibility to sit outside.
Simone Zimmer: "We have been buying in the Farmers Market Hall almost weekly for many years.
Mainly our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of the countrywomen are always very happy.
We also discovered the butchery for us.
We would like to see a chance to maintain this offer even during and especially after the construction of the gallery.
In other cities, there's that, too.
Especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting. "
Gerd Densing: "Whether direct marketers settle in a market hall in the gallery depends on the amount of rent.
But this is unlikely to be low in the new project. "
Eva Kilic: "What shopping palaces in Bitburg?
Whether it's clothing, shoes, drugstores or supermarkets, I find that superfluous.
There is already enough of that in our city.
You can see how many shops are empty here - some for months and years.
However, since there is not even a regular weekly market here, it is all the more important that we at least retain the market hall.
After all, the goods offered there are fresh, are mostly offered directly by the producer and are also inexpensive.
As you can see, shops in a shopping centre are only rented by larger companies, because the rents there are often not sustainable for a retailer.
It is a pity that special shops are almost no longer available and what is left of them will probably disappear. "
Wolf Fandel: "A shopping centre with a market hall doesn't fit together for me.
And the gallery doesn't fit Bitburg.
Above all: Where should the farmer's market hall go during the construction period?
The old Edeka would be the solution - even in the long run, if the bit gallery actually comes at some point.
Or does the Gespenst Bit-Galerie manage to sell all the shops from Bitburg before? "
George Marquet: "That just won't work.
And a shopping center that stands empty doesn't need anyone, either.
In my opinion, it would have been better to promote a proper farmers' market instead of this gallery.
But for a farmer's market hall, thanks to the insanely many - I think - senseless construction projects in Bitburg, there is no place left.
When the farmers "market hall is broken, a piece of culture will disappear again."
A fitting resemblance: Artist creates portraits with Chelsea Manning's DNA
In the middle of the Fridman Gallery room in New York, many faces can be seen - white, black and brown, almost imperceptibly equal - hanging on cables from the ceiling.
The 30 portraits were created by artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from cheek tubs and haircuts sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent the excerpts from the Fort Leavenworth prison, where the former Secret Service analyst was serving a 35-year prison sentence after she made public classified diplomatic notices via the WikiLeaks website.
The new exhibition, which opened on August 2, is called A Becoming Resemblance (A matching resemblance).
She is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline united her expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a Transwoman and landmark dissident whose conviction was transformed by Barack Obama when he had just three days left in office.
Dewey-Hagborg, through the algorithmic analysis of DNA extracted by Manning and created from the 30 portraits of what someone might look like with these genomic data, has a sharp, if somewhat intellectual, comment not only on the formability of DNA data - the many ways in which they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also created for identity.
Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward but has already spoken openly about identifying as a woman since her puberty, was convicted in 2013 on 20 charges, including six violations of the spy law, computer fraud and theft.
Through prison, her image was suppressed, so much so that there was only one photo - a crooked, black-and-white selfie in which Manning sits visibly unwell in a driver's seat and wears a platinum blonde wig - with which she was associated.
In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg just came from the huge success of her 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'.
In it, the artist produced portraits of strangers from forensic artifacts such as cigarette mugs and chewing gum, extracting DNA from the waste to create a picture of what these people might look like.
That was when she received an email from a newspaper magazine.
"They conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison, and they wanted some kind of portrait to accompany this article," Dewey-Hagborg explained at a press preview of the new exhibition.
And she couldn't visit at the time and she couldn't be photographed, so you made contact with Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to do a DNA portrait.
The artist and her incarcerated muse became unequal letters, exchanging several letters over the course of two years.
They even created a "Suppressed Images" comic illustrated by Shoili Kanungo that foreshadowed a future in which the president would convert Chelseas's judgment and she would be able to see the exhibition in person.
That Obama would actually demand Manning's release after seven brutal years at a military prison in Kansas just days after the book was published was a welcome kind of happy gathering.
There is also something deep and strong now at the opening of the exhibition, as Donald Trump is waging a war on informants from the government camp and against transgender troops to find new, tweetable ways to further inflame the rigid divisions he was supposed to fix.
When Dewey-Hagborg was asked about the strange timing of all these things, she said that "things happen for a certain reason."
In an artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery, Manning, with her oversized signature underneath (the "i" in her family name is endowed with a heart), called for an end to "automatic fragmentation, the basis of which has been gender, race, sexuality and culture."
On the opposite wall, her mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousand-feet of Cs and Gs and As, is written in pencil.
Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show by including the 200 letters (or nucleotides according to the artist's highly developed scientific lexicon) how astonishingly similar, at least in biological terms, we are all.
"What people will hopefully take away from it is that our genome doesn't care who we are and how openly genetic data is for an interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose 2007 video work, Spurious Memories, is also on display.
'DNA data can tell so many different stories, so that's 30 of those stories. '
The last piece in the exhibition, which is kept in its own space, is a page from the aforementioned comic novel.
She shows Manning how she emerges with a hands-free phone in hand from the United States "disciplinary barracks like King-Kong.
"If they cold your speech, then they won," it reads.
"So never stop the mouth."
"It came directly from a letter she wrote to me," said the artist, who greets from Philadelphia.
'i still get goosebumps when I talk about it. '
Manning hasn't seen the exhibition in person yet - just as it was anticipated ahead in the comicbook - but if she was to do it, then she will be greeted in the middle of the room by the masks, by her own genomic simulacres, which coalesce like hordes of protesters.
That was also purposeful, like everything in the exhibition, to the size (5 "2, Manning's stature) where her genetic haplogroups were written with pencil.
"In the past, I had them on the wall, but I wanted them to feel like a crowd," Dewey-Hagborg said of the portraits.
'i wanted it to feel like a mass movement forming with Chelsea, like the movement that was also behind their liberation. '
University of Northwestern professor and an Oxford University employee sought for killing
A nationwide manhunt is underway for a professor at Northwestern University and an Oxford University employee who are being sought as suspects after a man was stabbed with fatal injuries at a luxury apartment in Chicago.
On Monday, warrants for murder were issued for Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) for their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, as Cook County District Court files show.
The documents say Cornell-Duranleau, 26, passed away after several stitches.
A community warning system released by the Chicago Police Department says the corpse was discovered on July 27.
Officials received a call, arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with multiple injuries to his body.
Cornell-Duranleau was still declared dead at the scene of what happened, and detectives are investigating the stitches as a homicide while police are actively searching for the two suspects, officials said.
Lathem has been an extraordinary professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, the vice president for university relations, said in an emailed statement that Lathem had now been assessed and barred from entering Northwestern University's campus.
"This is now a criminal matter being investigated by the relevant authorities and Northwestern University is cooperating in this investigation," Cubbage said.
Warren is a Senior Treasury Assistant at Oxford University.
A spokesman for the university and Somerville College said in an emailed statement that "we are in contact with police in the UK and ready to help US investigative authorities in any way possible."
The statement added that Warren's colleagues were shocked and want him to pose.
Chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Department, Anthony Guglielmi, said he strongly urges the suspects to face the authorities.
"The police have an idea of their whereabouts, and our efforts to locate them are stepping up," Guglielmi said.
Guglielmi said local, regional and national authorities are helping to find the suspects.
Guglielmi said police received a call from the building manager of the Grand Plaza building, who had just received a puzzling tip saying something had happened in apartment 1008.
Police described the scene as very cruel.
Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the incident had also taken place on July 27.
It was confirmed by security cameras that Lathem and Warren were in the building.
"We believe Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," Guglielmi said.
Grand Plaza's management team released a statement to residents: "Police are currently working on the timeline and background of the victim and are exploring a variety of motives, including a possible domestic incident."
"We will complete the WADA roadmap in the near future" - Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mutko
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said it would not take long for the remaining World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) criteria to be implemented for the restoration of Russia's Anti-Doping Agency (Rusada).
'at a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the roadmap, Rusada has been given the right to plan and test in collaboration with UKAD (UK Anti-Doping).
The WADA roadmap has been updated in this regard, "Mutko explained on Thursday.
The PM commented on the second part of WADA's roadmap to comply with the code, which describes the criteria for Rusada's reinstatement and was recently published on the organisation's website.
According to Mutko, it contains nothing that could cause concern for Russia.
"Everything has been announced, everything is being implemented.
And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA in the near future, "he added.
However, one of the criteria mentioned in the list states that Russian anti-doping authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the WADA-approved investigation by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren into alleged state-sponsored doping in Russian sport.
Referring to the matter, Mutko said: "We are conducting the investigation as our anti-doping system has acknowledged a mistake.
All measures have been implemented.
But there were no government programs, and we're not going to admit something that doesn't exist. '
Mutko's words matched those of Vitaly Smirnov, the head of Russia's independent anti-doping commission.
Speaking to Russian outlet rsport at the start of the day, Smirnov admitted problems of the past in Russian anti-doping organisations, but then added: "We have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations.
No one intends to accept this report unconditionally, "Smirnov added.
Rusada was barred from carrying out doping checks in Russia in November 2015 in the wake of the doping scandal by WADA.
However, she was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti-Doping (UKAD).
After a visit to the organization's headquarters in Moscow in July, WADA Director General Olivier Niggli said Rusada was moving "in the right direction" to be reinstated.
Aldi no longer sells eggs for now
This was shared by the business groups.
It was a mere precaution that no further health impairment could be assumed, the communication stated.
As of now, only eggs are likely to be delivered to Aldi, which has been proven to have been tested negatively for fipronilous anti-lamination agents.
Aldi wants to make clarity and transparency with its customers.
The start-ups that will help your company not become the next Uber
Amy errett wanted to measure happiness with your employees at your e-commerce start-up, but the polls didn't work.
Answers were often vague, little helpful or - even worse - fraudulent.
And even if you promised anonymity, some workers didn't mourn the process.
"There was just never consistency and objectivity," said errett, who runs the 75-person San Francisco e-commerce Hair Care company Madison Reed.
She has called people from the outside for help.
A new breed of Human Resources start-ups is growing to help companies figure out how their employees feel.
By creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement, it allows companies to conduct surveys, address special groups and demographic groups, provide employees with anonymity and complaint hotlines, and in some cases allow whistleblowers to bypass the C-Suite executives and contact the board directly..
"You now have tools like Strava and Fitbit for tracking their health, but where is the Fitbit for your company?" Said Jim Barnett, co-founder and chief executive of Redwood City start-up Glint, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement.
Errett said she gained a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with Glint.
In addition to the snap polls and polls from certain teams, it offers a heat map of the firm that at a glance shows which units have the most complaints and which executives have low approval results - so you can drill down on why.
Companies come to realise that must remain at the forefront of workplace culture so that you don't become the next Uber to be embroiled in scandals since a former employee posted a blog post describing an environment of harassment where those who spoke were punished.
For start-ups like Glint, this desire for an overview is a lucrative business opportunity.
The global governance, regulation and compliance industry could own more than $118.7 billion worth in 2020, according to financial engineering website Let's Talk Payments.
Denver, Colorado, start-up Convercent, which helps companies prevent and detect bad behavior, saw a rising interest and activity earlier this year amid the Uber case in miscredit.
Convercent has nearly 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber recently signed up as a client.
Like Glint, Convercent lets companies send bespoke "pulse" surveys, collect confidential responses in real time and view the heat maps of your problem areas.
It also offers an anonymous text message hotline that lets employees report bad behaviour.
And when the chief executive is involved, complaints go directly to the supervisory board.
"The court of public opinion has gripped the regulators," said Patrick Quinlan, the founder and chief executive of Convercent.
If a company is found that treats its employees badly or behaves unethically, it can experience costly consequences from consumer boycott, worker fluctuation and lawsuits, Quinlan said.
Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 locations, has employed Convercent for more than a year to ensure employees are aware of the policies and procedures and have an easy way to reach their corporate headquarters.
Earlier, if an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a phone number or email for the corporate headquarters, file a formal complaint and hope he was taken seriously.
It was often an intimidation and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesdays General Counsel, who said there was no good way to track staff complaints.
Now that the company deploys Convercent, problems previously hidden by executives who sat in offices in cities or states - such as discrimination, harassment or unfair practitioners - can be identified and addressed more quickly.
"I can get closer to this holistic, 360-degree view into the experience of employment," said Vitrano, who heads Ruby Tuesday's Risk Management Group.
'and we're protecting our shareholders from employment litigation. '
Companies began taking ethics, values and employee engagement more seriously in 2002 after accounting firm Arthur Andersen collapsed due to ethical violations by the Enron scandal, Quinlan said.
But it took until the "social media came to their right" that companies realized you couldn't prevent their dirty laundry going online.
"Before using technology to monitor ethics, people used hope as a strategy," he said.
Both Glint and Convercent offer your software as a service, and charge companies with recurring fees for using their products.
It's a business model and an opportunity that finds approval from venture capital investors who have both backed start-ups.
Convercent received $10 million in funding in February from firms such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, raising the total capital to $47 million.
Glitern secured $10 million in November from Bessemer Venture Partners, bringing its total funding to $60 million.
These investments come as little surprise, given the interconnected nature of companies, culture and venture capital.
There is a growing complex of research showing that today's employees expect more from their jobs than before.
In competitive markets like Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are just stakes.
Employees want to feel that you are accepted and valued and that you are giving your time to a company with a positive mission.
"If people are happy to be in a company, feel that their voices belong, and that the work you do is worth it, then they feel more committed to making this company successful," said Nina McQueen, vice president of Global Benefits and Employee Experience at LinkedIn, which includes both ConveredIn cent as well as Glint used.
Investors achieve returns when their portfolio companies run well. Companies run well when employees are engaged and engaged.
If third-party analytics tools promise to increase engagement and employee engagement, it's no wonder you'll find support.
The data on employee engagement according to the experts of workplace culture important.
But the data is useless if a company's administrators don't take action.
In fact, when a company asks employees for your feedback, it may have an expectation that change is on the way.
And if change doesn't come fast enough, or not at all, this can breed disappointments and demotivate employees.
"If you ask for 4,000 suggestions, you have to be willing to have 4,000 conversations," said Russell Raath, president of consulting at business management firm Kotter International, who has seen companies that have relied too much on collecting data.
"Because if you don't follow employees will ask themselves," Have you really heard me?
Do you care?
And who you don't care about, why should I? '
Madison Reed, who now runs monthly employee surveys, was able to take action on the same day when a problem is reported about Glint, so aroused.
And after collecting feedback from frustrated employees, she was through the speed of decision-making and the quality of communication, able to reorganize several teams within the company and add a communications training to address the issues.
At Ruby Tuesday, the company is getting new insights about employees, and it hopes that in the long run, this will lead to better bonding of workers in an industry known for high sales.
"If you're not committed to creating a culture of transparency, you're going to lose people," Vitrano said.
'and if you lose people, you lose customers too.
And if you lose customers, then you're going to lose businesses.
The NCAA removes the two-day practices and makes a long day for the Bruins
It goes on at 11 p.m. as a crowd of UCLA football players entertain themselves on one side of the team's new practice fields on campus.
Some have pulled out their jerseys and show the back full of sweat from the first day of training camp.
For a good part of the team, these idle minutes represent a lunch break.
Players enrolled for the summer courses will return to their final exams after the three-hour exercise before returning to the Wasserman Football Center at 6: 30 a.m. the following morning.
"That's a real treadmill for the guys the next three days," Bruins coach Jim Mora said just before Monday became Tuesday.
The NCAA eliminates two-day exercises to ease the burden of players, and it has actually extended its days - at least until Friday's final.
That's why UCLA's first three training sessions should start at 7: 15 p.m. to match the players "already packed schedules.
The compromise away from the two days is more than a day when the Bruins postponed the start of camp nearly a week after last season and did practical exercises during summer school for the first time during Mora's six seasons at Westwood.
They are scheduled to hold 18 exercises over the course of August, with 20 before formal game preparations begin for their kick-off against Texas A & M in September.
Mora said he supports the NCAA's rule change even as it adds another point to players "busy routes.
"We put that enormous strain on them three or four days, and it's very challenging," Mora said.
'and they just pushed it through, they're placking on, they're great people.
I think as soon as we get to Saturday and we have more time, it's going to be really great. '
UCLA will end its practices once the camp is finished, which will not be an easy task given the clear sight lines of its fields from an adjacent parking lot and the adjacent Luskin Center, an upscale-class hotel that has already been pelted with footballs that cleared a protective net behind a goalpost.
Bruins players are scheduled to occupy the hotel starting this weekend, but Mora acknowledged there could be a problem once those rooms are free during the season.
"We will use our security," Mora said.
'that's a real problem, and it's not far-fetched to think people rent a room there and then adjust there to record an exercise.
If you have the video tape of an exercise, it's a pretty good deal.
But we have security forces there, and we have security forces in parking 8.
We're going to do the best, with what we have.
I am not too worried about this.
We've got a plan. '
Facebook wants to intensify fact-checking in fight against fake news
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with fake news to fact-checkers from third parties and then display their results under the original contribution, the world's largest online social network said on Thursday. It's one of its efforts to combat so-called fake news.
The company said in a statement on its website that it will begin using updated machine learning methods to detect possible misinformation and send it to fact-checkers who will potentially display fact-checking results from the original article.
Facebook has been criticized as one of the main distribution points for so-called fake news, many of which believe they also influenced the 2016 U.S. presidential election.
The problem has also become a major political issue in Europe, with French voters flooded with false stories in the run-up to May's presidential election, and Germany backing a plan to punish social media networks if they fail to quickly eliminate hateful postings like before elections there in September.
On Thursday, Facebook said in a separate statement in German that a test of the new facts review was being launched in the US, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
"In addition to realising what stories are being challenged by fact-checking third parties, people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share," Sara Su, product manager for Facebook news, said in a blog.
She added that Facebook will continue to test its feature on the "related article" and is working on other changes to its news feed to reduce fake news.
Creating a comic novel: A Castle in the History of England
In his recent past, little Scotney Castle was seen in a squeeze music video and was a loophole for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970 "s and 1980" s.
But Scotney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history from his cosy seat in the Bewl River Valley in Kent and has now become the inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes, a mophaaric Yorkshireman with a fondness for historical documents.
"I find it so nice to look at the handwriting of someone who has been dead for 300 years," he says woefully.
'What a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand. '
'a Castle in England 'spans the period from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward, documenting the families who lived in Scotney. Each story was illustrated by another emerging British artist - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
It's not Rhodes' first book based on an archive: He wrote 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories' in 2014, a collection inspired by documents at the British Library - a project he found unexpectedly emotional.
"I just responded to the thumb print on the side of a letter so written by a double agent in the 1700's who worked for the Jacobins," he says.
'that's his thumb print!
And letters always smelled for smoke, because at that time a fire was lit because of the light.
For someone who lives 300 years later, the smell has an effect, as if it were at it itself.
Ah, I love archives! '
For someone so beaten with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and Arts Council England and lived in a castle for almost four months ("To be honest: I've overrated my welcome greeting a little"), this all seems too nice to be true.
Rhodes spent his days exploring the Victorian "new" castle, looking through the archives and studying the castle's many treasures and curiosities, such as the assembled hyenas heads on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the ditch.
He wandered through the grounds and ruins of the old castle and spoke to landscape keepers, gardeners and sometimes the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book.
Then, at night, he drank "whiskey and started writing."
Scotney's intimate history is relatively unknown as the National Trust did not get full access until 2006, when the last Erbin, Elizabeth Hussey, died.
When Rhodes arrived a decade later, employees just started looking after the archive, which he described as "hundreds of years in which aristocrats said" Oh, whip it to the attic. "
Diaries, letters from the time of the English Empires, maps depicting who owned what: "You could think that land conflicts would be boring," Rhodes says, "but there was a birch to which two families fought.
Guys, let it all go his gear! '
Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to delve into English history on a broader basis, including 'The labourer', which follows a man leaving the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 1381.
"There's a record of a riot that occurred in the castle in 1380, in this book titled 'Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex,'" Rhodes says.
'the peasant uprising started in this area and I thought an uprising was a good start.
Maybe the two are connected? '
Other stories are firmly rooted in the castle's history - such as' The Priest ', which tells the story of the Jesuit patron whom the Darrell family hid for seven years during the English Reformation.
Or 'The Smuggler', depicting 18th-century smuggler Arthur Darrell staging his own funeral by filling a coffin with stones (a discovery made only years later when his coffin was excavated).
The Darrells are Rhodes' favourite family of Scotney: "The Lords seemed to be quite crooks, repeatedly making debts and spending money on things they couldn't afford.
Other generations of Darrell men solved their debt crises by marrying rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of good-looking guys, with a talent to advertise Erbinnen. '
After the end of his engagement at the castle, Rhodes is looking for other unique writing experiences
He has put a two-week stay in the Finnish wilderness behind him for a comic novel about Elämänmäki, the site of an early 20th-century sanatorium that has since been reclaimed by nature.
But Scotney has a special place for him.
"I was sad to go again," he says.
It was like, "Ah, now I have to cope with the damn life again."
Campaign launched: Over 300-year-old Marienkapelle shrouded in Rhöndorf
On Friday, the city of Bad Honnef launched its campaign to introduce a new umbrella brand (Thursday's round show) with the addition of the 301-year-old Marienkapelle in Rhöndorf.
Until Thursday, Mayor Otto Neuhoff and his marketing team around Nelson Artz want to keep the logo and slogan secret.
At the end of August there will be a festival on the island of Grafenwerth as the highlight of the campaign.
"Too nice for us.
Or?, "the makers of the action have been asking on the posters at the Rhöndorfer Chapel since yesterday.
"We don't really think so (of course!)," they write on their website, which was released yesterday.
'but we're using this measure to gain your attention.
And to make it clear that some things are better than it seems.
Basically, we firmly believe that we as Bad Honnefer citizens know very well about the beauty and attractiveness of our city. "
The action is about more than "just" a logo and a slogan, it goes on to say.
'it's all about formulating a stand-alone promise, one that gives the city a distinctive one-size-fits-all feature. '
After all, it is in competition with other municipalities.
The city of Bad Honnef can cost a medium five-digit amount of its new umbrella brand and the campaign.
Military reforms in Turkey - Erdogan's fear of army
Every year at the beginning of August in Ankara, the Supreme Military Council (YAS) advises on retirements and promotions in the officer corps.
So too this week.
At first glance, a normal process.
But nothing is routine among Turkish forces a year after the coup attempt.
The meeting was no longer held in the General Staff building, as it used to be, but in the Prime Minister's seat.
The five Vice-premiers, as well as the Ministers for Defence, Home Affairs, Justice and Foreign Affairs, took part in the discussions under the Presidency of the Heads of Government.
As a result, the civilians in the YAS were in the majority.
The government is pulling the reins in the military.
Chief of Staff Hulusi Akar remains in office, but commanders of the army, air forces and the Navy have been deposed.
Since the failed coup, head of state Erdogan has fired 169 of the 326 generals and admirals.
Over 10,000 soldiers have been removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of alleged links to the movement of the exile preacher Fethullah Gülen, whom Erdogan sees as the wire-teller of the coup attempt.
Against 486 people who are said to have been directly involved in the coup attempt, negotiations have been underway in Ankara since this week.
Even the day after the coup, Erdogan had called the overthrow attempt a "gift of God" as he gave him the opportunity to "fully clean" the armed forces.
But does Erdogan really have the army in limbo?
In late February, the newspaper "Hürriyet" published an article with the headline "Unease in the Military Headquarters."
There were concerns in the General Staff about an increasing "Islamization" of the army, which manifests itself among other things in the lifting of the headscarf ban on soldiers, the newspaper wrote.
In any case, the major cause of the army and the security forces continues.
In mid-July, Erdogan let another 7395 state servants fire by decree, including 2303 police officers and 546 soldiers.
In doing so, it seemed that Erdogan had tamed the military.
The generals used to be the real masters of the country.
Three times they putted, citing their role as guardians of the secular state order.
After his 2002 election victory, Erdogan pushed the power of the military back step by step, not least citing the European Union's reform requirements.
Former officers say Erdogan is purposefully driving an Islamization of the armed forces.
In the magazine "Vocal Europe," a named unnamed officer who sought asylum after the coup attempt for fear of persecution abroad warned the Turkish army would be "full of extremists and salafists" in a few years.
If that is true, such a development could not leave Nato cold.
In any case, after the purges, there are doubts in the alliance about the readiness of the Turkish army to operate.
Leadership structures and operational capabilities were "weakened," Nato diplomats say.
Washington changes Green Card rules
There will be a new U.S. immigration plan to change Green Card rules, President Donald Trump said, quoted by the media.
He envisages cutting legal immigrants to 50,000 a year, tighter rules on obtaining visas for a temporary work permit and restrictions on family-oriented visas.
The new rules are proposed by Republicans and supported by the president.
The bill is to be discussed in the two chambers of Congress.
'This law will reduce poverty, raise wages and save billions of dollars on taxpayers and will do so by changing the way citizens from other countries are issued green cards. '
The law will prevent chain migration and replace the current system.
This new application procedure will benefit candidates who speak English who have the financial resources to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy, "Trump said, quoted by the American media.
Ministry wants to renovate track for racecourse shuttle
Over and over the past few months, the future of the racecourse shuttles had been disputed - now it is to be done very quickly.
Before the end of the year, it is planned to build on the baroque route on which the tourist railway runs.
Construction work on the track is expected to begin later this year in order to secure the future of the racecourse shuttle in the long term, according to the Department for Transport.
"With the decision to continue ordering and renovating the Ilmenau-Rennsteig route, the country is committed to this connection, which is particularly important for tourism," said Transport State Secretary Klaus Sühl in Erfurt on Friday.
He estimated the cost of repairing the route to be about 2.5 million euros.
Of that sum, the country takes 75 percent.
The contract, on the basis of which the shuttle is to be ordered from the country in the future, is currently being finalised, said Sühl.
The Ministry and the Südthüringen Bahn as operator already agreed on the technical details.
"With that, the roadmap, the vehicles used and the quality standards are negotiated," Sühl said.
The planned contract between the Ministry and the railway company will be concluded for a period of eleven years.
With this, the racecourse shuttle should be ordered on a regular basis on December 2017.
The racecourse shuttle is a popular railway connection between Ilmenau and Rennsteig stations, especially among tourists.
Over the past few months, a pilot operation has tested whether the route will be used by a sufficient number of people to re-order it regularly in the future.
The track is also very busy in parts.
The rise of sex robots is real, and we should be worried
Just when you thought it can't get even crazier in 2017, comes a new report on the technological developments in the field of sex robots.
Yes, actually.
Sex robots are a big thing right now.
Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (Foundation for Responsible Robotics) (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years.
According to Noel Sharkey, embattled professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of FRR, we need to start taking their rise seriously.
Customers can choose the eye color of the robot, its shape of the nipple and the type of fingernail.
"People are making fun of them, but the companies are delivering a lot of it, and we're going to get to see them a lot more often," Mr Sharkey said when publishing his new report.
Modern sex dolls have evolved from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with deliberately human reactions achieved by artificial intelligence.
The user can also "customize" his robot according to his beliefs, choosing everything from the robot's eye color to the shape of the nipples to the type or color of his fingernails.
But it becomes even more troubling as many robots own the "personalities" that would make a Stepford woman look progressive.
Modern sex dolls have become robots with a silicone skin.
The RealBotix robot, for example, allows its users to adapt their robots to the properties they find appealing, such as shyness.
And then there's the Roxxy Gold sex robot developed by True Companion with pre-programmed personalities like "Frigid Farrah," which gives the impression of shyness and "Wild Wendy" with an "adventurous" personality.
"Roxxy Gold has a personality that's adapted to your personality as best as possible," swarms True Companion's website.
So she likes what you like, and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc.
She also has her moods over the course of the day - just like real people!
She can be tired of being fixated on conversation or she can be "in tune"! "
There are many troubling aspects to this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the underwhelming female traits, the allusions to rape when you take a step on Frigid (meaning here: Reluctant) Farrah, worry one the most.
On its website, True Companion compared Roxxy to a vibrator, but for men.
'If women (sic) can have a vibrator, then why can't men have a roxxy? 'The website reads.
However, these sex robots are not just a fetish or just another sex toy.
Their emergence and increasing sophistication point to something darker and deeper in our culture, to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with submission as an optional addition.
Most men will, of course, not hold sex robots, and while the FRR notes its rising popularity, they remain on the verge of consumer culture for the time being.
But what seeps through from the fringe zones can be very instructive in terms of the spirit of the time we live in.
And many people are not strange or offensive until the free market gives them permission to do so.
There is a certain overlap, after all, that these highly developed sex robots are emerging at a time when women's rights are under threat worldwide, when there is a president in the White House who has boasted of sexually assaulting women.
The most deterrent aspect of the television series' The Handmaid's Tale '(' The Report of the Magd ') is not the graphic images, the engulfed bodies and the outcast eyes, but how realistic this vision works.
The Republic of Gilead is a leap, but at the moment this doesn't feel like a big leap.
The goal behind these sex robots is to make a physical resemblance to actual women as realistic as technically possible (albeit with porn star proportions).
Their builders want them to feel human, that they emulate the movement of a real body.
But, put to the point when it comes to their "personalities," the robots don't represent real women.
They can't separate themselves from their companion or just walk away.
They have no mediation or background history, nothing that suggests independence or anything that could disrupt the imagination of total submission.
In other words, they are pleasing slaves.
Or to put it in the 2017 mode of speaking: Service girls
Trump's great achievement?
He makes Mitt Romney the epitome of common sense
It has become a Trump-era binge wisdom that the political divisions that have polarized the U.S. electorate have also divided small-format families.
Around Christmas and harvest festival, there were newspapers in the US with advice on how to deal with the horror of Trump-elect relatives.
We are all supposedly striving to make our filter bubbles burst.
Less noticed has been the power of Trump to bring families together.
I mention this because my cousine, a left-leaning poet who lives in Chicago and has long engaged with Republicans in our family, visited me in New York this week.
She reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.
With Trump in the White House, everyone she knows, including the Republican kinship she had struggled with for decades because of politics, is suddenly and quite peculiar on the same page.
This is certainly a good thing about the dining table, but it strikes me in a further context that this also entails significant risks.
The left has been bolstered by Trump, but the disfiguring effect of his presidency has the strength to push us all to the right.
When we talk about "normalization" and Trump, we refer to the grim possibility that one day his kittens will no longer repel us.
There is, however, an even more terrifying long-term scenario in which Trump "normalizes" right-wing Republicans who suddenly appear to be the epitome of reasonableness at once compared to his standards.
I find myself beset today by an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's urcomical version of the crazy - the dog on the car roof, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew what his tax return looked like) - both of which, compared to Trump, are in fact found to be very mild offenses.
If Trump goes, the next Republican candidate only needs to be mentally healthy to qualify as an immeasurable improvement.
When my cousine was in town, we took our children to the carousel in Central Park, the largest of the New York Park Department's carousels, and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don't need a caffeine.
The horses are enormously large, the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are scarce and the animals twist to look full of fear over their own shoulders - extremely dark and the climate-beating music conveys this in an odd way.
So many clichés of a city disappoint: The views of tall buildings get old, the skylines become too familiar to offer much excitement, and the reality of the city doesn't live up to the dream.
Thirty-five years later, and I'm still not quite over the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is in fact not a Swiss cottage - the themed pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage doesn't count - but a big roundabout in north London.
The Central Park carousel, however, is still an oddly magical experience, as here two two-year-olds, an 11-year-old and two women in the 40's can go on it and all have a great time.
If I could have assessed the carousel, I would have given him the full score, but luckily no one asked about it.
On the other hand, this week at a department store, I was forced to rate my "experience" with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could pull my credit card through.
In the coffee shop on the corner of my street, it's the same, plus the option of matching the rating with a 15% tip - this to buy something over the store table.
This not only leads to a slowdown in what should actually be a neutral exchange, but also puts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where none is required.
The poor woman in the department store stood excruciatingly grinning while I tired of the experience of reaching her my credit card with five stars.
Oscar Pistorius with chest pain transferred from prison to hospital
Pistorius has left prison for a hospital visit for the second time.
Last year, he was taken to hospital for treatment for cuts to his wrists, which he told prison authorities he suffered after a fall in his cell.
Pistorius was convicted of murder following an appeal by prosecutors against an initial manslaughter conviction.
He killed Steenkamp in the early hours of Valentine's Day 2013 by shooting her at her several times through a door of the toilet cabin at his home in Pretoria.
Pistorius claimed he thought his girlfriend was a nightly intruder hiding in the cabin.
Prosecutors have announced their intention to appeal this time against Pistorius' six-year sentence, which they say is too lenient.
The National Law Enforcement Agency said it would appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa and the opposition could be heard this year.
Pistorius is in danger of his sentence being increased to 15 years if prosecutors succeed.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
When Bauer Arnold finds an odd egg
As the last of the Blumberg schools, the quadruplets were released from skirts and apples into the holidays and into the secondary schools.
Three of the students will go to high school in the future, four to the secondary school.
School principal Angelika Sitte welcomed the parents and representatives of the public at the Biesental civic house in Epfenhofen on Tuesday evening.
As a symbol of school release, the 29 students of the four classes, led by Sophia Schumacher and Regine Meder, chose a young eagle growing up in the chicken farm but then being released into freedom.
This was followed by a musical titled "The Eagle in the chicken farm."
Bauer Arnold found an odd egg, and let it fry out from his chickens.
Instead of a chicken kitchen, a little eagle came out.
But the hope of making a chicken out of him dashed, the eagle spread its wings on a high mountain and swung away.
After that, classes three and four showed a chicken dance in the study of Yvonne Frank.
The hens danced with the young gockles carrying cylinders to the bet.
The eagle stands for integration, said school principal Angelika Sitte.
The young animal is different from the other young animals (chicks), but belongs to it.
He will never be like a chicken, though.
His purpose was to be free.
She wished every four-week-old that he felt accepted in his new school.
It was followed by a word of thanks to the colleagues, the former head of the school, Michael Müller, who repeatedly jumps in at school shortages, and the parents' representatives.
The kitchen time was now over, explained class teacher Sophia Schumacher.
After two years of teaching, she dismisses her students very much, because it was a really great time.
In the end, she was able to rely on the quadruplets.
At the end, all students recorded a song of summer time and holiday time.
At the same time, great joy broke out among the children.
Eight first-class students are already registered for the new school year.
Two Bulgarians detained for illegal camping in Greece
Two Bulgarians were jailed for illegal campings in Greece, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, quoted by television, shared.
On the morning of August 1, a group of illegally camping people were detained in Sithonia by police, including the two Bulgarians.
On the same day, they were released while an investigation is ongoing.
The State Department reported bTV that the Bulgarians were later released.
Greek authorities have tightened control of free camping and are imposing significant fines on anyone found to remain in a place not intended for that purpose.
Checks will continue throughout the season.
The ministry said the court can impose a fine.
Software update for diesel vehicles: What sufferers need to know now
How exactly does the software update take place?
Do diesel drivers have to take part in the action?
The most important questions and answers at a glance.
At the diesel summit, BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW Group offered software updates for a total of around 5.3 million cars.
They are intended to improve the exhaust behaviour of cars of the emission classes Euro 5 and partly Euro 6.
Euro 4 diesel or worse are excluded.
Anja Smetanin from ACE Auto Club Europe gives assessments:
Is the new action mandatory?
No, the negotiated software updates are voluntary.
"The mandatory updates previously only apply to the vehicles that have Schummelsoftware," says Anja Smetanin.
The German Federal Motor Vehicle Office (KBA) has ordered their retrofitting.
How and when will customers be informed about updates?
Manufacturers have announced a speedy implementation over the next few months, but have not yet given a precise date.
Daimler has communicated to write to anyone affected.
If an inspection is due anyway, that will be done within their framework.
How long are the overall changes likely to drag on?
"Hard to say," Smetanin thinks.
This depends on the commitment of manufacturers and on political pressure.
"We have seen that car manufacturers are not acting voluntarily on the issue of the environment."
How long is the update supposed to last?
The retrofitting itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop.
It could be more time-consuming to get an appointment.
What do motorists who don't drive a car from BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW Group do?
The ACE advises to wait.
Presumably, foreign manufacturers would follow suit, according to Smetanin.
Is there now a threat of a massive fall in the price of Euro 4 cars?
The ACE fears that.
But it is precisely in the regions where driving bans are threatened.
In rural areas, there has been no loss of value for older diesel.
The ACE advises to wait with a sale yet.
Ll Cool J receives Kennedy Center award
The Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most glamorous events in Washington.
The first awards ceremony under President Trump promises to become political.
One of the prize winners does not want to come - in protest.
Ll Cool J (49) gets one of the prestigious Kennedy Center's coveted awards as the first rapper.
As the cult establishment announced on Thursday, this year singer Gloria Estefan (59), Lionel Richie (68), as well as choreographer Carmen de Lavallade (86) and TV producer Norman Lear (95) are among the honors.
The awards will be handed out in early December.
Traditionally, US President Donald Trump will host a reception and attend the awards ceremony along with his wife Melania.
The award winner Lear, who has been announced with progressive TV series, has already announced that he will not attend the gala.
The "New York Times" he said: "This presidency has chosen to completely neglect the arts and human rights - even deprive them of the means - and that strains me."
The 59-year-old Estefan stressed she would use the conversation with Trump to clarify her point of view.
The Kennedy Center, named after former President John F. Kennedy, is the largest cultural facility in the U.S. capital.
Previous winners include Meryl Streep, Aretha Franklin, Robert De Niro, George Lucas, Tom Hanks and Sting.
We make the city worth living
Roland Wacker, Haslach's city builder, is retiring next year.
The job has already been tendered, but suitable candidates are rare.
For 31 years, Wacker has been a city builder.
And the work is still great fun for him, as he conveys in the press interview.
He reports on varied but also demanding tasks waiting for his successor.
At the same time, he is surprised that so far no application fulfils the requirements profile.
The city is looking for an architect or civil engineer at the earliest possible time.
In this way - taking into account the regular notice periods - there should still be enough time for an introduction.
Since Haslach acts as the Lower Building Law Authority for the Administrative Community, the applicant must have the appropriate qualifications.
Because the city definitely wants to keep this function.
If they were no longer able to fill them, the citizens would have to go to Offenburg for advice.
But proximity to citizens is important to the city and to it itself, says Wacker, who reports on a good working climate as well as good mood between authority and citizens.
In more than 30 years in office, some significant projects have accumulated, which Wacker looks back on with pride.
"We make the city worth living," he is sure of the building office and its staff.
But also in the future, varied projects are on the agenda: The redesign of the former Hukla area and the Niederhofenparkplatz, for example, have been initiated.
The Kinzigbrücke between Bollenbach and Steinach is being renewed, and the stadium renovation is still an issue.
The latter alone will bat at around 1.5 million euros, "if we get it right," Wacker estimates.
"All in all, great tasks await my successor.
The work here is fun. "
There was a lot of room for a city builder to design.
With Haslach's own building yard and gardening, it is possible to react quite flexibly to many things.
"You can move a lot," says Wacker, and the design of the green spaces is often praised by citizens and visitors.
As the old town as an ensemble is under monument protection, it is important to "have an eye for what fits in" when new buildings are approved, the outgoing city builder emphasizes.
In any case, the city builder bears a high responsibility.
He's a builder, "in the end, everything is running over my table here."
When it comes to support and coordination, he can count on long-standing employees: Markus Neumaier (building construction) has been involved for ten years, Manfred Schöner (civil engineering) for 15 years.
Also, that his successor remains for a long time, Wacker wishes: "We are looking for someone who really identifies and wants to stay with the site."
Because continuity is not only important for a good working climate, but also for the further design of the city.
If you would like to inherit Roland Wacker, you should, according to the information of the city of Haslach, be able to have a completed degree as a diploma engineer or bachelor with a specialization in architecture and have good expertise in the fields of building regulations and planning law.
The Municipal Building Office is responsible for building and civil engineering, building management planning, basic employment matters, administration of urban properties, municipal farm with Bauhof and municipal gardening, as well as the Lower Building Law Authority, including monument protection.
Bike thrown on lines: South rail track locked
According to police, the previously unknown offenders had thrown the blue bike from the railway track overpass in the area of Leobener Straße (B116) onto the lines.
These were so badly damaged that the approaching freight train had to be stopped.
Investigators walk out of two male offenders and have been searching for them since the night hours.
Near the scene of the crime, a rosary scooter and a bicycle driver had been observed by witnesses.
"This goes well beyond a runaway coup," ÖBB spokesman Christoph Posch told the APA.
The perpetrator would have put himself in great danger and also put train traffic at risk.
In addition to the damage to the locomotive and the facility, as well as the delay minutes and the cost of rail replacement, the perpetrators could also be faced with patrons of rail customers.
Overall, a "significant" sum was to be expected, the spokesman said.
The damage had been remedied on Friday afternoon, while rail traffic on the Southern Railway line could be conducted without any disabilities.
Almost ten passenger trains had fallen out on Friday morning, two of which concerned long-distance traffic.
Freight trains did not fall out, but they were late.
According to ÖBB spokesman Christoph Posch, about 200 metres of overhead lines had to be replaced.
Insulators and masts were also damaged.
Red meat, dairy products and chocolate could help alleviate IBD (inflammatory gut disease)
Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.
But a new study claims the exact opposite: A diet rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products could alleviate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory gut disease.
The incurable condition, which affects around 1.3 million in the US and 300,000 in the UK, causes stomach cramps and bruises, recurring or bloody diarrhoea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
While sufferers are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to alleviate their symptoms, researchers at Washington University found that the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins helps develop immune cells that promote a tolerant gut.
The lead researcher, Dr Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells are patrolling in the gut to ensure that harmful microbes hiding in food do not penetrate the body.
Cells capable of triggering inflammation are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without harming sensitive tissue.
If the balance tends too far towards inflammation, it can result in inflammatory intestinal disease.
Experiments found that a type of tolerance-promoting immune cell occurs in mice that carry a specific bacterium in their indentations.
And the bacterium needs tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells.
Professor Colonna said: 'We have established a link between a bacterial species - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the gut microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.
The more tryptophan the mice had in their food, the more they had of these immune cells. '
He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and a diet rich in tryptophan promotes more tolerant, less inflammatory intestinal milieus when the same system also swirls in humans.
Postdoctoral researcher Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan examined a type of immune cell that promotes tolerance when she found out that a group of study mice had such cells, but another group of the same tribe, which was housed separately, did not have this.
She suspected the difference had to do with the gut microbiomes of the mice - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi that normally live in the gastrointestinal tract.
The intestines of the mice were DNA sequenced and six bacterial species were found present in the mice with the immune cells, but without them missing in the mice.
Mice were raised in a sterile environment so they lacked an intestinal microbiome and they did not develop this type of immune cells, and they received the L. reuteri and the immune cells originated.
To understand how the bacteria impacted the immune system, the researchers let L. reuteri grow in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - to immature immune cells isolated from the mice.
The immune cells developed into the tolerance-enhancing cells.
When the active component was cleaned out of the liquid, it proved to be a byproduct of tryptophan metabolism known as indol 3 lactic acid.
When researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the mice's feed, the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent, but when the tryptophane levels were halved, the number of cells fell by half.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that people have the same tolerance-enhancing cells as mice, and that most of us protect L. reuteri in our gastrointestinal tracts.
It is not known if tryptophan by-products from L. reuteri develop the cells in humans as in mice, but defects in genes related to tryptophan were found in people with inflammatory intestinal disease.
She said: 'The development of these cells is probably something we would like to promote as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestine.
Potentially, high tryptophantic values in the presence of L. reuteri can lead to an expansion of this population. "
Jose Mourinho believes Manchester United have committed a 'genius' with Nemanja Matic
At Manchester United have signed a "genius" with Nemanja Matic, Jose Mourinho believes, after the midfielder had his debut against Sampdoria on Wednesday night.
Chelsea's £40 million signing began with a 2: 1 win in Dublin, the last pre-season game before the UEFA Super Cup against Real Madrid begins on Tuesday, and impressed in the keeper role as people like Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira marched ahead at will.
Matic, however, had been ruled out of the Blues' pre-season Asia tour and managed just 45 minutes, which Mourinho admitted he had to improve before the start of the Premier League season.
"He needs time but his experience, intelligence, a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football," Mourinho said.
'we'll help him get ready sooner rather than later. '
In addition to Matic, Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku also starred at the Aviva Stadium as Mourinho formed his starting XI for the start of the season.
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho still wanted three more new commitments, but he insisted the club had already done a "fantastic job" of fulfilling three of his four priority new commitments.
"To get three out of four, for that I thank the club," he added.
'i'll be happier if they get four out of four for me, but they've put a lot of effort into it. '
Boeing 'paints' Dreamliner into the sky
Us aircraft maker Boeing has painted the silhouette of a Dreamliner into the sky.
The pilots flew off from Seattle in the U.S. state of Washington, but the drawing began in Marquette in U.S. state Michigan and moved in the form of a Dreamliner over the U.S., which is several thousand kilometers.
The action lasted 18 hours and a minute.
On the radar screens was the shape of a Dreamliner to be.
The whole thing was an endurance test for new engines.
Boeing had previously made such advertising.
So the number "787" and the Boeing logo was painted into the sky.
New low for Martin Schulz - Hanover, we have a problem
How the wind turns: When Sigmar Gabriel was still SPD leader, Social Democratic prime ministers always looked to Berlin with some concern before elections.
Only no disturbance from the party headquarters, only no headwind from the covenant - that was the most important wish of the campaigners.
Since Martin Schulz leads the party, that has fundamentally changed.
Since then, staff from the Willy-Brandt-Haus have been watching events in the SPD-ruled state capitals with growing horror.
What Schulz has got from there since the beginning of the year would not even be described in the approach with headwinds.
It was lows.
And one by one.
The federal CDU sees a general signal against coalitions of SPD and Greens after the surprise end of the red-green majority in Lower Saxony.
"This shows once again: Red-green simply cannot govern reliably," CDU Secretary General Peter Tauber told the editorial network Germany (RND).
The surprise faction ouster of a Green MP has plunged the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) into a severe crisis.
Five months before the state election, his red-green coalition lost its one-vote majority to the opposition from CDU and FDP.
Greens federal executive Michael Kellner has called on the breakaway Lower Saxony Greens MP Elke Twesten to return her mandate.
The transition to the CDU means a clear distortion of the electorate's will.
Elke Twesten must immediately return her mandate, "the federal executive and campaign manager of the Greens told the editorial network Germany (RND).
"All this must not be true at all," one SPD campaigner sighs as the new Hiobsbotschaft reaches the party headquarters on Friday morning.
Stephan Weil, SPD prime minister of Lower Saxony, is standing without a government majority of his own after Green MP Elke Twesten transitioned to the CDU.
It is the provisional culmination of a whole series of large and small crises in SPD state associations.
And no one knows what's next.
The malaise began with the unexpectedly clear defeat in the Saarland election in March.
A blue eye, no more, the comrades calmed down at the time.
After the state elections in Schleswig-Holstein and North Rhine-Westphalia, everything will be different.
That became the case - and it all got much worse.
The defeat in Kiel brought the SPD into disarray, and the Dusseldorf bust kept the party running smoothly.
The comrades were tearfully rapping up again in the weeks after.
Then, when they had just taken up new courage, the G-20 summit came from Hamburg.
And with him came the next low.
Mayor Olaf Scholz, the last strong SPD state leader, lost his Nimbus that weekend because he was sitting in the Elbphilharmonie while his city was burning.
And because he did pretty much everything wrong in crisis communication afterwards, which can be done wrong.
Since then, Scholz has been fighting for his political survival.
So now also Stephan Weil.
The Prime Minister of Lower Saxony has been under criticism for a long time because of the VW exhaust affair and its role on the Supervisory Board.
Miese survey values were added.
In spite of this, or perhaps precisely because of this, Weil tried more and more in recent weeks to set an accent in the covenant.
The efforts of the former mayor of Hanover to expand his power in Berlin were not concealed by comrades in the surroundings of Martin Schulz.
They allowed him to be granted, because they promised Weil a stabilization of the party.
Now the exact opposite could occur.
In doing so, Weil is basically not guilty of the party-internal dispute between the Lower Saxony Greens.
And Schulz certainly not at all.
For the time being, the comrades are trying to keep their own ranks closed.
Her anger is directed at the Greens, and here especially at the breakaway parliamentarian Twesten.
"It is unbearable and democratically damaging how Ms. Twesten puts her own career interests above the interests of everyone else," says Matthias Miersch, head of the party left in the SPD Bundestag faction, the editorial network Germany (RND).
Mrs Twesten was elected to Parliament not because of her person as a direct candidate, but via the Land List of the Lower Saxony Greens, the Lower Saxony MP went on to say.
The logical consequence would be for her to return her mandate.
Thomas Oppermann, head of the SPD Bundestag faction, laments an "undemocratic maneuver."
"The will to vote four years ago was clear: People made Stephan Weil prime minister," Oppermann, who leads the Lower Saxony SPD as a top candidate in the federal election, tells the RND.
"Now the personal career thinking of a future CDU MP is distorting the election result," Oppermann went on to say.
He called for the backgrounds to be clarified.
I want to know whether there has been more or there have been further commitments from the CDU of Lower Saxony.
Funding for the town centre III
Those who want to renovate their house in the years will soon be able to receive support from the country.
Mayor Albert Schindler and three representatives informed STEG StadtEntwicklung in Empfingen on Wednesday.
At the beginning of the information event, Schindler once again gave a look back at what has happened so far.
Since 1991 there have been redevelopment areas in Empfingen.
At that time, in the redevelopment area I from 1991 to 2004, the state of Baden-Württemberg had taken over two thirds of the funding.
In the redevelopment area II from 2005 to 2016, the grant was still 60 percent.
For Schindler, the previous renovations are a "success project" - after all, it is important to promote interior development as well, and not only to open up new construction areas.
On 4 April, the President of the Government of Karlsruhe had been informed that there would be a redevelopment area III.
The subsidy amount amounts to 833 333 euros, of which 500 000 euros would come from the country, the rest from the municipality of Empfingen.
What is the development of a redevelopment area?
According to Schindler, one will investigate where the "really old" houses are.
It also plays a role, however, whether there is any interest in renovating the planned area at all.
If necessary, the territorial boundaries could then shift again.
STEG represented Martin Keller, Gaby Pietzschmann and Sarah Gotzel on Wednesday night.
Keller presented the contents of the federal-state program "Social City," in which the renovations would then be carried out.
The core of the programme is the revitalization of inner cities, the improvement of housing and work conditions and the maintenance and expansion of infrastructure.
The measures would be carried out object-related, that is, per plot.
The redevelopment area would then eventually be defined as a statute.
The eligibility period for the funding has been running until April 30, 2026, since January 1, 2017.
Until September of this year, however, the inventory would first be carried out, in which the participants in the redevelopment area will receive a questionnaire to fill out.
In November or December, as far as possible, the Articles of Association shall be adopted so that the renovations can begin in the coming year.
Pietzschmann then explained that each municipality had to carry out the aforementioned preliminary investigations.
It is a question of assessing the urban grievances and deciding when to renovate and to what extent.
A redevelopment note will then be entered in the land register for the respective property.
Pietzschmann himself would come back to the reception and take a picture of the situation, she promised.
Gotzel stressed that a key success factor for the project was the participation of the participants.
That is why there will be questionnaires that will be sent to citizens by post in the coming weeks and can be filled out by the end of the summer holidays.
The yellow questionnaire is the "building and land arc," which deals, among other things, with the structural condition and the renovation plans.
In the grey questionnaire, the "Household and Housing Boards," details of the size, division and residents of a living room can be provided.
The blue "operating arc" can only be filled if business premises are operated in the building.
However, Gotzel pointed out that a completed questionnaire is not an application for funding at the same time.
In addition, new construction measures were not eligible.
Schindler still stressed that the distribution of funding works according to the "greyhound principle" - whoever comes first grinds first.
You can't "reserve" funding for later.
Finally, photos of the project "Local Centre II" were shown in order to make a renovation "tasty" for those present.
British inventor sets himself a microchip to get in house and car with a hand movement
A British inventor is the first in the country to be fitted with a microchip so he can open his front door, enter his office and even start his car with a hand movement.
Steven Northam, 33, had implanted the tiny chip between thumb and index finger and is now offering the service to businesses and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology through his company BioTeq.
He has joined forces with Dr Geoff Watson, an advisory anaesthesist at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester, Hants, to ensure the implant procedure is performed according to medical standards.
The technology resembles a cat and dogs implanted microchip and takes just 30 seconds.
Mr Northam's firm also wants to change the locks on homes and cars in such a way that they are compatible with the chip, all for an extra cost of £300 per lock.
The married father-of-one has now fitted both at home and at his BMW Z4 technology, which starts when his hand is at the wheel.
White House advertising costs cost taxpayers thousands
The White House's decision to fly a Navy helicopter to the South Lawn for an event highlighting American manufacturing last month costs taxpayers up to $24,000, according to the military's data left to TIME magazine.
The green-white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One when the president is on board, was at the heart of the July 17 event at the White House with American construction programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and senior White House officials took a tour of products from all 50 states.
The helicopter, made in Connecticut, was on display alongside a yacht from Maine, a fire truck from Wisconsin and a forklift truck from Mississippi.
The White House military office demanded the helicopter's presence in a fragmentary order or frago, barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn, according to records from the Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for operating the helicopter.
"I just wanted you to be aware of this because it's such an unusual event with high visibility," the commander of HMX-1 wrote on the eve of the event to his superior, the deputy naval commander for aviation.
The news indicated the helicopter arrived at the South Lawn for the event at 3pm on July 17 at around 7am in the morning, and stayed until the lawn was cleared between 18: 00 and 21: 00 that evening.
The note adds that if the departure from the White House was to be delayed, a second team would be needed for the return flight due to the limitation of service hours.
The original flight crew were at the helicopter during the event, while the unit's security staff remained on the ground at the plane during the time.
It was not clear from the records provided to TIME whether a second flight crew was ultimately required.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using state property for political purposes.
Records indicate HMX-1 has asked if the event could breach the provision.
"One question we asked was whether it was a violation of the Hatch Acts and we were informed that this was not the case," the commander wrote.
"Sounds like you're locked up," the deputy commander replied.
The "Made in America" event was called an official event by the White House and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act.
But official events also have political overtones.
At the event, the president gave a push for health care reform underway in the Senate, and he propagated efforts to curb government regulations.
The use of the aircraft, known as Marine One or Air Force One, for politically advantageous purposes, is hardly a new phenomenon.
Presidents are required to use them for the trip.
But requesting their use only for a photo op is unusual.
Trump conducted an investigation in February when the presidential plane ran taxi services against the backdrop of his first campaign rally in Melbourne, Florida, and his Twitter account is full of messages complaining about his predecessor's use of the presidential plane.
"The White House is thrilled with the show" Made In America "- which shows products from all 50 states made by American workers using American materials," White House deputy press secretary Lindsay Walters said.
HMX-1 crews frequently conduct training flights in the area around Washington and the South Lawn to drop off the US president at the White House with precise centimetres.
When Trump was at the G20 summit in Germany in early July, HMX-1 conducted 58 practice landings at the White House.
The flight for the "Made in America" event counted in the flight crew's training needs for the month, an official said.
Helicopter units flew an additional 11 hours that day for "non-presidential support missions."
The White House said taxpayers took the burden on none of the other props presented at the event.
A Sikorsky spokesman said the company had not been involved in exhibiting the helicopter on the South Lawn.
HMX-1 does not have budget records for the presidential flights, and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event.
However, the DoD reimbursement rate for the VH-3D is $24,380 per flight hour, according to US Department of Defense staff rates for the 2017 fiscal year.
Records of the unit record the plane's flight time as 30 minutes from the Marine Corps Air Facility's home base in Quantico in Virginia.
The White House argues that the actual cost of operating the helicopter is well below that rate.
"Setting the cost to taxpayers based on estimates for reimbursement rates is highly misleading," Walters said.
'These estimates include staff, maintenance and many other hidden costs included in the annual funds. '
According to a 2015 RAND study, reimbursement rates for DoD do not include personnel costs, but take into account the cost of fuel, maintenance and contract completion.
At the time, former White House press secretary Sean Spicer defended the helicopter's use for the event.
"The idea is to present things this week that are made in America," Spicer said.
'and I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud that they contribute to our national security, and I reckon hundreds, if not thousands, of people depend on it.
And I think like most Americans, we're all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment that so many Americans have worked tirelessly for.
It's, of course, appropriate to highlight that. '
It was not clear if Trump was interacting with the helicopter as he entered his tour of the South Lawn for the event, but he sat in the driver's seat of a fire truck.
At the White House, Trump spoke to representatives of Sikorsky, joking with the media about his own fleet of company products.
"I know Sikorsky very well," the president said, "I have three of them."
TC BW Neuss facing tricky task
Top rider of the Second Tennis Bundesliga takes part in the table-stage SV Suchsdorfer.
The TC Blau-Weiss Neuss will arrive tomorrow from 11am in Kiel at the table stage suchsdorfer SV.
Despite still having a spotless record after five games, the top rider of the Second Tennis Bundesliga has been given the sense of reality.
Team boss Marius Zay, in any case, has respect for the opponent.
'that's a compact team that always plays in quite similar formation.
Especially on the back positions I find the team very good. "
In particular, imports from the high north provide for class and stability in the Suchsdorfer SV.
'whose Danes and Finns can even point to stakes in the Davis Cup.
And they're strong in the double as well, "says Zay overlooking Harri Heliovaara (Finland), Andre Göransson (Sweden), Sören and Esben Olesen, Martin Pedersen as well as Andreas Bjerrehus (all Denmark).
'that's going to be hard for us as ever.
You also need a good portion of luck. "
The Neusser team for the trip to the high north stands practically.
His debut for blue-white could give Maxime Janvier.
If the Frenchman, who is currently active at the Challenger tournament in the Italian Biella, does not make it to the Bundesliga match, the Zdenek Kolar (Czech Republic), who is playing at the tournament in the Czech Liberec, will be his first bet this season.
The previously undefeated Chilene Hans Podlipnik-Castillo was still at the ball yesterday with the Belarusian Andrei Vasilevski at the ATP Tournament in Kitzbühel.
He should be there in Kiel, though, as should Botic Van de Zandschulp, Niels Lootsma (both Netherlands) and Belgian Julien Cagnina.
After his two wins last Sunday against the club at the Alster, Máté Valkusz could also return to the team.
Isn't it enough for the 18-year-old Hungary, who was still the number one of the junior world rankings in January 2016, someone from the coaching staff around Marius Zay fills up the squad.
How America can harm OMV
Truly happy, Donald Trump didn't act when he put his signature Wednesday night under the law to tighten sanctions on Russia.
"In his haste to enact the law," Congress wrapped in a few "unconstitutional regulations," he etched.
The response from Moscow was as sharp as expected, too, and even Brussels foiled against the US push.
After all, the draft provides for punishing European companies that help Russians build gas pipelines into the EU.
Since then, investors of the local OMV, which together with other European companies co-finances the construction of the Russian Baltic Sea pipeline Nord Stream 2, have been alarmed.
The drone backdrop is formidable.
Still, it is too early for an assessment of the consequences, according to the oil company's official statement.
Indeed, Donald Trump himself would still have to bring the sanctions to life by executive order.
He has twelve weapons to choose from.
"The Press" has looked at which of the Group could fight off and which could really hurt it.
Narco's Staffel 3 trailer: Without Pablo Escobar, the Cali Cartel will take centre stage in Netflix's heat series
Despite the second season of Narcos revealing Pablo Escobar's killer, Netflix's series is far from over.
Staffs three and four have already been confirmed by the streaming service, the first getting their first trailer and showing the show's latest villain.
With the third season, the DEA has focused its attention on the richest organization of drug trafficking in the world: The Cali cartel.
Led by four powerful godparents, they operate "like a Fortune 500 company" only with more state bribes and violent actions.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) is the cartel's leader, Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) is her head, Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) commands the Mexican connection, and Chepe Santacruz Londono (Pepe Rapazote) is based in New York.
In the newly released trailer, Pedro Pascal returns as Javier Peña, the type that invites American and Colombian law enforcement agencies to support the war on drugs.
Other new actors include Matias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishe and Arturo Castro.
The third season of Narcos will begin on September 1.
Role backward: City hires 46 kitchen aids
The city organizes the Kita lunch table itself.
With permanent contact for the children and an assignment to the team.
In urban daycare centres, the clock is turned back.
As of September 1, the city of Krefeld will again take over the food supply in the municipal daycare facilities (Kitas) in its own right.
For Sonja Pommeranz, Deputy Head of Youth Aid, this is good news: "We were all very pleased."
Cooking continues to be out of the house: A caterer takes on this task and delivers freshly chilled Gekochtes.
The city operates 46 day nurseries in the Krefeld area, in 44 children get a hot meal at lunchtime.
Last year, 2800 children each sat at the tables, and demand is growing steadily.
"In the meantime, not only do children who are cared for 45 hours a week eat in the Kita at lunchtime," explains Pommeranz.
'the offer also applies in the 35-hour care when children stay until 2pm. '
46 part-time workers have kitchen service from September 1: They heat up the delivered food, supplement it with salad, raw food and fruit, portioning the meal individually, handing out the food, clearing, rinsing and cleaning the kitchen.
"The employees are firmly assigned to a kita," Pommeranz says.
The size - there are two groups as well as seven-group facilities - determines the hourly scope.
"The kitchen helpers are now firmly part of the Kita team," Pommeranz says satisfactorily.
'so they're much more involved and it's easier to implement pedagogical concepts for kite management. '
Because that's also what it's all about: Healthy eating and cooking lessons.
"The children are supposed to help prepare the food."
The direct connection of the kitchen power to the team makes sense.
Also for the children.
'They have a known force in the Kita, a person familiar to them, and not constantly changing people. '
This continuity is important for the children.
The cleaning of the Kita rooms - previously also the task of the kitchen staff - will be carried out by special cleaning staff in the future.
This variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - has, in addition to improving the quality of the kitchen performance, also the charm that it has proved to be the most economical in comparison with the cost of self-government and foreign procurement for the city, according to the Press Office.
And that, though 46 part-time forces are being rehired.
"But these hours don't matter as much at all with around 750 people in the education area," says Sonja Pommeranz.
Afghan democracy depends on women's political role, UN says
Elections can only be representative if all members of society, including women, play a role, the head of the UN mission in Afghanistan said on Wednesday.
Nicholas Haysom, acting head of the United Nations mission, said hundreds of women will run in the provincial council elections, with three women running for the role of vice president and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters being women.
"The role of women cannot be overestimated," he said in a statement on Wednesday.
Elections can only be truly representative and credible if women participate fully and are involved in all parts of the election process.
Afghan elections for the provincial council and presidential elections will take place on April 5.
The Taliban have issued threats against an election process that coincides with the transition from international combat operations to an advisory role.
This year, for the first time, elections will pass power peacefully from one democratically elected government to the next.
Haysom said a strong role for women will further reinforce Afghanistan's democratic success.
The Afghan Independent Electoral Commission reports that 1.2 million women of a total registered 3.6 million voters are registered.

Men try to rob out 13-year-old girl
Two young men, aged 19 and 23, are said to have tried to rob a 13-year-old girl on Thursday.
According to police information, the men addressed the 13-year-old, who was staying with friends on Kolpingstraße, about 2: 55 p.m. because they wanted to phone the girl's mobile phone.
However, the 13-year-old declined the request and went on with her friends.
As a result, one of the perpetrators tried to grab the girl's mobile phone and necklace, but this failed.
Without prey, the duo escaped.
The two young men could later be detained by police.
The investigation is ongoing.
GMB concern over investment at McVitie factory in Glasgow
A union wants to reassure managers at biscuit maker McVitie about the long-term commitment to production at its Glasgow plant.
GMB Scotland said the company had been silent about the future of investment at the Tollcross site.
More than 500 employees work at the plant, which manufactures Hobnobs and Rich Tea biscuits alongside other products.
McVitie's owner Pladis said he had invested more than £5m in recent years.
He added that staff and union representatives would be "experienced as the first" if their activities changed.
In a letter to the company's branch manager, GMB Scotland urged McVitie's to "raise concerns that funding for the modernisation of production lines was not being pushed forward."
GMB senior organiser Drew Duffy, said: "The fact that we cannot gain clarity from the general site manager about the business needs and investment plans for Tollcross's future deeply affects our members.
Generations of families have worked here and the workforce is heavily focused on the local community and Greater Glasgow, an important pillar of decent employment in an area with high unemployment and social disadvantage.
Therefore, under the perspective of jobs, pay and prosperity, and against the backdrop of Brexit, the rising cost of living and the chronic decline in production, the eastern end of Glasgow desperately needs a thriving production presence at McVitie. "
A spokeswoman for Pladis said: "The branch manager at Tollcross only received a letter from GMB Scotland yesterday and the company will respond directly to it as we appreciate the continued engagement with staff and union representatives.
We had a regular meeting with staff and GMB representatives at Tollcross two months ago, during which some issues were discussed openly.
We discussed with employees that, like all companies operating in a highly competitive and uncertain economic climate, we are constantly reviewing our business - and this applies to all our business units and locations - in order to remain competitive.
She added: "In recent years we have invested more than £5m in our Tollcross site, particularly in production lines and operational improvements.
We fully recognise the heritage of Tollcross as a production facility. If our operations at the site change, the employees and their union representatives will be the first to know this. "
Did PSG warn Barcelona about Neymar three years ago?
La Liga side may regret their interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain will not indulge in their pursuit of Neymar after making an offer of £189m to trigger his release clause, but did they warn Barcelona three years ago of the world record attack?
The sensational approach has fuelled the transfer window in the summer as the Ligue 1 club are poised to break the world record by more than double the previous mark, with Paul Pogba returning to Manchester United for £89 million last season.
After finishing, Neymar becomes the world's most expensive player and the highest-paid professional athlete in the world, with PSG offering wages of more than £500,000 a week.
Barcelona are furious at the way Neymar forced his way outside, although a source close to the Catalans board insists the club have always given their best to look after him since arriving from Santos in 2013.
But was the football world warned of this prospect by the PSG president three years ago?
When Manchester City expressed interest in signing Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi had a stern warning for any club wanting to have one of PSG's best players signed.
"I'm not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players then we will stand in opposition to them, we will contact their players," Al-Khelaifi said.
'we respect all clubs.
But if they try to have one of our players sign with them, this will have consequences. "
Barcelona appear to have crossed that line, with the Spanish club expressing interest in PSG midfielder Marco Verratti earlier this summer.
PSG made it clear they would not allow the international from Italy to leave under any circumstances and Barcelona could feel the consequences of that interest by losing one of their price offers for Neymar.
Scooter thrown around and damaged
On the night from Friday to Saturday, an unknown offender deliberately tossed a scooter parked in the Königsfelder street in front of the property number 30, causing damage of more than 200 euros to the cladding of the vehicle.
Police Schramberg, phone 07422 / 27 01-0, is asking for clues.
Police are seeking witnesses to an accident on the B 215 between Stolzenau and Leese.
Because a car hit him in his lane, the driver of a VW Touran had to evade and toured the control panel.
On Thursday night, the 34-year-old from Rehburg-Loccum was travelling towards Leese with his VW at around 7.55 p.m. on the B 215 from Stolzenau.
In the area of the town bypass of Stolzenau, he was confronted by a passenger car in his lane, so he had to escape to the right.
In doing so, the Touran driver toured the control panel.
Property damage was caused on the passenger car.
The driver of the oncoming passenger car, a Mercedes Benz, had overtaken a truck and continued his drive without taking care of the road accident.
It may be good, according to the accident victim, that the Mercedesdriver had not even noticed the accident.
Police are now asking witnesses to the incident, as well as the driver of the polluter's vehicle, to contact the commissioner in Stolzenau under Tel. 05761 / 92060.
Interview: 'Domspatzen report relieves Pope's brother Georg Ratzinger'
The Regensburg Domspatzen report on the abuse cases relieves Pope brother Georg Ratzinger.
This is what author and historian Michael Hesemann means.
The final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburg Domspatzen continues to hold discussions.
Christian Weisnder, spokesman for the reform movement "We are Church," said after publication to the German Press Agency that he expected an apology from the former Regensburg bishop and current Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as from the cathedral chapel master Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of the embattled Pope Benedict XVI.
It would greatly serve the prestige of the Catholic Church if Muller and Ratzinger expressed their deep regret at their own omissions or their false assessment of the events at the time.
The Vatican newspaper "Osservatore Romano," on the other hand, criticised the fact that "double standards" were applied in the reporting of violence in the domains.
With regard to the attacks in Regensburg, no one doubts that they were "disgraceful and shameful acts" that would have to be punished and prevented in the future, but the "degree of media manipulation" was striking, according to author Lucetta Scaraffia, historian and member of the national Italian Bioethics Committee.
"The habit of calling the Catholic Church a source of all evil is already part of everyday experience and prepares public opinion to think that is normal," Scaraffia writes.
In the interview with Bayerische Rundfunk, Prince Gloria von Thurn and Taxis also said: "You like to go on the church and that's a found fresco."
She also pointed out that in her youth, "beatings had been a very normal educational means" to cope with cheeky children, like I was one. "
They would find it unfair to apply today's standards to previous decades, because the world has changed.
In connection with the reports of the abuse cases, Pope brother Georg Ratzinger also often appeared.
The author and historian Michael Hesemann, who wrote the remembrance book "My Brother of the Pope" with Ratzinger (translated into 12 languages), is completely wrong.
"I have to protect Georg Ratzinger," says Hesemann, "because all this had nothing to do with him," he evaluates the results of the final report.
What exactly is the 440-page report presented by the lawyer Ulrich Weber, who was commissioned by the Bistum Regensburg with the Enlightenment?
A total of 547 Regensburg Domspatzen were sexually abused between 1945 and the early 1990s "with high plausibility" victims of assault, 67 domains.
In the final report, Georg Ratzinger, who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994, said: "In summary, it can be said that in many cases, Domkapellmeister R. used forms of physical and psychological violence.
Especially with high emotionality, the punishment for the students could also be more severe.
Nevertheless, in contrast to many other defendants, it is apparent that many victims appreciated the general humanity of R. and, therefore, in numerous cases, even combine positive memories with him despite violence. "
In the interview, Hesemann explains why he believes that the final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburg Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger will relieve the burden.
Mr. Hesemann, the 440-page report on the "incidents of violence on protective orders at the Regensburg Domspatzen" gives a contradictory picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger.
On the one hand, many students highlight his "humanity."
On the other hand, he also appears as a choleric and perfectionist who often became palpable when a dome treasure musically did not bring a top performance.
How do you, as his biographer, evaluate this final report?
Michael Hesemann: If you take the trouble and read the entire 440-page report from the front to the back, you have to ask yourself why the name Georg Ratzinger actually appears in it.
He has just eight pages dedicated to him and he is clearly acquitted of any suspicion of complicity or complicity in the horrific cases of sexual abuse.
The violence at preschool also occurred outside its sphere of activity.
One can at best accuse him of experiencing it too late or of not taking initial suggestions seriously enough.
The Domspatzengymnasium on which he acted was perceived by virtually all respondents as - so literally - "redemption," "heaven" and "better world."
For example, the vast majority of his students Georg Ratzinger gives an excellent testimony, describing him as "warm-hearted," "popular," "sincere," "competent" and "understanding," as an extremely good-natured teacher who regularly supplied the boys with cakes, biscuits and bonbons and always "surrounded by grapes of children."
Only a minority complains about his perfectionism and his high emotionality, which has already led to outbreaks of rage.
The fact that he not only knelt with chairs and threw the key dog on the floor, but also distributed ear coats and pulled all too cheeky guys at the hair or ears, he himself admitted years ago, deeply regretted and apologized for it.
To his salvation of honour, however, it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the period in question, the 1960s and 1970s, among parents as well as teachers.
Do you also know such methods of intimidation?
Of course, I think every one of us born before 1968.
I, too, have experienced this in a secular school, a state high school.
Compared to what this report is actually about, namely the appalling sexual abuse and the violence at preschool, these are, of course, bagatelles.
One wonders if it is not more to do with his notoriety and his role as the brother of Benedict XVI, that many media have just rushed at him.
Many who have never understood him are still busily working on the Bavarian Pope.
The truth, however, is that the report relieves Georg Ratzinger in every respect!
A great deal has been reported in the media in connection with the report on the issue of abuse at the Regensburg Domspatzen.
Will Georg Ratzinger also be charged with any involvement or complicity in sexual abuse in the final report?
Michael Hesemann: Clearly no.
None of the 67 victims of sexual assault claim to have entrusted themselves to the cathedral chapel master.
Not even the parents were inaugurated.
"I never dared to talk to my father or my mother about it," said one concerned representative for the others, "It was all very embarrassing to me."
The real problem in educating sexual abuse was, and still is, that most victims remain silent out of shame.
If they did not even entrust themselves to parents and siblings, then certainly not to a choir leader who would have been a colleague of the perpetrators in a professional way.
How do the Domspatzen students rate Ratzinger's role with regard to the abuse cases?
Michael Hesemann: A student in question put it this way: "Regarding sexual abuse... I see... no case in which he (Georg Ratzinger) would have had timely knowledge and could have stopped the respective offender.
I think it... is also really absurd to assume that it is precisely him... Buben have opened more insidiously or more clearly, or rather, than to their parents, boarding managers, trust teachers etc.
That you talk to him about sex... - unthinkable. '
Thus, the report comes to the very clear conclusion: "The fact that pupils and / or their surroundings were entrusted to him beforehand could not be confirmed as part of the investigation."
As far as sexual abuse is concerned, Georg Ratzinger is therefore free from any complicity.
Nor can he be accused of failing to prevent or display him.
There is therefore no reason to associate his good name with these resentful crimes, as unfortunately happened in some cases.
In the media there was much to read about "violence" at the Regensburg Domspatzen.
The former master of the cathedral, Georg Ratzinger, is accused in the report of "looking away."
Does he have to live with this accusation?
Michael Hesemann: That's the big problem, that in the coverage everything was mixed up and mixed up into a huge melange of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere, right in the middle of it, Georg Ratzinger.
But that, in turn, is an abuse of the report.
There is a clean separation: Between the preschool and the high school of the domains, between sexual abuse and violence, and, let us say, other allegations.
In addition, the report deals with incidents from the period since 1945, i.e. also from four decades in which Georg Ratzinger was not choir director of the Domspatzen.
All the terrible test pedagogy, the cases in which boys were literally harassed and maltreated by sadistic teachers and suffered horribly, all occurred at the preschool in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where truly scandalous conditions must have prevailed.
But Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do with them, because he only got to face the boys when they were already at the Domspatzengymnasium.
On that, as most witnesses point out, the subject of "pre-school" was taboo.
One was just happy to have escaped her and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even "paradisian" states.
What was different on the Domspatzengymnasium?
Michael Hesemann: There was discipline, but there was no sadistic violence.
And this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, where the report concludes that "many victims appreciated the general humanity of R. and therefore in many cases even associate positive memories with him despite violence."
So, at most, there remains the accusation of having looked away.
But despite all the efforts, the report could only define two periods in which it was told of the conditions at preschool.
The first time in 1970 / 71, when he just started to establish himself and did not want to hear anything about the events at a school where he did not work and was responsible (according to the witness), and then only around 1993.
Did Georg Ratzinger consistently close his ears before the conditions?
Michael Hesemann: No, because back in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Domspatzengymnasium, which the report even reproduces.
In it, he points out to them "that in pre-school the punishment of examinations continues to be practiced."
Even in the face of the danger of negative press releases, he recommended urgent intervention.
That was, of course, at a time when there was legal clarity, when punishments were long since banned in Bavaria, too.
Before that, they occurred in a legal grey area, as each of us probably still knows.
It was also difficult for him to estimate where those affected might have been exaggerated or dramatised and where the permitted limit had really been exceeded.
You can't say, though, he'd always looked away.
That is simply not true.
It was only in 1980 that the punishment for school examinations was officially abolished in Bavaria.
Prince Gloria von Thurn and Taxis claimed that it was unfair to apply today's pedagogical standards to the time.
How do you see that?
Michael Hesemann: We historians talk about the "pitfall of anachronism," that is, the danger of evaluating the past according to today's moral standards.
The princess is right.
But this does not, of course, apply to sexual abuse, which has been abhorrent at all times, nor to what has been breached in pre-school in terms of inconsistencies and violence against innocent children's souls, that goes far beyond what was then normal.
That's all quite terrible and I'm glad it's finally being worked up.
But at the same time I have to protect Georg Ratzinger, because all this had nothing to do with him.
His means of disciplining and punishing, that is, pulling ear cows and at the hair and ears, were widespread in the 1970s.
When physical punishment was then banned, he also strictly adhered to it.
What picture of his time in Regensburg did Georg Ratzinger give in the talks with you for the book "My Brother of the Pope"?
Did the subject of punishment also come up?
Michael Hesemann: Well, the book is about the life of his brother Joseph, that is, Pope Benedict XVI, tells from his perspective that the domains played only a minor role.
Nevertheless, I am by no means oblivious to the fact that he led a strict regiment there.
But this, too, must be said: Without this perfectionism, without demanding unconditional discipline, it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of world tranquillity from the previously nationally known Regensburg Domspatzen, true cultural ambassadors of Europe and its musical tradition, twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991) went on tour.
With biscuits and bonbons alone, one does not make any great singers out of recalcitrant boys and faces every success, in whatever field, but always discipline, passion and self-overcoming.
As what kind of person did you experience Georg Ratzinger during the talks on her book?
Michael Hesemann: Through the work on the book and beyond, I really got to know Georg Ratzinger very well and experienced again and again as wonderful, humorous, basic, deeply believing and good-hearted people, from whom one cannot imagine that he could even do something to a fly.
I regularly get along with how many former domains still today, 23 years after he was emulated, keep regular contact with him, visit him, read him out - he's almost blind - and treat him like a member of their family.
So those who still do not forgive him for once being strict with them are clearly in the minority.
Most domains are grateful to him today for enriching their lives and bringing the world of music to them.
And that he was always a good, paternal teacher - a strict father, certainly, that may be - but also a lovely person of respect to whom they still look up today and whom they almost revere.
And please, once again very clearly: All that he is accused of are educational methods that were on the agenda at the time.
We can be glad that we have long since overcome this time.
But it is highly unfair to make a man, just because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother, a media scapegoat.
The evil intention behind it is all too obvious.
Because the report, which has just been published, exonerates it.
Now the decency, a 93-year-old man who has earned great merit and without whom outside Bavaria and perhaps still Germany no one would know the Regensburg Domspatzen, would finally leave in peace.
