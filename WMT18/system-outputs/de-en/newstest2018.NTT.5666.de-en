Munich 1856: Four maps that change your view of the city
An asylum where young people are supposed to meet today.
A pit chapel, where is now dug for the S-Bahn tunnel.
Small gardeners manage the former land of farmers.
The oldest official map of Munich reveals exciting stories.
It is annoying when maps are out of date.
This is familiar to anyone who has ever had to get upset, because the Navi car showed a green meadow instead of a bypass.
The historical maps of the digital Bavarian atlas, an offer by the Bavarian Geoportal of the state government, are anything but up-to-date - but for this very reason very enlightening.
Especially if you compare them with current online cards.
Then it becomes clear how cities and municipalities in the distribution area of the Munich Mercury have changed since the 19th century.
The digital Bayern Atlas is a patchwork quilt that is not immediately recognizable as such.
More detailed maps, so-called judging sheets, for cities and municipalities have been included in the large map.
According to the Bavarian surveying administration, these were created between 1810 and 1864 and stem from the first survey of Bavaria.
Your sponsor: Napoleon.
The French army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the second coalition war with Austria.
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a topographical recording of Bavaria - for military purposes, of course.
Even though the French troops finally withdrew with the peace of Lunéville on February 9, 1801, it was today's neighbours who created the idea of a comprehensive map of Bavaria.
Elector Max IV. Joseph drove the project forward, founded the "Topographical Bureau" - and with it the Bavarian surveying administration.
The Official Journal for Munich dates back to 1856 and, like all others, can be found on the website of the Bayerische Landesbibliothek.
The comparison between the past and the present is most impressive on the example of the provincial capital.
The city has spread in all directions and has grown together.
An example of this is Untersendling, which still appears relatively isolated in the map of 1856.
Sendling was incorporated as a district of Munich 21 years after the creation of the map, i.e. in 1877.
Today Untersendling is in the middle of the city.
The houses of Untersendling concentrate around 1856 along the present-day Plinganserstraße, which was only named in 1878 after Georg Sebastian Plinganser, a leader of the Bavarian peasants "uprising against Austria in 1705.
Where the West Park is today, one sees nothing but fields - at first glance: When zooming in, a smaller map with dozens of lines and numbers appears: Hand-written flurries from the so-called "primeval recording" from which the property tax was derived.
Today, small plots are no longer occupied by farmers - but by small gardeners of the "Land in the Sun" plant.
A large green area stands out to the north of Untersendling.
The Theresienwiese, the site of the Oktoberfest since 1810, was actually still a meadow in the 19th century - and not a concrete desert.
On the other side of the Isar, the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.
In today's Au-Haidhausen district, the original page reads not only the street name "at the Gasteig" or the height "On the air" - but also in large letters, "Irren Anstalt."
Yes, here on the Auerfeldstrasse people were once locked up with delusions.
There, in 1858 / 59, the Munich Kreis-Irrenanstalt "On the Air" was created.
From 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden headed the institution - that psychiatrist who is brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II.
"He was progressive for his time and ended, for example, the chains of the so-called lunatics.
He has also forbidden the staff to use violence against the inmates, "says Hermann Wilhelm, director of the Haidhausen Museum, who has been working with the institution for an exhibition.
At first there was room for 280 patients, later it was extended to 500 places.
At some point, this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the roundabout facility in Haar 1905.
The Isar-Amper-Klinikum München-Ost, one of the largest psychiatrists in Germany, has been located there since 2006.
On the site of the former Auer Anstalt, young people now meet in the Salesianum in Munich.
The Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and converted it into a youth home with training companies.
To the west lies the football field of the TSV Munich East, to the east residential buildings from the 1980s.
In 2015, the children's house "Casa Don Bosco" was built, in an architectural style similar to the original building of the Irrenanstalt, which was destroyed by bombing raids during the Second World War.
The Marienplatz was listed as the "main square" around 1856, and the Kaufinger Gasse was the name of the shopping street.
The Second World War also brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich.
The Allied bombs ripped many holes into the city centre in December 1944.
A big one remained to this day - at the Marienhof.
The English Institute, small business houses and a greenery chapel from the Middle Ages once stood at the Marienhof, where the preparatory work is taking place these days and on 5 April 2017 the groundbreaking ceremony for the second commuter railway line.
With the slider, the old Munich map can be compared to the aerial view of today - and fill the hole at the Marienhof.
Civil rights group publishes travel warning for Missouri
The National Association for the Advancement of Colors has issued a warning for colored people travelling to Missouri due to the state's discriminatory policies and racist attacks.
"The NAACP Travel Advisory for the state of Missouri, due to enter into force by August 28, 2017, urges African-American travelers, visitors and Missourians to pay special attention when traveling through the state and exercise extreme caution, as a number of questionable, race-based incidents are reported here in recent times and throughout the state."
A recently passed Missouri law that makes it harder for people to win discrimination lawsuits, as well as the state's law enforcement agencies that disproportionately target minorities, prompted the group to issue the travel warning, the NAACP said.
"You have violations of civil rights that happen to people.
They are stopped because of their skin color, they are beaten up or killed, "the president of the Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, told the Kansas City Star.
'we hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven't heard yet. '
It is the first such warning the organization has issued for a state in the US.
The group cited incidents such as racist misdemeanours against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died in questionable circumstances earlier this year after he ran out of gasoline during the journey through the state and was taken into custody by Missouri police without being accused of a crime.
The council also points to a recent report by the attorney general's office of Missouri, which shows that black motorists in the state are stopped 75 percent more frequently than whites.
"The recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families, friends and co-workers about what could happen in Missouri," Chapel said.
'People need to be ready, whether it's bringing deposit money or letting relatives know they're travelling through the state. '
Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest figures from the FBI's hate crime reporting program, which ranked the state in 16th place in the country in terms of the number of such violations.
The travel warning is also a response to a new Missouri law that would make it harder to sue a company for housing or job discrimination.
Previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) had issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after states passed immigration laws requiring local law enforcement agencies to arrest people for immigration violations, which the ACLU believes will contribute to further racial profiling.
Travel warnings are usually issued by the State Department for other countries, but lately interest groups have used the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the US.
Grazing fence project is elementary
The Fischerbacher Weidezaun project is a success project and will be continued in the coming year.
CDU members Peter White and Kordula Kovac took a picture on the spot.
At the Schwendemann family's graveyard, representatives of the fishermen's CDU local association met with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two deputies.
Markus Schwendemann first provided insights into his farm, in which he farmed 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, fed 40 dairy cows and just as many young animals and housed holiday guests in five apartments.
For him, "Black Forest milk" is the alternative marketing route for the milk of his cows, according to Schwendemann.
The table of the holiday guests is exclusively regional.
Since he is also BLHV chairman of Fischerbach, he described the pastureland project as "fundamental."
I cannot manage on such steep land for profit.
The grassland area provides for a lot of work, a lot of things had to be worked on with the motorsense.
"We are struggling here with the conditions and with the topography," Schwendemann pointed out.
In 2003 he took over his parents' farm and managed it without chemical plant protection and fertilizer, even if he did not run a organic farm.
For Mayor Thomas Schneider, it was clear: "The municipality has recognised the importance of the Weidezaun project and is pleased with the support of the Leader."
At a cost of between EUR 3 000 and EUR 4 000 per hectare, farmers would have to be supported.
It is hoped that the afforestation of the land could be dragged out for quite some time.
"The greatest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and are concerned about how to further their operations," the mayor stressed.
Farmers are often criticised for support
A total of 25 parcels of eleven participants were fenced in 2013.
The open area is 40 hectares, which may not be reforested until at least 2023.
Of the total cost of EUR 71 500, half was funded by Leader, and one quarter was borne by the municipality of Fischerbach.
This left the farmers with EUR 12 610, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometres of pasture fence.
"The big advantage is the longevity of the fences," Schwendemann explained.
Kordula Kovac stressed: "You are doing a really good job, you cannot do without farmers and rural women."
Peter White also stated: "This is where the best foods are produced."
The Landscape Leadership Directive (LPR) Baden-Württemberg allows state support for grazing fences.
The aim is to keep the Black Forest open.
A prerequisite is the existence of a funding environment called by the LPR.
In addition, the fenced-in area must not be tradable (slope over 35 percent) and must therefore be threatened by afforestation.
For the FISCHLER WeidezaunProject 2018, the application is currently being made by eight participants with 24 plots who want to build almost 16 kilometres of fence.
The disclosure area is 35 hectares and the calculated cost is more than EUR 112 000.
Is nothing sacred anymore?
Now the White House of Trump is taking the Statue of Liberty
The surest sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues.
The Americans value these as much as any other - hence the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein in Firdos Square in Baghdad in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologues of the Trump regime, certainly knew what he was doing when he took a symbolic axe in a heated dispute with CNN's Jim Acosta over the president's proposals to drastically curb legal immigration with the Statue of Liberty.
To be fair, Miller did not attack the statue itself.
A horde of boat owners and Liberty impersonators would have lynched him if he had done it.
But he attacked its meaning, and in particular the meaning attributed to it, when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus was added to its base in 1903, 17 years after the monument was completed.
As Miller Acosta quipped, "I don't want to go into a complete thing about history here, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the world.
The poem you're referring to, which was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty. '
Miller is factually correct, but as he himself put it, it's not really about history.
It's about the contemporary resonance to the stirring words of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state not only invites any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "Your tired, your poor, / your beleaguered masses who yearn to breathe freely, / the wretched of your coasts."
There was never a time when the "miserable waste" was better seen on our screens.
Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people are not welcome in Trump's US.
This conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural dispute: It is indeed a conflict about the meaning of America.
Lazarus - and her friends who campaigned to place their words at the base after her death - knew very well that they were performing a highly political act.
The sculpture was intended to show the connections between French and American Republicanism by depicting in a worn classical visual representation the female embodiment of freedom.
Lazarus changed this meaning: In her poem, the female figure is no longer abstract - she has been given a voice.
And she gives herself a very different name: Mother of exiles.
The combination of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American nativism.
And just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, the people from the right wing wanted to change this back a long time ago.
The great shrine Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty did not invite anyone, but was rather an early neo-conservative who brought the American flame to the encircled world: "Lady Liberty is moving forward.
It is meant to carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
The torch is not meant to light the way to the United States. '
It is quite unusual for Limbaugh to come across something here.
The meaning of the statue is entirely a question of the standpoint of perception.
The great imaginative act of Lazarus was to see her as she was seen by the exhausted, miserable but hopeful people after long and often terrible journeys on the decks of ships.
In the truest sense, it's about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives.
Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome they need to hear.
And that, of course, is not the perspective that Miller and Trump would ever want to acknowledge.
Their torch is not meant to light the way, but to ignite the hatred that is their only source of power.
World Cup 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish members of the UK team
Eilidh Doyle remembers a time when only two Scots belonged to Britain's team
The UK's performance director of athletics, Neil Black, says the 16-strong Scottish contingent in the World Cup squad "will make a massive contribution to the team."
A record number of Scottish athletes have been selected for London 2017, which kicks off on Friday.
Black believes "something special is developing in Scotland" and UK athletics needs to learn something from it.
"We welcome it, and we're trying to understand it, and we'll keep it going until we find out," Black said.
'i talk to people at the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it's something to do with what they've done.
The Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done.
British athletics: It has something to do with what they've done.
And also with the type at the street corner.
Whatever the combination of circumstances, it's absolutely brilliant. '
Several of the Scottish athletes are medals contenders, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will line up against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m track, while Eilidh Doyle has been voted team captain by the squad.
"Eilidh is quite modest.
Her captain's speech was incredible, "Black says.
"A number of athletes, whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train, walked out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated.
The passion and the real feeling that Eilidh brought in quite naturally were great. "
The Commonwealth silver medalist, who will compete at her fifth World Championships in the 400m hurdles, says it is "incredible" that 16 Scots are in the British squad.
Scotland's previous best total of athletes at the World Cup was seven, achieved in 1983 and 2015.
The middle-distance runner Muir leads this way and set five British and two European records last year.
She will take part in the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m races.
Chris O'Hare, who runs 1,500 metres, is another Scot to watch after a great season that included victory at the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games.
Doyle remembers her first World Championships, when the only other Scot in the team was Lee McConnell.
The team captain says she is "enormously proud" of the fact that many of her compatriots not only belong to the team, but in some cases will also participate in the medals and finals.
"The special thing about being team captain is that she was chosen by the other members of the team, so it was a huge honour anyway, but knowing that my team-mates voted for me and chose me makes it something very special for me," she added.
'Obviously I'm very proud of all the Scots who belong to the team.
It just shows how far we have come.
And they are here as established athletes, athletes who want to rise to podiums.
As for my speech as captain?
Yeah, I think she went well.
I just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation, as we have a home World Cup.
So it's really important to put on this home support and take advantage of the fact that we are back in the Olympic Stadium.
I'll get a second chance to go out there and compete and it's just going to be such a great atmosphere out there. '
Blocking critics on Facebook: Don't apply for public office if you can't tolerate the heating up of voters
The father of our country knew something of bad press.
The Americans loved George Washington, but it didn't take long for the newspapers to beat him because of everything, from domestic politics to his political principles.
He chimed at the criticism, for sure.
But he has not silenced his critics.
Because in 1783, Washington said, "Freedom of speech can be taken away - and, dumb and dumb, we are led like sheep to slaughter."
Which brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan, who has to work to be more like Washington.
Hogan's staff have blocked and deleted the posts of at least 450 people who have expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page.
And the American Civil Liberties Union sued him because of that earlier this week.
The governor's staff dismissed the lawsuit as frivolous, and the online comment was full of a backlash with "Na, and?."
"It's just Facebook," many people said.
But it is important.
And it's particularly important when it's a guy like Hogan.
This is a Republican governor in an overwhelmingly democratic state that is amazingly popular.
He has the second highest approval rating of the nation's 50 governors.
Hogan is not a reactionary heathead.
He has shown a firm hand in running his state and strict adherence to principles.
He was also very adept at using Facebook as a primary means to connect with his constituents and playfully debuting his hapless head after chemotherapy on his page.
Thus, blocking people coming to the governor's side - which is a public forum called official and by employees paid with public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan's spokesperson Amelia Chasse defended the governor's actions, arguing that blocking the comments was nothing more than a moderation.
But it's too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hateful people swinging the whip online.
The post spoke to some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.
And these are just real people who talk to their elected leaders: A teacher, an entrepreneur and a pastor, not trolls.
They all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not profane.
The priest quoted the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogan's Catholic faith.
Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., was not hateful, but she asked about hate crimes.
"I politely commented that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other recent news," she wrote in the comments section of the "The Post" news release.
"I don't appreciate this idea either, if a number of people take a position on the same subject, then some people disregard it more as a so-called collective effort and do not recognize it as a large group of affected citizens."
What the governor's staff described as a "concentrated spam attack," others would probably call "intercession."
The Facebook era makes it easy to tailor a message by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment.
It is much cleaner than in earlier times, if one had done the same, that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical editorials, or to arrest and silence protesters.
But this is exactly what is happening digitally.
Hogan is not the first public official to be criticised for slamming Facebook and other social media outlets.
President Trump is being sued by Twitter users who have been blocked by his Twitter feed.
One of the first milestones on this issue fell last week in Virginia.
The chairman of the Loudoun County Board of Supervisors violated the First Amendment, according to U.S. District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when she banned a voter from her Facebook page.
And in Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit from the ACLU because of his use of Facebook and Twitter.
That should not be so hard.
At the time of Washington, the time of the affordable port had a similar effect to the internet.
The number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letter writers swooped in on his leadership.
And even then, Washington had anonymous trolls.
The people who used pseudonyms such as "Juricola," "Valerius," "Belisarius" and "Portius" wrote all the letters to newspapers that put down Washington's decisions.
Petitions criticising his position on the Amity Treaty, trade and shipping with Britain overwhelmed his office, according to historical documents collected by the online papers of the George Washington Project.
But he did not silence them.
Freedom of speech, dissent and discourse are the foundation of our nation.
And true leadership means accepting that.
Ronan Rafferty hopes for home comforts at the Renaissance Club
Former European No 1 Ronan Rafferty will be hoping for home comforts over the next three days, as the Renaissance Club in East Lothian hosts the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open.
The Northern Irishman, who led links to the final round last year next door at the Archerfield before losing against Paul Eales, has been linked to the new venue and acts as a tournament ambassador on behalf of club founder and CEO Jerry Sarvadi.
"I've seen the Renaissance Club built, and we see how it achieves its glory with this event," Rafferty said.
'the players will see this course at its best, he's in a great state.
Jerry did a great job when he laid down this place.
He is an avid advocate of this game and is proud of his performance here.
This is a great showcase for this course. "
The Englishman Eales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time, although he has won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour in his 32-year career.
"This feels really special," said the player, who is based in Southport.
'i haven't been able to defend the Extremadura Open since it was taken out of the program the year after I won it.
Coming back to this part of the world is magical.
It's a wonderful place to play golf.
The memories from last year are coming back, and it was special for me and my wife Sharon to win here last year.
It was a really special time and one we'll always cherish. '
Gary Orr, who came to the European Senior Tour after his 50th birthday earlier this year, is returning to action on home soil.
This event will be his first Scottish appearance since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
"It always means a little bit more when you play at home," said Orr, the man from Helensburgh.
'you want to do it well, but you also feel that extra pressure.
I really enjoyed playing again, and I played some solid golf.
I am happy with the way things have gone so far. "
Joining the trio on the field are former Masters winner Ian Woosnam and senior major champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are among the six Scots in the field, the others being Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
Admission is free, parking costs £5 per car with one occupant and £10 per car with two or more occupants.

Reduced lung cancer due to passive smoking
In the past two decades, fewer and fewer people have died of lung cancer due to passive smoking.
Scientists from the University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) come to this conclusion in a study.
"According to our estimates, 167 lung cancer deaths per year are due to passive smoking," said study leader Heiko Becher.
As a comparison, he drew up his own study on this subject from 1994.
At that time there were still 400 cases of lung cancer death due to passive smoking per year in Germany.
The new investigation is published in the International Journal of Public Health.
Home connections prove to be very complex
Construction work on Villinger Street is in full swing and "lies reasonably in time," according to the head of the construction yard, Fred Heinze.
In the area of domestic connections, the situation is more complicated than assumed, because a lot is hidden underground, which is not mentioned in the plans.
The traffic, which repeatedly obstructs the construction work, is a major problem for the construction site of the company Stumpp.
"The ignorance of drivers in front of red lights and barriers is already enormous," reports Heinze.
The road was closed and only the buses were allowed to pass through.
Angelo Caruso, Marvin Kostorz and Tim Kostorz of the company Stumpp have been busy with the work on the bridge for weeks.
"The hot days were pretty exhausting.
But luckily we were provided with cool mineral water by our friend Fritz Matt, "says Marvin Kostorz.
Poverty and death in the Indonesian gold country
When Bardina Degei cooks dinner, she doesn't use a stove.
She even rarely uses a pot.
In her wooden house in Enarotali, the capital of the Paniai regency in the troubled Indonesian province of Papua, the housewife usually puts a sweet potato - locally referred to as "nota" - directly into the fireplace.
After half an hour, the charred tuber is removed with zealous, unwashed hands and devoured.
Degei sits on the clay floor - she has no furniture - where she also performs her daily work, such as washing dresses with murky water from the nearby swamp.
A bucket in a homeless room serves as a latrine.
As the youngest of her husband's four wives, she was not assigned any fields.
Polygamy is common here.
Of course, working late can be dangerous: Most village men are unemployed, and many drink heavily, and there are the soldiers here.
"Nobody dares to walk around the village after 5pm," she says.
It is a rare glimpse into daily life in the highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony that began in 1969 after a controversial referendum in Indonesia, when only 1,026 elders were due to vote in front of the occupying forces by a public hike.
An existing movement that stirred up for independence against Dutch rule quickly turned against the government of Jakarta, which maintains control of the region and excludes foreign journalists or legal observers from it.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua, with the independent part of Papua New Guinea encompassing the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is as remote as it is desolate. The trip includes a 90-minute flight from the provincial capital of Jayapura to Nabire, and then a 5-hour morning car journey by car.
There is no public transport.
The town of about 19,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences, and corrugated iron roofs that have been converted by rust into various yellow-brown tones.
Very few Indonesians have made their journey here, let alone journalists and virtually no foreigners.
Before Christian missionaries arrived, Mee Pago Papuans worshipped a god named Uga Tamee.
There were also other changes.
"We weren't used to wearing these clothes," says Degei, pointing to her vibrant, hand-woven turban, her dark shirt and her bright skirt.
"We used to have only leaves on our bodies."
Papua is Indonesia's poorest province, where 28% of people live below the poverty line and have some of the worst child mortality and literacy rates in Asia.
But it is also Indonesia's gold country.
The world's largest and most profitable gold mine, Grasberg, owned by the Freeport McMoran from Phoenix, is just 60 miles from Paniai, a highland province the size of New Jersey with 153,000 residents.
In 2015 alone, Freeport lost $3.1 billion in gold and copper.
In addition, Papua has timber resources worth an estimated $78 billion.
These riches, however, are a source of misery for the Papuans, who ensure that Indonesia's powerful military maintains a stifling presence.
A 2005 investigation in the New York Times reported that Freeport paid local military personnel and units nearly $20 million between 1998 and 2004, including up to $150,000 to a single officer.
Papuan demands for greater autonomy threaten these golden goose and are treated mercilessly.
According to activists, more than 500,000 Papuans have been killed and thousands have been raped, tortured and imprisoned by the Indonesian military since 1969.
Mass killings in Papua's tribal highlands in the 1970 "s became genocide according to the Asia Human Rights Commission.
In the region alone, Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful protesters last year.
"We will lose everything" says a 2016 report by the Archdiocese of Brisbane, which included reports of atrocities from the previous year, such as unlawful executions and torture - rape and electric strikes are particularly popular, according to another report - and the brutal crackdown on peaceful demonstrations.
"It's difficult to count the number of victims as incidents happen every week," says Andreas Harsono, Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch.
The screws have intensified as Papua's resources bring an influx of settlers from other parts of Indonesia.
The population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83% Christian, but the demographic trend is changing as Muslim economic migrants come from the populous islands of Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Javanesian waiting canteens sell fried chicken and Gado-Gado, a mixed vegetable served with peanut sauce.
Local people struggle to keep up here.
"The migrants have started selling chickens and vegetables in the traditional market cheaper than local Papua," explains Abeth You, a 24-year-old Paniai native who moved to the provincial capital Jayapura for work.
'it has cost the local Papua - the mum-mum [the women] of Papua - their market. '
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, popularly known as Jokowi, promised to address inequalities and rights violations in Papua during his 2014 election campaign.
The former carpenter secured 27 of the total 29 districts of Papua - including Paniai - on his way to the presidential palace in Jakarta.
But in Papua, little has changed, and today the locals feel betrayed.
"Our hearts are broken because we voted for Jokowi in 2014, with the expectation that he will fulfill our hopes that justice will be restored," says You.
In fact, just two months after Jokowi's inauguration in October, Paniai suffered a low point.
On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children were outside, singing Christmas carols in front of a campfire in Enarotali when two Indonesian soldiers broke through the darkness on a motorcycle.
The terrified children told them to turn on their headlights.
One of the soldiers took offence at their clay and later came back with four soldiers, according to local pastor Yavedt Tebai.
The soldiers who had been drinking were hunting and beating the group with their rifle butts, victims and witnesses said.
Then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children.
One child, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was beaten so severely that he fell into a coma.
A few hours later, the building of the nearby government commission was set on fire and things escalated the next day.
About 1,000 young Papua men, women and children gathered on a football field in front of the local police station and the military command center to demand justice.
They wore ceremonial hunting arches and performed the Waita dance - running in circles and imitating a bird song - by Papua's Mee Pago tribe.
Some demonstrators began throwing stones at police and military posts.
As the mood heated up, the soldiers were sent an order via an internal funk: "If the masses resist more than three times, they shoot them dead," according to an official TIME document, which has not been released to local media.
Yeremias Kayame, 56, the head of the Kego Koto neighborhood of Enarotali, saw the imminent danger and called for calm and urged the crowd to return home.
No one was in the mood to listen.
"When I turned around, I was suddenly shot in my left wrist," he told TIME on the porch of his colorfully painted wooden house.
Kayame still doesn't know who fired, but says that the bullet came from the ranks of the soldiers gathered here.
"It was crowded, many shots were fired," he adds.
Local man Alfius Youw was hit three times, according to his cousin, who witnessed the shootings.
"I ran to him and examined his body to make sure he was," Yohanes, who, like many Indonesians, bears only one name, told TIME in gloomy mood.
'i saw he was dead... I kissed him. '
The chief inspector of the Papua police, Yotje Mende, told reporters that his officers only wanted to "secure" her station because she was being attacked.
"We must defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us," Papua Police spokesman Commissioner Pudjo Sulistiyo said in 2015.
'it's about life and death. '
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and many more injured.
The news of the killings came 'filtered' to Jakarta only the following day.
For three weeks, Jokowi gave an impassioned speech in Jayapura in which he expressed sympathies for the families of the victims and vowed to address the historical grievances in Papua.
"I want this case to be resolved immediately so it won't happen again in the future," he said.
Security Minister Wiranto said in October 2016 that he was setting up an out-of-court mechanism to settle historic human rights violations.
But the excuses began almost immediately.
"Most of the injuries occurred a long time ago.
Some were in the 90's and early 2000's.
The point is that we are committed to addressing these violations, but there are processes that need to be gone through, "he said.
Then Wiranto made a withdrawal when he spoke to TIME in Jakarta on June 5, saying he had no plans to set up a complaint mechanism in Papua.
Instead, "everything is legislated for," he said.
Wiranto, whom the UN has indicted for "crimes against humanity" that claimed more than 1,000 lives in East Timor's bloody independence vote of 1999, said 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua had already been settled, including the Paniai incident.
Families of the Paniai victims took such claims with grim incredulity.
"I've been interviewed four times in the last three years, but there's been no progress whatsoever," says Yohanes.
"I'm tired."
He says that years later he still lives in fear.
"I'm scared," he says.
'i'm afraid of being arrested by the military, I'm afraid of being shot. '
His brother Yacobus repeated the view that people in Paniai are afraid to discuss the incident.
He says he was beaten by the military after he helped bury four of the victims.
"After I buried the bodies, the military searched for me," he says.
The shootings have not stopped.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police shot at villagers in Paniais neighborhood Deiyai.
During a confrontation between villagers and the manager of a construction company who refused to take an unconscious man to the hospital, one person died and 17 others were injured, including children.
The man, 24-year-old Ravianus Douw, who drowned when he was fishing in a nearby river, died on his way to hospital.
Excited villagers protested in front of the company's site office.
Police said that the villagers threw stones at officers who responded by firing warning shots.
But locals say the mobile brigade (Indonesian paramilitary police) began shooting at the crowd, killing one.
"We were so panicked, we are afraid that there will be revenge," says 29-year-old Dominggu Badii, who lives near the hospital and witnessed how the injured were quickly hospitalized here, according to TIME.
'i've been hiding in my house for two days. '
The Deiyai Parliament has called for the officers involved to be held accountable and for the police's mobile brigade to be withdrawn from the area.
Paniai has always been a source of trouble for the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development strengthens the dissatisfaction of the tribal members Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal, who live in the green highlands of Papua.
Many joined the "Free Papua Movement" (OPM), the rebel army which claims to defend Papua's rights by launching sporadic attacks and kidnappings of Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the top OPM leaders are from Paniai, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
In response, thousands of people have been arrested and arbitrarily detained in Paniai in recent years, under the pretext of "securing national sovereignty."
Some never show up again.
Among people in Papua, Paniai is known as "a tragic, forgotten place."
Poverty strengthens dissatisfaction.
The bit of rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive for locals.
Bread is just as out of reach.
The people here grow everything they eat: Especially nota and fruit and leafy vegetables.
Agriculture is the task of women, who can each work four or five fields of sweet potato.
They keep most of the harvest for the family, while the rest is sold on the local market.
Ten pieces of nota cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Over time, economic inequalities have grown between native Papua and the new migrants who have arrived in greater numbers since the opening of new routes to Nabire airport.
The few jobs that exist in the region usually go to the better-educated and wealthier migrants.
Papua rarely have the capital or the necessary skills to run their own businesses competitively.
"The young people are not interested in staying in the village... because there are no jobs or money here," says John Gobai, the chairman of Paniai's tribal council.
Isolation keeps the eyes of the world away from Papua.
In addition, restrictions on international media coverage remain tense.
Earlier this year, French journalists Franck ESCUDIE and Basille Longchamp were deported from Papua due to a lack of coordination with related institutions, although they were given rare permission to film.
According to Phelim Kine, deputy Asia director of Human Rights Watch, the promises of Jokowi's election campaign to lift reporting restrictions in order to promote transparency and development have not been realised.
"There are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to report from Indonesia's most troubled eastern provinces of Papua and West Papua: Visa denial and a blacklist," he said in a statement.
Lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indonesian government remains largely confined to Papua's immediate neighbours.
In March, six Pacific states - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the "various and widespread violations" in Papua, including the Paniai shooting.
The same countries have historically supported the OPM.
Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesman Arrmanatha Nasir rejected the group's allegations, telling journalists in Jakarta: "A democratic system still applies in Indonesia and there is free media so it is difficult to cover up the evidence of human rights cases."
Local people want more foreign governments to take note of this.
When an official delegation from the Netherlands, led by Human Rights Ambassador Kees Van Baar, visited Jayapura on May 4, locals broke their silence and urged him "We want freedom," according to a source who also attended the meeting but wished to remain anonymous.
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019, but the Papua say they are unlikely to vote for Jokowi again.
"Jokowi is a person who has good intentions, but he is surrounded by the people involved in the panic ai shots," says Gobai, the chairman of the tribal council.
He wants Jokowi to know that the Paniai people, apart from living under the constant threat of a predatory military, are in poor education and health services.
Gobai says that the Paniai people, like other Papuans, regard their vote for Jokowi as a "debt" that he must repay.
"They don't need money, they just want justice," he says.
Despite the threats and intimidation, families of the Paniai gunshot victims carried out a final symbolic act of defiance: The body of a victim was buried on a site just opposite the police and the military station.
They know they may never get justice, but at least they do not let those responsible forget their crimes.
"A member of our family was killed," Yacobus says with his head lowered.
"What else can we do?"
Fire capture the 'Torch' skyscraper of Dubai for the second time
A fire took place in one of the world's tallest residential towers in Dubai on Friday, forcing hundreds of residents to flee from the 337-metre-high, 79-storey building.
It is the second fire to sweep through the high-rise building in just two years, which is accidentally called the Torch Tower (torch tower).
The building was evacuated, no injuries were reported, and there was no direct word on the cause of the blaze.
"We slept and we got up at the fire alarm and when people were screaming.
We ran down the stairs, and it took about 10 minutes to get down from the 50th floor, "one resident, who gave his name as George, told Reuters.
Dubai's civil protection authorities said fire-fighting units extinguished the fire at around 4am local time (00.00 GMT) and cooled the building.
The government said it was working on providing shelter for those affected.
The incident may revive questions about the safety of materials used in outdoor areas of high-rise buildings around the world.
An investigation by the management of the Torch building after its fire in 2015 found that most of the damage came from cladding, exterior cladding to decoration or insulation.
In Britain, police said they believe the system of plates used for insulation and cladding at London's Grenfell Tower in June may have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire in which about 80 people died.
No Davis Cup reform: Continue best-of-five
The president of the International Tennis Federation (ITF) has fallen through with his great Davis Cup coup at the General Assembly.
At the meeting in Ho Chi Minh City, the revolutionary proposal for this sport to play Davis Cup singles only on two winning sets was not supported by the required two-thirds majority.
The five-set classics, which are often very long, but also very much appreciated, are thus preserved in the traditional competition.
63.54 percent of member countries voted in favor of the reform, so the goal of ITF President David Haggerty was only narrowly missed.
'we respect this decision, but are disappointed that our member nations have not adopted the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and Fed Cup.
We need a change to secure the long-term future of these iconic and historic competitions, "Haggerty said.
They will continue to work to improve the competitions.
After many objections, the proposal to hold the final in a neutral location had not even been put to the vote.
New from 2018 are only comparatively minor details: In the future, the finalists in the Davis Cup and Fed Cup will have the host right in the first round the following year.
In order to reduce the costs for the organisers, the requirements in terms of training places, etc., will be made easier and players will have to make fewer official media appointments before the Davis Cup.
More than 1 in 5 US travellers bring banned items into the plane, a survey finds
A survey among airline passengers found that more than 20 percent deliberately or unconsciously smuggled prohibited items past U.S. Transportation Security Administration checkpoints, including at least 6 percent who entered the plane while accidentally carrying banned knives or other items with blades.
Less than 1 percent claimed they had discovered belatedly that they had mistakenly travelled with firearms, ammunition or explosives.
The survey of more than 1,000 people - conducted by a jet charter service, Stratos Jet Charters Inc. - also found that younger travelers were more likely to flout the rules.
Of the respondents who admitted they knowingly tried to fly with something banned by the TSA, 19.7 percent were millennials, compared with less than 15 percent who were members of Generation X.
The most common items intentionally passed by TSA agents were food and fluids.
More than 3 percent admitted having knowingly carried items with blades through security control, while 2.2 percent of female respondents and 3.7 percent of male respondents also confirmed that they had intentionally brought prohibited drugs into the plane.
The company said it had interviewed travelers across the country to find out how many had inadvertently brought contraband goods through airport security and how many had done it deliberately.
It's no surprise that the people most likely to carry contraband - knowingly or unknowingly - through security were the ones who fly most often.
However, the company points out that the TSA guidelines are somewhat complicated and confusing.
People are often unsure what liquids they are allowed to take with them or how much of it.
So it is no surprise that the largest amount of liquids seized by the TSA are prohibited.
For a time, people thought the TSA could view books as contraband.
Fluids are allowed on domestic flights, but not on international flights.
Elon Musk it doesn't matter: Tens of thousands of Tesla customers cancel order
Electro-Tausendsassa Elon Musk likes to give with the huge number of pre-orders for his new Tesla "Model 3."
So far, he has failed to acknowledge that some of the customers have already withdrawn their non-binding reservation.
In addition to the ever-triumphant figures for sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets, Tesla CEO Elon Musk has for the first time revealed a different, less luminous figure in the announcement of the latest quarterly balance: The cancellations of the new mass-market Model 3.
Musk had frequently advertised in the past few months with the more than 500,000 pre-orders for the new car, the delivery of which is just beginning.
Now Musk admits: Out of a total of 518,000 pre-orders, 63,000 have already been withdrawn.
Critics have repeatedly pointed out that these are only non-binding reservations.
In case of cancellation, Tesla will repay the 1000 Euro (1000 US dollars in the US and 1000 pounds in the UK) "reservation deposit" in full.
There are currently 455,000 such non-binding reservations, Musk acknowledged in a conference call with analysts.
However, the Tesla boss does not believe that the cancellation of so far about twelve percent of all orders could become a problem.
His argument: The challenge of ambitious growth targets lies not with demand, but with the production side.
Last year, Tesla delivered 84,000 vehicles.
In 2018 - all models put together - there will be 500,000, and in 2020 a million.
The demand for this is obviously there.
According to Musk, there are currently 1,800 reservations per day.
Anyone ordering a "Model 3" today can expect delivery in the second half of 2018 at the earliest - if Tesla manages to drive its brand-new production lines, which have never been tested in practice, without major disruptions with maximum capacity utilization.
Many experts doubt that this is possible.
However, if there are major delays, the non-binding nature of the reservations could become a problem for Tesla.
Because then the company cannot prevent unhappy customers from running away in droves.
EPA chief Pruitt withdraws because of delay in Obama-Era rules to reduce emissions
A day after he had been sued by 15 states, Scott Pruitt, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, reversed his earlier decision to delay implementation of the Obama-era rules to reduce emissions of smog-causing air pollutants.
Pruitt presented the change as his agency proved itself to be more responsive to the needs of state environmental authorities than previous administrations.
He did not mention the lawsuit, which had been brought against his previous post in a federal appeals court.
It is about a deadline that expired on 1 October for states to comply with the 2015 standards for ground-level ozone.
Pruitt announced in June that he would delay compliance for a year to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid "interfering in local decisions or hampering economic growth."
Pruitt, who was a prosecutor of Oklahoma before he was appointed by President Donald Trump, has long been a reliable opponent of stricter environmental regulations.
Since arriving in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly moved to block or delay regulations that the chemical industry and the fossil fuel industry oppose.
Wednesday's sudden reversal is the latest legal setback for Prut's regulatory rollback agenda.
Last month, a federal appeals court in Washington ruled that the EPA administrator exceeded his authority when he tried to delay implementation of an Obama administration rule requiring oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leaks.
In a statement released on Wednesday evening, Pruitt suggested that his U-turn on ozone standards simply reinforces EPA's willingness to cooperate with states through the complex process of timely compliance with the new standards.
"Under previous administrations, the EPA has often failed to meet the deadlines for implementation and then waited to be indicted by activist groups and others, and in an agreement to set the date for implementation," said Pruitt, who sued the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job.
"We do not believe in legal regulation and we take deadlines seriously.
We also take the law and the authority it gives us seriously. "
Still, the EPA's opinion said that Pruitt will at some point use his "power to delay and all other legally available powers" to ensure that the regulations are "based on sound policies and the best available information."
Republicans in Congress are pushing for a more comprehensive rewrite of the ozone rules.
A bill approved last month is expected to delay implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years.
The measure has not yet been put to a vote in the Senate.
New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who led the coalition of states that had sued the EPA this week, said the group planned to maintain legal pressure.
"The EPA's reversal - according to our lawsuits - is an important win for the health and safety of these 6.7 million New Yorkers and the over 115 million Americans directly affected by the smog pouring into their communities," Schneiderman said.
New York joined California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington and the District of Columbia in this case.
Ground ozone arises when pollutants from cars, power plants, oil refineries, chemical plants and other sources in the atmosphere react to sunlight.
The resulting smog can cause serious respiratory problems in sensitive groups of people, and contribute to thousands of premature deaths each year.
Public health officials and environmentalists cheered over Prut's surprising change of direction.
"It's worrying how much pressure it takes to get this sensible step from the person responsible for protecting the air we inhale," said Lori Ann Burd of the Center for Biological Diversity.
'we must continue to fight against the Trump administration's ideological crusade to pander to polluters and their special interests. '
Tumlingen celebrates 750 years of St. Hilarius Church
750 years of St. Hilarius Church: On the occasion of the anniversary of the mountain church is invited to the old cemetery area in Tumlingen on Sunday, July 16, at 4.30 pm to a serenade.
Whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the resort, the historic St. Hilarius complex is a popular place to stay.
Visitors to the sixth Benefiz Serenade can be captivated by this powerful place.
The rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the village has made the friends and patrons of Tumlingens their concern.
Walter Martini emphasizes: "It is a unique village treasure."
In 1267 the St. Hilary Chapel was mentioned for the first time in the official record book of Württemberg: Count Hermann von Sulz sold "the mountain with the parish church on it to Tumlingen and the Vogtei" to Magister Eberhard of Horb and to his brother Dietrich Silver.
According to the text of the document, apart from the former parish church, the Tumlinger Berg also had a splendid courtyard, to which the church or the patronage law belonged, and not the other way round.
So people also lived there.
As can be seen from the description of the Oberamt Freudenstadt in 1858, next to the lower village and the upper village, which can still be seen today in the village of Tumlingen, the "mountain" was the third, the splendid settlement centre of the village.
Old maps from the time around the year 1600 underpin these historical facts.
The right of patronage arose from the early medieval church law.
A gentleman who built, furnished and occupied a church with a priest remained the owner of this church and was also able to inherit this church.
Associated with this was the right to appoint a priest or to propose to the bishop a new pastor.
There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower.
The older of the two crumbled at Christmas 1673.
The newly created bell was first heard in 1692, but had to be delivered later in the Second World War in 1942.
In the 30-year war (1616 to 1648) the windows were smashed and the bells were stolen.
The roof was leaking.
In 1796, French troops camped near the church.
They broke out the pulpit and church chairs and used them as firewood.
Remains of the church threatened to collapse in 1809.
Until 1869, the Tumlinger Hilarius Cemetery also served as the final resting place for the dead from Hörschweiler.
In 1823 the cemetery was extended and the Hilary church was demolished.
Only the church tower was left standing.
On New Year's Eve 1834, a storm split the church tower and half collapsed.
To prevent an accident, the tower was demolished.
Only the tower dwarf, which still exists today, was preserved as a witness to the 750-year-old church history.
Today, Horst Kallenberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem are cultivating the Hilarius plant from the "creative pensioners" in place of Dieter Dockhorn.
As the organizer, the friends and sponsors invite Tumlingens on Sunday, July 16, to the sixth serenade in the old cemetery to the St. Hilary Chapel.
It is designed by the combo of the Kepler-Gymnasium Freudenstadt and with contributions from Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis.
Local leader Hartmut Romann speaks the final word.
The programme starts at 4.30 p.m.
Admission is from 3.30 pm.
At the end of the Serenade a drink takes place in front of the cemetery.
"Enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with the wide view over meadows towards the forest," the organisers point out the fantastic view.
The Serenade takes place only in dry weather.
The organizers hope for many supporters for the preservation of the historic St. Hilarius plant, which is important for tumblers and audiobooks.
The friends and sponsors of Tumlingens feel particularly committed to home care, as Serenade organizer Walter Martini affirms.
Association wants to have approval of wind turbines examined
"Boisheim resists" does not see any legal requirement for the construction and has therefore turned to the Landrat.
The "Boisheim Resistance" association has asked Landrat Andreas Coenen (CDU) to withdraw its permit for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Boisheim Nette.
It was carried out illegally.
The association argues that, at the time of approval on 30 December 2016, no wind turbines could have been approved at all in the Boisheimer Nette, as at the time in Viersen a wind power concentration zone existed only at the city border to Schwalmtal.
Within this concentration zone, the construction and operation of wind turbines are generally possible, but at the same time the concentration zone excludes the use of wind energy for the rest of the urban area.
Such zones are intended to prevent a "saving" of the landscape.
The city of Viersen had adopted a second wind power concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette by amending the land-use plan a few days earlier - but it had not been approved by the district government of Düsseldorf due to a formal error.
"Due to the lack of a planning requirement, the granted approval decision is still unlawful and can therefore also be withdrawn," said Christoph Erkens, Chairman of "Boisheim resist."
Current state of affairs: Before the summer recess, the city council has once again decided on the wind concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette; approval of the district government is still pending.
Erkens: "This means that planning permission for the construction of wind turbines is excluded at this point."
The circle confirms the receipt of the invitation.
"The relevant letters have been received by Viersen County since last week," a spokesman said.
The circle takes it as an opportunity to re-examine the matter.
However, they are not expected to lead to the proceedings being stopped.
In view of ongoing proceedings at the Administrative Court, the district on Thursday did not wish to comment on the content of the argument of the association "Boisheim resists."
NEW Re, a subsidiary of NEW, plans to build four wind turbines, each 200 metres high, on an area at the Boisheimer Nette.
Last year, the company, in which the city of Viersen is indirectly involved, had already signed leases with the owner of the 65-hectare site.
The construction of the four wind turbines is expected to meet the electricity needs of around 11,400 households - equivalent to about one fifth of the electricity needs of all four households.
NEW Re plans to invest around 20 million euros.
Last summer, Viersen City Council gave the go-ahead for the purchase of three wind turbines at the Linnich wind farm near Aachen, as well as a stake in a wind turbine at Übach-Palenberg in the Heinsberg district.
Car and tractor collapse: Woman dies in horrific accident
A terrible traffic accident took place on Friday morning at around 10 a.m. on the L 333 between Niederwallmenach and Bogel (Rhein-Lahn-Kreis).
One woman was fatally injured.
Two other people were slightly injured.
The state road remained closed for hours.
According to police, a 17-year-old young woman from Bornich was driving the L 333 towards the Bogel with her 53-year-old mother as an accompanying person as part of the escorted journey.
City and retailers plan "home shopping" weekend
Bad Langensalzaer and people from the region are to rediscover the shopping opportunities in the city centre in September.
The trade association and the city administration want to use the weekend on 8 and 9 September to lure the inhabitants to the city centre for shopping.
As the chairman of the trade association, Christian König, announced, the "home shopping" weekend is intended to sensitize customers about the offers their own city offers away from the usual supermarket merchandise.
A market is planned with regional suppliers, similar to the weekly market.
In addition, local companies will present themselves with their apprenticeships.
In addition, the shops of the city centre are to invite for "midnight shopping."
The action was not only aimed at residents of the city and the surrounding region.
In preparation are commercials on the radio, an internet video and printed bags that point to the weekend of action, according to Christian König.
The city administration and trade association cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce.
This will take the trade association and the city to another stage of the project "Attractive city centre."
These include new offers such as the first "Active Day" at the Brunnenfest and Sunday sales, talks with all traders and hosts to encourage them to take an active part.
Attractive offers for Saturday and the waiver of parking fees on this day are also part of the concept.
In addition, customer potentials are to be tapped or re-tapped.
This includes spa guests and tourists.
But also many locals would have lost sight of the city centre while shopping.
In the end, everyone would have to contribute to revitalizing the inner city - up to landlords, the businesses of the whole city and clubs.
It was a matter of using a network to overcome lethargy, which had partly spread, King had said in the spring.
Birgit Streich, head of the IHK-Center in Mühlhausen, announced that five Thuringian cities were taking part for the first time in the third "home-shopping" day in Germany.
In addition to Bad Langensalza, these are Weimar, Sömmerda, Heiligenstadt and Bleicherode.
The day should "promote the appreciation of local trade and emphasize its importance for the common good of our cities," he said.
The campaign led by the Chamber of Commerce and with many partners also made it clear that every citizen with his or her buying behaviour can influence his or her immediate environment.
Two dead and several injured after explosion at US school
During construction, there was a gas explosion in the school building.
New other people were injured.
Two people have been killed and nine others injured in a gas explosion in the US city of Minneapolis, some of them severely.
According to the fire department, one injured person was still in critical condition on Wednesday (local time).
One man died when part of a school building collapsed in the explosion.
A missing person was later also found dead.
The dead were employees of the school.
As a result of the accident, the authorities suspected work on a gas pipeline.
During the holiday season, only a few people stayed in the building of the Pyongyang Academy.
Trump put Mexico under pressure after leaked transcripts of phone calls over payment of border wall
Transcripts of phone calls between US President Donald Trump and leaders of Mexico and Australia have been published by the Washington Post.
On January 27, Trump called in a phone call with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto to stop saying publicly that he would not pay for a planned border wall.
The US president insulted him because he had publicly denounced the wall. According to reports, he said to him, "You can't tell the press that."
Trump launched his presidential campaign with a promise to build a wall on the US southern border and vowed to make Mexico pay for the project.
Transcripts of his first call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull were also published and revealed a tense exchange.
Mr. Trump told Mr. Turnbull that a trade for the U.S. to take refugees who emigrated to Australia was "ridiculous," "mies" and "stupid" and that insisting on trade mediated by the Obama administration would make him look like a "dump" after he proposed a ban on relocating refugees to the U.S.
Mr. Trump ended the call after telling Mr. Turnbull that "this is the most awkward call for the whole day."
Moores Ford massacre: Activists reintroduce racist lynching as a call for justice
A 1948 Ford Mercury drove through a group of spectators in rural Monroe, Georgia, rummaging towards Moore's Ford Bridge.
Before the car, which had four black passengers and a white driver, could reach the bridge, a group of white men with guns stepped out to block its path.
The mob's leader - a middle-aged man in a needle patrol suit - took a long train at his cigar and looked through the windshield, examining it.
Inside, the inmates were hovering in fear.
"We want this n ---- r Roger!" The man roared.
"Get him out of the car!"
Screams tore the silence when a young black man was dragged from the passenger seat.
Luckily, this horrific scene, which was played on July 22, is just a follow-up.
But when a noose is then thrown around the neck of "Roger," almost everyone in the audience threw out very real sighs.
Since 2005, civil rights activists have been coming back to Moore's Ford Bridge to emulate the night two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom, as well as George and Mae Murray Dorsey - were lynched by the Ku Klux Klan in 1946.
No one has ever been charged over the murders.
"It's really unfathomable that not a single person has been arrested in all these years - even though we see them in our communities, even though we know who they are," said Tyrone Brooks, who helps organize the follow-up.
'it's a dirt on a story, but it's a burden on our souls. '
Brooks is a 71-year-old former congressman of the state of Georgia and a lifelong civil rights activist.
For him, the replica serves as a dramatic call to action and represents an annual reminder to the Monroe community that an injustice has never been corrected.
"We want law enforcement, we want termination, we want healing, we want reconciliation, but first we need to get justice," he said.
"We cannot reach healing and reconciliation until we get justice."
A forensic doctor lays a bed sheet over the corpse of one of the victims of the Moore Ford lynching on July 27, 1946.
According to FBI records obtained by NBC News, more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding counties were suspected in the lynching process.
But none has ever been charged.
Although the suspects have remained at large for decades, civil rights activists say the double motivation for the Lynch actions has always been known throughout the city: Politics and sex.
In April 1946, a Supreme Court decision allowed black citizens in Georgia to vote for the first time in the summer's pre-election campaign.
At about the same time as the election, according to the FBI, black farmer Roger Malcom stabbed a white landowner, Barnett Hester, during a fight - allegedly because of a woman.
Brooks said the rumour in the city had been that Hester had slept with Malcom's wife Dorothy and that the baby she was carrying was not from her husband.
On July 25, 1946, Loy Harrison, a prominent white landowner, paid $600 to free Malcom from prison, according to the FBI.
He was escorted to the prison by Dorothy and her cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey.
But when they then moved away from the prison and approached Moore's Ford Bridge, a lynch mob surrounded the car.
"As it turns out, it was Harrison who prepared and ordered the killings," an FBI report concludes.
'it's also obvious that there was a plot between state and local law enforcement, which was not only involved in the murders, removed evidence and covered up the identity of witnesses. '
Brooks formulates it even more succinctly.
"It was a right-to-vote massacre," he said.
"They were all killed for sending a message to black people in this community:" If you register and if you vote, then this will happen to you here. "
For almost a decade, Cassandra Greene has spearheaded the annual rendition of the Moore Ford Bridge Lynch murders.
Her portrayal is vivid, poignant and is grounded in a kind of deep racism that many would like to believe no longer exists in America.
It's hard to watch, and even harder to look away, but Greene said that's the point.
"We don't want to talk about the lynching because then we are confronted with its ugliness in all of us," she said.
'but I can't build a relationship with you if you don't want to listen to me or don't want to hear what I've been through. '
Rehearsals for this year's production began in June, and on the first day nearly 30 actors - a dozen white and the rest black - crowded into a room and listened as Greene launched a well-reviewed review of the piece.
Wade Marbaugh is Greenes's co-director here.
He has played the role of chief clan member for years, but he said the role will never get easier.
"I feel dirty because I'm not like that," Marbaugh said.
'but I think it's very important to keep this story alive because we don't want to go back to these times. '
On the other side of the room, the actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, who play Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester, rehearsed their lines.
The play begins with Malcom shouting at Hester and harassing him, angry that he has slept with his wife Dorothy.
"I said, n --- er, disappear from my property!"
Rascona reciprocates the fire.
There is a break.
And then everyone (at least all black actors) erupts into laughter.
Greene laughs the loudest.
"What?!" Rascona asked.
He is alarmed and confused.
Was I too hard?
"No," said Greene, still chuckling.
"I just don't think white people said 'n --- he' at the time."
"Yes," joked one of the other black performers.
'you just have to hit the hard 'R.'. '
And that's exactly where the energy shifts in the room, a feeling of camaraderie replaces the discomfort.
Everyone is busy getting this right, not only because of the game, but also because of the memory of the four people killed.
The scene begins again.
This time, when Rascona says the N-word, he says it sharply and emphatically.
Absolutely no one is laughing.
This repetition ends violently and quickly.
There are screams, shots and then silence.
A woman, clothed with a funeral dress, stands over the bodies of the actors and performs Billie Holidays's grieving eulogy "Strange Fruit."
Her voice breaks at every second word.
About a hundred meters behind, a group of about four dozen spectators wipe sweat and tears from their eyes.
The audience is almost evenly divided between black and white.
A couple has arrived from Ithaca, New York, to see the performance, many just coming down the street.
They have all experienced Georgia's oppressive moisture for almost eight hours, when Brooks takes them on a pilgrimage to the tombs of the Malcoms and Dorseys.
Up to this point, the killings have remained an anecdote, but now, standing on the same land where the Lynch murders took place, the air feels ghostly.
When the last notes of the song come to an end, Greene invites the crowd to get closer and inspect the corpses.
Children sit at their heads, register the fake blood and the silent bodies and whisper to each other.
"They're not really dead," a little boy mumbles, as if he wanted to remember it.
After a few minutes, Greene thanks the crowd - and suddenly it's over.
The actors throw away the lynching rope and wipe away their tears.
Bradshaw embraces Marbaugh, the man in the suit who played the clan member.
Nick Rascona hugs two of his fellow players and then breaks down crying in her arms, the emotional burden of the performance finally breaking through with him.
"It's okay," one of the women whispers.
'we know that's not in your heart.
You've done that for a reason. '
Later, the audience sits down with the actors for dinner.
At a table, a white couple from Atlanta chatted excitedly about the rendition with a black couple they've just met.
Denise Duplinski struggled to find words about what feeling the performance has left behind.
"It's hard to hear these terrible words and actions... coming from people who look like yourself and who do that because they look like you," she said.
"What this really does to me makes me believe that the lynching is still going on," she added, "today this is just called police shooting."
In the same room, Tyrone Brooks Court holds on to his table, he eats and recalls the civil rights.
He said he had already started planning the performance next year.
"The aftermath is inspiring in a way, because it describes the horror of what we endured, but it's also a moment of learning," he said.
'it's like, if we don't learn anything from it, then it can happen again.
Those who do not study their own history, those who do not know their own history, are condemned to repeat it. "
"Götterdämmerung" reconciled the Wagnerians in Bayreuth
Also in the fourth part of Richard Wagner's monumental work, director Frank Castorf puts on a colorful-frivolous staging in front of gigantic, six-storey backdrops.
The rotary stage (designed by Aleksandar Denic) shows a shabby street corner with a wall rest and embellishment in Berlin, a "Plaste and Elaste" logo from East German times or the New York Stock Exchange.
Before that, an open Mercedes classic car is parked, in which the Rhine daughters pose as rock stars, or alternatively an Isetta.
Stacked oil barrels are reminiscent of Castorf's leitmotiv - money, power and greed - which runs through his "ring" staging.
The three Rhine daughters - sung by Stephanie Houtzeel, Wiebke Lehmkuhl and Alexandra Steiner - harmonize as they did in the "Rheingold" marvellous.
Kess seduce her Siegfried (Stefan Vinke), dragging a corpse into the trunk in Hollywood style and giving the Krawallo clique.
Stephen Milling sings the gloriously feathery hagen that surrounds the aura of a heavyweight boxer.
Brutal the scene when he shot Siegfried.
Later on, Gunther (Mark's oak) has to believe in it.
The audience would like to thank the ensemble with loud applause.
Tempestuously celebrated are Foster, Milling, Vinke and conductor Janowski, who humbly bows his hands to the Merkel-Raute.
There is great applause for the festival orchestra, which shows itself on stage for the first time - in view of the great heat again in empty casual clothing.
The appearance of Frank Castorf and his team of directors was eagerly awaited.
Had he still had to endure a glowing pipe concert in 2013, five years later there were great cheers in which the isolated "buh" cries went down.
Festival director Katharina Wagner should have been pleased about this.
"You realize that the audience has grown together with the" ring "in a way," she had said shortly before the dpa's performance.
The audience had not only made a form of peace with Castorf, but also an understanding of his view had grown.
I draw a positive conclusion.
Max crowd works as a volunteer
They work in several places during their volunteer year.
Where everywhere?
Crowd: Normally in Steinfurt in the furniture store, once a week I help out here in Greven in the furniture bridge.
And I have already worked at the school in the open day.
What are your experiences with this?
Crowd: It's a nice, broad spectrum that I see here.
I have to deal with different people, with young people, with refugees, with young adults.
They are now 26 years, so a late-career volunteer.
How come?
Crowd: I did baccalaureate.
And then a civil engineering degree, let's say, successfully canceled.
I realized for myself that it's the wrong thing for me and I want to do something else, work with people.
And then I asked myself, what are you doing.
Make a social year, there is an insight, there you can see how it really is on the spot, in the focal point perhaps also.
And was it?
Crowd: I've collected great impressions.
I will start my studies in the social sciences in the winter semester.
I will study on a dual basis, probably do a social worker training in Herne and study in Hamm at the university of applied sciences.
Isn't it a little unusual to have several different locations during the volunteer service?
Crowd: Yes, it's very variable.
It probably always depends on where you do your FSJ.
You can do it from retirement home to youth work - in all sorts of facets of social work.
With me it was very diverse.
I was also partly in the OGS, that is, in the afternoon care.
For me, that was just the right thing that irritated me.
I could recognise my own strengths and see how it really works out.
Unlike in civil engineering studies?
Crowd: Of course, this is not about calculating statistics.
You always have other people in front of your head, who each have a completely different story behind them.
Whether a refugee, whether a youth who has been taken out of the family - you always have to deal with it individually.
Very interesting.
And you had no touching fears?
Crowd: I'm not the guy for that.
It's an area that gives you a lot.
Lots of love, lots of kindness.
There are sometimes negative moments, but that's how life is.
Pearson cuts another 3,000 jobs and cuts dividend to revive business
British education group Pearson said on Friday it will cut another 3,000 jobs and cut its interim dividend by 72 per cent as another restructuring programme is launched to overcome the pressure facing the company.
The job cuts, which Director-General John Fallon mostly announced for late 2018 and early 2019, come on top of his previous restructuring, which has already lost 4,000 jobs.
Pearson announced a cost-cutting plan for another £300 million ($394 million) in a third cost-cutting programme in May to revive a business hit by the rapid move to digital learning.
The company, which divested its stake in Penguin Random House to partner Bertelsmann last month, said its outlook for the financial year was unchanged after it posted a 1 percent increase to £2.05 billion in the first half of the year.
Kabul convoy attack: NATO soldier killed in suicide attack
A suicide bomber has attacked a military convoy in the Afghan capital, Kabul, killing a Nato soldier and injuring several others, officials say.
Five soldiers and an interpreter were injured, a Nato statement said.
Unconfirmed local reports said that three civilians also died in the incident in the Qarabagh district.
The bombing is the latest act of violence to hit Afghanistan this month - more than 30 people were killed in a mosque in Herat on Tuesday.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
A Nato statement says the explosion happened on Thursday night when a joint patrol with the Afghan army was attacked by an "improvised explosive device worn by persons." "
The statement says that all the injured are in a stable condition and are being treated at the US military hospital on the Bagram airfield.
Correspondents say the growing strength of the Taliban and the group, known as the so-called Islamic State (IS) in Qarabagh, is a major concern for NATO troops in nearby Bagram.
According to the United Nations, there were at least 1,662 civilian deaths in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, about 20% of them in the capital.
At the end of July, a suicide car bomb killed at least 30 people in a mainly Shiite district of Kabul.
The Taliban said they had carried out that attack.
On May 31, a massive bombing in the center of the city killed more than 150 people with the country's deadliest militant attack since U.S.-led forces ousted the Taliban from power in 2001.
The violence underscores the precarious security situation in Afghanistan as US President Donald Trump weighs in to increase the number of US troops supporting the military and police in the country.
Correspondents say the suicide attacks in Kabul in recent weeks have also caused a crisis of public confidence in the government, its policies and, in particular, in the reputation of President Ashraf Ghani.
EPA reverses decision to delay smog rule after lawsuits
The US Environmental Protection Agency has overturned a decision to delay regulation of the Obama administration, which requires states to curb smog-causing emissions, a day after 15 states sued the agency for the move.
The EPA announced late on Wednesday the decision to push ahead with the so-called "ozone provisions 2015" and said it showed the agency's commitment to working with states.
"We believe in dialogue with and that we are responding to our state partners," EPA chief Scott Pruitt said in a statement.
Pruitt had announced in June the EPA's intention to delay the ozone regulations - in which pollutant emissions are to be measured in part of the country to determine where cuts need to be made to meet stricter air quality standards - by one year until October 2018.
A group of 15 mostly Democratic states, along with the District of Colombia, filed a lawsuit on Tuesday, saying the effort was illegal.
President Donald Trump's administration has sought to roll back a wide range of environmental conditionality imposed by former President Barack Obama as part of a broader agenda that, according to Trump, aims to boost economic growth.
However, the efforts have sparked the backlash from Democrats and conservation groups, who are worried about the impact of larger emissions on public health.
The EPA's website says that inhaling air that contains ozone can "reduce lung function and amplify respiratory symptoms" such as asthma.
Local council wants community space
In the end, the decision was clear: In the case of two votes against, the Municipal Council of Fluorn Winzeln decided to establish a common area in the future senior housing complex.
Before the discussion there is an important information: The purchase contract for the missing piece of land has been signed, reports Mayor Bernhard Tjaden.
Although it will take some time until the area previously belonging to the parish is in municipal ownership, there is now no longer any obstacle to planning the project to be undertaken by a private investor.
For this there is a discussion about a Community area.
One of the two investors still in the boat has offered to accommodate the community.
On the ground floor, it would provide a living space - around 55 square metres - and an adjoining terrace with as much as 70 square metres of space for a special price.
The administration and the majority of the municipal council would like to see such a communal space not just as a meeting place for the inhabitants of the seniors, but open into the community.
As an example, the word "knitting café" made the rounds.
Funding opportunities will sweeten the decision, which was already pre-decided last autumn by the provision of funds for the current budget.
The construction is in the refurbishment area.
Setting up a community space would be eligible, reports Tjaden, with 60 percent of 30 percent.
The proposal for a decision, in order to signal to the investor that it does not want to be thrown between its legs in this respect, provides for the conclusion that both semi-articulated - based on the surrounding area - and powder roof - which would reduce the separation and make construction economically feasible.
It is not only Wilfried Sohmer who thinks that this addition is unnecessary.
If it helps: Unanimously, he passes the body.
The common area is not so easy.
Daniela Ruf refers to the many buildings of her own that are not progressing very well, but now they are leaning out of the window in the common room, she says: "I'm having a hard time with that."
Yvonne Staiger is very much in favour of the Community area - but absolutely against communal participation.
It sees behind it a covert subsidy to already wealthy or even foreign investors.
This is not the case, because with the acquisition of the area one does not give a subsidy, but gets a real counter-value which can be marketed in case of doubt, is the counter-argument.
Staiger's request to split the proposed decision accordingly has three supporters.
So there are two votes against the original programme, which sums up Stefan Haller as follows: "If we take the decision like this, we will take a giant step towards closing a huge gap in our infrastructure."
Collision with car: Cyclist is flung on road
While crossing the road, an 82-year-old cyclist was captured by a car in Garath on Wednesday and seriously injured.
According to the police, the 82-year-old Langenfelder had been riding his bike on the bike path of the Black Way from the direction of Hilden at 12.20 am.
The senior wanted to cross the carriageway at the height of the road Am Buchholzer Busch.
A driver driving in the same direction gave him priority.
When the long fields drove on the road, he evidently did not pay attention to the oncoming traffic.
He collided with a car driving a 66-year-old aid worker.
The man was flung into the street.
He sustained serious injuries and was taken to a hospital with a towel truck.
FC Bayern Munich must dispense with David Alaba and Thiago in the Supercup against Borussia Dortmund
The Supercup takes place without him: David Alaba has to suck the game against Dortmund.
With personnel worries, FC Bayern will travel to Dortmund for the first mandatory game of the new season.
Seven pros are missing the defending champion in the Supercup against the Cup winner.
Staff worries at German football record champion Bayern Munich are getting bigger ahead of the Super Cup on Saturday (8.30pm / ZDF and Eurosport) at cup winner Borussia Dortmund.
Coach Carlo Ancelotti will also have to dispense with David Alaba in a duel with the BVB.
The Italian confirmed that on Friday.
In addition, the mouths of Manuel Neuer, James, Thiago, Jerome Boateng, Arjen Robben and Juan Bernat are missing.
For the five defeats in the past six Test matches, Ancelotti has blamed the physical condition and lack of balance in his team's game.
"We know we're not in the best physical condition," Ancelotti said, adding: "The most important point is the balance in the team.
Last but not least, it was not good. "
However, the 58-year-old believes in a performance boost in the first official mandatory game of the season.
"Football is also tactics, strategy, personality and motivation.
I have great confidence that my team is showing these qualities.
The squad is ready.
We want to play smart, "said Ancelotti, who is expecting a" difficult, intense game. "
The duel of the two German football heavyweights captivates the fans.
The game is sold out with 81,360 spectators, the German Football League (DFL) announced on Friday.
Walking in the resin from star to star
The first "star path" is to be created in the resin.
This is planned by the association Observatory St. Andreasberg.
There is a planetary path in Göttingen - since 2003.
A "star path" meets the information needs of many resin visitors, it said.
It combines nature, science, movement and athletic performance.
The members want to set up panels along the planned route and then inform about stars and constellations.
In a first phase until 2018, the association plans "easy-to-reach installations in five to six places" in the Oberharz.
These could be St Andreasberg, Braunlage, Hohegeiß and Sieber.
The information on the panels will be supplemented via the Internet.
Therefore, a good mobile network reception plays a role in the choice of location.
Accessibility is also a criterion.
Later, the star path is to be extended by train.
"On the star path, viewers learn a lot worth knowing, for example about the physics of the individual stars," the association explained.
They also learned why stars have different colors or why one star shines more strongly than another, even though it is much further away.
It is also conveyed in which constellation a selected star is and when it is best to be seen.
The association has been operating the highest observatory in northern Germany in the mountain town of St. Andreasberg since 2014.
According to the Federal Agency for Nature Conservation, the site in the heart of the Harz National Park is one of the six darkest regions in Germany.
From there, the Milky Way and even the Andromeda galaxy can often be seen clearly with the naked eye.
Since 2003, on the initiative of the funding association Planetarium Göttingen, there has been something similar in the university city to the planned star dwarf - the planetary path.
Starting in front of Gebhardt's hotel in the Goetheallee, which forms the interior of our solar system, the planetary path with its steles leads up to the Hainberg and the observatory - as well as an "alien" location in Diemarden (village equals) with the planet Sedna.
The steles with the individual planets - including the dwarf planet-degraded Pluto at the end point - are positioned exactly at the distance and scale of one to two billion.
The earth thus shrinks to a sphere of 6.5 millimetres in diameter, while the sun, which is exactly 75 metres away, measures 70 centimetres.
The total distance of the planetary path is a good four kilometers.
While the light from sun to Pluto takes about eight hours, pedestrians need a good hour to get to the stele with Pluto.
So pedestrians are faster than the light in space.
The march to the next fixed star, however, would take another half a year.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for the first time, discussing a possible showdown
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who were supposed to be in a collision course to stage the most exciting boxing match in the near future under 147 pounds, met for the first time on Thursday.
They were in separate rooms at ESPN offices in Los Angeles until Garcia, the undefeated World Boxing Council lightweight champion, walked down the hallway to greet Lomachenko, the world boxing organization's super-featherweight champion.
Following Garcia's victory by unanimous decision over former four-division world champion Adrien Broner on Saturday on Showtime, both fighters are members of the top-five Pound-for Pound list.
Garcia stretched out his right hand and said, "How are you doing, Champion?
I wish you good luck. "
Lomachenko defends his belt against Miguel Marriaga on Saturday night at 7 p.m. on ESPN.
As the pair posed for photos, Lomachenko's manager Egis Klimas noticed that a possible showdown between the fighters would be the "perfect scale."
"I am a former featherweight," Garcia recalled.
'i went up for Broner [to 140 pounds], but I'm not that big.
I'm small for 140.
I want to get down to lightweight.
And he needs to move to lightweight [135 pounds] and then we fight.
That's what the fans demand.
Let's give them that. '
Lomachenko agreed.
"Boxing needs this fight."
Klimas asked if it should be on pay-per-view, part of a strategy Lomachenko must fight with a 135-pound debut this year to agree a date next summer with Garcia (37-0, 30 knockouts) who also has interest in fighting the winner of Jorge Linares lightweight Luke Campbell on September 23.
"This fight could take place in pay-per-view mode because all the fans have asked for it," Garcia said, later openly expressing a desire to fight at the network that offers the best financial package.
We are the best.
No other names can generate this kind of attention.
Whenever they are ready... "
Garcia said he appreciated Lomachenko as "an enormous fighter," and he will possibly take part in his Saturday fight.
But Lomachenko paused at the lavish praise for Garcia and said that he thinks the three-fight champion from Riverside look "very slow, sorry Mikey... you wanted the co-op, yes."
Garcia said the focus was to show batting, then boxing.
Both said they could feel the momentum that was building up for their own struggle.
"This is the fight that needs to be carried out.
No other fight creates so much attention and enthusiasm.
I'm more than happy to work on it, "Garcia said.
Lomachenko said: "I've been waiting for the top fighters, and that's Mikey.
It will be a great fight. "
Four injured after puncture
Four people were partially seriously injured in an accident on the A7 on Thursday afternoon.
According to initial information, the driver of an Opel Zafira probably lost control of his vehicle at around 4.30 p.m. shortly before the market-wide connection point after a tyre burst.
The car hurled to the right into the embankment, where it overflowed and then remained on the roof in the green strip.
The four inmates - two adults and two children - were partly seriously injured in the accident.
During the initial rescue service for the injured, the A7 was blocked in the direction of the north for about an hour, after which the traffic on the left lane could be passed by the accident site.
Fortunas Hoffmann: "Triple chain works better"
Andre Hoffmann hopes that after the 2: 2 on the season opener against Braunschweig, the optimization of the defensive formation in Aue will bring points.
Andre Hoffmann was satisfied with the first game of the season, also with the result, if there had not been the two opposites in the 2: 2 against Brunswick.
"These were two opposites too many, and we have to be even more careful in Aue," says Fortuna Düsseldorf's defensive player.
In the Erzgebirge, the triangle is also to be further optimized.
And a gate after a free-throw, the Fortune don't want to capture any more.
"For the future, there will be no one standing on the line next to Michael (Rensing)."
Hoffmann is convinced that his team will also be able to cope better with the treble chain after the experiences in the preparation than with the quadruple chain.
"I don't know yet how we will act in Aue," says his coach Friedhelm Funkel, but Hoffmann is sure of his thing, "because we just have players in the triple chain at the half positions in Kaan Ayhan and Niko Gießelmann who can build well," Hoffmann said.
"The prerequisite is, however, that we harmonize even better and that we do not afford so many playback errors in the set-up."
Of course, Hoffmann also drives to Aue to win the game.
"But you don't know whether you can talk about a failed start after a draw.
The performance could be quite okay, "said Hoffmann.
"But if we can score four points on Sunday and concentrate on the Cup, we will certainly be able to talk about a good start to the season."
His coach didn't want to know anything about that.
"I only judge the start of the season after six to eight match days," said Friedhelm Funkel, who does not want to speak of an advantage over Aue just because the Saxony game in Heidenheim had to be canceled prematurely because of a storm.
"Now they can practically start the season with a home game," Funkel said and Hoffmann believes the players from Aue might even be a bit fresher, as they wouldn't have a heavy and complete game like Fortuna against an ascendancy favourite in the bones.
"But they don't know as 100 percent where they currently stand," says Fortuna's interior defender.
Admittedly, the guests from the Rhineland go into the encounter on Sunday in the finally (almost) finished stadium of Aue.
"That we sweep them away just because we have the claim to get under the first six is nonsense," says Funkel, whose record in only one defeat against Aue from nine games is quite positive.
"There is no team in the 2nd Bundesliga that you have to beat from the start," explains Fortunas head coach.
"To make such a statement would be arrogant and arrogant."
And so Funkel definitely doesn't want to experience his players on Sunday.
New results of Swedish asylum age assessment tests published
The recent results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden, which have been subjected to a new method of medical assessment of their age, show that more than 80 percent of those tested are over 18 years of age. However, not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results.
The Swedish National Agency for Forensic Medicine (Rättsmedicinalverket) started carrying out the tests last year.
They are supposed to make the assessment of age more accurate during the asylum procedure, after the Swedish Migration Agency (Migrationsverket) was criticised for errors in assessing the correct age of some refugees who were underage.
To date, Migrationsverket has sent 6,880 cases to be tested and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,481 tests from the period from mid-March to July 31, 2017.
Eighty percent (2002) were judged to be 18 or older, while in another 25 cases the Forensic Medicine Agency assessed that the person was "possibly 18 years or older."
In 432 cases, the conclusion was that the person "may be under 18 years old."
The tests are only carried out in cases where the age of the person is questioned.
According to Johan Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency, the results have been consistent over the past few months.
"We don't see a big difference in the statistics of the past few months, the numbers are pretty consistent," he told the magazine The Local.
The high proportion of cases in which the person was judged to be over 18 years of age does not necessarily mean that the asylum seeker lied about his age.
In May, the agency published the results of 581 tests, saying there were 442 cases that "suggest that the person examined is 18 years or older."
When the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet examined the 581 published results, it found that in 243 of these cases, the person had openly said that she would turn 18 this year.
The method of medical age assessment, in which X-rays of wisdom teeth and MRI recordings of knee joints are made, which are then analysed by dentists and radiologists, has also been criticised in some areas.
One skeptic is the endocrinologist Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute, whose work includes assessing people's biological maturity to see if they went through puberty sooner or later than usual.
'i had reason to think about it, and I don't think the type of measurement should be used.
Judging the biological age in this way is very uncertain.
If we can't say it for sure, we shouldn't pretend we could, "he told the Metro newspaper.
However, Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency defended the accuracy of the tests: "In general, you can say that the risk of misjudging a child as an adult is low.
The biggest risk is if the person is just under 18, in this case that's about 10 percent. '
Fully in the plan
The work on the three bridges of the highway 108 between Lauterbach and Schramberg is progressing well.
On Wednesday, a seven-ton heavy concrete part was installed on the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lauterbach.
"We're very good at the time, it's going great," says Reinhold Leicht, construction manager at the Department of Road and Transport at the Freiburg government headquarters.
In April, work began at the same time on all three bridges between Schramberg and Lauterbach in need of repair.
The end of construction is scheduled for October and Leicht is sure that the schedule will be adhered to.
The first bridge, coming from Schramberg, leads over the Trombach.
It is a vaulted arch bridge made of concrete, which is covered with red brick and has a total length of 4.80 meters.
It was built in 1900.
Like the other two bridges, it has come of age in the meantime.
In order to ensure stability and traffic safety, the three buildings are now being thoroughly renovated.
The other two bridges lead over the Lauterbach.
They are built of red cobblestone.
Both were built in 1939 and are twelve, or 10.60 meters long.
The bridge at the village entrance of Lauterbach has now received a 1.30-metre wide and seven-tonne so-called bridge cap on the north side on Wednesday morning.
This is a fringe attachment, which is also used as an operating route.
A 2.20-metre-wide bridge cap is due to be deployed on the southern part of the bridge on Friday.
The pedestrian path is supposed to follow.
What is special about it is that these are finished parts, a patent from the Schramberg company Dizwo.
The other two bridges are already equipped with the patented bridge caps.
The laying of lines through the building in Lauterbach required particular sensitivity.
Because there is also a fibre optic cable to which many companies are connected.
The local residents were informed about the project by hand in advance of the work.
In addition, fish and crabs had to be fished first.
For the bridges between the Bauhof building and the pavilion in the direction of Schramberg, the traffic is regulated one-lane by a traffic light.
For the construction work on the bridge at the village entrance of Lauterbach, the road in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotels "Tannenhof" and "Seven Linden" is completely closed.
The total cost of the three bridges is EUR 700 000.
It is financed by the country.
AFD in Gerolstein: Colourful protest at German potato salad
It doesn't happen that often that parties pull together, but when it comes to the Alternative for Germany (AfD), it comes together, which is otherwise hard to reconcile.
The parties represented in Kreistag Vulkaneifel (CDU, SPD, Greens, FDP, FWG, Left) belong to a broad alliance that is peacefully flying the flag on that day because the AfD is inviting for the "big campaign kick-off" in the Gerolstein town hall of Rondell.
And well-known names at the start - such as Alice Weidel, who together with Alexander Gauland forms the top duo for the federal election on September 24, and Deputy Federal President Beatrix of Storch.
But those who are on site hours before the start of the event don't want to listen to the AfD people, they want to demonstrate.
The motto "The Eifel remains colourful."
Originally, the city picnic was planned under the motto "All at a table" on the fountain square, but now takes place in the parking lot below the roundabout - and thus right in front of those who come to the AfD event in the town hall.
A colourful picture that presents itself there.
And what Christa Karoli, chairman of the Forum One World and one of the leading organizers, is really happy about: "Great, how many people have come together here."
There is music and lots of food, including an "ancient German potato salad that the AfD could easily eat," says the woman who brought it with her.
The police have ordered many officials to Gerolstein, it shows presence especially at the station, which is only a few meters away from the venues.
How did the AfD actually get on Gerolstein?
Mario Hompes of the AfD Vulkaneifel reports that he had tried to organise such an event and was awarded the contract.
The 45-year-old from Gönnersdorf had initially asked in Daun, but received a rejection there because there were not enough parking spaces because of the Laurentiuskirmes, which had already been built up.
So now the Rondell, Hompes is pleased that "we can have such a beautiful event here."
Looking ahead to the event on the Rondellvorplatz, he says: "That's the good right of the people, main thing, it stays peaceful."
And so it does: Around 8 p.m., a band provides entertainment on the Rondellvorplatz, in which Stadthalle hosts various speakers, including the Rhineland-Palatinate AfD chairman Uwe Junge.
In the room are about 200 listeners waiting for the top candidate for the federal election, Alice Weidel, and Deputy Federal President Beatrix von Storch to give their speeches.
Unchanged is the police presence, but so far officials have had a quiet evening.
Just over an hour takes the AfD event, the guests on the forecourt have a longer breath, but also there is scheduled to clean up shortly after 9pm.
The police can depart - no special occurrences.
Trombone meets trumpet
There will be a rehearsal with the Wolfacher trombonist Frederic Belli in the series of Haslacher monastery concerts tomorrow, Sunday, at 8 p.m. in the monastery church.
Together with the Bulgarian trumpeter Miroslav Petkov, he gives a concert under the motto "Black Sea meets Black Forest," or even "Balkan folklore" meets a classical German education with roots in brass music.
Both soloists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and hold solo positions in top European orchestras.
So is Petkov Solotrompeter at the renowned Concertgebouw Orchestra Amsterdam and Frederic Belli is a solo posaunist of the SWR Symphony Orchestra.
Both combine the desire not only to cross the borders on their instruments, but also to merge the boundaries of the different genres.
For the two, Johann Sebastian Bach sounds like a new robe, Daniel Schnyder's "World Music" combines with Bulgarian folklore, and in the play "Exchange Suite" by jazz choreographer Nils Wogram, classical music, jazz and free playing are combined into a fascinating work of art.
This centrepiece of the programme was premiered in Freiburg only this spring with great success.
The renowned composer Nils Wogram wrote it specifically for the two musicians and even more: The Haslacher Klosterkirche, with its special acoustics, is deliberately included in the concert.
Kristen Stewart talks about her bisexuality
"Some people love grilled cheese and will eat it until the end of their lives.
But I want to try everything, "Kristen Stewart bluntly quipped about her bisexuality.
'once I bite into grilled cheese, I think, 'Oh that was cool, what's next?'. '
Arguably the Hollywood star's best-known relationship was the one with her "Twilight" colleague Robert Pattinson, which ultimately went bitterly apart.
Despite all this, the brunette actress assures opposite the "Harper's Bazaar" magazine: "I was seriously in love with everyone I dated.
Or do you think I played it? "
After her separation, Kristen admitted that she was bisexual: "I've always lived dualism and seriously believed in it.
So it has never confused or hindered me.
I just never liked not being taken seriously. '
She particularly suffered as a result of this, according to "Bang Showbiz," but at school, when she preferred to dress like a boy: "Not all girls are typical girls.
That really hurt me a lot.
When I was eleven the kids told me I would look like a boy.
I felt really attacked, scared and ashamed.
Now I look back and think to myself: 'Girl, be proud of you!'. "
In particular, she doesn't like to explain her love life to the public: "People expect you to behave in a certain way and that annoys me.
And maybe some call me ungrateful, but I don't like having to justify myself to the whole public. '
The governor of West Virginia announces that he is changing party
. The Democratic governor of West Virginia, Jim Justice, announced Thursday night at a rally with President Trump that he would change the party.
Whether you like it or not, the Democrats have moved away from me, "Governor Justice said.
'Today I will tell you with many prayers and a lot of reflection... today I will tell you as a resident of West Virginia, I can't help you anymore if I am a Democratic governor. '
The rally broke out in cheers.
"Tomorrow I will change my registration to the Republicans," Justice added.
'as a coach, I'd say it's time to play another game. '
Mr. Trump previously promised a big announcement at the West Virginia rally.
Mr. Trump won West Virginia with 42 points, and Justice did not endorse Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice, who, according to Forbes, is the only billionaire in the state, was elected in 2016.
Forbes notes that he owns coal mines in five states, and inherited a coal business from his father.
He's worth about $1.59 billion.
Meanwhile, the Republican National Committee issued a statement on Thursday evening saying, "Governor Justice's party change is another blow to a Democratic Party that would prevent us rather than work to make our country great again."
"With only 15 governorships and the control of the fewest legislative bodies in history, Governor Justice's announcement is only the latest rejection of a party that is top to bottom without leadership and is unable to find a positive, unifying message," RNC Chairman Ronna McDaniel said in a statement to CBS News.
Coe praises "honest" Russian apology for doping scandal
The world's chief of athletics, Sebastian Coe, praised on Thursday what he described as a blatant apology from Russia to a doping scandal, but he reiterated that it was not the moment for the country to be reintegrated into the sport.
Russia's athletics chief Dmitry Shylakhtin said during the IAAF congress on the eve of the World Athletics Championships that his country's exile from the sport was correct and that he was determined to fight doping.
He said he was sorry for "all the athletes who were snapped away gold and silver medals in competitions."
Despite his comments, the IAAF Congress voted to uphold the ban, which was imposed in November 2015, after a report by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) found evidence of state-sponsored doping in Russia.
"I thought it was a very open answer today, a very honest presentation," IAAF President Coe told reporters.
"The entire Council and the entire Congress were pleased that the Russian Federation recognized by itself that it had experienced some rather hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is redesigned."
Coe said he was also "pleased" that Russia accepted the criteria for his reintroduction.
"I think it was a very constructive day and I think progress has been made, but Congress supports the task force's recommendations that this is not the moment to reinstate Russia," Coe said.
"We must do everything we can in the coming months to normalise this situation.
The guiding principle has always been that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the depraved system, "he added
Nineteen Russian athletes will compete as neutral players at the World Athletics Championships, which begin in London on Friday, according to the strict IAAF criteria.
The head of the IAAF task force, Rune Andersen, said on Monday that Russia had yet to meet some of the criteria for reinstatement.
Drug tests were still inadequate and banned trainers were still operating freely, he told reporters in London after a talk at the IAAF Council.
Act of mourning for soldiers crushed in Mali
At a funeral ceremony in Fritzlar, northern Hessian, around 1000 people of the two commemorated soldiers killed in a helicopter crash in Mali.
The ceremony took place on Thursday in the cathedral city under high security precautions.
On the pending crash, Defense Minister Ursula von der Leyen (CDU) said nothing.
However, she described the two killed pilots as "experts in their field."
"We bow down to this highest sacrifice they have made on behalf of the Federal Republic of Germany," she explained.
The 33-year-old Major and the 47-year-old Chief of Staff from North Hesse had died in Mali in West Africa on Wednesday a week ago.
Their coffins were transferred to Germany and brought to the Fritzlarer Dom Saint Peter on Thursday, accompanied by a vigil of the German army.
At lunchtime only the relatives in the church said goodbye.
After that, the funeral began in the circle of family, close friends, representatives of the German army and politics.
Among them were Hesse's Prime Minister Volker Bouffier (CDU) and the Inspector General of the German Armed Forces Volker Wieker.
Mourners laid down roses, the relatives stood arm-in-arm at the coffins.
In front of the church, Fritzlarer and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on a canvas.
Defence Minister von der Leyen described the soldiers killed as "highly decorated" and depleted.
The Chief of Staff had helped to set up the flight operation of the fighter helicopter Tiger in Fritzlar and was one of the first six trained tiger pilots of his regiment.
Volker Bauersachs, commander of the regiment to which the soldiers belong, also declared: "If this occupation could not avert the crash, then no one would have been able to."
Minister von der Leyen did not show any doubts about the UN mission in Mali: The deployment was dangerous.
But it was also of high importance "for a country from which we are separated only by two states," she said.
After the funeral, the coffins were brought out of the cathedral.
When and where they are buried, the Bundeswehr did not provide any information.
Prince Henrik does not want a tomb next to his wife
The husband of the Danish Queen Margrethe (77), Prince Henrik (83), does not want to be buried next to his wife after his death.
This was announced by the Royal House on Thursday.
Traditionally, the Danish royal couple is buried in the cathedral church of Roskilde.
The sculptor Bjørn Nørgaard has already made a sarcophagus for the two of them.
The Queen agreed with her husband's decision, it continued in the communication.
It was still unclear where Prince Henrik would be buried.
But he had no intention of being buried in his native France.
Prince Henrik had never made a secret of the fact that he was not happy with his title.
After his wife Margrethe's ascension to the throne in 1972, he would have liked to become king.
He retired in 2016 and also holds the title of "Prince Supper."
Since Henrik did not get the title and function he wanted in Denmark, he did not consider himself to be equivalent to his wife - even after death, explained Lene Balleby, the chief spokeswoman of the Danish royal house.
Where the last resting place of the 83-year-old will ultimately be is still unclear.
However, he did not intend to be buried in his native France, but in Denmark.
He likes the country he has worked for for the last 50 years.
A native of Henri de Laborde de Monpezat, the son of a French noble family, Margrethe had met in London in 1965.
He worked on the Thames in the French embassy.
While his later wife always flew the expressions of sympathy of the people, Prince Henrik, in his almost 50-year reign with the Danes, had a heavy stand.
In an autobiography, Henrik commented about the first few years in Denmark: "A few months after my arrival, everything I did was criticised.
My Danish was fluctuating, I preferred wine instead of beer, silk socks instead of knitted socks, Citroën instead of Volvo, tennis instead of football.
Even for the Gauloises, who I smoked instead of Virginia tobacco and who had a reputation here for being the brand of socially critical intellectuals, I could not hope for leniency.
I was different.
I seemed to be satisfied with this position and not to be ashamed.
There were two mistakes! "
Prime Minister Weil wants swift new election
CDU and FDP before possible majority in Lower Saxony
Lower Saxony's Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) is in favour of a rapid re-election of the country after losing the red-green government majority, but he does not want to resign.
Because on Friday it was in favour of the dissolution of Parliament.
Earlier, the surprise resignation of a Green MP from her regional parliament in Lower Saxony had plunged the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) into a serious crisis.
Five months before the official date of the state elections, the red-green coalition in Hanover lost its narrow one-vote majority in parliament to the opposition from the CDU and the FDP.
Former Greens MP Elke Twesten justified her move with the non-nomination for the 2018 election in her constituency in Rotenburg (Wümme).
"I see my political future in the CDU," she declared in Hanover on Friday.
CDU group leader Björn Thümler wants to recommend to his group that they be included.
This would give the CDU and the FDP a combined 69 seats in the Lower Saxony Parliament, the SPD and the Greens 68.
So far, the relationship has been reversed.
The new Landtag will be elected on 14 January next year.
Thümler said the red-green state government must now decide whether it could continue to govern without a majority in this situation.
Stephan Weil considers it essential, however, that the Landtag decides on its self-dissolution as soon as possible.
The CDU group is expected to decide on its next course of action on Tuesday.
The state constitution also provides for the possibility that the state parliament will remove the trust of the prime minister and elect a successor.
"Our Constitution offers several options.
These possibilities must be examined in a legally clean manner, "Thümler said.
"All issues will be discussed calmly if they are considered in a legally reasonable way."
Thümler called Twesten's move "yet somewhat curious."
The politician herself stressed: "I am not a traitor.
I feel very good. ""
She described herself as a follower of black-green.
The Greens called on the breakaway MPs to return their country mandate.
"We assume, of course, that it will return its state mandate, which it received via the Green Land List, with immediate effect," said the country's presidents Meta Janssen-Kucz and Stefan Körner.
Greens leader Anja Piel said: "We very much regret the decision of Elke Twesten."
She had deliberately chosen not to hold a debate in the group.
"Even in view of the fact that there were no substantive differences, we cannot follow this step."
SPD candidate for chancellor Martin Schulz condemns the transfer of Lower Saxony Green MEP Elke Twesten to the CDU as a betrayal.
"The conduct of former Green MPs in Lower Saxony is not only a betrayal of voters, but also a betrayal of red-green," the federal head of the Social Democrats wrote on Facebook on Friday.
He supported the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) to allow the state parliament to be quickly re-elected.
Twesten's exit costs the majority of the red-green in Lower Saxony.
The politician "in her injured vanity and in her frustration put her personal interests before the good of the country," criticised SPD Secretary General Hubertus Heil.
"It is a scandal that the CDU in Lower Saxony is taking part in this dirty intrigue game and is trying to make political capital out of it."
Lower Saxony's CDU group leader Björn Thümler wants to recommend to his deputies that Elke Twesten be included in the CDU.
The leader of the SPD in the Bundestag, Thomas Oppermann, accused Twesten of using personal career gifts to distort the outcome of the 2013 state elections.
At that time, the CDU was the strongest force before the SPD, but the SPD and the Greens had a thin majority of one vote in the Land parliament.
Minister for Agriculture in the interview - How do we protect ourselves from toxic eggs, Mr Schmidt?
Germany is discussing contaminated eggs.
How could the scandal happen?
How can consumers protect themselves.
Minister of Agriculture Christian Schmidt (CSU) is interviewed by the Editorial Network Germany (RND).
Mr Schmidt, how can consumers protect themselves from poisoned eggs?
I can only encourage all consumers to look closely at the eggs in your fridge and check the stamp print.
On the consumer protection portal www.lebensmittelwarnung.de, the federal states provide the latest information on the eggs batches affected.
Eggs should be destroyed or returned.
Even if, according to everything we currently know, a health hazard is practically impossible.
Is Aldi now taking on the best possible crisis response - all the eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the Enlightener is not really perceived by the Federal Agriculture Minister?
Food control is the responsibility of the federal states.
Despite this, my house immediately opened up and has been in close contact with the authorities of the countries ever since Germany became aware of its concern.
All information and risk assessment is available to consumers.
Like manufacturers, retailers must ensure that the products sold are commercially viable and safe.
If the maximum residue limit of 0.005mg / kg is exceeded for eggs, these are not marketable.
However, uncontaminated eggs can be sold and eaten.
This time, the plants are not to blame.
Are production companies and consumers in the same boat?
According to current knowledge, the production companies are not directly to blame.
On the contrary, they are likely to suffer economic damage as a result of alleged illegal practices by service companies.
As always, there are too few inspectors in an emergency.
Is there a shortage of staff or a lack of coherent competence?
After all, it was the official controls that uncovered the issue.
The truth, however, is that food fraud and criminal energy can never be 100% excluded.
It is precisely for this reason that a rigorous investigation of such events and the surrender to public prosecutors in cases where criminal offences may be committed is of crucial importance.
I have already made it clear on a number of occasions that I expect full information from the responsible authorities.
Is regular alarmism in food scandals really necessary?
Consumers have the right to receive only safe and marketable food.
When an unauthorised insecticide is used in the food industry, consumers are rightly outraged.
The adulterated product has put manufacturers, dealers and consumers in a situation that is absolutely not necessary.
In principle, it must be clear that the illegal use of the insecticide Fipronil in the keeping of food-producing animals is unacceptable and must be stopped immediately.
This must be done consistently and with high pressure at all levels.
I expect all the competent authorities to ensure that the facts are clarified swiftly and in full.
How football's financial rules affect Neymar's move to Paris
The rules, which aim to prevent unfettered spending by European football clubs, will not disrupt Neymar's world-record transfer from Spain's Barcelona to France's Paris-Saint Germain.
Any consequences are yet to come for Paris Saint-Germain from UEFA, because the senior organisation that oversees the European game has the power to ban teams from accessing the prestigious Champions League tournament.
Financial fair play rules launched by UEFA in 2011 mean that PSG will at some point have to prove that the transfer of Neymar was funded without major losses.
Barcelona has paid 222 million euros ($262 million) to buy the Brazilian out of his contract, and Neymar will receive a salary that will amount to several tens of millions of dollars a year.
Here are some of the financial aspects of Neyma's move to France.
PSG can certainly make the money loose for Neymar to sign and bring him into a galaxy of other stars, given the funding of the team by Qatar's energy-rich ruling family.
Clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money on acquiring players, but have to counter with legitimate sources of revenue that allow them the break-even point in their football-related business.
FFP was conceived by Michel Platini after his election as UEFA president in 2007.
The former French player believed that clubs, which had incurred enormous debts in their pursuit of success, were effectively cheating and risking ruining themselves when banks or owners withdrew their support.
In 2011, FFP shifted from focusing on the clubs "debt to monitoring their losses.
The change meant that the business model that Roman Abramovich originally used at Chelsea in 2003 - buying a club with potential and then investing heavily to improve the squad and build a global brand - should become a tougher affair.
During the current three-year FFP investment period, which runs until 2018, clubs can sustain losses of 30 million euros.
And although Platini fell out of favour of the presidency in 2015, his UEFA successor Aleksander Ceferin continues to campaign to discourage excessive spending.
"Certainly FFP is not dead and we will certainly reinforce the rules for the future," Andrea Traverso, who is in charge of FFP at UEFA, told The Associated Press last week.
Although PSG paid Neymar's buy-out clause in a lump sum, it can distribute the amount for the accounting over the duration of its contract.
Neymar has signed a five-year contract so that the transfer fee for the next five years, amounting to 44.4 million euros, can be reported in the annual financial statements.
The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 hit PSG, along with Abu Dhabi, which is owned by Manchester City, with the most severe sanctions.
PSG received a fine of 60 million euros (then $82 million), which was later lowered to 20 million euros - and it was ordered that team members for the 2014 / 15 Champions League season be limited to 21 players instead of the otherwise normal 25 players.
UEFA is looking for clubs that could try to outwit their financial supervision by inflating their revenue through companies linked to the owners of a club.
While a Qatari company could sponsor PSG, if the value of sponsorship were to exceed standard market rates, UEFA would not allow this to be considered a legitimate income.
This is exactly what happened in 2014, when UEFA decided that the value of PSA sponsorship was inflated by the Qatar Tourism Authority.
It has been reported that part of PSG's payments to Neymar could come via payments made by the organising committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.
But PSG and Qatar in 2022 have denied that Neymar will become World Cup ambassadors and such a manoeuvre could be easy to figure out for UEFA regulators.
The sanctions against PSG so far mean that UEFA will be even more attentive to any attempt to circumvent the rules.
UEFA did not have any preparatory discussions with PSG about Neymar's transfer, the people familiar with the situation said on Thursday.
They spoke on condition of anonymity with The Associated Press, as they were not authorized to discuss the PSG situation.
The latest published reports show that PSG made a profit of more than 10 million euros in 2015 / 16 with a turnover of 542.4 million euros.
The accounts for the last financial year have yet to be published.
PSG expects Neymar's arrival to be a boon for sponsorship deals, merchandising and jersey sales.
The association expects sales to increase by at least 30 percent after the signing.
The Spanish league was clearly irritated to see one of the best football players go, and it tried to prevent Neymars moving away by claiming that PSG would hurt the FFP.
"It is a clear case of" financial doping "with the club and the state," the president of La Liga, Javier Tebas, told the Spanish daily AS regarding Qatar's eventual ownership of PSG.
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, whose club is owned by an American sports tycoon, shares La Liga's reservations against a state that funds a club.
"It's the consequence of ownership and that has completely changed the entire landscape of football over the last 15 years," Wenger said on Thursday.
"As soon as a country has an association, anything is possible.
It's going to be very difficult to respect financial fair play because you can go different ways or have different interests when a country has such a big player to represent a country. '
Swiss is looking for a new automotive supplier
In recent years, Chocolat Frey has made board chocolate for Swiss.
Now the sweet cooperation is about to come to an end: The airline is rewriting the order.
Swiss spokeswoman Meike Fuhlrott confirmed a corresponding report from the newspaper "Nordwestschweiz" on Friday at the request of the news agency sda.
According to current planning, the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018.
The products would be reviewed every two to three years and subjected to quality control.
"We are very satisfied with the current supplier Chocolat Frey," said the spokeswoman.
The flight attendants distribute around 17 million small red-packed chocolate tablets to 14 grams per year to passengers before landing.
Swiss did not want to provide any information about the costs.
According to "Northwest Switzerland," industry insiders estimate the order volume to be between 1.5 and 2 million Swiss francs - the Migros subsidiary generates annual sales of around one billion Swiss francs.
But the advertising effect is always more important: For a chocolate manufacturer it is a prestigious order.
Swiss does not want to reveal how many candidates there are for the new call.
However, only Swiss manufacturers are eligible.
According to the newspaper report, Chocolat Frey plans to seek a renewal of the contract beyond spring 2018.
For the sda, the largest Swiss chocolate manufacturer could not be reached for comment.
Swiss has been distributing chocolate boards on board its flights since 2006.
Before the Swiss signed a contract with the Migros subsidiary, Barry Callebaut, in collaboration with Hug, had supplied the chocolate tablets.
Swiss introduced the possibility of placing the logo two and a half years ago with the launch of its collaboration with Chocolat Frey.
The airline works with various Swiss chocolate producers.
On long-haul flights, First Class customers will be spoiled with treats from the Confiserie Sprüngli, in Business Class wet passengers Schoggi from Lindt and in Economy Class Schoggi from Chocolat Frey.
Swiss Schoggi by Chocolat Frey is also distributed on the short circuit, both in business and in economy class.
Athletics - Diskus Olympic champion Robert Harting reaches World Cup finals
The three-time world champion fights for a medal in the final on Saturday.
His brother Christoph, Olympic champion of 2016, had failed in the national World Cup draw and could only watch the discus competition from the grandstand.
Also with the first attempt, the Polish defending champion Piotr Malachowski, who threw 65.13 meters wide, qualified for the final match.
Nostalgia goes to the niche in "Wet Hot American Summer" and "Comrade Detective"
This retelling of the story is at the same time nostalgic for the glorious days of the characters of the 80s, for the 90s grunge era (when the pre-thinkers David Wain and Michael Showalter turned the sketch comedy "The State" for MTV), and for themselves, that is called Paul Banks.
As a cultural artifact, it is equally a parody and an embodiment of our Facebook-enabled era of permanent memories.
But as a franchise, it feels like time is running out.
"First Day of Camp" worked surprisingly well, not only because of its absurd humor (it contained an original story for a talking can of vegetables spoken by H. Jon Benjamin).
By sticking to the core of the gag - middle-aged actors play horny children who grow up - they nevertheless managed to win back the last part of the joke.
"Ten Years Later," with its adults now playing adults, is less emotionally ingrained and its parody goes more according to the casting-scattering principle, including a riff on the Stalker films of the 90's like "The Hand That Rocks the Cradle" (").
At one point, a character roams through an Apple powerbook, some inline skates and "a number of other things from 1991."
Many of the central stories are the same.
The amiable coop (Mr. Showalter), now a novelist, has still not forgotten Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) has still not lost his virginity.
And there's another crazy-vicious plot in which Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter) is included, now supported by George H. W. Bush (a well-done impression of Michael Ian Black).
As always, the excursions are the best part of the franchise.
It's especially a lot of fun to see the eternally young Mr. Rudd, who shows Matt Dillon's lower-lip beard of "Singles," whose former big-man-on-camp Andy now feels like an old cracker.
It's the moments of random madness that could fuel this franchise like a kind of repetitive "Seven Up!" Series until he reaches what I assume to be his logical conclusion: "Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later," whose final scene will show the gang as they attend the film premiere of "Summer Hot."
"Comrade Detective" on Amazon, meanwhile, evokes a different kind of nostalgia: The revival of the Cold War of "The Americans," the film "Atomic Blonde," and even "GLOW" with its East-versus-West wrestling iconography.
The comedy created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka with Rhys Thomas as director claims to be a grounded TV series: A Romanian drama of the eighties starring the two policemen as friends, two officers from Bucharest fighting for truth, atheism and the path of Marxism-Leninism.
The lead roles - a hard-boiled Gregory and an idealistic Iosef - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu ulici, whose dialogues are synchronized in English by Channing Tatum (also an executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
It's a brilliant idea.
But it's not much more than an idea.
There are some nice gags to watch (the police spend time watching chess on TV, as Americans might do with football).
And the list of famous speakers - including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny - makes for a decent game of 'Find the voice out'.
But "Comrade Detective" is so committed to the veracity of a desperate propaganda drama - a murderer wearing a Reagan mask is included - that it often plays like a single one.
With six long episodes, it drags away, and the comedy is not fast or frequent enough.
"Comrade Detective," which has been edited to a lesser length, could better deliver its agitprop satire, as Gregor and Iosef keep visiting the American Embassy, whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men swallowing up a bunch of hamburgers.
The message for the imagined communist audience is that Western culture can make everything a fodder for a pledge.
The fictitious Romanian creators were not wrong: We are even doing it with our own recent history and with theirs.
Blow to drug mafia in the country
The police have succeeded in striking a blow against the Italian mafia in Baden-Württemberg.
On Wednesday morning, numerous objects were searched in the Black Forest Baar district, in Rottweil, Konstanz, Esslingen and Stuttgart, the prosecutor's office in Konstanz announced on Friday.
15 suspects between the ages of 25 and 77 were arrested and arrest warrants have already been issued against them.
In addition, officials secured larger quantities of marijuana and cocaine, firearms, as well as several hundred thousand euros.
Two people were arrested during simultaneous raids in Italy.
German arrest warrants were issued against the two suspect Italians.
The two will therefore probably be shipped to Germany.
The action involved Italian and Bavarian investigators.
In total, more than 300 police officers were deployed.
Members of the Mafia are accused of organised drug-related crime, serious acts of violence, attempted murder, robbery and extortion.
The Konstanz Public Prosecutor's Office has been investigating the organised drug trade in the southern German region since summer 2016.
There was a lively exchange between the prosecutors in Konstanz and Palermo, and the investigators of Kripo Rottweil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily.
As a result, the large-scale operation was also accompanied by four officials from Palermo on Wednesday morning.
The investigation focused in particular on Italian nationals with close links to the Italian Mafia.
An incident on May 27 in Hüfingen, in which several shots were fired into a restaurant early in the morning, is also likely to be attributed to the gang.
Weise complains of large gaps in the foreigner register
"Data of citizens who should not show up there ": According to a report, the register of foreigners in Germany has significant shortcomings.
This leads to sometimes serious wrong decisions in asylum procedures.
According to a media report, the Federal Government Commissioner for Refugee Management, Frank-Jürgen Weise, has drawn attention to large gaps in the central register of foreigners.
Deficiencies in the data recorded there could lead to "sometimes serious wrong decisions" in asylum procedures and deportations, Weise warned in an analysis available to the "Süddeutsche Zeitung."
According to the figures, the register covers 10 million people of foreign nationality, including some 5.7 million from non-EU countries.
The data will be managed by about 600 immigration authorities in Germany.
Because the data had not been sufficiently maintained, the data quality in parts had not been good.
In individual cases, data from 1921 had been found, "by people who have long since ceased to be alive, or by citizens who have become German citizens and should no longer appear in the register."
"Erroneous data input can significantly slow return processes," the report continues.
The statistics on people who are forced to leave the EU also include EU citizens who do not even have to leave the country.
Such false assignments, however, "led to a distorted debate about how to deal with expatriates," according to the analysis.
Meanwhile, the federal government appears to have begun sending refugee families with children under the age of 16 back to Italy once they have entered from there.
This emerges from an internal paper by the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF), reports the "Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung."
The paper therefore states that the BAMF has been carrying out such procedures "concerning families with children - with the exception of infants and toddlers - again to Italy since 1 June 2017."
This has been virtually impossible since the end of 2014, according to the newspaper, referring to the difficult situation on the ground.
Under the Dublin agreement, refugees are the responsibility of the EU state they reach first.
If a migrant travels to another EU country, that state can send him back to the country of entry.
The Office now writes as justification: "In the meantime, the capacity of families with children under age in Italy has increased considerably."
Italy had given guarantees for the reception and accommodation of families.
Even the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) considers these commitments sufficient.
Other EU states would also send refugees back there under the Dublin agreement.
Ulla Jelpke, the left-wing group's internal affairs spokesperson in the Bundestag, criticised this decision: "Families with children are threatened with illegal reception conditions and a threat to the best interests of children because of the shortcomings in the Italian asylum system."
Second best result achieved
A total of 220 litres of blood from people living in Oberreichenbach has already been provided by the blood donation service for other people.
At least of the twelve citizens who were awarded on Friday.
In particular, Jürgen Greule, who has now made 100 donations, has now shared 50 litres of blood.
Traditionally, in the meeting of the local council, the community acknowledges the multiple willingness to donate blood.
"It is ingenious how our body is designed for this and we pay respect to the donors who make their blood available to strangers, and also unselfish," stressed Mayor Karlheinz Kistner.
"A single donation of blood helps several people," explained Holger Maisenbacher, head of the German Red Cross (DRC).
For example, three people could benefit from a blood donation.
At the same time, Maisenbacher reported on the actions that will be carried out in the spring in Oberreichenbach.
"This year we achieved the second best result with 114 donors," said the DRC's county preparedness chief.
Obviously the change to the theatre a few years ago led to higher numbers of participants.
Even before that, Thomas Bockstadt, Susanne Reichle, Sandra Schöck, Thomas Reichle and Meta Umbeer were among the multiple donors and were awarded for 50 blood donations each.
Half as many book Herbert Mair and Dorothee Riexinger, while Tamara Pfrommer, Petra Schleeh, Stefanie Stoll and Uwe Vetter gave away ten times each 500 millilitres of their life juice.
The Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged after weak economic growth and the slowdown in inflation dampened speculation of a rise.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain "sluggish" as it kept interest rates on family incomes in the midst of increasing pressure.
Policymakers on the Bank's Monetary Committee (MPC) voted 6 to 2 to keep interest rates at 0.25%, with fewer members aiming for a rise this month, as weak economic growth has weakened support for an increase.
In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank reduced its growth forecasts to 1.7% in 2017 and 1.6% in 2018, and warned that pressure on household incomes would continue, with inflation expected to rise to just under 3% in the autumn.
But she signalled that interest rate hikes would become necessary over the next few years to rein in inflation fuelled by Brexit and she said borrowing costs may have to rise more than expected in financial markets.
Members also voted to withdraw part of the mammoth stimulus package issued a year ago after Brexit.
It will demand time for the funding plan to provide cheaper funding for banks from next February, although it has been said that it is now expected to provide £15 billion more under this scheme - with £115 billion.
Minutes after the decision on the interest rate, the bank said: "In the MPC's central forecast, gross domestic product (GDP) remains weak in the short term as pressure on households' real incomes continues to weigh on consumption."
On interest rates, she reiterated that "some tightening of monetary policy" would be needed to cool down inflation and a "slightly larger" scale than markets expect.
Markets are currently forecasting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020.
However, the bank stressed that increases would be "gradual" and "limited."
The Bank's downward adjusted growth forecasts for this year and next are up against the 1.9% and 1.7% forecast in May.
It has maintained its growth forecast to 1.8% in 2018.
The pound fell against the dollar and the euro after this news.
The pound fell 0.5% to $1.31 and fell 0.4% to 1.11 euros.
The decision to no change comes after recent disappointing growth figures dampened rising expectations of an interest rate rise and GDP rose to 0.3% in the second quarter from 0.2% in the previous three months.
Growth is expected to be 0.3% in the third quarter, although it will recover slightly towards the end of the year, according to the bank.
The latest inflation report offered little enthusiasm for households affected by rising inflation and small salary increases, as the tightening first gets worse before it then improves.
She added that monetary policy cannot "prevent" the income slump over the next few years, but she added that wages will recover "significantly" at the end of its three-year forecast.
The economy is also boosted by rising demand for UK goods, due to the weak pound, which will offset some of the lower consumer spending.
The decision comes a year after interest rates were cut to 0.25% last August following the shocking EU vote that caused the fall in the pound.
The Bank estimates that it will probably take four years for this to fully reach prices and the economy.
Before the Bank's last judgment on interest rates, the call for an interest rate hike had soared as inflation increased pressure on hard-pressed households, with three policymakers calling for a rise to 0.5% in July.
Inflation fell to 2.6% last month from 2.9% in June, although the bank said this was expected and it will pick up again in the coming months.
The bank said the excess relative to its target of 2% was "entirely" due to the weak pound.
Andrew Montlake, director at Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: "Given the recent decline in swap rates, the mortgage market is likely to become more competitive again as lenders look loudly for deals and want to end the year in a positive way.
The market looks particularly good for those where existing deals are phasing out and new mortgages are closing, and many with fee-free options and low rates are becoming increasingly popular. "
NHS (The National Health Service) is to prescribe controversial HIV drug 10,000 people
Patients will be given access to "transformative" HIV prevention treatment from September after a fight in the High Court against funding for the drug in the NHS.
NHS England announced that a pre-intercourse pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), which can reduce the risk of infection in high-risk patients by around 86 per cent, is now being delivered by the health service via an initial three-year study for an estimated 10,000 people.
He agreed to fund the trial after the Court of Appeal upheld a Supreme Court ruling last year that the NHS had the power to pay for PrEP despite claims that local authorities should fund it.
The move, announced on Thursday, was hailed by NHS England chief Simon Stevens as an "important new intervention," while the National Aids Trust (NAT) described it as a "pivotal moment."
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to allow people to sign up, and further clinics will follow in October before it is due to be introduced across England in April 2018.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a consequence of HIV preparations taken before sex in order to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
Studies have shown that PrEP significantly reduces HIV transmission in infected individuals.
Taking prep before intercourse means that just enough drugs are present in a person's body to prevent HIV infection.
Such medications can be taken every day or so as early as two hours before intercourse.
Those eligible for treatment include gay or bisexual men, transsexuals and those with HIV-positive partners who have not been successfully treated.
Clinics identify suitable participants who agree to the study, including men, women, transgenders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by antiretroviral treatment.
People who live in England and are registered with a family doctor can also sign up for possible participation in their local participating sex clinic.
The programme will be worth £10m and NHS England signed a contract to supply the drugs this week after an international competitive sourcing.
The study aims to assess the full potential of PrEP by gathering clinical evidence on how it is targeted, absorbed and implemented on a large scale.
Mr Stevens said: "This major new intervention should complement and overhaul the far-reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV.
It's another milestone in the more than three decades of sustained progress in addressing one of humanity's biggest health challenges. '
Deborah Gold, chief executive at NAT (National Aids Trust), said: "This is a pivotal moment in the fight against HIV.
Prep, if it is targeted at needy and vulnerable people, offers the opportunity to change the English HIV epidemic.
From September, people at high risk of HIV will have access to this NHS-funded trial in England to develop a new tool that is truly individually controlled and not subject to negotiation with a partner, leading to the improvement of many, many lives.
We warmly welcome this announcement. "
Ian Green, chief executive of the Terrence Higgins Trust, said: "The priority must now be for the study to be carried out quickly across the country and for no one who has a risk for HIV to be left behind.
Now that the PrEP test medicine has been procured, we are on track to protect more than 10,000 HIV-infected people. "
Sharon Hodgson, shadow health minister, said: "The start of the PrEP process is welcome and overdue after months of delays and hesitant implementation by the government.
The evidence shows how transformative this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transmission of this life-changing infection.
This attempt brings us one step closer to understanding the benefits of PrEP.
Now it's important that this study is carried out as quickly as possible across the country to protect people who are HIV-infected and that it will help us move one step closer to ending the spread of HIV in society. '
Living the big life: Mezzanine and clever designer tricks have turned this little Earls Court apartment into a lavish home
Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, narrowed down from a large house in Knightsbridge to an Earls Court apartment in 2014.
It's on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it's testament to the new design that Joanne hasn't packed and sold her bags.
"Before that, I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger space," says Joanne.
"I was looking for something comparable to my price.
I was shown this apartment in Earls Court, and it had the same high ceilings.
I fell in love with her and made an offer that day. '
Since the first visit, the 1,000 square foot apartment has been completely overhauled.
Originally a one-bedroom property with a nested layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - Joanne wanted to add storage space and a mezzanine floor to make the most of the lavish ceiling height.
"I wanted high ceilings, big windows, lots of light.
That was my request, "she says.
To that end, she commissioned Erfan Azadi's architectural and design studio Duck & Shed from Notting Hill to use the 12.5 foot high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Joanne.
The ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms on top of each other, so the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine floor where you could stand.
Erfan had to think creatively to solve the default.
"The steelwork is quite complicated," he explains.
"We had to arrange the rooms in such a way that they were stacked on top of each other without us having to bend down.
It wasn't just about building a simple platform, but putting the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below. "
This arrangement allowed Erfan to place two rooms at full height on top of each other - with a lot of additional drama.
For the mezzanine floor, a classic copper-lit window of Retrouvius looks down over the glamorous living area.
Mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program.
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre, space and light.
A short corridor is mirrored at both ends in order to make it work longer.
In the kitchen, the reflection feels like a window into another room.
At the entrance, mirrored units offer space for all the cutlery and glasses of Joanne.
Through the perception of a more glamorous space, the beauty of the living room can shut out the kitchen if not used.
Collapsible kitchens are nothing new.
The special thing about this is that it is a garage door.
"A bit of engineering art went in there," explains Erfan of the steel-reinforced, furious MDF door.
'it's counterweight, so when you push the door up, it glides very easily. '
Thanks to the clever use of space and storage space, Joanne was able to gain an additional 16 m ², an additional bedroom and an improved layout.
"At the end of the day you will sell the floor space - or how your property is valued," says Erfan.
"In a rudimentary form, a real estate agent will enter and make a calculation based on the size of the floor."
Here they have managed to increase the floor area and at the same time use high-quality materials that give the space its luxurious advantage.
"The materials are the things you touch and that therefore help create an emotional bond in a home," says Erfan.
"You don't fall in love with the electrical sockets in the walls.
These are important, but they don't play with your heart. '
It shows that an apartment can be transformed into something quite amazing by good design and increased square meters of something standard.
In fact, like Joanne, you might decide not to leave these.
Brothers fight because of a $500 million real estate empire
Two brothers, four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty, are in a dispute over one of Victoria's largest real estate empires, worth over $500 million.
The former director of the Carlton Football Club and developer Colin De LUTIS lives in a villa in Toorak, just three doors away from his younger brother Paul, who took him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and business assets are to be divided.
Paul has wanted to withdraw from the family business since 2014, but a sharp dispute over the separation is taking place in the Supreme Court.
Together with their mother Anna, the brothers own 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars, accumulated since the family bought a shop in Smith Street, Collingwood, in 1973.
There, the family founded Westco Jeans and grew into a chain of 160 retail stores.
It was sold in 1999 for $85 million.
That money has been invested in real estate, and De LUTIS's portfolio now includes offices in the city centre, the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento, the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller, as well as suburban shopping centres.
According to an agreement with her late father, Colin - described by Paul as the "main operator and the dominant personality" in the De LUTIS family - owns about two-thirds of the company's assets and Paul about a third.
A court filing states that this means Colin owns property worth $316 million and Paul worth $176 million.
The distribution of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul.
"The divisions proposed by Colin have left him with what I thought were the best objects," he wrote in a first affidavit in 2015.
Last Friday, the first Supreme Court hearing took place after several failed mediations.
The brothers are now also fighting for control of the existing business - which Colin, as Paul claims, ruled him out.
Colin argues this is not true, but accuses Paul of managing some possessions incompetently.
In an early affidavit filed by Colin, he says he hopes to settle the dispute.
"My Italian heritage dictates that family is the most important priority," he wrote.
Costs are rising in the case, with hundreds of pages containing affidavits, emails and reports from companies including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and with leading lawyers including Allan Myers, QC, and law firms from both sides.
Ms De LUTIS and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated milk bars and delicatessens from the late 1950's and bought a shop in Brunswick in the early Seventies.
They used the security to buy the Collingwood property, in which Colin opened the family's first jean shop.
Colin says he started Westco there when he was "in my last years of high school, when Paul was still a little kid (about 10 years old)."
Anna De LUTIS says she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to pass on their property amicably to their sons.
"Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to end up in court," she wrote.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De LUTIS group of companies, with Colin alleging that Mark was paid $10 million when leaving the company and $26 million when he left.
Both Luke and Mark are, Paul says, "embittered about the terms of their financial separation."
Colin has been very restrained, even though he was a former AFL board member and, according to a 2015 biography by Eddie McGuire, the TV star's best friend.
Fairfax Media made contact with Colin and Paul De LUTIS and their attorneys.
Only Colin replied by text message to say "I really can't say much" because the case was before the courts.
"It is very, very sad that my brother Paul decided to sue me and drag our family name through the courts," he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote in a letter to the court that he had tried to meet his brother's demands.
"Our father would not have wanted Paul and I to end up in our current dispute," he said, adding that he was "still hoping for a solution."
On Friday, that hope seemed to be over.
"Our matter will be resolved by the courts in the near future," Colin wrote.
Trump's new chief of staff is planning to limit the president's media abstinence.
Others have tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.
If so, he will be the first.
Politico reports that the new White House chief of staff is planning to restrict the flow of information on President Trump - including news media reports - in the hope of keeping the chief on a more even course.
Here is a piece by reporter Josh Dawsey:
"When John F. Kelly, the new White House chief of staff, met with senior staff on his first day of work, he posed a major problem in President Donald Trump's White House that he wanted to fix: Bad information getting into the hands of the president.
Kelly told employees "that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in briefings - because the president would make better decisions if he were to receive good information."
Kelly's diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to tame Trump by monitoring his media diet.
President Trump's relationship with television goes back decades - and now that he is in the White House, his television advertising is still going strong.
"If candidate Trump was upset about unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he received fair coverage of posts that were to be persuaded," former campaign adviser Sam Nunberg told Politico in February.
Politicos Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that "the key to keeping Trump's Twitter habit under control, according to six former campaign officials, is to ensure that his personal media consumption involves steady praise."
Okay.
But the idea that Trump's Twitter habit was ever "under control" is ridiculous.
Perhaps these campaign officials know something we others don't know - that Trump's tweets would have contained even more ignition without their interventions.
We will probably never learn anything about the tweets that Trump did not send.
If his co-workers have managed to keep him away from trouble several times, then their efforts have paid off.
But no one has consistently prevented Trump from provoking controversy.
Part of the problem is that people in a White House made up of rival parties keep trying to advance their own agenda by presenting Trump material that may be promoting their views of the world.
Politico - entirely concerned with this story - reported in May on the advisers "preference to provide dubious information to the president for strategic reasons.
This was an example that was described by reporter Shane Goldmacher:
'current and former Trump officials say that Trump can react like a volcano to negative press cutouts, especially those with damaging leaks, and that he's stiffening to figure out where these come from.
That is exactly what happened at the end of February, when someone maliciously gave the president a printed copy of an article by GotNews.com, the website of internet provocateur Charles C. Johnson, accusing Deputy Chief of Staff Katie Walsh of being "the source behind a bunch of leaks" in the White House.
Although Johnson has been permanently banned from Twitter for harassment or that he has not offered any concrete evidence or that he has made false allegations in the past and revoked them.
Trump read the article and began interviewing employees "about Walsh."
Goldmacher added that then-Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and the White House secretary general, Rob Porter, "tried to implement a system to manage and document the paperwork that Trump receives."
How did it work?
Kelly is trying to do the same three months later.
Perhaps he will prove himself to be a more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his advisers are still striving for influence.
These unchanging factors make Kelly's mission very difficult.
Most wanted criminals receive mail from Europol
Since the address is unknown, the participation of the population is requested and hoped for.
Police across Europe are sending (virtual) postcards to dangerous criminals on the run this summer.
Since the addresses of the wanted serious criminals are naturally not known, information from the population is hoped for and requested.
Europol reported on Friday of the action, which follows the "EU Most Wanted" advent calendar from the winter.
Experience has shown that many fugitives hide in holiday destinations, according to Europol.
They have put together 21 postcards for wanted criminals from 21 EU countries.
Since 2016 there is the website www.eumostwanted, more than 2.5 million times it has been viewed.
Thirty-six of the online requests have so far been arrested, at least eleven of them on the basis of post-publication notices on the website.
Travellers negotiate a ditch and return to the 'million'
Some of the West Midlands' most affluent homeowners are standing again with some determined travelers on war footing who negotiated a ditch drawn by the community to reclaim a field in front of their mansions.
Travellers have parked their 20 caravans in a field outside a wealthy Strait of Solihull called the "millionaire row."
They brought horses, babies and an army of vans after they were only thrown out in May, but without being deterred by a ditch excavated by the council to prevent their incursions.
The tactful group found a gap in the defense facilities and pushed their vehicles through a section that remained unobstructed to find a way.
Angry residents have pressed Solihull council, who said it was "useless to deal with the problem."
An anonymous resident said: "They moved there on Monday night after being sent on by Bentley Heath, where they threw stones at passers-by.
The Council must be forced into action by shame, as it has been useless in dealing with the problem.
The travellers were there in May, were moved on and are now back again.
More arrived last night, probably more today. "
She added: "Birmingham Council knows how to deal with this by holding long teachings to protect their parks.
I live on Streetsbrook Road and I'm not happy to continue to pay my community tax if the council can't even stop that. '
One local resident, who did not want to be named, said: "It is ridiculous, we have just seen the last round of these travellers, only to be sacked by another round.
The numbers have increased this time and you have even seen a horse in the parking area. "
A spokeswoman for Solihull Council said: "We are aware of an unauthorized camp in the countryside beyond Streetsbrook Road and are working with Solihulls Police. We are taking the necessary legal steps to allow them to move on as quickly as possible.
In order to support our collection of evidence, it is very important that as many residents as possible report anti-social or criminal behaviour to the police by calling 101.
This helps to provide a picture of the situation in which the court must consider when we present our case. "
From Birkenhof, Waldhotel Luise
From the former Hotel Birkenhof will be the Waldhotel Luise.
The house at the gates of Freudenstadts is currently being renovated and is due to reopen on 1 March next year.
This is good news for the city.
The closure of the Hotel Birkenhof by the former Ambiente Betriebsgesellschaft mbH on 13 April 2014 resulted in the loss of around 30,000 overnight stays per year, as well as income from the tourist tax.
In autumn 2014, in the face of dramatically increasing numbers of refugees arriving in the county, the hotel building was offered to the district council as collection accommodation, causing controversial discussions.
The city prevented the accommodation of asylum seekers by setting up a development plan to secure the area as a hotel location.
The decision was not uncontroversial in the local council at the time.
But above all Freudenstadt's mayor Julian Osswald defended the hotel location and already at that time spoke of serious interested parties in the house.
He should be proved right.
The group Luisenhotels with managing director Birgit Scherer, based in Bad Bergzabern, has bought the former Hotel Birkenhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it a three-star plus-category house again under the name of Waldhotel Luise.
The group has four houses with the Freudenstadt object.
Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Herrenalb.
They are called Hotel Luise, Luisenpark, Parkhotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise.
At the former Hotel Birkenhof construction debris containers have been standing in front of the entrance for a long time, and when you enter the house, it becomes clear what extensive renovation work is being carried out.
The floors were ripped out, some ceilings removed, old bathtubs removed from the rooms.
The entire hotel building is a single construction site.
There is still much to be done by March.
"It's actually a nice hotel," says Thomas Scherer, talking to our newspaper.
Everything is to be redone in the Black Forest style.
The rooms are equipped with large walk-in showers, the entrance area is redesigned, new windows are installed.
Everything should later become "beautifully close to the citizen," as Thomas Scherer expresses himself.
"We want to make a piece of jewellery out of it."
Swimming pool, wellness area and a meeting room are among the amenities.
One does not want to position oneself on the high level of the hotels in Lauterbad, but already on a high level of the city centre, Scherer emphasizes.
The Waldhotel Luise, with its approximately 60 rooms, wants to position itself broadly, Scherer explains.
Both individual holidaymakers, groups or business people should feel comfortable in the hotel.
He has already held talks with OB Julian Osswald and Tourism Director Michael Krause, Scherer said.
The ideas of the city are identical with those of the hotel group.
'we're on the same line. '
Asked about the level of investment, Thomas Scherer does not want to be precise.
Just under a million euros, he reckons.
The exterior systems are also brought to the front, this is already clearly visible.
In a courtyard, a large terrace is created, which will be accessible from the restaurant, which is public.
Thomas Scherer is optimistic: "Freudenstadt is a good market."
Russia affair: Us special investigator sets up Grand Jury
In the Russia affair surrounding US President Donald Trump, special investigator Robert Mueller is said to have set up a so-called Grand Jury, according to a report.
The panel had begun work in the past few weeks, wrote the Wall Street Journal, citing people familiar with the matter.
The newspaper interpreted the move as a sign that Mueller had expanded and intensified his investigations.
The CNN channel reported there were already initial subpoenas from the body in connection with a meeting between Trump's eldest son and a Russian lawyer.
Us intelligence agencies have long accused the Kremlin of purposefully interfering in the 2016 presidential campaign.
Mueller is investigating whether there was collusion between Trump's campaign team and Moscow.
The investigation will focus on several men who acted as advisers to the Republican during the election campaign.
According to reports, Mueller also took more and more of Trump's private and business environment under the microscope.
The Washington Post wrote a few weeks ago that the special investigator had personally put Trump at the center and was investigating the accusation of whether the president may have obstructed justice in the course of the affair.
The main task of Grand Juries is to examine available evidence in possible criminal cases and to decide whether charges should be brought.
Grand juries are therefore also called Prisoners.
In most cases, they are switched on when there are larger and more controversial cases.
The procedure always takes place behind closed doors.
The Board can also be activated by the Public Prosecutor's Office to summon people for questioning under oath.
According to the CNN channel, subpoenas have already been issued that revolve around the encounter between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer.
People involved in the meeting had been asked to make a statement, the report said.
They should also provide documents.
In addition to Trump Jr., Trump's adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner, as well as his then-campaign chief, Paul Manafort, were also present at the conversation.
Legal experts said on US television on Thursday night that the inauguration showed that Mueller would not be intimidated in his work and that he wanted to act quickly if necessary.
However, it did not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury would be turned on at the end to decide on the prosecution of an indictment.
Still, the establishment of the body is the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new cause for concern for President Trump.
Amid the new revelations, the President used a speech in West Virginia on Thursday evening to portray the Russia affair as a campaign by his political opponents.
"The Russia story is a total fabrication," Trump said.
The issue gives Democrats a way to "feel good because they have nothing else to talk about."
His special counsel, Ty Cobb, said in a statement that he did not know anything about the establishment of a Grand Jury.
But they also usually work in secret, he pointed out.
The White House supports any action that accelerated the Special Envoy's work in a "fair" way.
Former FBI chief James Comey has said three times that he is not under investigation against the president.
There was no reason to believe that this had changed, the statement continued.
Mueller, however, had only been deployed after Trump fired Comey.
Because of this accusation, accusations against Trump had been made that he wanted to obstruct justice.
Comey told a Senate committee in June that Trump had asked him to stop investigating then-national security adviser Michael Flynn.
The president is under great pressure because of the investigation.
According to US media, the White House collected material against the special agent and his associates.
That sparked speculation about whether Trump wanted to sack Mueller.
Unlike an independent special counsel to Congress, such as in the Watergate affair surrounding the later ousted President Richard Nixon, Mueller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired by the Justice Department at the president's insistence.
However, several senators from both parties want to prevent such a move.
Two groups of Republican and Democratic senators presented bills on Thursday under which the special counsel could no longer be dismissed so easily.
Antarctica: Gigantic iceberg drifts in the Antarctic
In West Antarctica, a gigantic iceberg of barely seven times the size of Berlin has dissolved from the Schelfeis.
This was announced by the Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research in Bremerhavener on Wednesday.
The colossus, weighing more than one trillion tons and measuring 5800 square kilometres, is now drifting north and will probably take two or three years before it has melted.
With a length of 175 kilometres and a width of up to 50 kilometres, it is one of the largest ice giants that researchers have registered in the past three decades.
He does not pose a danger to people.
The extent to which climate change played a role in breaking down the iceberg is unclear, according to researchers.
All in all, however, there has been a series of unusual collapses of ice shelves in the region for around 30 years, writes the US Research Centre for Snow and Ice (NSIDC) in a factual background.
According to many researchers, this could be related to global warming.
The now broken colossus was a part of the Larsen-C-Schelfeis until now.
Schelfeis swims on the sea and is fed by large glaciers.
It continues to grow into the sea and breaks down regularly.
The Larsen-C-Schelfeis is located south of South America almost at the tip of the Antarctic peninsula.
North of this skeleton, the balance of waxing and breaking off was disturbed a few years ago.
A complete slap had disintegrated there, writes AWI researcher Daniela Jansen.
There is much to be said for the fact that the Larsen-C-Schelfeis is also in danger, because the front edge has never withdrawn as far as it is at present.
In addition, the ice sheet is under tension and can disintegrate if a piece breaks down at a key point.
The melting of Schelfeis and Eisberg does not raise sea levels as they swim on the water and displace ice as much water as it yields after the melting itself.
However, the loss of the ice causes the glaciers to flow directly into the sea and flow off much faster than before.
This could possibly increase sea levels, but only to a limited extent, writes the British research project on the observation of Antarctica (Midas).
According to AWI data, the Larsen-C-Schelfeis is the fourth largest slap in Antarctica, covering almost 50,000 square kilometres.
At the transition from the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick, at the front edge to the free ocean about 200 meters.
There it breaks down regularly.
"Although it is a natural occurrence and we are not aware of any direct link to climate change, the ice sheet is now coming into a more vulnerable position," said Martin O'Leary of Britain's Swansea University.
"This is the furthest retreat since records began," he also confirmed.
Among scientists, it is disputed whether the Larsen-C skeleton will now grow again or decline in the long term and possibly fall together, said his colleague Adrian Luckman, adding: "Our models say it will be less stable."
But this development will take decades.
Although these researchers do not attribute the demolition of this gigantic iceberg to climate change, a great many ice shelves of the Antarctic Peninsula have disintegrated in recent decades.
This long tip of Antarctica stretches towards South America.
According to data from the British Antarctic Survey research programme, the Antarctic Peninsula's ice surface has fallen by 28,000 square kilometres since the 1950s.
The increase in temperature had contributed to the decline.
The Antarctic Peninsula has warmed by around three degrees over the past 50 years, making it one of the areas where the temperature is rising fastest.
CDU wants house tariff on staff
Because it is becoming more and more difficult to fill vacancies, the CDU is demanding to step out of the employers "association in order to become more attractive.
Just before the summer break, the Kreistag waved through 41 new posts in the administration.
More than 1100 employees and officials work for the district administration in Mettmann.
Now another 17 trainees have completed their first working day.
The apprenticeships at the circle are obviously very much sought after.
Around 620 applications were registered for the places to be awarded this year.
Nevertheless, the circle still lacks personnel in order to be able to cope with the increased demands and tasks.
At present, there are still 50 vacancies in the Mettmann district.
Among other things, we are looking for doctors and engineers as well as members of the general administration.
In Kreistag, the CDU, together with the FDP and the UWG, would now like to take the initiative and address the shortage of skilled workers in the administration.
According to the wishes of the parties, the administration should "develop a concept for recruitment and personnel development."
The aim is not only to meet short-term needs for skilled workers, but to address the shortage of applicants in a future-oriented way, it says.
The overall concept should be oriented internally and externally, identify concrete measures for new entrants and include a training offensive, demand CDU, FDP and UWG.
That sounds like a good approach.
Because the circle has to do with personnel problems that you didn't know before.
Other cities recruit good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions.
There is talk of real "competition between public employers."
In addition, there is a high number of employees who leave the service due to illness or age.
It is high time for action, therefore, so that more jobs do not remain unfilled.
But Klaus-Dieter Völker, leader of the CDU, is going beyond the joint motion with his party.
He recently caused a foul surprise in the district day, when he publicly questioned the coverage of personnel costs and stunned the other parties.
Peoples would like to see all possible avenues for leaving the municipal employers "association reviewed.
"If we do not find a satisfactory solution here in the short term, the district administration should aim for a house tariff with the trade unions - perhaps also in cooperation with the surrounding cities," says Völker.
In this way, the CDU is trying to pay the employees and officials better than the tariff regulations for the public service actually provide.
Salaries are currently strictly compulsory, there are increases or more money only if you move to a higher level, which is based on years of work.
But the tasks of the circle have grown more and more in recent years.
Only a few weeks ago, new rooms had to be set up in which employees take care of the provisions of the new prostitution protection law.
Not least because of the increasing number of asylum seekers, Councillor Thomas Hendele and district director Martin Richter have a problem: They have too few staff.
Italy tightens tone on NGO migrant lifeboats
Italy has warned NGOs using rescue boats for migrants in the Mediterranean that they must not continue to do so unless they abide by new rules for their operations.
"If NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct, it is difficult to see how they can continue to work," Interior Minister Marco Minniti said in an interview with the Turin daily La Stampa.
Minnick's warning came a day after the Italian authorities seized a boat belonging to the German aid organisation 'Youth Rettet' because its crew had effectively cooperated with traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration.
The aid organisation, which has only been in operation for a year, declined to comment on detailed allegations made by the Italian prosecutor Ambrogio CARTOSIO.
"For us, saving human life is and remains our top priority, so we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment," the organization said in a statement on social media.
'we can only assess all the allegations currently being made after we have gathered all the information and can assess the situation. '
The Italian authorities had been monitoring the boat from 'Youth Rettet', the Iuventa, since October.
It is thought that its crew is taking hose-boat migrants on board, delivered to them directly by traffickers, and that the smugglers can depart so that the ships can be used again.
At least one such meeting reportedly took place just 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast, according to the prosecutor's file, the content of which was published by Italian media.
The crew is suspected of exceeding the authority of the Italian coastguard, which monitors rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not for any other motives.
Under the code of conduct, boats such as the Iuventa must, above all, have an Italian police officer on board to monitor their activities.
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have so far agreed to abide by the code: Save the Children, Moas from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain.
The latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be seen as unnecessary but acceptable as they would not entail "significant changes or obstructions" to their rescue operations.
Among those who refuse to sign is the Nobel Prize-winning organization Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF).
Minniti meanwhile said that the number of migrants arriving in Italy after the rescue measures had fallen sharply in recent weeks, suggesting that efforts to strengthen the Libyan coastguard and work with local mayors had borne fruit.
"In the last few days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel," the minister said.
He announced plans for further talks with Libyan mayors this month on economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving those countries in the hope of reaching Europe.
Rises and Trials
Nine Weilermer bikers, the "Berlin outpost" and two guest drivers met in Wachenheim in the North Palatinate to enjoy Trials and sights for four days.
Three friendly guides were available for this.
The accommodation in the Wachenheim valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours.
The castle and wine festival of Wachenheim was a welcome extra.
The first tour led in hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Michaelskapelle above Deidesheim.
It followed vantage points, partly on towers, from which one could look far beyond the Palatinate forest and the upstream plains.
In between there were always longer climbs, for which long trials were rewarded.
On the second day we went to Bad Dürkheim to the Saline and the Volksfest Wurstmarkt.
Again, the lookout point was at the lookout point, connected by "flowery" trials and moderate rises.
On the last two days there were again many altitude meters.
Caves, rocks, towers, castles, ruins and refuges brought welcome breaks.
In Bad Dürkheim, the bikers breathed healing soles in the open-air inhaler.
Neustadt was also approached.
After 173 kilometres and almost 4,500 metres of altitude, the group had got to know the Palatinate Forest at its best - both sporting and cultural.
Console instead of lawn - Bundesliga gears up for e-sports
Will the sports stars be sitting in front of computer consoles in the future instead of sweating through the stadium races in the event of wind and weather?
Fact: E-sports has long since become a serious industry, a lucrative business - including big stars, millions of fans and huge high-stakes tournaments.
This has also been recognised by the first Bundesliga clubs, which are increasingly involved in this area.
The start was made in 2015 by the VfL Wolfsburg, later followed by FC Schalke 04 and most recently VfB Stuttgart, who founded an e-sports department in mid-July and signed two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17.
"We hope that this will inspire completely new young target groups for the VfB," says CEO Jochen Röttgermann.
He is sure that "a lot of clubs are going up on this train."
Next weekend, the FIFA Football World Cup organises the first "Interactive Club World Cup" in London, where gamers from different clubs compete against each other.
In addition to Schalke and Wolfsburg, for example, Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain and PSV Eindhoven have qualified.
Robin Dutt also sees great potential in e-sports.
The ex-coach of Bayer Leverkusen and Werder Bremen is now advising an agency for virtual football players.
"Real football has to deal with the 14 to 30-year-olds in particular, that the young people will still go to the stadium in the future," says the 52-year-old.
And: The clubs tried to conquer all sorts of markets, especially the Asian ones.
With prominent e-athletes under contract, you could be present on these markets much more often online than just sending the national league team to Asia once a year.
What is it all about?
In e-sports, computer games such as "League Of Legends," "Dota 2," "Counterstrike" or just the football simulation FIFA are fought at the competition level.
For a long time, as in normal sport, leagues have been established in which the professionals compete against each other.
And at the 2022 Asian Games, e-sports is already part of the official program.
But is it a real sport at all?
For many, the idea certainly needs getting used to.
Ingo Froböse has also dealt with the question for a long time.
For the professor at the German Sports Academy in Cologne, e-sports is a sport because it is competitive and shows many biological and physical reactions that can also be found in classical sports - for example, increased heart rates, stress reactions, hormonal changes.
There is also a need for cognitive skills, technical and tactical understanding and rapid reaction capability.
Professional gamers should not only train at the console, but also their body and pay attention to nutrition.
"The fit player is a good player."
But Froböse also sees problems: "Doping is becoming more and more an issue."
Controls were difficult to carry out in online games, and in the scene the structures of classical sport were lacking.
On the positive side, the scientist emphasises the high integrative effect of e-sports.
The players are travelling internationally, this is like a big global family, there are no intercultural barriers.
A study by business consultants Deloitte and the Federal Association of Interactive Entertainment Software (BIU) predicts rapid growth in e-sports.
In 2016, 50 million Euros were implemented in Germany, mainly through advertising, sponsorship and major tournaments.
In three years, sales are expected to reach 130 million.
Against the almost 2.4 billion euros of the Bundesliga this is not very much.
However, the e-sport is "not far away from the other established sports such as handball, basketball or ice hockey," the Deloitte consultants write.
Internationally, many countries are already further ahead.
Major markets include Asia and the US, where ex-basketball player Shaquille O'Neal and baseball star Alex Rodriguez are taking part in US team NRG eSports.
Hollywood actor Ashton Kutcher invests in the eSports betting company Unikrn.
Things are also happening in Europe.
In a Norwegian school, e-sports have been introduced as a teaching subject, says Froböse.
In the Netherlands and France, according to Dutt, first-tier football clubs are now obliged to set up an e-sports department.
"In European comparison, Germany is lagging behind," explains VfB CEO Röttgermann.
Just falling into nostalgia, and clearing up the old days, is no longer enough today.
The aim was to preserve the tradition of the association, but at the same time to align the company with the modern market.
"We live in a digitised world," Dutt also says.
"You can't hold on to the fact that only in football everything stays as it always was."
Poison eggs ade - The egg alternatives to cooking and baking
Almost all the federal states are now affected by the scandal of poisoned eggs.
Aldi Süd and Aldi Nord have reacted by removing all eggs from sale throughout Germany.
Only eggs that have been shown not to contain fipronil are to be placed on the shelves.
Michelle Carter convicted of texts urging Conrad Roy to commit suicide
A woman from Massachusetts has been sentenced to two and a half years for encouraging her boyfriend to commit suicide through texts and calls.
Michelle Carter, now 20, will spend 15 months of her sentencing behind bars and five years have been suspended on probation.
Carter was convicted in June of the negligent killing of Conrad Roy, who took his life on July 13, 2014.
Roy's father said at the hearing on Thursday: "My family is uncomforting.
My son was my best friend. "
Carter was allowed to remain free until the appeal.
She had been faced with a maximum sentence of 20 years, but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy were suffering from a mental illness.
Dressed in red trousers and a cream-coloured blouse, Carter stood there with tears in her eyes, with folded hands and down-facing eyes as she was sentenced.
"Their actions have killed Conrad Roy," the prosecutor told the court.
'she ended his life to make her own better.
She has not taken any responsibility, "she said.
'she didn't show any remorse. '
But Carter's lawyer said it was a "terrible circumstance that she completely regrets."
However, Judge Lawrence Moniz said he did not find out that their "age or degree of maturity or even their mental illness have a significant impact on their actions."
A prosecutor read a statement from Roy's mother Lynn Roy saying that there is "no day when I do not mourn the loss of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and how I deal with everything. I try to be there for his sisters despite all the pain we will carry with us for eternity, "it reads.
Roy's sister, Camdyn Roy, testified that she was "haunted" by the realization that she would never attend her brother's wedding or be an aunt for his children.
"No longer having this only person I've been with every day since I was born is a pain I will always keep with me for the rest of my life," she said.
The case seems to set a legal precedent, as there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to call on another to commit suicide.
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead from a carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle in 2014.
The case drew national attention after Carter's text messages revealed that she had encouraged him to end his life.
"Hang up, jump from a building, stab yourself, I don't know, there are many ways," she said in several messages she had sent in the two weeks before his death while he was on vacation with his family.
In the moments before his suicide, she wrote, "You have to do it, Conrad" and "All you have to do is turn on the generator and you'll be free and happy."
Judge Moniz said that Carter sought attention through the death of Roy and ordered that she should benefit from the case through any press.
The case has divided legal opinion.
Among the few who defended Carter was Amanda Knox, who was convicted in 2007 of murdering her British roommate in Italy before she was acquitted two years ago.
Ms. Knox, who is 30 years old, posted a comment in the Los Angeles Times: "Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help, not prison."
Joshua Kimmich: Learning from the new mini-lame of FC Bayern
The fact that Joshua Kimmich was allowed to run up as captain at the Audi Cup is no coincidence.
The FC Bayern is confident of a great season for the Confed Cup winner - extra motivation does not hurt.
Something was different on his seat in the cabin, that saw Joshua Kimmich immediately, even if the additional garment was very, very small.
But as far and wide on the second day of the Audi Cup there was of course no Philipp Lahm and also no Manuel Neuer to be seen, he made the bond assigned to him stop at his arm.
"The coach didn't announce it," said the Confed Cup winner afterwards, after his first deployment as Bayern captain.
Well, the score could have been better than the 0: 2 against the SSC Naples.
But the sign from the coach could also interpret Kimmich like this.
It was not the eight-year-old Arturo Vidal who had been chosen as the game leader in the C-Elf, made up of youth players, debutants and professionals who had just come out of their holidays.
After all, sugar is best distributed to those to whom one trusts a lot, who one wants to keep happy.
So anyone who has been chosen to take on the legacy of Lahm can only make good use of a little extra motivation.
Kimmich confirmed: "This is what you want as a player: To take responsibility."
On Wednesday, the 22-year-old flitted across the field as a mini-lahm.
Right at the back, this is now his position, the white bandage on his arm did the rest.
And in general, in this initial formation Kimmich seemed like the one who can take the helm in the best hand.
He gave instructions, tried to direct the unseeded troupe.
He had the look for the whole, while many others were busy with himself.
Vidal used to overplay his lack of fitness (hardly worked out); Renato Sanches made use of the performances of the trip to Asia (even if only partially); and Sebastian Rudy and Niklas Süle didn't seem negative in their first appearance in the Bavarian jersey.
After all, that worked out quite well.
Süle ran up next to Kimmich, Rudy in front of the defense, both acting sovereign.
The well-known Napoli storm often had a hard time, and Süle also tried to build up a game a few times.
His colleague Rudy admittedly admitted that the result "was not as we hoped it would be."
But he, too, showed a decent performance at the debut.
Game shift, tempo change: "I was also brought in for this style."
How unusual this Bavarian world is for the new entrants, you saw after the game.
Rudy, for example, did not give one or two in the catacombs, but determined six or seven interviews.
Kimmich said goodbye after a few crisp statements in the back of his new fellow players.
There he heard an interesting sentence from Süle: "I have already noticed what is going on here.
At Bayern you just have to win every game. '
After all, he no longer has to teach the new.
Alaba motivates ÖFB ladies
David Alaba believes in the success of our ÖFB ladies
Austria's most famous footballer signed up on Twitter shortly before the game and wished the ÖFB ladies all the best.
After all, the Bavarian Legionnaire is a club-mate of ÖFB captain Schnaderbeck and has a lot of fun with our Ladys.
The tweet of the Austrian footballer of the year and Champions League winner should be a special motivational injection.
Our ladies might well need the famous Bayern-Dusel, too.
Company satisfied with Rhineland-Palatinate minister: Economy praises Wissings pace
It often turned out to be irreconcilable, the relationship between the country and the regional economy, when Eveline Lemke (Greens) was still Minister of Economy of Rhineland-Palatinate.
This is evident after more than a year in which the new Economy Minister Volker Wissing (FDP) is in office.
Chambers and companies from the region speak at T V request of a change in economic policy - and at the same time blame the old minister.
Frank Natus, chairman of the Trier Companies Association (VTU), says: "Wissing takes up the wishes of the economy, which Lemke has all blocked."
Natus sees the biggest U-turn in infrastructure policy: The gap in motorway 1 between Kelberg and Adenau is now at the top of the country's list of priorities.
Later this year, the ministry hopes for a planning assessment process, by 2021 the building law should stand.
The West Bypass Trier, which is in urgent need of the Federal Road Map, also plays a role in the country's plans.
The aim is to get the line up and running in December 2020, says Ministry spokesperson Cornelia Holtmann.
Natus sees this as a signpost to support regional but internationally competing companies.
As recommended by Wissing, the Trier Chamber of Commerce and Industry (IHK) strives for a Rhineland-Palatinate label for wine, in order to increase sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of German wine exports, which has been sagging for ten years.
In addition, Wissing has an open ear for people who want to start their own company, praises the IHK.
The Trier Chamber of Crafts sees the new master bonus as an additional incentive for young apprentices, says managing director Matthias Schwalbach.
There will be a premium of 1000 Euros for the masters exam and 2500 Euros if graduates become self-employed within ten years of their master training.
The homework list for the country remains long, however.
According to Jan Glockauer, chief executive of the IHK Trier, the country lacks the necessary personnel when it comes to the planned road construction.
So far, only 29 of the 56 new engineers Wissing wants to employ for mobility at the national company have been filled.
The IHK is calling for more contracts to be awarded to external offices.
Christian Baldauf, member of the CDU Group, refers to calculations by the Court of Auditors that the country is investing more than EUR 20 million less in the maintenance of national roads in 2017 and 2018 than it has proposed.
Frank Natus is also awaiting a concept from the country on how to address the shortage of skilled workers in the region.
The broadband expansion in the country to date is also sobering.
In 2016, regional companies had rated network supply only with the grade 3.4 in an IHK survey.
They complained about stalled internet connections and abortions.
Ex-Minister of Economy Eveline Lemke, on the other hand, is out of politics at the moment and still sits on the board of the wind power company Pro Wind.
The Green Group left Lemke in April to become president of a private university in Karlsruhe - where, after four months, she already cleared the field again because of disagreements.
Audi set to change 850,000 diesel vehicles - automakers face a backlash
A day before Audi's announcement, BMW said it would offer to upgrade the software in more than 350,000 vehicles.
The BMW chairman said the company believed that "there are smarter options than driving restrictions," referring to European cities - including Munich, where BMW is based - to ban or restrict diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions.
None of the companies described the companies as a recall.
European automakers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with rules on carbon dioxide emissions.
But the nitrogen oxides emitted by diesel engines are considered to be carcinogens and can cause asthma.
The cost to car manufacturers of installing equipment to neutralise exhaust emissions from diesel vehicles is also increasing, making it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of spoiling the powerful car companies and ignoring signs of the problem.
The companies are trying to avoid Volkswagen's mistakes, which include the use of so-called shutdown devices that could regulate emissions to comply with regulations when a car has been tested but drive back in normal driving conditions.
In the United States, several Volkswagen employees have been indicted, while others are being investigated on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former head of thermodynamics in Audi's engine development was arrested in Germany.
The former manager, Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio, is Italian and is therefore not protected from extradition and could be brought to justice in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi was included in German criminal investigations at Volkswagen after authorities accused Audi of installing a system to circumvent emissions regulations in Europe, and a request focused on the United States was expanded.
The inclusion of Audi in the investigation could weigh heavily on Volkswagen: The luxury car manufacturer makes a disproportionate contribution to Volkswagen's profit.
This message has the raft on Saturday on the Isar
The city wants to protect the Isar.
In order that the Isar visitors also take part, a raft passes through Munich tomorrow, Saturday, which has a special message.
If you are drawn to the Isar river again on Saturday, you will see a big raft there between Flaucher and Reichenbachbrücke.
And this is not a usual raft, with Isar tourists.
But the construction department wants to clarify.
On the raft you can see a big infra-party.
It shows a rubbish mountain.
The prelude to a publicity campaign to appeal to the Isar visitors.
With the motto "True love is..." the understanding of the Isar as a protected wild flow is to be sharpened.
Already last summer the raft drove over the Isar and also this year there are further actions and measures to achieve a considerate and environmentally conscious behavior.
Mordillos Knollennasen and laughing against suffering
Mordillo was at times one of the most published cartoon draftsmen, the Knollennases of his figures are his trademark.
Even at 85, the Argentinian is still drawing and working on a film.
His message: Laugh, "because there is too much suffering in the world."
Guillermo Mordillo was born in Buenos Aires on August 4, 1932, the son of Spanish immigrants.
In his first years as an artist he worked as a draftsman for congratulatory cards - which frustrated him.
"The happiest day in my professional life was the day when lost into my job," he once said.
After stops in Lima, New York and Paris, he made his breakthrough at the end of the 60s: With the release of his cartoons in "Paris Match" and then also in "Stern" and other leading magazines around the world.
Even in China, Mordillo found many fans.
Again and again the artist was inspired by cities.
Large, round Mordillo figures tumble in drawings with the Leaning Tower of Pisa, Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow.
According to his own statements, he is still sitting at the drawing table in the early morning, working almost ten hours a day.
Through calendars, puzzles, books for adults and children, T-shirts, plush toys and watches, his droll figures continue to find a lot of distribution worldwide.
For six years he has been working on a cartoon and a TV series with his characters.
The main person in the movie "Crazy Island" is a giraffe - Mordillos's most popular animal in his drawings - who has a thousandfold as his opponent.
For the first time, his characters speak in the 3D film, which is set to hit the cinema screen in 2019.
"I don't know exactly what they're going to say, it's weird for me," says Mordillo.
The script is not written by him.
That's why he relies more on the TV series, which, like his original drawings, is produced without a word.
Lavender from Provence threatened by climate change
He has become a symbol of Provence in southern France, but there is a warning that he is threatened by climate change.
Lavender is declining due to drought-related conditions and disease-borne insects, which is a major headache for scientists and farmers trying to find solutions.
Eric Chaisse, expert at the agricultural research institute CRIEPPAM in Provence, said: "The lavender in Provence is effectively at risk because the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change in recent years, which brought much less rain in the spring and much more in the autumn.
This has an impact on the life of lavender.
There is also a small cicade, a microbacterium that transmits dwarf cicadas, and in very dry weather there are a lot of them. "
And there is a lot at stake.
Lavender oil is not only attractive for holidaymakers, it is also in great demand for perfume and cosmetics.
Eric Chaisse said: 'Instead of having very long plant clocks with a large number of flowers, we have smaller, underdeveloped and either missing or weakened.
So we have fewer parts with essential oil. "
The solutions being considered include better water distribution and slowing evaporation from the soil, but also spraying the plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and developing varieties that are more resistant to drought.
The town of Geisa in the Thuringian Rhön celebrates its 1200-year anniversary.
Peak is this Saturday and Sunday with a medieval festival.
Cranes, guilds, dealers, vagants or a country slave camp are said to be experienced on these days in the city centre.
The murder of a journalist underscores the growing threat in Mexico
Employees of the weekly Riodoce usually meet Wednesday to review their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the state of Sinaloa caused by organized crime, corrupt officials and ceaseless drug wars.
But that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about safety.
They have been told it is important to change their routines.
Two high-ranking journalists discuss what feels safer: They should take their children into the office, who were the target of an attack with grenades in 2009, or leave them at home.
Security experts have written three words on a plaque at the front of the room: Opponents, neutrals, allies.
They ask the reporters to suggest names for each column - no proof is needed, perceptions and gut feelings range.
There are drug smugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists suspected of being on the government's payroll or the cartels, a catalogue of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous.
There is no respite from the violence, and while bodies are piling up across the country, more and more journalists are participating: At least 25 since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012. 589 are under federal protection after attacks and threats, and so far this year there have been at least seven deaths in seven states.
Among the latter is her editor and her inspirator of Riodoce, co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.
"The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his numerous books on drug-related violence.
His absence is deeply felt, although his presence is present everywhere - a large photo of Valdez, showing his middle finger with the word "Justice," hangs on the facade of the Riodoce building. Two reporters in their thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wearing T-shirts typical of the panamel.
The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared themes, the trauma, their nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.
Although a special Federal Prosecutor's Office was established in 2010 to deal with the cases of journalists, according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists, it has initiated only two criminal proceedings.
As with most of the thousands of murders linked to drug trafficking and organised crime every year, journalists' murderers are rarely brought to justice.
At Riodoce, they still insist on treating the violence of Sinaloa, although they are uncomforting and although the terrain is now even more treacherous.
Without information about the killers, without justice, the meeting for discussing security has little benefit, Ibarra says.
"It's very stupid to waste my time in this workshop," he says.
'as long as we don't know the why, we distrust everyone. '
On the morning of May 15, Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the state capital of Culiacan.
He only managed to drive a few blocks away before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men. He was forced out of his car and shot at him 12 times, presumably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated as "Twelfth River."
The gunman drove away in his car and damaged it nearby.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He left behind a wife and two grown-up children.
Rumours tend to fly around freely in Culiacan.
But on the subject of Valdez, there is virtually nothing but silence.
Since Guzman's arrest last year and extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa had become one of the country's bloodiest battlefields, as rival factions here struggle to fill the vacuum.
It doesn't matter that in Sinaloa, someone or several people are shot in the street every day or that the cemetery is full of ordained, two-story mausoleums for drug royalty that are larger than many houses for the living.
Forget for a minute that there is a state of "calm" when only one cartel has control of the coastal state with its precious ports and drug trade routes to the United States.
Still, and despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, has broken with guilt for not being able to protect his friend.
He believes that two misconceptions contributed to the murder.
First, in February, there was the publication of an interview with Damaso Lopez, a leader of one of the rival antitrust factions at war with Guzman's sons.
This publication may have annoyed the sons, suspected gang members bought every copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to newspaper kiosks.
The second mistake was not to force Valdez to leave the country for his own safety after the seizure of another newspaper that had published the same story.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is seen as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists.
He had survived for so long that his friends and colleagues assumed he would always be there.
He was an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003, when he joined forces with five colleagues to set up Riodoce and sold $50 worth of holdings.
In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to engage in journalism without encountering the narcotics problem," Bojorquez said.
Over time, the newspaper earned a reputation for courageous and honest reporting, and sales and advertising increased.
Reporters loved being able to publish hard-hitting investigations without fear of censorship, and readers were intrigued by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else dared to deal with.
Eight years after the founding of Riodoce, she was awarded the prestigious "Maria Moors Cabot Prize" for her reporting in Latin America.
In the same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award from the Committee to Protect Journalists for his courage in prosecuting Mexican drug history wherever it led.
He voluntarily admitted that he was afraid.
"I want to live on," he said at the time of the CPJ award.
Drug trafficking in Sinaloa "is a way of life," he said in an interview with Rompeviento-TV last October.
'you have to take on the task that falls to you as a journalist - either that or you're playing the stupid.
I don't want to be asked, "What did you do in the face of so many deaths... why didn't you say what was going on?"
The Riodoce team is missing Valdez, the joker who could curse like a dockworker, the friend who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.
They relied on his routine.
He would always wear his hat.
He would always go to El Guayabo, the bar across from the office, and always sit there at the same table.
Now they ask: Was his love of routine his spoiling?
His death has also forced them to question their own assumptions about how best to do their job and stay alive.
"They don't like it when you deal with their wives, their children, their clean shops, their secret runways" to move drugs.
"These things were not allowed," Bojorquez said.
The result is, even in the best of times, a high level of self-censorship and self-preservation.
Trust his own instincts.
If it smells wrong, stay away from it.
The trouble is, said the editor of Riodoce Andres Villarreal, that "smell a sense that can be fooled... and then the thing happened to Javier."
The old rules, as he and others say, no longer apply in Sinaloa - just as they do in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states where a toxic mix of lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt government officials reside.
The landscape is constantly changing.
In the room where the employees of Riodoce met for security training, suddenly no mobile phones were allowed. Days before, it became known that spyware, which is sold exclusively to governments, was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.
Outside, two police officers sought shelter from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shade of a tree.
They were mandated by the state government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-storey building in a middle-class neighborhood of Culiacan.
Half in jest, some of the reporters wondered whether these officers were among the 50 percent of police officers that the governor himself described as untrustworthy.
It's been months since the reporters went to the mountainside, where the drug gangs are de facto under control.
For this week's edition, Riodoce has looked at three main stories.
There was the assassination of the brother of former well-known boxer Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.
They also had an exposé on government spending focused on the governor's home town.
And there was a group that carried out a kidnapping at one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the prosecutor's office.
There was no official word on who was kidnapped or how it happened, so caution was needed when it came time to write what everyone in the city knows: That the restaurant is a favorite place of drug dealers and authorities.
A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician belonging to the ruling Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), which dominated all political levels for almost the entire century.
Recently, several PRI governors have been accused of high-profile cases of corruption.
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in that eatery, including one in which a son of "El Chapo" Guzman escaped a military raid.
Just a few months earlier, readers would have viewed Valdez's column as the best-informed source about the kidnapping.
"Before, we would have known what happened," said Villarreal, 46, using the nickname "El Flaco" because of its slim body board.
"Now all channels of communication with our sources are broken."
Valdez's office has been rededicated to the storage room for signs and stickers protesting against the murders of journalists because the staff have become something they themselves would never have expected: Activists on behalf of the press.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez grabbed a few signs and went to a demonstration the next morning because of another journalist to the prosecutor's office.
Salvador Adame went missing three days after Valdez had been killed, in the western state of Michoacan.
A cremated body has been discovered and officials say based on DNA tests that it is his.
Across the country, journalists have become more vocal by writing down "SOS Press" on sidewalks and buildings in organized protests.
On that day, the director Bojorquez is away in Washington and trying there to gather international support for the judiciary in the Valdez case.
At a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa the day after Valdez's assassination, Ramirez accused the authorities of spying on journalists and killing them because they told the truth.
She has since asked for it to be reclassified by the government because she is concerned that her anger has hurt her objectivity.
Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were "surrounded" by organized crime, government officials involved in it and an indifferent society.
In his last book, "Narco-Journalism," he wrote that reporters are not only killed by drug gangs, but also on the orders of politicians and security forces who were in cahoots with organized crime.
The media watchdog group "Articulo 19" last year assigned more than half of the attacks on journalists to police and officials.
"In Mexico, you're dying because they want you to keep your mouth shut," Ramirez said.
Apparently, the killings have a deterrent effect.
No one forgets the death of the blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago.
Her body was found along with a note allegedly signed by the Zetas cartel saying: "Here I am because of my reports."
A computer keyboard and headphones lay next to her severed head.
Some branches have chosen to close, such as the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state of Chihuahua after the assassination of correspondent Miroslava Breach in March.
Others continue to do as El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did after the murder of their director in 2004.
In 2010, the Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed the drug cartels with an editorial on the front page with the headline "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists have fled from their home states or even the country.
It is a painful decision.
It's hard to find work in exile, and they're still watching the streets and looking for dangers.
And sometimes they are hunted, as is apparently the case for photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered in 2015 along with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after fleeing Veracruz.
For those who stay behind and continue the work, it's a daily dance with risky choices.
Ibarra, who once wanted to be a poet, admits that drug trafficking frightens him.
"Mexico is going to hell, and that's why I became a reporter," he said.
At midnight last Friday, when the last edition had already ended, Riodoce's editors were sitting on the sidewalk in front of the office and drinking beer when all of a sudden all their phones began to buzz.
A series of shootings involving gang rivals and security forces near the seaside resort of Mazatlan had left 19 confirmed dead.
The war continued to escalate, as promised by a series of cartel embassies in the region.
From the curb, they posted the news on the Riodoce website via mobile phone.
The title page had to be changed the next day.
Sirens howled nearby - another shooting in the area.
Bojorquez took a look at the police officers who were holding guard to see if they were in readiness.
If they were afraid at all, they didn't show it.
Under the powerful portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper, whose middle finger was visible to all of Sinaloa, Riodoce's staff followed in his footsteps.
"How can you even think of closing," Bojorquez said, "when on the same day Javier was murdered, the intern asked me to send her out to the streets for reporting."
Dinosaur used camouflage to dodge his enemies
At first glance, it looks like a statue, albeit a terrifying one.
Now researchers have found that the first findings of a Canadian miner's incredible rhino have been so well preserved that experts have described it as the "Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs."
It was so well preserved they could even find that his scaly skin was of reddish brown - and they said she had had something of a "troubled past."
The report in the journal "Current Biology" described him as "the best-preserved armored dinosaur ever found, and one of the best dinosaur specimens in the world."
The fossil is a newly discovered species of nodosaurier that lived in the middle of the Cretaceous period between 110 million and 112 million years ago.
Its incredibly well-preserved condition has stunned researchers who describe it as "truly remarkable"
According to reports in National Geographic, the armored plant eater is the best preserved fossil of its kind.
It was found by Shawn Funk when he dug in the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011.
He encountered something that seemed out of place from the surrounding rock, and decided to look more closely.
The fossil he discovered was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.
They spent the next six years uncovering the wild animal within the 2,500 pound (1,100 kg) heavy ground clump.
After all this hard work, the finished result is now ready to be revealed.
"If you just blink a little with your eyes, you could almost believe it has slept," said lead author Caleb Brown, a scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature can be seen.
'it will go down in scientific history as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaur specimens - the Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs. '
Researchers have found that although this herbivore is covered with an armor and resembles a walking tank, it has probably been threatened by meat-eating dinosaurs.
The heavily armored dinosaur used a red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and used a shielding technique known as counter-shading, which is also used by many modern animals.
This would have allowed it to blend better into its environment and dodge its enemies, experts say, suggesting it was threatened by larger dinosaurs.
The 110 million-year-old creature from the Nodosaurian family first made headlines in May and can now be seen at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.
Researchers have now studied the wild animal and named it Borealopelta markmitchelli after museum technician Mark Mitchell, one of a team that has spent more than 7,000 hours carefully uncovering it.
The astonishing preservation of the specimen allowed Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and shape of scales and armor across his body.
They discovered countershading, a common defense method in the animal kingdom, meaning the top of the creature was darker than its underside.
Although countershading is common, the results are surprising, as the size of Borealopelta far exceeds that of the animals living today.
It suggests that the dinosaur was hunted by enough pressure from flesh-eating dinosaurs that evolution favored the concealment of confrontation as a means of survival.
But most contemporary animals that use counter-shading - think deer, zebras or belt animals - are much smaller and more vulnerable than prey, signalling that this nodosaur was exposed to a real struggle for survival.
"Strong predator behavior on a massive, heavily armored dinosaur show how dangerous the dinosaur predators of the Cretaceous must have been," Brown said.
The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the dinosaur's skin was red-brown.
Scientists continue to examine the animal for clues about its life, including its preserved intestinal content, to find out what it ate as its last meal.
They believe the dinosaur, when he died, ran into a river and was driven out into the sea, where it sank on its back to the seabed.
At the time, Alberta was as warm as southern florida today, and rivers and oceans probably spread much further inland than they are today.
"This nodosaurier is really remarkable because it is completely covered with preserved scaly skin, but is also preserved in three dimensions and maintains the original shape of the animal," Brown said.
"The result is that the animal today looks almost the same as in the early Cretaceous period.
You don't need to use a lot of imagination to reconstruct it. If you just look a little with your eyes, you could almost believe that he is sleeping. "
The Cretaceous period was a time when giant theropods, carnivorous dinosaurs, standing on two legs, passed through the earth.
Although the king of them, the Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions of years after Borealopelta, the armored dinosaur was hunted by some of its fearsome ancestors.
These include the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38-foot (11.5 m) long, six-ton monster.
The scientists, whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta sank in the sea after death and was mummified in the mud.
The creature was found by Shawn Funk when he dug in the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011.
According to the museum, it is the best preserved armored dinosaur in the world, including skin and armour, and is complete from snout to hip.
The creatures were on average about 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).
It contained two 20-inch-long spikes that raced off his shoulders.
The researchers believe that the armored herbivore waded through western Canada until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea.
But the underwater burial of the dinosaur preserved its armor in exquisite detail.
The fossilized remains of this particular specimen are so well preserved that the skin remains still cover bumpy tank plates along the dinosaur
As Michael Greshko has written for National Geographic, such a level of conservation is as' rare as a win in the lotto.
The more I look at it, the more confusing it gets.
Petrified remnants of the skin still cover the bumpy tank plates that carry the animal's skull.
His right front foot is at his side, his five fingers are spread upwards.
I can count the scales on his sole '.
In thunderstorm: Mass carambolage on A8: Many injured
Violent accident on Thursday night on the A8: Just under 30 vehicles are involved in a mass carambolage.
There are numerous injured, mile-long traffic jams - and gaffers.
About 20 people were injured in a mass carambolage on the Stuttgart-Munich motorway (A8) late Thursday afternoon.
According to initial police data, nearly 30 vehicles, including probably trucks, crashed between Adelzhausen and Odelzhausen (Aichach-Friedberg district) during a thunderstorm at around 5pm.
Initially, no information was available on the exact number of injured persons.
They were minor to moderate injuries, said a police spokesman.
A large number of emergency vehicles were at the scene of the accident.
The A8 was completely closed in the direction of Munich.
A ten-kilometre long backlog formed in the direction of Munich.
As an AZ reporter reports, massive disabilities also occurred on the opposite lane - due to numerous gaffers.
The fire brigade took note of the characteristics of the drivers, who are now facing severe penalties.
Shortly after 6: 45 p.m. a second accident occurred on the A8, this time between Augsburg and Dasing.
There had been a collision between a car transporter and a car.
A rescue helicopter was on its way to the accident site.
Deutsche Bahn: Group tests "comfort check-in"
It's a moment that almost everyone has experienced before: Nothing unsuspecting you sit on the train and sleep.
Or you are engrossed in his work and just have an ingenious thought.
And then: Pufff.
If the conductor comes and wakes you up, or rips the passenger out of the middle of the workflow.
Ticket control.
But the days of interruptions are soon over.
Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the seamless ticket control.
One simply confirms by mobile phone that one has taken his place and thus devalues the ticket.
A test operation is currently running on two routes.
"If the offer arrives, we extend it.
It is then expected to be available on many more long-distance routes in Germany early next year, "a rail spokesman said.
"Comfort Check-in," the train calls the ticket devaluation without a conductor.
In order to be able to use them, however, some prerequisites must be met: You need a smartphone or a tablet.
And you have to have booked an online ticket - which is already what most passengers do anyway.
You also have to buy it via the app of the train, the DB Navigator, which is anyway the most convenient way to book a ticket.
And finally you need a seat reservation.
Because the "comfort check-in" works like this: You get on the train, call your ticket under "My Tickets."
A button for electronic devaluation will then appear with the test customers.
The train attendants receive a message on their mobile devices that Passenger X is on the train and has taken the seat Y booked.
If the train attendant arrives at number Y during ticket inspection, he knows that there is a passenger with an already devalued online ticket.
So you can continue to sleep, continue working, keep silent.
The "check-in" has two advantages: One for the customer, one for the railway - which in turn should benefit the passengers.
"If you want to travel in a relaxed way without ticket control by our train attendants, simply check in yourself at the DB Navigator.
This allows passengers to make their travel time on the train more personal, "says Michael Peterson, marketing director of DB Fernverkehr.
Second plus: "And our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs."
Those who travel by train often know that, in addition to delays and missed trains, ticket checks are one of the biggest annoyances.
Because often you yourself, but in any case one of the passengers does not have all the documents you need for the devaluation of online tickets.
Either there is no credit card or identity card or any other document to show.
The result is endless discussions between train attendants and passengers, which leads to bad mood in the compartment or large area and delays in controlling your own ticket, and the conductor ultimately takes the time to take care of other concerns.
Only a small number of test customers can still use the new service.
And this only applies to the ICE 915 Dortmund-Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart-Essen connections.
Additional numbers on the same route are not yet available.
How one activist came to learn the answer to the question: "Whose Streets?"
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shaken to her core.
Just a day after she arrived in New York City, the St. Louis-born sat on the bed of an Airbnb apartment she rented and scrolled through Facebook on her phone.
She stumbled across a post from someone from high school.
"The police have just killed an 18-year-old child, and it is still lying on the street," it said there.
Confused, as no one else had posted the information on her feed, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
A user with the Handle @ TheePharoah was constantly retweetet on her timeline.
The rapper from the St. Louis area was in the process of tweeting live the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old who was killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Mo.
He posted a picture of Brown's lifeless body, which was stretched out on the street and would stay there for four hours.
"That's wild," Ferrell thought to himself.
But death was nothing new for her and her community.
She dropped off her mobile phone to return later in the evening to tweets about people on the Canfield drive.
There were photos of the police tape and people screaming, and of a man claiming to be Brown's father, who carried a sign with the inscription: "Ferguson's police just killed my unarmed son!"
She watched a live feed where a police officer stood in front of a group of protesters with a barking dog.
In another video, she said, another police officer unlocked his rifle and screamed, "I will kill you... animals all."
"This is not common," Ferrell recalled of her statement.
'that's not the kind of murder we've become accustomed to and that we can call typical. '
At that moment I felt chills.
I was angry and crying. '
She booked a return flight and went home the next day.
After landing at 11pm, she picked up her 6-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided that the two would head to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson over the following three years is the subject of a new documentary, "Whose Streets?," in cinemas from the 11th.
It is a story of survival and protest, of love and loss, of strength and resilience, comprised from the point of view of the people who live in the community and have filled the streets to demand answers.
When Ferrell drove to Ferguson with her daughter, who was wearing a floral dress and matching crown, the two discussed a conversation they had countless times before that morning "about the black experience and the black state."
"You remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe in?" She recalled what she said.
'we're going to Ferguson now because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and that wasn't right.
I couldn't take them, "Ferrell said later.
"What happened today is a culmination of... what happened in the past.
She needs to know and see it and be brought up in it.
It needs to be well developed, to know not only activism and organization, but also the different layers of the black experience and the black constitution, and what we need to do to become free to liberate ourselves.
Even though I am lucky enough to give her an experience in which she personally does not experience blatant racism, she is no different from the next black women's child.
I feel like I'm doing her a disservice to keep her away from it. '
The first stop when they arrived in Ferguson was on South Florissant Road, a site opposite the police authority that became a camping area as the activists waited for the possible non-indictment of Officer Darren Wilson.
There, Ferrell and her daughter connected with a local business owner who was making lunch.
They prepared pockets and helped pass them on to protesters.
Slowly, a new kind of activism for Ferrell began to take shape.
"My activism totally changed after August 9," she said, noting that as a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, she was president of the Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on food justice and health inequalities in black communities.
"I had no experience in organizing.
It's all come. '
Weeks later, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, one of the film's co-directors, during an evening demonstration.
Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar just wanted to "document" what happened.
One question came to Ferrell's mind: "Do you want to document or do you try to find a story that you can exploit?"
This skepticism was fuelled by countless cases of people, often whites - in a community that benefited from their pain and resilience.
As Folayan recently explained in an interview, "We had heard that people who were born and raised in Ferguson did not centre their voices and we wanted to do it differently."
Folayan had already worked with the then co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the field known for his activism around death row inmates.
His commitment brought Ferrell closer to the project, along with six other locals following the team from "Whose Streets?" In the years following Brown's shooting.
"This documentary is not someone who speaks for us or talks to us. We talk," Davis said.
'that was the main thing for me, how these people are portrayed, because that's how I'm going to be portrayed. '
The goal was not to focus on Ferrell's experience - to show that the movement is "not a messiah leader, but a community coming together," Folayan said - it proved to be the most open participant in the film.
As a result, documents from "Whose Streets?" Show surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrell's life as she falls in love and marries her wife.
"I felt like I was nude," Ferrell said, laughing when she saw the finished product for the first time.
'but I've understood that there must be some vulnerability in this work and in the humanization of black people. '
In addition, Ferrell's story repeats the role of black gay women in the broader Black Lives Matter movement.
Two of the movement's three founders, who coined the film "BlackLivesMatter" on social media after the killing of black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012, identify as gay.
"Black, gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement overall," Ferrell said, "and therefore we are constantly fighting on different fronts.
Black, gay women must bear the brunt of everything. ""
Folayan agreed to note that "the movement is really held upright by black women and many black women."
However, she insists that "this is not an affirmatic type of action," in which Ferrell was chosen as the heart of the film because of her identity.
"She was the person who stirred up that energy," she said.
'it's no coincidence, although she was at the forefront because so much is at stake in a life at these crossings as a black, gay woman.
You can feel their energy through the screen. "
Meanwhile, the news cameras in Ferguson have long since disappeared, but the racial links between the community and the police continue to exist.
Ferrell is on probation for 2 ½ years for blocking a highway at a demonstration.
She describes the socio-political atmosphere of the area she calls her home: "A mess."
Still, she clings to a chant and she has been committed to that memory ever since she took to the streets in Ferguson three years ago.
"It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It is our duty to win.
We must love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose - except our chains. '
From "dream" to "megalomania ": TV readers discuss bit gallery
The bit gallery moves people, although it is far from being built.
But the idea of a shopping center on the southern end of the pedestrian zone has been dividing the population into supporters and opponents since the first presentation in 2009.
The topic hardly leaves you cold.
The topic is also discussed on our Facebook page "Volksfreund Bitburg."
While some say to the bit gallery: "That would be a dream" (Anja Becker) or "That would be really great" (Nicole Schausten), from the other side comes: "No man needs" (Siggi Betzen) or simply: "Megalomaniac!" (Lars Scholz).
While supporters are relying on a gallery to attract more customers to the city, which also benefits the rest of the shops, opponents fear that the pedestrian zone will bleed out.
In addition, the gallery is planned precisely on the site of the farmer's market hall, where 13 direct marketers offer their products.
This will come to an end at the beginning of the construction work.
The gallery makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - towards Beda Square with the possibility of sitting outside.
Simone Zimmer: "We have been shopping almost weekly in the farmer's market hall for many years now.
Mainly our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of the rural women again and again very much.
We have also discovered the butchery for ourselves.
We would like there to be a chance to maintain this offer during and especially after the construction of the gallery.
In other cities there are.
Especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting. "
Gerd Densing: "Whether direct marketers settle in a market hall in the gallery depends on the level of the rent.
But this will probably not be very low for the new project. "
Eva Kilic: "Why shopping palaces in Bitburg?
Whether it's clothing, shoes, drugstore or supermarkets, I think it's superfluous.
There's already enough of that in our city.
You can see how many shops are empty here - some have been for months and years.
However, since there is not even a proper weekly market here, it is all the more important that we at least retain the market hall.
After all, the product offered there is fresh, is mainly offered directly by the producer and is also inexpensive.
As you can see, shops in a shopping centre are only rented by larger companies, because the rents there are often not affordable for a retailer.
It's a pity, there are almost no special shops anymore and what is left of them will probably disappear. "
Wolf Fandel: "A shopping centre with a market hall doesn't fit together for me.
And the gallery does not fit to Bitburg.
Above all: Where should the farmer's market hall go during the construction period?
The old Edeka would be the solution - even in the long run, if the bit gallery actually comes at some point.
Or does the ghost bit gallery manage to sell all the shops from Bitburg before? "
George Marquet: "This just won't work.
And a shopping center that stands empty, nobody needs either.
In my opinion, it would have been better to promote a real farmers' market instead of this gallery.
But thanks to the unbelievably many - in my opinion - useless building projects in Bitburg, there is no longer any room for a farmer's market hall.
If the farmers "market hall is destroyed, a piece of culture will disappear again."
An apt resemblance: Artist creates portraits with Chelsea Manning's DNA
In the middle of the room of the Fridman Gallery in New York, many faces can be seen - white, black and brown, almost imperceptibly alike - hanging on cables from the ceiling.
The 30 portraits were created by artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from cheeks-toppers and haircuts sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent the excerpts from the Fort Leavenworth prison, where the former intelligence analyst was serving a 35-year prison sentence after she made public classified diplomatic notices through the WikiLeaks website.
The new exhibition, which opened on August 2, is called A Becoming Resemblance (A fitting resemblance).
She is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline united her expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a trans woman and pioneering dissident whose conviction was commuted by Barack Obama when he had only three days left in his post.
Dewey-Hagborg, through the algorithmic analysis of DNA extracted by Manning and created from the 30 portraits of what someone with this genomic data might look like, has a sharp, if somewhat intellectual, commentary not only on the formability of DNA data - the many ways in which they can be interpreted.
Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward but has already spoken openly about identifying as a woman since her puberty, was convicted in 2013 of 20 charges, including six violations of the spy law, computer fraud and theft.
Through prison, her image was suppressed, so much so that there was only one photo - a grainy, black-and-white selfie in which Manning visibly sits unwell in a driver's seat and wears a platinum blonde wig - with which she was associated.
In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg just came back from the huge success of her 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'.
In it, the artist produced portraits of strangers from forensic artifacts such as cigarette butts and chewing gum by extracting the DNA from the waste to create a picture of what these people might look like.
That was the time when she received an email from a newspaper magazine.
"They conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison, and they wanted some kind of portrait to accompany this article," Dewey-Hagborg explained at a press preview of the new exhibition.
And she couldn't visit at that time and she couldn't be photographed, so you made contact with Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to do a DNA portrait.
The artist and her imprisoned muse became unequal pen friends, who exchanged several letters over the course of two years.
They even created a comic "Suppressed Images," illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, which foresaw a future in which the president would transform Chelseas's judgment and she would be able to see the exhibition in person.
That Obama would indeed demand Manning's release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas, just days after the book was published, was a welcome kind of happy coincidence.
There is also something deep and strong now at the opening of the exhibition, as Donald Trump is waging a war against informants from the government camp and against transgender troops to find new, tweetable ways to further inflame the rigid divisions he was supposed to fix.
When Dewey-Hagborg was asked about the strange timing of all these things, she said that "things happen for a certain reason."
In an artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery, Manning, with her outsized signature underneath (the "i" in her family name is emblazoned with a heart) called for an end to "automatic fragmentation, the basis of which has been gender, race, sexuality and culture."
On the opposite wall is their mitochondrial DNA sequence - a millipede of Cs and Gs and As, written in pencil.
Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show by incorporating the 200 letters (or nucleotides according to the artist's highly developed scientific lexicon) how astonishingly similar, at least in biological terms, we all are.
"What people will hopefully take away from this is that our genome doesn't care about who we are and how open genetic data is to interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose 2007 video work, Spurious Memories, can also be seen.
'DNA data can tell so many different stories, so that's 30 of these stories. '
The last piece in the exhibition, which is kept in a separate room, is a page from the comic novella mentioned above.
She shows Manning as she emerges with a hands-free phone in hand from the disciplinary barracks of the United States like King-Kong.
"If they cold your speech, then they won," it reads.
"So never stop your mouth."
"It came straight from a letter she wrote to me," said the artist, greeting from Philadelphia.
"I still get goosebumps when I talk about it."
Manning has not yet seen the exhibition in person - just as it was anticipated in the comic book - but if she was to do so, then she will be greeted in the middle of the room by the masks, by her own genomic simulacres, gathering like hordes of protesters.
That was also purposeful, like everything in the exhibition, right down to the size (5 "2, Manning's stature) at which their genetic haplogroups were written with pencil.
"In the past I had them on the wall, but I wanted them to feel like a crowd of people," Dewey-Hagborg said of the portraits.
'i wanted it to feel like a mass movement that was forming with Chelsea, like the movement that was also behind its liberation. '
Professor of the University of Northwestern and an employee of the University of Oxford wanted for killing
A nationwide manhunt is underway for a professor at Northwestern University and an employee of Oxford University who are being sought as a suspect after a man was stabbed to death with fatal injuries in a luxury apartment in Chicago.
On Monday, arrest warrants were issued for Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) for murder over their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, as the files of the Cook County District Court show.
The documents say that Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after several stitches.
A community warning system published by the Chicago Police Department says the corpse was discovered on July 27.
Officials received a call, arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with multiple injuries to his body.
Cornell-Duranleau was still declared dead at the scene of the incident, and detectives are investigating the stitches as murder, while police are actively looking for the two suspects, officials said.
Lathem has been an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, the vice president for university relations, said in an emailed statement that Lathem would now be on leave and had been barred from entering the Northwestern University campus.
"This is now a criminal matter that is being investigated by the relevant authorities, and Northwestern University is cooperating in this investigation," Cubbage said.
Warren is a senior treasury assistant at Oxford University.
A spokesman for the university and Somerville College said in an emailed statement that "we are in contact with the police in the UK and ready to help the US investigative authorities in any way possible."
The statement added that Warren's colleagues were shocked and want him to turn himself in.
Chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Department, Anthony Guglielmi, said he strongly urges the suspects to stand up to the authorities.
"The police have an idea of their whereabouts, and our efforts to locate them are intensifying," Guglielmi said.
Guglielmi said local, regional and national authorities are helping to find the suspects.
Guglielmi said police received a call from the building manager of the Grand Plaza building, who had just received an enigmatic tip saying something had happened in apartment 1008.
Police described the scene as very cruel.
Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the incident had also taken place on July 27.
It was confirmed by security cameras that Lathem and Warren were in the building.
"We believe that Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," Guglielmi said.
Grand Plaza's management team released a statement to residents: "Police are currently working on the timeline and background of the victim and are exploring a variety of motives, including a possible domestic incident."
"We will complete the WADA roadmap in the near future" - the Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mutko
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said it will not take long for the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) to be implemented for the restoration of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (Rusada).
"At a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the roadmap, Rusada has been given the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD (UK Anti-Doping).
The WADA roadmap has been updated in this regard, "Mutko said on Thursday.
The PM commented on the second part of WADA's roadmap for complying with the code, which describes the criteria for re-establishing Rusada and was recently published on the organisation's website.
According to Mutko, it contains nothing that could be of concern to Russia.
"Everything has been announced, everything is being implemented.
And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA in the near future, "he added.
However, one of the criteria mentioned in the list states that the Russian anti-doping authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the WADA-approved investigation by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren into alleged state-sponsored doping in Russian sport.
Referring to the matter, Mutko said: "We are conducting the investigation as our anti-doping system has admitted an error.
All the measures have been implemented.
But there were no state programs, and we're not going to admit something that doesn't exist. '
Mutko's words aligned with those of Vitaly Smirnov, the head of the independent Russian Anti-Doping Commission.
Speaking to the Russian outlet rsport at the beginning of the day, Smirnov admitted problems of the past in Russian anti-doping organizations, but then added: "We have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations.
No one intends to accept this report unconditionally, "Smirnov added.
Rusada was barred by WADA from carrying out doping checks in Russia in November 2015 in the wake of the doping scandal.
However, it has been allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti-Doping (UKAD).
After a visit to the organization's headquarters in Moscow in July, WADA Director-General Olivier Niggli declared that Rusada was moving "in the right direction" to be reinstated.
Aldi no longer sells eggs for the time being
This was communicated by the groups of companies.
It is a purely precautionary measure and no further damage to health can be assumed, the communication states.
From now on, only eggs could be supplied to Aldi, which had been shown to have been tested negative for fipronilate-containing anti-lesions.
With this, Aldi wanted to create clarity and transparency for its customers.
The start-ups that will help your business not to become the next Uber
Amy errett wanted to gauge the happiness of your employees at your e-commerce start-up, but the surveys didn't work.
Answers were often vague, unhelpful or - even worse - fraudulent.
And even if you promised anonymity, some workers did not trust the process.
"There was just never consistency and objectivity," said errett, who runs the 75-person San Francisco e-commerce Hair care company Madison Reed.
She has called people from the outside for help.
A new breed of human resources start-ups is on the rise to help companies figure out how their employees feel.
By creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement, it allows companies to conduct surveys, target specific groups and demographic groups, provide employees with anonymity and complaint hotlines, and in some cases allow whistleblowers to contact the C-Suite executives directly.
"You now have tools like Strava and Fitbit for tracking their health, but where is the Fitbit for your company?" Said Jim Barnett, co-founder and chief executive of Redwood City start-up Glint, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement.
Errett said she gained a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with Glint.
In addition to the snap surveys and surveys of certain teams, it offers a heat map of the firm that shows at a glance which units have the most complaints and which executives show low approval results - so you can drill down on why.
Companies are coming to realise that they need to stay at the forefront of workplace culture so that you don't become the next Uber embroiled in scandals since a former employee published a blog post describing an environment of harassment in which those who spoke out have been punished.
For start-ups like Glint, this desire for an overview is a lucrative business opportunity.
The global governance, regulation and compliance industry could own more than $118.7 billion in value in 2020, according to financial technology website Let's Talk Payments.
Denver, Colorado, start-up Convercent, which helps companies prevent and detect bad behavior, saw a rising interest and activity earlier this year amid the Uber case in disrepute.
Convercent has nearly 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber recently signed up as a client.
Like Glint, Convercent lets companies send tailor-made "pulse" surveys, collect confidential responses in real time, and look at the heat maps of your problem areas.
It also offers an anonymous SMS hotline that allows employees to report bad behavior.
And when the chief executive is involved, complaints go directly to the supervisory board.
"The court of public opinion has grasped the regulators," said Patrick Quinlan, the founder and managing director of Convercent.
If a company is found to be treating its employees poorly or behaving unethically, it can experience costly consequences from consumer boycotts, employee fluctuation and lawsuits, Quinlan said.
Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 locations, has deployed Convercent for more than a year to ensure employees are aware of the policies and procedures and have an easy way to reach their corporate headquarters.
Previously, if an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a phone number or email for the company headquarters, file a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously.
It was often an intimidation and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesdays general counsel, who said there was no good way to track the complaints of staff.
Now that the company uses Convercent, problems that were previously hidden by executives who sat in offices in cities or states - such as discrimination, harassment or unfair internships - can be identified and addressed more quickly.
"I can get closer to this holistic, 360-degree view into the experience with employment," said Vitrano, who heads Ruby Tuesday's Risk Management Group.
"And we protect our shareholders from employment litigation."
Companies began to take ethics, values and employee engagement more seriously in 2002 after the accounting firm Arthur Andersen collapsed due to ethical violations caused by the Enron scandal, Quinlan said.
But it took for the "social media to come to their right" that companies realized you couldn't prevent their dirty laundry from going online.
"Before using technology to monitor ethics, people used hope as a strategy," he said.
Both Glint and Convercent offer their software as a service, and charge companies with recurring fees for the use of their products.
It's a business model and an opportunity that finds the approval of venture capital investors who have supported both start-ups.
Convercent received $10 million in funding in February from firms such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, bringing the total capital to $47 million.
Glitter secured $10 million in November from Bessemer Venture Partners and brought its total funding to $60 million.
These investments come as little surprise, given the connected nature of business, culture and venture capital.
There is a growing complex of research showing that today's employees expect more from their jobs than before.
In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are only stakes.
Employees want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission.
"If people are happy to be in a company, feel that their voices belong, and that the work you do is worthwhile, then they feel more committed to making this company successful," said Nina McQueen, vice president of Global Benefits and Employee Experience at LinkedIn, both used by Glint.
Investors achieve returns when their portfolio companies are doing well. Companies are doing well when employees are engaged and engaged.
If third-party analytics tools promise to increase employee engagement and use, it's no wonder you'll find support.
The data on employee engagement according to the experts of workplace culture important.
But the data is useless if a company's administrators do not take action.
In fact, when a company asks employees for your feedback, it may have an expectation that change is on the way.
And if change does not come quickly enough, or not at all, it can breed disappointments and demotivate employees.
"If you ask for 4,000 suggestions, you have to be willing to have 4,000 conversations," said Russell Raath, president of consulting at business management firm Kotter International, who has seen companies that have relied too much on collecting data.
"Because if you don't follow staff will be wondering," Have you really heard me?
Do you care?
And who you don't care about, why should I? '
Madison Reed, who now conducts monthly employee surveys, was able to initiate action on the same day when a problem is reported on Glint, according to errett.
And after collecting feedback from frustrated employees, through the speed of decision-making and the quality of communication, she was able to reorganize several teams within the company and add a communication training to address the issues.
At Ruby Tuesday, the company is getting new insights about employees, and it hopes that in the long run, this will lead to better bonding of workers in an industry known for high sales.
"If you are not committed to creating a culture of transparency, you will lose people," Vitrano said.
'and if you lose people, you lose customers too.
And if you lose customers, then you will lose businesses.
The NCAA eliminates the two-day practices and makes a long day for the Bruins
It goes up to 11 p.m., when a lot of UCLA football players chat on one side of the team's new practice fields on campus.
Some have pulled out their jersey tops and show their backs full of sweat from the first day of training camp.
For a good part of the team, these idle minutes represent a lunch break.
Players who are enrolled at the summer courses will return to their final exams after the three-hour exercise before returning to the Wasserman Football Center the next morning at 6: 30 a.m.
"This is a real treadmill for the guys the next three days," Bruins coach Jim Mora said just before Monday turned into Tuesday.
The NCAA eliminates two-day exercises to ease the burden on players, and it has actually extended its days - at least until the final on Friday.
That's why UCLA's first three trainings should start at 7: 15 p.m. to meet the players "already packed schedules.
The compromise away from the two days is more than a day when the Bruins postponed the start of camp almost a week after last season and carried out practical exercises during the summer school for the first time during Mora's six seasons at Westwood.
They are scheduled to hold 18 exercises during August. 20 before the start of formal game preparations for their opener against Texas A & M in September.
Mora said he supported the NCAA's rule change, even if it added another point to the players "busy routes.
"We put this enormous strain on them for three or four days, and it's very challenging," Mora said.
'and they just pushed it through, they keep placking themselves up, they're great people.
I think as soon as we get to Saturday and we have more time, it's going to be really great. '
UCLA will end its practices once the camp is finished, which won't be an easy task given the clear lines of view of its fields from an adjacent parking lot and the adjacent Luskin Center, an upscale hotel that has already been pelted with footballs that cleared a protective net behind a goal post.
Bruins players are due to occupy the hotel from this weekend, but Mora acknowledged that there could be a problem once those rooms are vacant during the season.
"We will use our security," Mora said.
'that's a real problem, and it's not far-fetched to think that people rent a room there and then adjust there to record an exercise.
If you have the videotape of an exercise, it's a pretty good deal.
But we have security forces there, and we have security forces in parking lot 8.
We will do the best we can with what we have.
I am not too worried about that.
We have a plan. ""
Facebook wants to step up fact-checking in the fight against fake news
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with false messages to factual verifiers from third parties and display their results under the original post then, the world's largest online social network said on Thursday. It is one of its efforts to combat so-called fake news.
The company said in an opinion piece on its website that it will start using updated machine learning methods to detect possible misreporting and send it to factual verifiers who may be displaying results of fact-checking from the original article.
Facebook has been criticized as one of the main distribution points for so-called fake news, many of which believe it also influenced the 2016 US presidential election.
The problem has also become a major political issue in Europe, with French voters flooded with false stories in the run-up to May's presidential election, and Germany is backing a plan to punish social media networks if they fail to quickly eliminate hateful postings as they did before the September elections there.
On Thursday, Facebook said in a separate statement in German that a test of the new facts review would be launched in the US, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
"In addition to realizing what stories are being contested by factual verifiers of third parties, people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share," said Sara Su, product manager for Facebook news in a blog.
She added that Facebook will continue to test its feature on the "related article" and is working on other changes to its news feed to reduce false news.
Creating a comic novel: A castle in the history of England
In its more recent past, little Scotney Castle was featured in a squeeze music video and was a loophole for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970's and 1980's.
But Scotney has experienced 700 years of tumultuous history from his cozy seat in the Bewl River valley in Kent and has now become the inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes, a mophaired Yorkshireman with a penchant for historical documents.
"I think it's so nice to look at the handwriting of someone who has been dead for 300 years," he says wistfully.
'What a personal relationship to hold this letter in my hand. '
'a Castle in England 'spans the period from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families who lived in Scotney. Each story was illustrated by another emerging British artist - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
It's not the first book by Rhodes based on an archive: He wrote 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories' in 2014, a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project he found unexpectedly emotional.
"I just reacted to the thumb print on the side of a letter written by a double agent in the 1700's who worked for the Jacobins," he says.
"This is his thumb print!
And letters always smell of smoke, because at that time they lit a fire because of the light.
For someone who lives 300 years later, the smell has an effect, as if it were also there.
Ah, I love archives! "
For someone so smitten with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and Arts Council England and lived in a castle for almost four months (" To be honest: I've overrated my welcome a little bit ") this all seems too good to be true.
Rhodes spent his days exploring the Victorian "new" castle, sifting through the archives and studying the many treasures and curiosities of the castle, such as the mounted hyenic pots on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the ditch.
He wandered through the grounds and the ruins of the old castle and spoke to landscapers, gardeners and sometimes the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book.
Then, at night, he drank "Whiskey and began to write."
Scotney's intimate history is relatively unknown, as the National Trust only gained full access in 2006 when the last heir, Elizabeth Hussey, died.
When Rhodes arrived a decade later, employees were just beginning to take care of the archive, which he described as "hundreds of years in which aristocrats said," Oh, throw it in the attic. "
Diaries, letters from the time of the English Empire, maps that depict who owned what: "You might think that land conflicts would be boring," says Rhodes, "but there was a birch around which two families fought.
Guys, let everything go his gear! "
Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to delve into English history on a broader basis, including 'The labourer', which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 1381.
"There is a record of an uproar that occurred in the castle in 1380, in this book titled 'Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex'," says Rhodes.
"The peasant uprising started in this area and I thought an uprising was a good start.
Maybe the two are connected? "
Other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - such as' The Priest ', which tells the story of the Jesuit priest, whom the Darrell family hid for seven years during the English Reformation.
Or 'The Smuggler', depicting 18th-century smuggler Arthur Darrell, who staged his own funeral by filling a coffin with stones (a discovery made only years later when his coffin was excavated).
The Darrells are Rhodes' favourite family of Scotney: "The Lords seemed to be quite crooks, getting into debt again and again and spending money on things they couldn't afford.
Other generations of Darrell men solved their school crises by marrying rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of good-looking guys, with a talent to advertise heirs. '
After the end of his work in the castle, Rhodes is looking for other unique writing experiences
He has spent a two-week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about Elämänmäki, the site of a sanatorium from the early 20th century, which has since been reclaimed by nature.
But Scotney has a special place for him.
"I was sad to go back," he says.
It was like, "Ah, now I have to cope with the damn life again."
Campaign launched: Over 300-year-old Marienkapelle shrouded in Rhöndorf
With the unveiling of the 301-year-old Marienkapelle in Rhöndorf, the city of Bad Honnef launched its campaign to introduce a new roof brand (Thursday's roundshow) on Friday.
Until Thursday, Mayor Otto Neuhoff and his marketing team around Nelson Artz want to keep the logo and the slogan secret.
At the end of August there will be a festival on the island of Grafenwerth as the highlight of the campaign.
"Too beautiful for us.
Or?, "ask the makers of the action since yesterday on the posters at the Rhöndorfer Chapel.
"We don't really think so (of course!)," they write on their website released yesterday.
'but we're using this measure to attract your attention.
And to make it clear that something is better than it seems.
Basically, we strongly believe that we, as citizens of Bad Honnefer, are well aware of the beauty and attractiveness of our city. "
The action is about more than "just" a logo and a slogan, it continues.
"It is important to make a single promise, one that gives the city a distinctive unique selling point."
After all, it is in competition with other municipalities.
A medium five-digit amount can cost the city of Bad Honnef its new umbrella brand and the campaign.
Military reforms in Turkey - Erdogan's fear of the army
Every year at the beginning of August in Ankara the Supreme Military Council (YAS) advises on retirements and promotions in the officer corps.
So also this week.
At first glance, it is a normal procedure.
But nothing is routine in the Turkish armed forces a year after the coup attempt.
The meeting was no longer held in the General Staff building, as it used to be, but in the Prime Minister's Office.
Under the chairmanship of the Prime Minister, the five Deputy Prime Ministers and the Ministers for Defence, Home Affairs, Justice and Foreign Affairs also took part in the discussions.
Thus the civilians in the YAS were in the majority.
The government is pulling the reins in the military.
Although Chief of Staff Hulusi Akar remains in office, the commanders of the army, the air forces and the navy have been deposed.
Since the failed coup, Erdogan has fired 169 of the 326 generals and admirals.
More than 10,000 soldiers have been removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of alleged links to the movement of exiled preacher Fethullah Gülen, whom Erdogan sees as the ringleader of the coup attempt.
486 people, who are said to have been directly involved in the attempted coup, have been under negotiation in Ankara since this week.
The day after the coup, Erdogan had already described the attempted coup as a "gift of God" because it gave him the opportunity to "completely clean up" the armed forces.
But does Erdogan really have a grip on the army?
At the end of February, the Hürriyet newspaper published an article with the headline "Uneasy at Military Headquarters."
In the General Staff, there were concerns about an increasing "Islamisation" of the army, which manifested itself, among other things, in the lifting of the headscarf ban for female soldiers, the newspaper wrote.
The great cleansing of the army and the security forces, in any case, continues.
In mid-July, Erdogan had another 7395 civil servants fired by decree, including 2303 police officers and 546 soldiers.
In doing so, it seemed that Erdogan had tamed the military.
The generals used to be regarded as the actual masters of the country.
They putted three times, citing their role as guardians of the secular state order.
After his election victory in 2002, Erdogan pushed back the power of the military step by step, not least citing the European Union's reform agenda.
Former officers say Erdogan is deliberately driving an Islamization of the armed forces.
In the magazine "Vocal Europe," an unnamed officer, who sought asylum after the attempted coup for fear of persecution abroad, warned that the Turkish army would be "full of extremists and Salafists" in a few years.
If that is true, such a development could not leave NATO cold.
In any case, following the purges, there are doubts in the Alliance about the Turkish army's readiness to intervene.
The management structures and operational capabilities are "weakened," say Nato diplomats.
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
There will be a new U.S. immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card, President Donald Trump said, quoted by the media.
It aims to reduce legal immigrants to 50,000 per year, tighter rules on obtaining visas for a temporary work permit and restrictions on family-oriented visas.
The new rules are proposed by the Republicans and supported by the president.
The bill is to be discussed in the two chambers of Congress.
"This bill will reduce poverty, raise wages and save billions of dollars for taxpayers, and will do so by changing the way citizens from other countries" green cards are spent. "
The law will prevent chain migration and replace the current system.
This new application procedure will benefit candidates who speak English, who have the financial means to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy, "Trump said, quoted by the American media.
Ministry wants to refurbish track for racing shuttle
Time and again in the past few months there have been arguments about the future of the racing steep shuttle - now it should be done very quickly.
Before the end of the year, the marooned route on which the tourist railway runs is to be built.
In order to secure the future of the race steep shuttle in the long term, construction work on the track is scheduled to begin later this year, according to the Ministry of Transport.
"With the decision to continue ordering and refurbishing the Ilmenau-Rennsteig route, the country is committing itself to this important link, especially for tourism," stated Transport Secretary Klaus Sühl on Friday in Erfurt.
He estimated the cost of repairing the route at about 2.5 million euros.
Of that total, the country takes over 75 percent.
The contract, on the basis of which the shuttle will continue to be ordered by the country, is currently being finalised, said Sühl.
The Ministry and the Südthüringen Bahn as operator are already in agreement on the technical details.
"This means that the roadmap, the vehicles used and the quality standards have been negotiated," said Sühl.
The planned contract between the ministry and the railway company was concluded for a period of eleven years.
This means that the race platform shuttle should be ordered on a regular basis on December 2017.
The race platform shuttle is a rail link between Ilmenau and Rennsteig train stations, which is particularly popular with tourists.
In recent months, a pilot operation had tested whether the route would be used by a sufficient number of people to re-order it regularly in the future.
The track is also highly dilapidated in parts.
The rise of sex robots is real, and we should be worried
Just when you thought it can't get even crazier in 2017, comes a new report on technological developments in the field of sex robots.
Yes, indeed.
Sex robots are a big deal at the moment.
Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (Foundation for Responsible Robotics) (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years.
According to Noel Sharkey, professor emeritus of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of FRR, we need to start taking their rise seriously.
Customers can choose the eye color of the robot, its shape of the nipple and the type of fingernail.
"People make fun of them, but the companies deliver a lot of it, and we'll get to see them a lot more often," Mr Sharkey said at the release of his new report.
Modern sex dolls have evolved from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicon skin that feels warm - with deliberately human reactions achieved through artificial intelligence.
The user can also "customize" his robot according to his beliefs, selecting everything from the eye color of the robot to the shape of the nipples to the type or color of his fingernails.
But it becomes even more disturbing, as many robots own the "personalities" that would make a Stepford woman look progressive.
Modern sex dolls have evolved into robots with a silicon skin.
The RealBotix robot, for example, allows its users to adapt their robots to the characteristics they find appealing, such as shyness.
And then there are the Roxxxy Gold sex robots developed by True Companion with pre-programmed personalities such as "Frigid Farrah," which conveys the impression of shyness and "Wild Wendy" with an "adventurous" personality.
"Roxxxy Gold has a personality that is adapted to your personality as well as possible," True Companion's website enthuses.
So she likes what you like, and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc.
She also has her moods during the day - just like real people!
She can be tired, fixated on conversation or she can be "in the mood"! "
There are many worrying aspects to this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the subservient feminine traits, the allusions to rape when taking a step on Frigid (meaning here: Reluctant) Farrah, worry one the most.
On his website, True Companion compared Roxxxy to a vibrator, but for men.
"If women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can't men have Roxxxy?" The website reads.
However, these sex robots are not just a fetish or just another sex toy.
Their emergence and increasing sophistication point to something darker and deeper in our culture, to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with submission as an optional encore.
Most men, of course, will not hold sex robots, and while the FRR notes their rising popularity, they remain on the fringes of consumer culture for the time being.
But what seeps out of the fringes can be very instructive in terms of the spirit of the time in which we live.
And many people are not strange or insulting until the free market gives them permission to do so.
There is a certain overlap that these sophisticated sex robots are emerging at a time when women's rights are under threat around the world, when there is a president in the White House who has boasted of sexually assaulting women.
The most chilling aspect of the TV series' The Handmaid's Tale '(' The Report of the Magd ') is not the graphic images, the muffled bodies and the outcast eyes, but how realistic this vision is.
The Republic of Gilead is a leap, but at the moment this does not feel like a big leap.
The goal behind these sex robots is to make a physical resemblance to actual women as realistic as technically possible (albeit with porn star proportions).
Their builders want them to feel human, that they imitate the movement of a real body.
But, in a nutshell, when it comes to their "personalities," the robots do not represent real women.
They can't separate from their companion or just leave.
They have no mediation or a background story, nothing that hints at independence or anything that might interfere with the fantasy of total submission.
In other words, they are happy slaves.
Or to put it in the phrase of 2017: Maids
Trump's great achievement?
He makes Mitt Romney the epitome of common sense
It has become a truism of the Trump era that the political divisions that have polarized the US electorate have also divided small-scale families.
Around Christmas and Thanksgiving, there were newspapers in the US offering advice on how to deal with the horror of Trump-choosing relatives.
We are all supposedly trying to make our filter bubbles burst.
Less noticed has been the power of Trump to bring families together.
I mention this because my cousin, a left-wing poet who lives in Chicago and has long worked with the Republicans in our family, visited me in New York this week.
She reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.
With Trump in the White House, everyone she knows, including the Republican kinship she had fought with for decades because of politics, is suddenly and oddly on the same page.
With regard to the dining table, this is certainly a good thing, but it strikes me in a wider context that this also entails considerable risks.
The left has been strengthened by Trump, but the disfiguring effect of his presidency has the strength to push us all to the right.
When we talk about "normalization" and Trump, we refer to the creepy possibility that his kittens will one day no longer repel us.
There is, however, an even more frightening long-term scenario in which Trump "normalizes" right-wing Republicans who suddenly appear as the epitome of reasonableness when compared to his standards.
I find myself today afflicted by an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's hilarious version of the madman - the dog on the car roof, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew what his tax return looked like) - both of which, compared to Trump, in fact, come across as very mild offenses.
If Trump goes, the next Republican candidate only needs to be mentally healthy to qualify as an immeasurable improvement.
When my cousin was in town, we took our kids to the carousel in Central Park, the largest of the carousels in the New York parking department, and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don't need caffeine.
The horses are enormous, the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all the clowns are crisp and the animals twist to look over their own shoulders full of fear - extremely sinister and the climbing music conveys this in a strange way.
Disappoint so many clichés of a city: The views of tall buildings are getting old, the skylines are becoming too familiar to offer much excitement, and the reality of the city doesn't do justice to the dream.
Thirty-five years later, and I'm still not quite over the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is indeed not a Swiss cottage - the themed pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage does not count - but a big roundabout in north London.
The Central Park carousel, however, is still a strangely magical experience, as here two two-year-olds, an 11-year-old and two women in their 40's can go on it and all have a great time.
If I could have evaluated the carousel, I would have given him the full score, but luckily nobody asked for it.
On the other hand, in a department store this week, I was forced to rate my "experience" with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could pull through my credit card.
In the coffee house on the corner of my street it's the same, plus the option to balance the rating with a 15% tip - this to buy something over the counter.
This not only leads to a slowdown in what should actually be a neutral exchange, but also puts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where none is required.
The poor woman in the department store stood apologetically grinning while I tired of the experience of handing her my credit card with five stars.
Oscar Pistorius with chest pain moved from prison to hospital
Pistorius has left prison for the second time for a hospital visit.
Last year, he was taken to hospital for treatment of cuts to his wrists, which, according to prison authorities, he suffered after a fall in his cell.
Pistorius was convicted of murder after an appeal by prosecutors against an initial manslaughter sentence.
He killed Steenkamp in the early hours of Valentine's Day in 2013, shooting her several times through a door of the toilet cubicle at his home in Pretoria.
Pistorius claimed that he thought his girlfriend was a nightly intruder hiding in the cabin.
The prosecutors have announced their intention to appeal this time against Pistorius' six-year prison sentence, which they say is too lenient.
The National Law Enforcement Agency said it would appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa and the appeal could be heard this year.
Pistorius runs the risk of his sentence being increased to 15 years if prosecutors are successful.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
As farmer Arnold finds a strange egg
The fourth-graders were the last of the Blumberg schools to be released on holiday and to secondary schools.
Three of the students will go to high school, four to secondary school.
School principal Angelika Sitte welcomed the parents and representatives of the public at the Bürgerhaus Biesental in Epfenhofen on Tuesday evening.
As a symbol of dismissal, the 29 students of the four classes, led by Sophia Schumacher and Regine Meder, chose a young eagle, which grows up in the chicken yard but is then released to freedom.
To this the cheerful band performed a musical titled "The eagle in the chicken farm."
Farmer Arnold found a strange egg, and had it incubated by his chickens.
Instead of a chicken pie, a little eagle came out.
But the hope of making a chicken out of him was dashed, and the eagle spread out its wings on a high mountain and disappeared.
After that, classes three and four showed a chicken dance in the study of Yvonne Frank.
The hens danced with the young gockles that cylinders wore to make the bet.
The eagle stood for integration, said school principal Angelika Sitte.
The young animal is different from the other young animals (chicks), but belongs to them.
But he will never be like a chicken.
His purpose was to be free.
She wished every fourth-grader that he felt accepted in his new school.
This was followed by a word of thanks to the colleagues, the former headmaster Michael Müller, who repeatedly jumps into teaching difficulties, and the parents' representatives.
The kissing season is now over, explained class teacher Sophia Schumacher.
She is very reluctant to release her students after two years of teaching, because it was a really great time.
In the end, she was able to rely on the fourth-graders.
At the end, all students performed a song of summer time and holiday time.
Great joy broke out among the children.
Eight first graders have already been registered for the new school year.
Two Bulgarians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
Two Bulgarians were imprisoned for illegal camping in Greece, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, quoted by television, reported.
On the morning of August 1, a group of people illegally camping in Sithonia, including the two Bulgarians, was arrested by the police.
On the same day they were released while an investigation is currently ongoing.
The Foreign Ministry told bTV that the Bulgarians were later released.
The Greek authorities have tightened control over free camping and are imposing substantial fines on anyone found to stay in a place not intended for this purpose.
Checks will continue throughout the season.
The ministry said that the court may impose a fine.
Software update for diesel vehicles: What those affected need to know now
How exactly does the software update take place?
Do diesel drivers have to take part in the action?
The most important questions and answers at a glance.
At the diesel summit, BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW Group offered software updates for a total of around 5.3 million cars.
They are intended to improve the exhaust behaviour of cars in the emission classes Euro 5 and partly Euro 6.
Euro 4 diesel or worse are exempt.
Anja Smetanin of the ACE Auto Club Europa gives his opinion:
Is the new action mandatory?
No, the software updates are voluntary.
"The mandatory updates previously apply only to the vehicles that have cheating software," says Anja Smetanin.
The Federal Motor Transport Authority (KBA) has ordered their retrofitting.
How and from when will customers be informed about updates?
The manufacturers have announced a swift implementation in the next few months, but have not yet given an exact date.
Daimler has indicated that it will write to each person concerned.
If an inspection is due anyway, it will be done within its framework.
How long will the overall changeover take?
"It's hard to say," says Smetanin.
This depends on the commitment of the manufacturers as well as the political pressure.
"Because we have seen that car manufacturers are not yet acting voluntarily on the subject of the environment."
How long should the update take?
The conversion itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop.
It might be more time-consuming to get an appointment.
What do motorists who do not drive a car from BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW Group do?
The ACE advises to wait.
Presumably foreign manufacturers would follow suit, according to Smetanin.
Is there now a risk of a massive drop in the price of Euro 4 cars?
The ACE fears that.
But precisely in those regions where driving bans are threatened.
In rural areas, there has been no loss of value for older diesels so far.
The ACE advises to wait with a sale yet.
Ll Cool J receives Kennedy Center award
The Kennedy Awards gala is one of the most glamorous events in Washington.
The first awards ceremony under President Trump promises to become political.
One of the prize winners doesn't want to come - in protest.
Ll Cool J (49) is the first rapper to receive one of the prestigious Kennedy Center's coveted awards.
As the cultural institution announced on Thursday, this year's honorees include singer Gloria Estefan (59), Lionel Richie (68), as well as choreographer Carmen de Lavallade (86) and TV producer Norman Lear (95).
The awards will be presented in early December.
Traditionally, US President Donald Trump will hold a reception and attend the ceremony along with his wife Melania.
For this reason, the award-winner Lear, who has become famous with progressive TV series, has already announced that he will refrain from attending the gala.
To the New York Times, he said: "This presidency has chosen to completely neglect the arts and human rights - to deprive them of even the means - and that weighs on me."
The 59-year-old Estefan insisted she would use the conversation with Trump to clarify her view.
The Kennedy Center, named after former President John F. Kennedy, is the largest cultural institution in the US capital.
Previous winners of the award include Meryl Streep, Aretha Franklin, Robert De Niro, George Lucas, Tom Hanks and Sting.
We make the city worth living
Roland Wacker, Haslach's city builder, is retiring in the coming year.
The position has already been advertised, but suitable candidates are rare.
Wacker has been a city builder for 31 years.
And the work is still great fun for him, as he conveys in the press conference.
He reports on varied but also demanding tasks awaiting his successor.
At the same time, he is surprised that no application has met the requirements profile so far.
The city is looking for an architect or civil engineer at the earliest opportunity.
Thus - while respecting the regular notice periods - there should still be enough time for an induction.
As Haslach acts as a sub-contracting authority for the administrative community, the applicant has to present the corresponding accounts.
Because the city wants to keep this function in any case.
If they were no longer able to fill them, the citizens would have to go to Offenburg for advice.
But proximity to the city and to the city itself is important, says Wacker, who reports a good working atmosphere as well as good mood between the authority and citizens.
In more than 30 years in office, a number of important projects have accumulated, which Wacker looks back on with pride.
"We make the city worth living," he is sure about the building office and its employees.
But a variety of projects will also be on the agenda in the future: The transformation of the former Hukla area and the Niederhofenparkplatz, for example, have been initiated.
The Kinzigbrücke between Bollenbach and Steinach is being renovated, and the refurbishment of the stadium is still an issue.
The latter alone will cost around 1.5 million euros, "if we get it right," estimates Wacker.
"All in all, great tasks await my successor.
Working here is fun. "
There is a lot of room for manoeuvre for a city builder.
With Haslach's own farm and nursery can be reacted to many things quite flexibly.
"You can move a lot," says Wacker, and the design of the green spaces is often praised by citizens and visitors.
Since the old town is listed as an ensemble, it is important to "keep an eye on what fits in" when new buildings are approved, emphasizes the outgoing city builder.
In any case, the city builder bears a great deal of responsibility.
He is a builder, "in the end everything here runs over my table."
He can count on long-term employees for support and coordination: Markus Neumaier (building) has been involved for ten years, Manfred Schöner (civil engineering) for 15 years.
Wacker also hopes that his successor will stay for a long time: "We are looking for someone who really identifies with the position and wants to stay."
Continuity is not only important for a good working atmosphere, but also for the further development of the city.
According to information provided by the City of Haslach, anyone wishing to inherit Roland Wacker should have completed their degree as a graduate engineer or bachelor with a specialist in architecture and should have good expertise in the areas of planning and construction law.
The Municipal Construction Office is responsible for civil engineering, planning, property acquisition, management of the municipal properties, Municipal Works Court with Bauhof and Stadtgärtnerei, and Lower Building Law Authority including the Protection of Monuments.
Bicycle thrown on lines: Southern railway line blocked
According to police, the previously unknown perpetrators had thrown the blue bicycle from the railway track crossing in the area of Leobener Strasse (B116) onto the lines.
These were so badly damaged that the approaching freight train had to be stopped.
Investigators are going out from two male perpetrators and have been looking for them since the night hours.
Near the crime scene, a rose-colored scooter and a bicycle rider had been observed by witnesses.
"This goes far beyond a mouse stroke," ÖBB spokesman Christoph Posch told the APA.
The perpetrator or perpetrators would have put themselves in great danger and also endangered train traffic.
In addition to the damage to the locomotive and the plant, as well as the delay minutes and the cost of rail replacement traffic, the perpetrators could also be faced by rail customers.
The overall result was a "significant" sum, the spokesman said.
The damage was repaired on Friday afternoon, and rail traffic on the southern railway line could be operated without any obstructions.
Almost ten passenger trains were cancelled on Friday morning, two of which concerned long-distance transport.
Freight trains were not cancelled, but they were delayed.
According to ÖBB spokesman Christoph Posch, around 200 metres of overhead lines had to be replaced.
Insulators and masts were also damaged.
Red meat, dairy products and chocolate could help alleviate IBD (inflammatory bowel disease)
Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.
But a new study claims exactly the opposite: A diet rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products could alleviate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel disease.
The incurable condition, which affects around 1.3 million in the US and 300,000 in Britain, causes stomach cramps and bloating, recurrent or bloody diarrhea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
While sufferers are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to relieve their symptoms, researchers at Washington University found that the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins helps to develop immune cells that promote a tolerant gut.
The senior researcher, Dr Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells patrol in the gut to ensure that harmful microbes hiding in food do not enter the body.
Cells that are capable of triggering inflammation are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues.
If the balance tends too far towards inflammation, an inflammatory bowel disease can result from it.
In experiments, it has been found that a type of tolerance-promoting immune cell occurs in mice that carry a particular bacterium in their bowels.
And the bacterium requires tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells.
Professor Colonna said: 'We have established a link between a species of bacteria - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the gut microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.
The more tryptophan the mice had in their food, the more they had of these immune cells. '
He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and a diet rich in tryptophan promotes more tolerant, less inflammatory intestines, when the same system also works in humans.
Postdoctoral researcher Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan examined a type of immune cell that promotes tolerance when she found that a group of study mice had such cells, but another group of the same tribe, which had been housed separately, did not have this.
She suspected that the difference had to do with the mice's gut microbiomes - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi that normally live in the gastrointestinal tract.
The mice's intestines were DNA sequenced and six species of bacteria were found that were present in the mice with the immune cells but were missing in the mice without them.
Mice were raised in a sterile environment so they lacked an intestinal microbiome and they did not develop this type of immune cells, and they were given the L. reuteri and the immune cells originated.
To understand how the bacteria affected the immune system, the researchers let L. reuteri grow in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - to immature immune cells isolated from the mice.
The immune cells developed into the cells that promote tolerance.
When the active component was purified from the liquid, it proved to be a by-product of tryptophan metabolism, known as idol-3 lactic acid.
When the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the mice's feed, the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent, but when tryptophantic levels were halved, the number of cells dropped by half.
Dr Cervantes-Barragan explained that humans have the same tolerance-promoting cells as mice, and that most of us protect L. reuteri in our gastrointestinal tracts.
It is not known whether tryptophan by-products from L. reuteri develop the cells in humans in the same way as in mice, but defects in genes related to tryptophan have been found in people with inflammatory bowel disease.
She said: "The development of these cells is probably something we would like to promote as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the gut.
Potentially, high tryptopical levels in the presence of L. reuteri can lead to an expansion of this population. "
Jose Mourinho believes Manchester United have committed a "genius" with Nemanja Matic
At Manchester United have signed a "genius" with Nemanja Matic, Jose Mourinho believes, after the midfielder made his debut against Sampdoria on Wednesday night.
Chelsea's £40 million signing began with a 2-1 victory in Dublin, the last pre-season game before the UEFA Super Cup begins against Real Madrid on Tuesday, and impressed in the keeper role as the likes of Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira marched forward at will.
Matic, however, had been ruled out of the Blues' preparatory Asia tour and managed only 45 minutes, which Mourinho admitted he needed to improve before the start of the Premier League season.
"He needs time, but his experience, intelligence, a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football," Mourinho said.
'we'll help him be ready sooner than later. '
In addition to Matic, Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku also starred at the Aviva Stadium as Mourinho shaped his starting XI for the start of the season.
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho still wanted three more new commitments, but he insisted the club had already done a "fantastic job" of fulfilling three of its four priority new commitments.
"To get three out of four, for that I thank the club," he added.
'i'll be happier if they get four out of four for me, but they've gone to great lengths. '
Boeing "paints" Dreamliners into the sky
The US aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the silhouette of a dreamliner into the sky.
The pilots flew from Seattle in the US state of Washington, but the drawing began in Marquette in the US state of Michigan and retreated in the form of a Dreamliner over the US, which is several thousand kilometers.
The action lasted 18 hours and a minute.
On the radar screens was to be the shape of a dreamliner.
This was an endurance test for new engines.
Boeing had already made such advertisements before.
So the number "787" and the Boeing logo were painted into the sky.
New blow for Martin Schulz - Hanover, we have a problem
How the wind turns: When Sigmar Gabriel was still head of the SPD, social-democratic prime ministers always looked to Berlin with some concern before the elections.
Just not a barrage from the party headquarters, just no headwind from the federal government - that was the main wish of the campaigners.
Since Martin Schulz led the party, this has fundamentally changed.
Since then, the employees of the Willy-Brandt-Haus have watched with growing horror the events in the SPD-governed state capitals.
What Schulz got from there since the beginning of the year would not even be described with headwinds.
They were lows.
One after the other.
After the surprising end of the red-green majority in Lower Saxony, the CDU sees a general signal against coalitions of the SPD and the Greens.
"This shows once again: Red-green simply cannot govern reliably," CDU General Secretary Peter Tauber told the Editorial Network Germany (RND).
The surprise resignation of a Green MEP has plunged the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) into a serious crisis.
Five months before the election, his red-green coalition lost its one-vote majority to the opposition from the CDU and the FDP.
Greens chief executive Michael Kellner has called on breakaway Lower Saxony Greens MP Elke Twesten to return her mandate.
The move to the CDU is a clear distortion of the will of the electorate.
Elke Twesten must immediately give back her mandate, "the Green Party's federal chief executive and campaign manager told the Editorial Network Germany (RND).
"All this must not be true," sighs one SPD campaigner as the new obscure message reaches the party headquarters on Friday morning.
Stephan Weil, SPD Prime Minister of Lower Saxony, left the CDU without a majority of his own government after the green MEP Elke Twesten came to power.
It is the preliminary culmination of a whole series of large and small crises in SPD state federations.
And no one knows what's next.
The misery began with the unexpectedly clear defeat in the Saarland election in March.
A blue eye, nothing more, the comrades calmed down.
After the state elections in Schleswig-Holstein and North Rhine-Westphalia, everything will be different.
That's what it got - and it got much worse.
The defeat in Kiel plunged the SPD into turmoil, and the party was flummoxed by the collapse of Dusseldorf.
The comrades painstakingly rose up again in the weeks afterwards.
Then, when they had just plucked up new courage, the G-20 summit came from Hamburg.
And with him came the next low blow.
Mayor Olaf Scholz, the last strong SPD national chief, lost his Nimbus that weekend because he was sitting in the Elbphilharmonie while his city burned.
And because in the crisis communication after that he did pretty much everything wrong that you can do wrong.
Since then, Scholz has been fighting for his political survival.
So now also Stephan Weil.
Because of the Volkswagen exhaust gas affair and its role on the Supervisory Board, the Lower Saxony Prime Minister has been under criticism for a long time.
Miese survey values were added.
In spite of this, or perhaps because of it, Weil tried to focus more and more on the federal government in the past weeks.
The desire of the former mayor of Hanover to extend his power in Berlin was also not hidden from comrades in the vicinity of Martin Schulz.
They let him go, because they promised Weil a stabilization of the party.
Now the exact opposite could happen.
Weil is not really to blame for the intra-party quarrel of the Lower Saxony Greens.
And Schulz certainly not.
For the time being, the comrades therefore try to keep their own ranks closed.
Her anger is directed at the Greens, and here especially at the breakaway parliamentarian twesten.
"It is intolerable and anti-democratic how Ms Twesten puts her own career interests above the interests of everyone else," says Matthias Miersch, head of the party leftists in the SPD parliamentary group, the editorial network Germany (RND).
Mrs Twesten was elected to Parliament not because of her person as a direct candidate, but through the Land list of the Lower Saxony Greens, the Lower Saxony Member continued.
The logical consequence would be for it to give back its mandate.
Thomas Oppermann, head of the SPD parliamentary group, laments an "undemocratic manoeuvre."
"The will to vote four years ago was clear: The people made Stephan Weil prime minister," Oppermann, who leads the Lower Saxony SPD as the top candidate in the federal election, tells the RND.
"Now the personal career giving of a future CDU MP is distorting the election result," Oppermann further said.
He called for the backgrounds to be clarified.
I want to know whether there has been more or whether there have been more far-reaching commitments from the CDU in Lower Saxony.
Funding for the town centre III
Those who want to rehabilitate their old house will soon be able to get support from the country.
Mayor Albert Schindler and three representatives of STEG Urban Development informed about this in Empfingen on Wednesday.
At the beginning of the briefing, Schindler gave a review of what had happened so far.
There have been refurbishment areas in Empfingen since 1991.
At that time, in the refurbishment area I from 1991 to 2004, the state of Baden-Württemberg took over two thirds of the funding.
In the refurbishment area II from 2005 to 2016, the subsidy was still at 60 percent.
For Schindler, the refurbishments so far are a "success project" - after all, it is important to promote internal development as well, and not only to develop new building areas.
On 4 April the head of the Karlsruhe government was informed that there would be a refurbishment area III.
The funding amounts to EUR 833 333, of which EUR 500 000 would come from the Land, the rest from the municipality of Empfingen.
How is a refurbishment area created?
According to Schindler, one will investigate where the "really old" houses are.
It also played a role, however, whether there was any interest at all in the planned area to be remedied.
If necessary, the territorial limits could then shift again.
The STEG represented Martin Keller, Gaby Pietzschmann and Sarah Gotzel on Wednesday evening.
Keller presented the contents of the federal-state program "Social City," in the framework of which the refurbishments would then be carried out.
The core of the programme is the revitalization of inner cities, the improvement of living and working conditions and the maintenance and expansion of infrastructure.
The measures would be carried out on an objective basis, that is, per plot of land.
The refurbishment area would then be set as a statute.
The grant period runs from 1 January 2017 until 30 April 2026.
Until September of this year, however, the inventory would be carried out, during which the participants in the remediation area would receive a questionnaire to fill in.
As far as possible, the statutes should be adopted in November or December, so that the renovations can begin next year.
Pietzschmann then explained that each municipality had to carry out the said preliminary examinations.
It was a matter of evaluating the problems of urban planning and deciding when to rehabilitate and to what extent.
A refurbishment note would then be entered in the land register for the respective plot of land.
She promised that Pietzschmann would come back to her senses and get an idea of the situation herself.
Gotzel emphasized that a key success factor for the project was the participation of the participants.
That is why there will be questionnaires that will be sent to the citizens by post in the coming weeks and can be completed by the end of the summer holidays.
The yellow questionnaire is the "building and land questionnaire," which deals, among other things, with the building condition and the renovation plans.
In the grey questionnaire, the "household and housing form," information on the size, distribution and inhabitants of a living room can be provided.
The blue "operating arc" can only be filled in if business premises are operated in the building.
However, it should be noted, Gotzel pointed out, that a completed questionnaire is not at the same time an application for funding.
In addition, new construction measures are not eligible.
Schindler also emphasized that the distribution of funds works according to the "first come, first served" principle.
It is not possible to "reserve" any funds for later.
At the end, photos of the project "Location II" were shown, in order to make a restoration "tasty."
British inventor sets himself a microchip to get into the house and car with a hand movement
A British inventor is the first in the country to be fitted with a microchip so he can open his front door, enter his office and even start his car with a movement of his hand.
Steven Northam, 33, had the tiny chip implanted between his thumb and forefinger and now offers the service to companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives using technology through his company BioTeq.
He has teamed up with Dr Geoff Watson, an advisory anaesthetist at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester, Hants, to ensure the implant procedure is performed to medical standard.
The technology resembles a cats and dogs implanted microchip and takes only 30 seconds.
Mr Northam's company also wants to change the locks on houses and cars so that they are compatible with the chip, all for an extra £300 per lock.
The married father of one has now fitted both at home and in his BMW Z4 technology, which starts when his hand is at the wheel.
White House advertising costs cost the taxpayer thousands
The White House's decision to fly a naval helicopter to the South Lawn for an event highlighting American manufacturing last month cost taxpayers up to $24,000, according to the military's figures, which were left to TIME magazine.
The green-and-white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One when the president is on board, was the centerpiece of the event on July 17 at the White House with American building programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and senior White House officials took a tour of products from all 50 states.
The helicopter, made in Connecticut, was issued next to a yacht from Maine, a fire truck from Wisconsin and a forklift truck from Mississippi.
The White House military office requested the presence of the helicopter in a fragmentary order, or Frago, barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn, according to records from the Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for operating the helicopter.
"I just wanted you to be aware of this because it is such an unusual event with high visibility," the commander of HMX-1 wrote on the eve of the event to his supervisor, the deputy naval commander for aviation.
The news indicated that the helicopter arrived on the South Lawn for the event at 3 p.m. on July 17 at around 7 a.m., and remained until the lawn was cleared between 6: 00 p.m. and 9: 00 p.m. that evening.
The note adds that if the departure from the White House were to be delayed, a second crew would be needed for the return flight due to the limitation of service hours.
The original flight crew was with the helicopter during the event, while the unit's security staff stayed with the aircraft during the time on the ground.
It was not clear from the records made available to TIME whether a second flight crew was ultimately required.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using state property for political purposes.
Records indicate that HMX-1 asked if the event could violate the provision.
"One question we asked was whether it was a violation of the Hatch Act and we were informed that this was not the case," the commander wrote.
"Sounds like you're locked," the deputy commander replied.
The "Made in America" event was designated by the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act.
But official events also have political overtones.
At the event, the president gave a push for health care reform, which was underway in the Senate, and he touted efforts to curb government regulations.
The use of the aircraft, known as Marine One or Air Force One, for politically advantageous purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.
Presidents are required to use them for the trip.
But to request their use only for a photo operation is unusual.
Trump conducted an investigation in February when the presidential plane operated taxi services against the backdrop of his first campaign rally in Melbourne, Florida, and his Twitter account is full of notifications complaining about the use of the presidential aircraft by his predecessor.
"The White House is excited about the show" Made In America "- which features products from all 50 states made by American workers using American materials," said White House deputy press secretary Lindsay Walters.
HMX-1 crews frequently carry out training flights in the Washington area and the South Lawn to oust the US president at the White House with precise centimetre rates.
When Trump was at the G20 summit in Germany in early July, HMX-1 carried out 58 practice landings at the White House.
The flight for the "Made in America" event counted in the flight crew's training needs for the month, an official said.
Helicopter units flew an additional 11 hours that day for "non-presidential support missions."
The White House said taxpayers did not take over the burden for any of the other props presented at the event.
A spokesman for Sikorsky said the company had not been involved in issuing the helicopter on the South Lawn.
HMX-1 does not maintain budget records for presidential flights, and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event.
However, according to US Department of Defense hourly rates for the 2017 fiscal year, the DoD reimbursement rate for the VH-3D is $24,380 per flight hour.
Unit records record the plane's flight time as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Facility in Quantico in Virginia.
The White House argues that the actual cost of operating the helicopter is well below this rate.
"Setting the cost to taxpayers on the basis of estimates for reimbursement rates is highly misleading," Walters said.
'These estimates include personnel, maintenance and many other hidden costs included in the annual funds. '
According to a 2015 RAND study, the reimbursement rates for DoD do not include staff costs, but take into account the cost of fuel, maintenance and contracting.
At the time, the former White House press secretary, Sean Spicer, defended the helicopter's use for the event.
"The idea is to present things this week that are made in America," Spicer said.
'and I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud that they contribute to our national security, and I assume that hundreds, if not thousands, of people depend on it.
And I think, like most Americans, we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked tirelessly.
It is, of course, appropriate to underline that. "
It was not clear whether Trump interacted with the helicopter as he entered his tour of the South Lawn for the event, but he sat in the driver's seat of a firefighter car.
At the White House, Trump spoke to representatives of Sikorsky and joked with the media about his own fleet of corporate products.
"I know Sikorsky very well," the president said, "I have three of them."
TC BW Neuss facing tricky task
The leader of the second Bundesliga tennis will take part in the table race suchsdorfer SV.
The TC Blau-Weiss Neuss will start tomorrow at 11: 00 a.m. in Kiel at the Suchsdorfer SV table final.
Despite still having a flawless record after five matches, the front-runner of the Second Tennis Bundesliga has maintained a sense of reality.
Team leader Marius Zay has respect for his opponent.
"This is a compact team that always plays in a very similar formation.
Especially on the back positions I think the team is very good. "
The imports from the far north are the main source of class and stability in the Suchsdorfer SV.
"Their Danes and Finns can even point to stakes in the Davis Cup.
And they are also strong in doubles, "says Zay, looking at Harri Heliovaara (Finland), Andre Göransson (Sweden), Sören and Esben Olesen, Martin Pedersen as well as Andreas Bjerrehus (all Denmark).
"As always, this will be difficult for us.
You also need a good dose of luck. "
The team of nine for the trip to the far north is practical.
His debut for blue-white could give Maxime Janvier.
If the Frenchman, who is currently still active at the Challenger tournament in the Italian Biella, does not make it to the Bundesliga match, Zdenek Kolar (Czech Republic), who is playing at the tournament in Liberec, will make his first bet this season.
The previously undefeated Chilean Hans Podlipnik-Castillo was still on the ball with Belarusian Andrei Vasilevski at the ATP tournament in Kitzbühel yesterday.
He should be present in Kiel, however, as well as Botic Van de Zandschulp, Niels Lootsma (both Netherlands) and Belgian Julien Cagnina.
After his two victories last Sunday against the club at the Alster, Máté Valkusz could also move into the team again.
If it is not enough for the 18-year-old Hungarian, who was still number one in the junior world rankings in January 2016, someone from the coaching staff around Marius Zay fills up the squad.
How America can harm OMV
Donald Trump was not really happy when he signed the law to tighten sanctions against Russia Wednesday evening.
"In its haste to enact the law," Congress wrapped up a few "unconstitutional regulations," he etched.
The reaction from Moscow was also as sharp as expected, and even Brussels bragged about the US push.
After all, the draft provides for punishing European companies that help the Russians build gas pipelines into the EU.
Since then, investors in the domestic OMV, which, together with other European companies, is co-financing the construction of the Russian Baltic pipeline, Nord Stream 2, have been worried.
The threat is enormous.
Nevertheless, it was too early to assess the consequences, according to the official statement of the oil company.
In fact, Donald Trump himself would still have to bring the sanctions to life by executive order.
Twelve weapons are his choice.
"The press" has looked at which the corporation could repel and which could really hurt it.
Narcos season 3 trailer: Without Pablo Escobar, the Cali Cartel will be the focal point in Netflix's hit series
Despite the second season of Narcos, which revealed Pablo Escobars Killer, the Netflix series is far from over.
Season three and four have already been confirmed by the streaming service, the first of which received its first trailer and featured the show's latest villains.
With the third season, the DEA has turned its attention to the richest drug trafficking organisation in the world: The Cali cartel.
Led by four powerful sponsors, they operate "like a Fortune 500 company" only with more government bribes and violent actions.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) is the leader of the cartel, Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) is her head, Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) commands the Mexican compound, and Chepe Santacruz Londono (Pepe Rapazote) is located in New York.
In the newly released trailer, Pedro Pascal returns as Javier Peña, the type who invites American and Colombian law enforcement agencies to support the war on drugs.
Other new actors include Matias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishe and Arturo Castro.
The third season of Narcos will begin on September 1.
Roll back: The city hires 46 kitchen assistants
The city organizes the Kita lunch table itself again.
With fixed contact for the children and an assignment to the team.
In the municipal day care centers, the clock is turned back.
On September 1, the city of Krefeld will take over the food supply in the municipal children's day care facilities (Kitas) on its own.
For Sonja Pommeranz, Deputy Head of Youth Aid, this is good news: "We were all very pleased."
Cooking continues to be done away from home: A caterer takes on this task and delivers freshly cooked chilled biscuits.
The city operates 46 day care centres in the Krefeld area, and in 44 the children get a hot meal at lunchtime.
In the past year of kittens, 2800 children each sat at the tables, and demand is growing steadily.
"In the meantime, not only children who are cared for 45 hours per week are eating lunch at the Kita," explains Pomeranz.
"The offer is also valid in the 35-hour care if children stay until 2 p.m."
Forty-six part-time workers will have kitchen service from 1 September: They will warm up the delivered meals, complement them with salad, raw food and fruit, portion the meal individually, eat out, clean and rinse the kitchen.
"The employees are firmly assigned to a kita," says Pomeranz.
The size - there are two groups as well as seven groups - determines the amount of hours.
"The kitchen helpers are now firmly part of the Kita team," Pommeranz says with satisfaction.
"This means that they are much more involved and it is easier to implement pedagogical concepts for kittens."
Because that is also what it is all about: Healthy nutrition and cooking lessons.
"The children should help to prepare the food."
The direct connection of the kitchen power to the team makes sense.
Also for the children.
'They have a known force in the kita, a person familiar to them, and not constantly changing people. '
This continuity is important for the children.
The cleaning of the Kita rooms - up to now also the task of the kitchen staff - will be carried out by special cleaning staff.
This variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - has in addition to the quality improvement of the kitchen performance also the charm that it has turned out to be the most economical in the cost comparison between self-regulation and outsourcing for the city, says the press office.
This is despite the fact that 46 part-time workers are being recruited.
"But these hours don't matter so much for around 750 people in the education sector," says Sonja Pommeranz.
Afghan democracy depends on the political role of women, says UN
Elections can only be representative if all members of society, including women, play a role, the head of the UN mission in Afghanistan said on Wednesday.
Nicholas Haysom, Acting Head of the United Nations Mission, said that hundreds of women will stand as candidates in provincial council elections. Three women stand for the role of Vice-President and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women.
"The role of women cannot be overestimated," he said in a statement on Wednesday.
Elections can only be truly representative and credible if women participate fully and are involved in all parts of the electoral process.
Afghan elections for the provincial council and presidential elections will take place on April 5.
The Taliban have released threats against an election process that coincide with the transition from international combat to an advisory role.
This year, for the first time, the elections will hand over power peacefully from one democratically elected government to the next.
Haysom said a strong role for women will further reinforce Afghanistan's democratic success.
The Afghan Independent Electoral Commission reports that 1.2 million women out of a total registered 3.6 million voters were registered.

Men try to rob 13-year-old girl
Two young men aged 19 and 23 are believed to have tried to rob a 13-year-old girl on Thursday.
According to information from the police, the men approached the 13-year-old, who was staying with friends on Kolpingstrasse, at around 2.55pm because they wanted to phone the girl's mobile phone.
But the 13-year-old refused the request and went on with her friends.
One of the perpetrators then tried to grab the girl's mobile phone and necklace, but this failed.
Without prey, the duo escaped.
The two young men could later be arrested by police.
The investigations are ongoing.
GMB concerns over investment in McVitie factory in Glasgow
A union would like to reassure managers of biscuit manufacturer McVitie about the long-term commitment to production at its plant in Glasgow.
GMB Scotland said the company had remained silent about the future of investment at the Tollcross site.
More than 500 employees work at the plant, which produces Hobnobs and Rich Tea biscuits, among other products.
McVities owner Pladis said he had invested more than £5 million in recent years.
He added that employees and union representatives would be "the first to learn" if their activities were to change.
In a letter to the company's branch manager, GMB Scotland urged McVitie's to "raise concerns that funding for the modernisation of production lines will not be advanced."
GMB senior organiser Drew Duffy, said: "The fact that we cannot gain clarity from the general site manager about the business needs and investment plans for the future of Tollcross profoundly affects our members.
Generations of families have worked here and the workforce is strongly focused on the local community and Greater Glasgow, an important pillar of decent employment in an area with high unemployment and social deprivation.
Therefore, from the perspective of jobs, wages and prosperity, and against the backdrop of Brexit, the rising cost of living and the chronic fall in production, the eastern end of Glasgow urgently needs a thriving manufacturing presence at McVitie. "
A Pladis spokeswoman said: "The branch manager at Tollcross received a letter from GMB Scotland only yesterday and the company will respond directly to it as we appreciate the ongoing engagement with staff and union representatives.
Two months ago we had a regular meeting with staff and GMB representatives at Tollcross, where some issues were discussed openly.
We discussed with the employees that we, like all companies operating in a highly competitive and uncertain economic climate, are constantly reviewing our business - and this applies to all our business areas and locations - in order to remain competitive.
She added: "In recent years we have invested more than £5 million in our Tollcross site, particularly in production lines and operational improvements.
We fully recognise Tollcross's heritage as a manufacturing facility. If our operations at the site change, the employees and their union representatives will be the first to learn about this. "
Did PSG warn Barcelona about Neymar three years ago?
The La Liga side may regret their interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain will not let up in their pursuit of Neymar after making an offer of £189 million to trigger his release clause, but did they warn Barcelona three years ago of the world record robbery?
The sensational approach has fuelled the transfer window in the summer as the Ligue 1 club is poised to break the world record by more than double the previous mark, with Paul Pogba returning to Manchester United for £89 million last season.
After the termination, Neymar becomes the most expensive player in the world and the highest paid professional athlete in the world. PSG offers wages of more than £500,000 per week.
Barcelona are furious at the way Neymar forced his way out, although a source close to the Catalans board insists the club has always done its best to take care of him since his arrival from Santos in 2013.
But was the football world warned of this prospect by the PSG president three years ago?
When Manchester City expressed interest in signing Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi had a stern warning for any club that wanted to have one of PSG's best players sign.
"I'm not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players then we will stand in opposition to them, we will contact their players," Al-Khelaifi said.
'we respect all clubs.
But if they try to have one of our players sign with them, this will have consequences. "
Barcelona appear to have crossed that line, with the Spanish club expressing interest in PSG midfielder Marco Verratti at the start of this summer.
PSG made it clear that they would not allow the international from Italy to depart under any circumstances, and Barcelona could feel the consequences of that interest by losing one of their price deals to Neymar.
Roller thrown around and damaged
On the night of Friday to Saturday, an unknown perpetrator deliberately threw over a scooter parked in the Königsfelder street in front of the estate Number 30, causing material damage of more than 200 euros to the disguise of the vehicle.
The Schramberg Police Department, phone 07422 / 27 01-0, is asking for clues.
Police are looking for witnesses to an accident on the B 215 between Stolzenau and Leese.
Because a car met him in his lane, the driver of a VW Touran had to dodge and toured the crash barrier.
On Thursday evening, the 34-year-old from Rehburg-Loccum was travelling with his VW at about 7.55pm on the B 215 from Stolzenau in the direction of Leese.
In the area of the Stolzenau bypass, a car came to meet him on his lane, so that he had to dodge to the right.
In doing so, the Touran driver touted the roadmap.
The car suffered material damage.
The driver of the oncoming car, a Mercedes Benz, had overtaken a truck and continued his journey without worrying about the traffic accident.
According to the accident victim, it may well be that the Mercedes driver did not even notice the accident.
Police are now asking witnesses to the incident, as well as the driver of the polluter's vehicle, to contact the Commissariat in Stolzenau on tel. 05761 / 92060.
Interview: "Domspatzen report exonerates Pope brother Georg Ratzinger"
The Regensburg Domspatzen report on the cases of abuse exonerates Pope brother Georg Ratzinger.
This is the opinion of author and historian Michael Hesemann.
The final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburg Domspatzen continues to provide a basis for discussion.
Christian Weisnder, spokesman for the reform movement "We are Church," after publication to the German Press Agency, said that he expected an apology from the former Regensburg bishop and now Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller, as well as from the domicile master Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI.
It would greatly serve the reputation of the Catholic Church if Müller and Ratzinger were to express their deep regret at their own omissions or their mistaken assessment of what was going on at the time.
The Vatican newspaper "Osservatore Romano," on the other hand, criticised the fact that "double standards" were applied in the reporting of violence in the Domspatzen.
With regard to the attacks in Regensburg, no one doubts that these are "shameful and shameful acts" that must be punished and prevented in the future, but what is striking is the "degree of media manipulation," according to the author Lucetta Scaraffia, historian and member of the Italian national bioethics committee.
"The habit of calling the Catholic Church a source of all evils is already part of everyday experience and prepares public opinion to think that this is normal," Scaraffia writes.
In an interview with the Bavarian Radio, Fürstin Gloria of Thurn and Taxis also commented: "One likes to go to the church and that is a found food."
She also pointed out that in her youth "beatings had been quite a normal pedagogical means" to cope with naughty children, as I was one. "
They would find it unfair to apply today's standards to earlier decades, because the world has changed.
In connection with the reports on the cases of abuse, Pope-brother Georg Ratzinger often appeared as well.
Absolutely wrong, writes author and historian Michael Hesemann, who wrote the memento "My Brother the Pope" with Ratzinger (translated into 12 languages).
"I have to protect Georg Ratzinger," says Hesemann, "because all this had nothing to do with him," he assesses the results of the final report.
What exactly is written in the 440-page report presented by Ulrich Weber, the lawyer in charge of the Enlightenment in Regensburg?
A total of 547 Regensburg Domspatzen were sexually abused between 1945 and the early 1990s "with high plausibility" victims of assault, 67 Domspatzen.
The final report refers to Georg Ratzinger, who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994: "In summary, it can be said that Domkapellmeister R. used forms of physical and psychological violence in many cases.
Especially with a high degree of emotionality, the punishment for the pupils could also be more severe.
In contrast to many other defendants, however, it is noticeable that many victims appreciated R. "s general humanity and therefore in numerous cases, in spite of violence, even associated positive memories with him."
In an interview, Hesemann explains why, in his opinion, the final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburg Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger has been relieved.
Mr Hesemann, the 440-page report on the "incidents of violence against persons in need of protection at the Regensburg Domspatzen" gives a contradictory picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger.
For one thing, many students highlight his "humanity."
On the other hand, he also appears as a cholerician and perfectionist, who often became handy when a domed musical did not yield a top performance.
As his biographer, how do you view this final report?
Michael Hesemann: If you take the trouble to read the whole 440-page report from front to back, you have to ask yourself why the name Georg Ratzinger appears in it at all.
Only eight pages have been devoted to him and he is clearly acquitted of any suspicion of complicity or complicity in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.
The excesses of violence at the preschool also occurred outside its sphere of influence.
At best, one can accuse him of being too late to learn of it or of not having taken the first insinuations seriously enough.
The Domspatzengymnasium on which he worked was perceived by virtually all respondents as - so literally - "redemption," "heaven" and "better world."
Thus, even the vast majority of his students Georg Ratzinger gives an excellent testimony, describing him as "warm-hearted," "popular," "sincere," "competent" and "understanding," as an extremely good-natured teacher who regularly provided the boys with cakes, biscuits and sweets from children. "
Only a minority complains about his perfectionism and his high emotionality, which also led to outbreaks of rage.
The fact that he not only knelt with chairs and threw the key dog on the floor, but also distributed earbuds and pulled over-cheeky boys by the hair or ears, he himself admitted years ago, deeply regretted and apologized for this.
To his credit, however, it must be said that such educational methods were widely used in the period in question, the 1960s and 1970s, both among parents and teachers.
Do you still know any of these methods?
Of course, I think any of us born before 1968.
I, too, have experienced this in a secular school, a state grammar school.
Compared with what this report is actually about, namely the appalling sexual abuse and the excesses of violence at preschool, these are, of course, trivial matters.
One wonders if it is not more to do with his notoriety and his role as brother of Benedict XVI that many media just rushed at him.
Many of those who have never understood him are still busy working on the Bavarian Pope.
The truth, however, is that the report exonerates Georg Ratzinger in every respect.
In connection with the report, a great deal has been reported in the media on the subject of abuse at the Regensburg Domspatzen.
In the final report, is Georg Ratzinger also accused of any involvement or complicity with regard to sexual abuse?
Michael Hesemann: Clearly no.
None of the 67 victims of sexual assault claim to have entrusted themselves to the domain master.
Not even the parents were inaugurated.
"I never dared to talk to my father or my mother about it," said one of those affected on behalf of the others, "It was all very embarrassing to me."
The real problem with finding out about sexual abuse was, and still is, that most victims remain silent out of shame.
If they did not even entrust themselves to parents and siblings, then certainly not to a choir director, who would have been, in a way, a colleague of the perpetrators professionally.
How do Domspatzen students assess Ratzinger's role with regard to the cases of abuse?
Michael Hesemann: A student in question put it this way: "With regard to sexual abuse... I see... no case in which he (Georg Ratzinger) of all people would have known in good time and could have stopped the perpetrator in question.
I think it is... also really absurd to assume that of all people... Jacks have opened up more forcefully or clearly or even more often than to their parents, dormitory managers, confidence teachers etc.
That you talk to him about sex... - unthinkable. "
Thus, the report comes to the very clear conclusion: "The fact that pupils and / or their environment were entrusted to him beforehand could not be confirmed within the scope of the investigation."
As far as sexual abuse is concerned, Georg Ratzinger must therefore be absolved of any complicity.
In this way, he cannot be accused of not having prevented him or brought him to trial.
There is therefore no reason to associate his good name with these repugnant crimes, as has unfortunately happened in some cases.
There was much to read in the media about "violence" at the Regensburg Domspatzen.
Former Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger is accused in the report of "turning a blind eye."
Does he have to live with this accusation?
Michael Hesemann: That's the big problem, that in the reporting everything was mixed up and mixed up into a huge melange of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere, in the middle of it, Georg Ratzinger.
That, however, is another abuse of the report.
There is a clear separation: Between the pre-school and the gymnasium of the domains, between sexual abuse and violence and, let us say, other reproaches.
In addition, the report deals with incidents from the time since 1945, that is to say also from four decades in which Georg Ratzinger was not the choir director of the Domspatzen.
The whole terrible teaching of beatings, the cases in which boys were harassed and maltreated by sadistic teachers and suffered horribly, all occurred at the nursery school in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where truly scandalous conditions must have prevailed.
But Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do with them, because he only got to see the boys when they were already at the Domspatzengymnasium.
On this, as most of the witnesses emphasize, the subject of "preschool" was taboo.
One was only happy to have escaped her and enjoyed so much better treatment and for many even "paradise" conditions.
What was different on the Domspatzengymnasium?
Michael Hesemann: There was discipline, but there was no sadistic violence.
And this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, in which the report concludes that "many victims valued the general humanity of R. and therefore in many cases, despite violence, even associate positive memories with him."
So at most there remains the reproach of having looked away.
However, despite all efforts, the report was able to define only two periods in which it was told of the conditions at preschool.
The first time in 1970 / 71, when he had just begun to establish himself and wanted to hear nothing of the events at a school where he was not active and responsible (according to the witness), and then again around 1993.
Did Georg Ratzinger consistently shut his ears in front of the conditions?
Michael Hesemann: No, because as early as 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Domspatzengymnasium, which the report even reproduced.
In it, the Court points out that "caning continues to be carried out in preschool."
Even in the face of the danger of negative press releases, he recommended urgent intervention.
This was, of course, at a time when there was legal clarity, when punishments for beatings had long been banned in Bavaria.
Before that, they took place in a legal grey area, as we all know.
For him, too, it was difficult to estimate where those affected might have been exaggerated or dramatised and where the permissible limit had really been exceeded.
But you can't say he always looked away.
That is simply not true.
Only in 1980 was caning at schools officially abolished in Bavaria.
Fürstin Gloria of Thurn and Taxis claimed that it was unfair to apply today's pedagogical standards to the time.
How do you see that?
Michael Hesemann: We historians are talking about the "snare of anachronism," that is, the danger of judging the past according to today's moral standards.
Since the princess is already right.
But this does not, of course, apply to sexual abuse, which has always been abhorrent, nor to what has been committed in the preschool of adversity and violence against innocent children's souls, which goes far beyond what was then commonplace.
This is all quite horrible and I am glad that it is finally being worked up.
But at the same time I have to protect Georg Ratzinger, because all this had nothing to do with him.
His means of disciplining and punishing, that is to say punching his ear and pulling his hair and ears, were widely used in the 1970s.
When corporal punishment was then forbidden, he strictly adhered to it.
What image of his time in Regensburg did Georg Ratzinger give in his conversations with you for the book "My Brother the Pope"?
Has the issue of caning also been raised?
Michael Hesemann: Well, the book is about the life of his brother Joseph, that is to say Pope Benedict XVI, tells from his perspective that the cathedral cats played only a minor role.
Nevertheless, I do not hide the fact that he led a strict regiment there.
But this also has to be said: Without this perfectionism, without demanding absolute discipline, it would hardly have been possible for him to form a world-class institution out of the previously rather nationally known Regensburger Domspatzen, true cultural ambassadors of Europe and its musical tradition, which went on tour twice in 1983 and in Japan (1988).
With biscuits and sweets alone, you don't turn recalcitrant boys into great singers and stand before every success, no matter what field, but always discipline, passion and self-overcoming.
As what kind of person did you experience Georg Ratzinger during the conversations about her book?
Michael Hesemann: By working on the book and beyond, I really got to know Georg Ratzinger very well and experienced him again and again as a wonderful, humorous, basic, deeply believing and kind-hearted person, of whom you can't imagine that he could do anything even for a fly.
I regularly get to know how many former Domspatzen still maintain regular contact with him today, 23 years after his retirement, visit him, read to him - he is almost blind - and treat him like a member of their family.
So those who do not forgive him to this day that he was once strict with them are clearly in the minority.
Most of the Domspatzen are grateful to him today for enriching their lives and bringing them closer to the world of music.
And that he was always a good, paternal teacher - a strict father, of course, that may be - but also a lovely person of respect, to whom they still look up today and whom they adore.
And please, once again quite clearly: All you accuse him of are educational methods that were the order of the day at that time.
We can be glad that we have passed this time long ago.
But it is highly unjust to make a man a media scapegoat just because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother.
The evil intent behind it is all too obvious.
Because the report that has just been published relieves it.
Now decency would dictate to finally leave a 93-year-old man, who has earned himself great merits and without whom no one outside Bavaria and perhaps still Germany would know the Regensburg Domspatzen in peace.
