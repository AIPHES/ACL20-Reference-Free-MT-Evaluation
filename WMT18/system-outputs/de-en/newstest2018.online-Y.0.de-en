Munich 1856: Four maps that change your view of the city
A mental institution where young people are supposed to meet today.
A tomb chapel where now digging for the S-Bahn tunnel.
Small gardeners manage the former land of farmers.
The oldest official map of Munich promotes exciting stories.
It annoys when maps are not up-to-date.
Everyone who has had to get upset is familiar with this, because the car navigation system showed a green meadow instead of a bypassing road.
The historical maps of the digital Bavaria Atlas, an offer by the State Government's Geoportal Bavaria, are far from up-to-date - but this is why they are very informative.
Especially if you compare them with current online maps.
Then it becomes clear how cities and municipalities in the distribution area of Munich Mercury have been growing since the 19th century. in the 19th century.
The digital Bayern atlas is a patchwork that is not immediately recognizable as such.
More detailed maps, so-called original position sheets, have been incorporated into the large overview map for cities and municipalities.
According to the Bavarian Survey Administration, these arose between 1810 and 1864 and originate from Bavaria's first survey.
Your client: Napoleon.
The French army leader occupied Bavaria with Austria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War.
Napoleon wished for an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a topographical recording of Bavaria - of course for military purposes.
Even if the French troops with the peace of Lunéville from 9. It was today's neighbours who created the idea of a comprehensive map of Bavaria.
Elector Max IV Joseph continued to advance the project, founded the “Topographic Bureau” - and thus the Bavarian Survey Administration.
The original position sheet for Munich dates from 1856 and can be found on the website of the Bavarian State Library, just like all others.
The comparison Earlier/Today is the most impressive in the example of the state capital.
The city expanded in all directions and grew together.
An example of this is the undersendling, which appears relatively isolated in the map of 1856.
Sendling was congregated as Munich's district 21 years after the map was created in 1877.
Today, Untersendling is in the middle of the city.
The houses of Untersendlings are concentrated around 1856 along the current Plinganserstraße, which was only named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser in 1878, a leader of the Bavarian peasant uprising against Austria in 1705.
Where the West Park is today, you can see nothing but fields - at first glance: when zooming in, a smaller card appears with dozens of lines and numbers: hand-numbered hallways from the so-called “primal reception” from which the property tax was derived.
Small parcels are no longer occupied by farmers - they are small gardeners of the “Land in Sun” plant.
A large green area is located north of Untersendling.
The Theresienwiese (Theresienwiese), which has been the scene of the Oktoberfest since 1810, was built in the 19th century. In the 19th century, there is actually another meadow - and no concrete desert.
On the other side of the Isar, the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.
In the first position leaflet, in the area of the present-day district of Au-Haidhausen, you can read not only the street name “am Gasteig” or the hill “Auf der Lüften” - but also in large letters “Irren Anstalt”.
Yes, here on Auerfeldstraße people were once imprisoned with delusions.
In 1858/59, the Münchner Kreis-Irrenanstalt “Auf der Auer Lüften” (“On the Auer Lüften”) was founded there.
From 1872, Dr. Bernard of Gudden the institution - that psychiatrist who is brought in connection with the death of King Louis II.
“He was progressive for his time and ended, for example, the chain of so-called madmen.
In addition, he has prohibited the personnel from using force against the occupants,” says Hermann Wilhelm, head of the Haidhausen Museum, who has been involved in the institution for an exhibition.
There was room for 280 patients at first, later expanded to 500 seats.
At some point, this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the circulating hospital in Haar 1905.
Since 2006 the Isar-Amper-Klinikum München-Ost, one of the largest psychiatriums in Germany, has been located there.
On the premises of the former Auer Anstalt, young people meet in the Salesianum in Munich.
The Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and converted it into a youth home with training establishments.
To the west is the football field of the TSV München Ost, east of residential buildings from the 1980s.
In 2015, the children's house “Casa Don Bosco” was built - in architectural style, following the original construction of the lunatic asylum, which had been destroyed during the Second World War in the event of bombings.
The Marienplatz was listed in 1856 as the “main square”, the Kaufinger Street was called “Kaufinger Gasse”.
The Second World War also brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich.
The Allied bombs tore many holes into the city centre in December 1944.
A large one remained to this day - at the Marienhof.
The English Institute, small business buildings and a medieval tomb chapel once stood at the Marienhof, where these days the preparatory works and on 5 May the church was built. The ground-breaking ceremony for the second S-Bahn regular line will take place on April 1, 2017.
With the slider, the old Munich map can be compared to today's aerial imagery - and the hole at the Marienhof can be filled up.
Citizens' Rights Group publishes travel warning for Missouri
The National Association for the Promotion of Colors has issued a warning to colored people who travel to Missouri due to the discriminatory policies and racist attacks of the state.
“The NAACP Travel Advisory for the State of Missouri, which will be open until 28 October 2017. Afro-American travelers, visitors and Missourians are encouraging special attention and extreme caution when travelling through the state, as a number of questionable race-based incidents have occurred in recent time throughout the state and be noted here”, the Group's comments state.
A recently adopted Missouri law that makes it harder for people to win discrimination actions, as well as the state law enforcement agencies that disproportionately target minorities, prompted the group to issue the travel warning, said NAACP.
“They have violations of civil rights that happen to people.
They are stopped because of their skin color, they are beaten up or killed,” said the president of the Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, Kansas City Star.
“We hear complaints at such a frequency that we have not yet heard.”
It is the first such warning issued by the organization for a state in the USA.
The group cited incidents such as racist offences against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died in questionable circumstances at the beginning of the year, after he had no gas during the trip through the state and was detained by the Missouri police without being accused of a crime.
The Council also points out a recent report by the Office of the Prosecutor General of Missouri, which shows that black motorists in the state are stopped 75 percent more often than whites.
“The recommendation is that people are aware of what could happen in Missouri,” said Chapel.
“People need to be ready to bring bail money or let the relatives know they're traveling through the state.”
Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest figures from the FBI's hate crime reporting program, which led the state in terms of the number of such violations to the 16th century. rank the country.
The travel warning is also a response to a new Missouri law that would make it harder to sue a company for housing or employment discrimination.
Previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after the states had adopted immigration laws that oblige local law enforcement authorities to arrest people for immigration violations, which, according to ACLU, will contribute to further racial profiling.
Travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries, but recently stakeholders have used the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the United States.
Willow fence project is elementary
The Fischerbach Willow Fence Project is a success project and will continue in the coming year.
CDU MEPs Peter Weiß and Kordula Kovac took a picture on the ground.
Representatives of the Fischerbach CDU local association met with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two deputies at the right-grave courtyard of the Schwendemann family.
Markus Schwendemann first provided insights into his farm, where he manages 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, supplies 40 dairy cows and as many young animals, and houses holiday guests in five apartments.
“Black Forest Milk” is for him the alternative marketing route for the milk of his cows, says Schwendemann.
On the table of the holiday guests comes exclusively regional.
Since he is also chairman of the Fence Society of Fischerbach, he described the fence project as “elementary important”.
I can't make a profit on such steep areas.
The grassland area provides for a lot of work, much needs to be processed with the motor sense.
“We are struggling with the conditions and the topography here,” Schwendemann emphasized.
In 2003, he took over the parental holding and managed it without chemical plant protection and fertilizer, even if it does not run a biobusiness.
For mayor Thomas Schneider it was clear: “The municipality has recognized the importance of the fence project and is glad about the Leader promotion”.
Farmers would have to be supported at a cost of between EUR 3000 and EUR 4000 per hectare.
It is hoped that the afforestation of the land could be extended for a while.
“The greatest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and are concerned about how to move their business forward,” said the mayor.
Farmers are often criticised for their support
In 2013, a total of 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced by the grazing fence promotion.
The area covered by the disclosure is therefore 40 hectares, which must not be forested until at least 2023.
Of the total cost of EUR 71 500, half was supported by the Leader, and one quarter was supported by the municipality of Fischerbach.
Thus, farmers remained 12 610 euros, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometers of pasture fence.
“The great advantage is the longevity of the fences,” Schwendemann explained.
Kordula Kovac stressed: “You do a really good job, without farmers and rural women it is not possible”.
Peter Weiß also said: “Best food is produced here”.
The Landschaftspflegerichtlinie (LPR) Baden-Württemberg enables the state support of fences.
The aim is to keep the Black Forest open.
The prerequisite is the presence of a conveyor backdrop designated by the LPR.
In addition, the area to be fenced must not be traceable (inclination over 35%) and must therefore be threatened by afforestation.
For the Fischerbach willow fence project 2018, the application is currently being submitted by eight participants with 24 plots, who want to build almost 16 kilometers of fence.
The area covered by the disclosure corresponds to 35 hectares and the calculated costs exceed EUR 112 000.
Is nothing holy anymore?
Now the White House of Trump takes the Statue of Liberty
The safest sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues.
The Americans appreciate this as well as any other - hence the carefully staged fall of Saddam Hussein on Firdos Square in Baghdad in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the Trump regime, certainly knew what he was doing when he took a symbolic axe to the Statue of Liberty in a heated dispute with Jim Acosta of CNN about the President's proposals to drastically restrict legal immigration.
To stay fair, Miller didn't attack the statue itself.
A horde of boat owners and Liberty imitators would have lynched him if he had.
But he attacked its importance, and in particular the importance attributed to it, when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus was added to its base in 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument.
When Miller insulted Acosta, “I don't want to go into a whole thing about history here, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that enlightens the world.
The poem to which you refer, which was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty.”
Miller is factually right, but as he himself put it, it's not really about history.
It is a question of contemporary response to the stirring words of Lazarus, the only one in which a state invites not only any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: “Your tired, your poor,/your afflicted crowds who yearn to breathe freely/the miserable waste of your rich coasts.”
There was never a time when the “miserable waste” was better seen on our screens.
Miller did not engage in literary critique - he made it clear that these people are not welcome in Trump's USA.
This conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural debate: it is indeed a conflict about the importance of America.
Lazarus - and her friends who were committed to placing their words at the base after their death - knew very well that they were doing a highly political act.
The sculpture was intended to show the links between French and American Republican by depicting the female embodiment of freedom in a worn-out classical graphic representation.
Lazarus changed this meaning: in her poem, the female figure is no longer abstract - she received a voice.
And she gives herself a completely different name: mother of exiles.
The connection between the poem and the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American nativism.
And just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, people wanted to switch this back from the right wing for a long time.
In 2010, the great cry-neck Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the Coming of Trump, argued that the Statue of Liberty was not inviting anyone, but rather an early neo-conservative that brought the American flame to the overnight world: “Lady Liberty is moving forward.
She's supposed to carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
The torch should not illuminate the way to the United States.”
Quite unusual, Limbaugh came across something here.
The significance of the statue is quite a question of the point of view of perception.
The great imaginative act of Lazarus was to see it as seen by the exhausted, miserable but hopeful people after long and often terrible journeys on the decks of ships.
It is literally about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives.
Her statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome that they must hear.
And of course that's not the perspective that Miller and Trump ever want to recognize.
Their torch should not illuminate the way, but should ignite the hatred that is their only source of power.
World Cup 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish members of the UK team
Eilidh Doyle remembers a time when only two Scots were part of the UK team
UK Athletics Director Neil Black says that the 16-person Scottish contingent in the World Championship squad will “make a massive contribution to the team”.
A record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017, which starts on Friday.
Black believes that “something special is developing in Scotland” and that the UK's athletics must learn something from it.
“We welcome it, and we try to understand it, and we will continue until we find out,” Black said.
“I'm talking to people at the Scottish Institute of Sport, and they think it has something to do with what they did.
The Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they did.
British Athletics: It has something to do with what they have done.
And the guy on the street corner.
Whatever the combination of circumstances is, it's absolutely brilliant.”
Several of the Scottish athletes are medallists, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000-metre track, while Eilidh Doyle was elected team captain by the team.
“Eilidh is rather modest.
Your captain's speech was incredible,” Black says.
“A number of athletes, whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train, went out of the room and felt very proud and motivated.
The passion and the real feeling that Eilidh brought naturally were great.”
The Commonwealth Silver Medal winner, who will compete in the 400-metre hurdles at her fifth World Championships, says that it is “incredible” that 16 Scots are in the British team.
Scotland's best total athletes in the World Championship to date was seven, which were achieved in 1983 and 2015.
The medium-distance runner Muir is on this path and set five British and two European records last year.
She will take part in the 1,500 m and 5,000 m runs.
Chris O'Hare, who runs 1,500 meters, is another Scot to watch after a great season that included the victory at the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games.
Doyle remembers her first World Championships when the only other Scot on the team was Lee McConnell.
The team captain says that she is “enormously proud” of the fact that many of her compatriots are not only part of the team, but in some cases will also be involved in the medals and the finals.
“The special thing about being a team captain is that she was elected by the other members of the team, so it was a great honor anyway, but knowing that my teammates voted for me and chose me makes it very special for me,” she added.
“Obviously, I am very proud of all the Scots who are part of the team.
It just shows how far we've come.
And they are here as established athletes, athletes who want to climb on podiums.
As far as my speech as a captain is concerned?
Yeah, I think she was fine.
I just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation because we have a home world championship.
It is therefore really important to rely on this home support and to benefit from the fact that we are back at the Olympic Stadium.
I get a second chance to go out there and compete, and it's just gonna be such a great atmosphere out there.”
Blocking critics via Facebook: Don't apply for a public office if you can't tolerate the heat-up of voters
The father of our country knew something about bad press.
The Americans loved George Washington, but it didn't take long for the newspapers to beat him for anything, from domestic politics to his political principles.
He was scampering with the criticism, sure.
But he didn't silence his critics.
Because in 1783 Washington said, “Freedom of speech can be taken away - and, stupid and silent, we are led to slaughter like sheep.”
That brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan, who has to work to be more like Washington.
Hogan's employees have blocked and deleted the posts of at least 450 people who have expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page.
And the American Civil Liberties Union sued him about that at the beginning of this week.
The staff of the governor dismissed the lawsuit as frivolous, and the online comment was full of a counter-reaction with “Well, what?” .
“It's just Facebook,” many people said.
But it's important.
And it's especially important if it's a guy like Hogan.
This is a Republican governor in an overwhelmingly democratic state that is amazingly popular.
He has the second highest approval of the 50 governors of the nation.
Hogan is not a reactionary heat head.
He has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict adherence to the principles.
He was also very skilled at using Facebook as the primary means of connecting with his constituents and playing to debut his hairless head after chemotherapy on his side.
Therefore, the blocking of people coming to the governor's side - which is a public forum called official and of employees paid with public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan's spokeswoman Amelia Chasse defended the governor's actions and argued that blocking comments was nothing more than moderation.
But it's too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hateful people swinging the whip online.
The post spoke to some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.
And these are only real people who speak with their elected leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur and a priest, no trolls.
They all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not profan.
The priest quoted the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogan's Catholic faith.
Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., was not hateful, but she asked about hate crimes.
“I politely commented that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other recent news,” she wrote in the comment section of the news show “The Post.”
“I do not appreciate this idea either, if a number of people comment on the same subject, then some people disregard it more as a so-called collective effort and do not recognise it as a large group of affected citizens”.
What the governor's staff called “concentrated spam attack,” others would probably call “intercession.”
The Facebook era makes it easy to crop a message by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment.
It is much cleaner than in the past if you had done the same thing that employees were posted to collect and burn newspapers with critical editorial articles or to arrest and silence demonstrators.
But that's what's happening digitally right now.
Hogan is not the first public official to be criticised for insulting Facebook and other social media.
President Trump is sued by Twitter users who have been blocked by his Twitter feed.
One of the first milestones in this question fell last week in Virginia.
Loudoun County's Chairman of the Board of Supervisors violated the First Amendment, according to U.S. District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when she banished a voter from her Facebook page.
And in Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit from ACLU because of his use of Facebook and Twitter.
That shouldn't be so hard.
At the time of Washington, the time of the affordable photo had a similar effect to the Internet.
The number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous postage writers responded to his leadership.
And even then Washington had anonymous trolls.
The people who used pseudonyms like “Juricola”, “Valerius”, “Belisarius” and “Portius” wrote all the letters to newspapers that made Washington's decisions.
Petitions that criticized his position on the Amity Treaty, trade and shipping with Britain overwhelmed his office, according to the historical documents collected by the George Washington Project online papers.
But he didn't silence her.
Freedom of speech, disagreement and discourses are the basis of our nation.
And true leadership means accepting that.
Ronan Rafferty hopes for home comfort at Renaissance Club
Former European No. 1 Ronan Rafferty will be hoping for domestic comfort in the next three days, as the Renaissance Club in East Lothian will be back on 25 October. edition of the Scottish Senior Open.
The Nordire, which led to the final round in the Archerfield next door last year before losing against Paul Eales, is connected to the new venue and acts as a tournament ambassador on behalf of the club founder and CEOs Jerry Sarvadi.
“I've seen the Renaissance club build, and we're seeing it reach its fame with this event,” said Rafferty.
“Players will see this course at its best, it is in a great condition.
Jerry did a great job setting this place.
He is a zealous advocate of this game and is proud of his performance here.
This is a great showcase for this course.”
The English Eales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time, although he has won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour in his 32-year career.
“That feels really special,” said the Southport-based player.
“I could not defend the Extremadura Open because it was withdrawn the year after I won it.
Returning to this part of the world is magical.
It's a wonderful place to play golf.
The memories from last year come back, and it was special for me and my wife Sharon to win here last year.
It was a really special time and one that we will always appreciate.”
Gary Orr, who, after his 50th birthday, This year's European Senior Tour was celebrated on the occasion of his birthday earlier this year, he returns to the action on Heimatboden.
This event will be his first Scottish appearance since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
“It always means a little more when you play at home,” said Orr, the man from Helensburgh.
“You want to do well, but you also feel this extra pressure.
I really enjoyed playing again, and I played a solid golf.
I'm glad how it went.”
With the trio on the field are the former Masters winner Ian Woosnam and the Senior Major Champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are among the six bulkheads on the field, while others are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.

Reduced lung cancer death due to passive smoking
Over the past two decades, fewer and fewer people have died of lung cancer because of passive smoking.
Scientists from the University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) come to this conclusion in a study.
“According to our estimates, 167 lung cancer accidents per year are due to passive smoking,” said study director Heiko Becher.
As a comparison, he used his own study on this subject from 1994.
At that time, there were 400 lung cancer accidents due to passive smoking per year in Germany.
The new study is published in the International Journal of Public Health.
House connections turn out to be very complex
The construction works in Villinger Straße are in full swing and “are somewhat in time”, according to the head of the Fred Heinze building yard.
In the area of house connections, the situation is more complicated than expected, as there is a lot of hiding in the underground, which is not mentioned in the plans.
Traffic, which repeatedly impedes construction work, is a major problem for the construction team of Stumpp.
“The ignorance of motorists from red traffic lights and grilles is already enormous,” says Heinze.
The road was closed and only the regular buses were allowed to pass through.
Angelo Caruso, Marvin Kostorz and Tim Kostorz from Stumpp have been working on the bridge for weeks.
“The hot days were already quite exhausting.
But fortunately, our friend Fritz Matt provided us with cool mineral water,” says Marvin Kostorz.
Poverty and death in Indonesian gold country
When Bardina Degei cooks dinner, she doesn't use a stove.
She rarely uses a pot.
In her wooden house in Enarotali, the capital of the Paniai regime in the troubled Indonesian province of Papua, the housewife usually places a sweet potato - locally called “nota” - directly in the fireplace.
After half an hour, the charred tuber is removed and swallowed with eager, unwashed hands.
Degei sits on the clay floor - she has no furniture - where she also carries out her daily work, e.g. B. Wash clothes with cloudy water from the nearby swamp.
A bucket in a homeless room serves as a latrine.
As the youngest of her husband's four wives, no fields were assigned to her.
Polygamy is common here.
Of course, working late can be dangerous: most villagers are unemployed, and many drink heavy, and there are soldiers here.
“Nobody dares walk around the village after 5:00,” she says.
It is a rare insight into the daily life in the highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony, which was admitted in 1969 after a controversial referendum in Indonesia, when only 1,026 elders were to vote in front of the occupying troops through a public hike.
An existing movement that stirred up for independence against Dutch rule quickly turned against the government of Jakarta, which controls the region and excludes foreign journalists or legal observers.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua, with the independent part of Papua New Guinea comprising the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is as remote as it is desolate. The journey includes a 90-minute flight from the provincial capital of Jayapura to Nabire and then a 5-hour morning car ride with the rental car.
There is no public transport.
The town with about 19,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences and corrugated roofs, which were transformed by rust into various yellow-brown tones.
Very few Indonesians have travelled here, let alone journalists and practically no foreigners.
Before Christian missionaries arrived, Mee Pago Papuan worshipped a god named Uga Tamee.
There have also been other changes.
“We weren't used to wearing these clothes,” says Degei, pointing to her lively, hand-woven turban, dark shirt and bright skirt.
“We used to have only leaves on our bodies.”
Papua is Indonesia's poorest province, where 28% of people live below the poverty line and have some of the worst child mortality and literacy rates in Asia.
But it's also Indonesia's gold country.
The largest and most profitable gold mine in the world, Grasberg, owned by Phoenix's Freeport McMoran, is just 60 miles from Paniai, a New Jersey highland province with 153,000 inhabitants.
In 2015 alone, Freeport mined $3.1 billion in gold and copper.
Papua also has wood resources worth an estimated $78 billion.
However, these riches are a source of misery for the Papua, ensuring that Indonesia's powerful military maintains a suffocating presence.
An investigation in the New York Times in 2005 reported that Freeport paid local military personnel and units nearly $20 million between 1998 and 2004, including up to $150,000 to a single officer.
Papuan demands for greater autonomy threaten these golden goose and are treated mercilessly.
According to activists, more than 500,000 Papua have been killed and thousands have been raped, tortured and imprisoned by the Indonesian military since 1969.
Mass killings in Papua's tribal highlands in the 1970's became genocide according to the Asia Human Rights Commission.
In the region alone, the Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful demonstrators last year.
“We will lose everything” is stated in a 2016 report by the Archdiocese of Brisbane, which contains reports of atrocities of the previous year, such as illegal executions and torture - rape and electric strikes are particularly popular, according to another report - and the brutal defeat of peaceful Demonstrations.
“It's difficult to count the number of victims as incidents happen every week,” says Andreas Harsono, Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch.
The screws have intensified as Papua's resources bring an influx of settlers from other parts of Indonesia.
The population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83% Christian, but demographic development is changing as Muslim economic migrants come from the populous islands of Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Javanese warung canteens sell fried chicken and gado-gado, a mixed vegetable served with peanut sauce.
Local people fight to keep up with this.
“Migrants have begun to sell chickens and vegetables in the traditional market cheaper than the local Papua,” explains Abeth You, a 24-year-old Paniai native who moved to the provincial capital of Jayapura for work.
“It tasted the native Papua - the mama-mama [the women] of Papua - their market.”
The Indonesian President Joko Widodo, popularly known as Jokowi, promised to tackle inequalities and infringements in Papua during his election campaign in 2014.
The former carpenter secured 27 of the 29 districts of Papua - including Paniai - on the way to the Presidential Palace in Jakarta.
But little has changed in Papua, and today the locals feel betrayed.
“Our hearts are broken because we voted for Jokowi in 2014, with the expectation that he will fulfill our hopes that justice will be restored,” you said.
In fact, Paniai suffered a low point only two months after Jokowi's inauguration in October.
On the 7th. On December 31, 2014, a group of 11 children was out singing Christmas carols in front of a campfire in Enarotali, when two Indonesian soldiers broke through the darkness on a motorcycle.
The frightened kids told them to turn on their headlights.
One of the soldiers took charge of their tone and later came back with four soldiers, according to the local pastor Yavedt Tebai.
The soldiers who had drunk hunted and beat the group with their rifle pistons, said sacrifices and witnesses.
Then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children.
A child, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was struck so hard that he fell into a coma.
A few hours later, the building of the nearby government commission was set on fire and things escalated the next day.
Approximately 1,000 young Papua men, women and children gathered on a football field in front of the local police station and the military command center to demand justice.
They wore ceremonial hunting arcs and performed the Waita dance - running in circles and imitating a bird song - by Papua's Mee Pago tribe.
Some protesters began to throw stones at police and military posts.
When the mood was warmed up, the soldiers were sent an order via an internal radio: “If the crowds resist more than three times, they shoot them dead,” says an official document from TIME, which was not released to the local media.
Yeremias Kayame, 56, the head of the Kego Koto district of Enarotali, saw the imminent danger and called for rest and urged the crowd to return home.
No one was in the mood to listen.
“When I turned around, I was suddenly shot in my left wrist,” he said TIME on the porch of his colorful painted wooden house.
Kayame still doesn't know who fired, but says the bullet came out of the ranks of the soldiers gathered here.
“It was crowded, many shots were fired,” he adds.
The local man Alfius Youw was met three times, according to his cousin, who was witness to the shootings.
“I ran to him and examined his body to make sure it was him,” said Yohanes, who, like many Indonesians, bears only one name, TIME in a dark mood.
“I saw that he was dead... I kissed him.”
The chief inspector of the Papua police, Yotje Mende, told reporters that his officers only wanted to “secure” their station because it was being attacked.
“We must defend ourselves if people threaten to kill us,” said the Papua Police spokesman, Commissioner Pudjo Sulistiyo, in 2015.
“It's about life and death.”
According to Human Rights Watch, five young demonstrators were killed and many more injured.
The news about the killings came to Jakarta only the following day 'filtered'.
For three weeks, Jokowi gave a passionate speech in Jayapura, expressing sympathy for the families of the victims and swore to tackle the historical abuses in Papua.
“I want this case to be resolved immediately, so it won't happen in the future,” he said.
Security Minister Wiranto said in October 2016 that he set up an out-of-court mechanism to resolve historical human rights violations.
But the excuses began almost immediately.
“Most injuries occurred a long time ago.
Some were in the 90's and early 2000's.
The point is that we have committed ourselves to tackling these violations, but there are processes that need to be done,” he said.
Then Wiranto made a retreat when he was on the 5th. He spoke to TIME on June 6 in Jakarta and said he had no plans to set up a complaint mechanism in Papua.
Instead, “everything is regulated by law,” he said.
Wiranto, accused by the UN of “crimes against humanity” that claimed more than 1,000 deaths in East Timor's bloody independence vote of 1999, said that 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua had already been resolved, including the Paniai incident.
Families of Paniai victims accepted such claims with grim infidelity.
“I've been interviewed four times in the last three years, but no progress has been made,” says Yohanes.
“I'm tired.”
He says years later he still lives in fear.
“I'm scared,” he says.
“I'm afraid to be arrested by the military, afraid to be shot.”
His brother Yacobus reiterated the view that the people in Paniai are afraid to discuss the incident.
He says he was beaten by the military after helping bury four of the victims.
“After I buried the bodies, the military was looking for me,” he says.
The shootings didn't stop.
On Tuesday, the Indonesian police shot villagers in Paniai's neighborhood Deiyai.
During a confrontation between villagers and the manager of a construction company who refused to take an unconscious man to the hospital, one person died and 17 others were injured, including children.
The man, 24-year-old Ravianus Douw, who drowned when he fished in a nearby river, died on his way to the hospital.
Excited villagers protested in front of the company's site office.
The police said that the villagers threw stones at officers who responded by firing warning shots.
But locals say that the mobile brigade (Indonesian paramilitary police) began to shoot at the crowd and killed one.
“We were so panicked, we are afraid that there will be revenge,” says 29-year-old Dominggu Badii, who lives near the hospital and witnessed how the injured were quickly brought in here, according to TIME.
“I've been hiding in my house for two days.”
The Deiyai Parliament has called on the officers involved to be held accountable and to withdraw the police mobile brigade from the area.
Paniai has always been a troubled place for the Indonesian Government.
The lack of meaningful development strengthens the dissatisfaction of the tribal members Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal who live in the green highlands of Papua.
Many joined the “Free Papua Movement” (OPM), the rebel army, which claims to defend the rights of Papua by triggered sporadic attacks and kidnappings of Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the top OPM guides come from Paniai, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
In response to this, thousands of people have been arrested and arbitrarily detained in Paniai in recent years on the pretext of 'securing national sovereignty'.
Some never show up again.
Among the people of Papua, Paniai is known as “a tragic, forgotten place”.
Poverty strengthens dissatisfaction.
The little rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive for locals.
Bread is just as out of reach.
People here grow everything they eat: nota and fruit and leafy vegetables.
Agriculture is the task of women, who can process four or five fields of sweet potatoes each.
They keep most of the harvest for the family, while the rest is sold on the local market.
Ten pieces of Nota cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Over time, economic inequalities have grown between the native Papua and the new migrants who have arrived in greater numbers since the opening of new routes to Nabire Airport.
The few jobs that exist in the region usually go to better trained and wealthy migrants.
Papua rarely have the capital or the necessary skills to lead their own companies competitive.
“The young people are not interested in staying in the village... because there are no jobs or money here,” says John Gobai, Chairman of the Tribal Council of Paniai.
Isolation keeps the eyes of the world away from Papua.
In addition, restrictions on the reporting of international media remain tense.
At the beginning of the year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were deported from Papua because of lack of coordination with related institutions, although they were given the rare permission to film.
According to Phelim Kine, Deputy Asia Director of Human Rights Watch, the promises made by Jokowi's campaign to lift reporting restrictions in order to promote transparency and development have not been realized.
“There are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to report from Indonesia's troubled easternmost provinces of Papua and Western Papua: visa refusal and a black list,” he said in a statement.
Lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indonesian Government remains largely limited to the immediate neighbours of Papua.
In March, six Pacific states - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the “various and widespread injuries” in Papua, including the Paniai shooting.
The same countries have historically supported the OPM.
The spokesman of the Indonesian Foreign Ministry Arrmanatha Nasir rejected the group's allegations and said to journalists in Jakarta: “There is still a democratic system in Indonesia, and there are free media, so it is difficult to cover up the evidence of human rights cases.”
Local people want more foreign governments to take note of this.
As an official delegation from the Netherlands, headed by the Human Rights Ambassador Kees Van Baar, Jayapura, on 4 May. On May 1, locals visited, broke their silence and afflicted him “We want freedom”, according to a source that also participated in the meeting but wants to remain anonymous.
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019, but the Papua say that they will probably not vote for Jokowi again.
“Jokowi is a person with good intentions, but he is surrounded by the people involved in the Paniai shots,” says Gobai, the chairman of the tribal council.
He wants Jokowi to know that the Paniai people, apart from living under the constant threat of a robbery military, are in poor educational and health services.
Gobai says that the Paniai people, like other Papua, consider their voice for Jokowi as a “debt” he has to pay back.
“They don't need money, they just want justice,” he says.
Despite the threats and intimidations, families of the Paniai gunshot victims carried out one last symbolic act of defiance: the body of a victim was buried on a site just opposite the police and the military station.
They know that they may never have justice, but at least they don't let those responsible forget their crimes.
“A member of our family was killed,” says Yacobus with a lowered head.
“What else can we do?”
Fire capture the 'Torch' skyscraper of Dubai for the second time
A fire took place on Friday in one of the world's tallest residential towers in Dubai, forcing hundreds of residents to escape from the 337-metre-high 79-storey building.
It is the second fire that sweeps through the skyscraper in just two years, which is accidentally called the Torch Tower.
The building was evacuated, injuries were not reported, and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame.
“We slept and we got up at the fire alarm and the screaming of the people.
We ran down the stairs, and it took about 10 minutes to get off the 50. To come down to the floor,” said a resident who gave his name as George, Reuters.
Dubai's civil protection authorities said that the fire fighting units extinguished the fire and cooled the building around 4:00 a.m. local time (00:00 a.m. GMT).
The government said it was working to provide shelter to those affected.
The incident can revive questions about the safety of materials used in outdoor areas of high-rise buildings around the world.
An investigation by the management of the Torch building following its fire in 2015 revealed that most of the damage came from the cladding, the exterior cladding for decoration or insulation.
In Britain, the police said that they believe that the system of panels for insulation and cladding at the London Grenfell Tower in June could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire in which about 80 people died.
No Davis Cup reform: continue best of five
The President of the International Tennis Federation (ITF) has failed at the General Assembly with his great Davis Cup coup.
At the meeting in Ho Chi Minh City, the revolutionary proposal for this sport to play Davis Cup singles on only two winning sets was not supported by the necessary two-thirds majority.
The five-movement classics, which are often very long, but which are also very much appreciated for this reason, are thus retained in the traditional competition.
63.54 percent of the Member States voted in favour of the reform, so the goal of ITF President David Haggerty was scarcely missed.
“We respect this decision, but are disappointed that our member nations have not adopted the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and Fed Cup.
We need a change to secure the long-term future of these iconic and historical competitions,” said Haggerty.
They will continue to work to improve the competitions.
After many objections, it was not until the vote that the proposal was made to carry out the final in a neutral place.
From 2018 onwards, only comparatively smaller details will be available: the finalists in the Davis Cup and Fed Cup will have the right to host the next year in the first round.
In order to reduce the costs for the organizers, requirements for training places etc. will be facilitated and players will have to complete less official media appointments before the Davis Cup.
More than 1 in 5 U.S. travelers bring prohibited items to the plane, finds out a survey
A survey of passengers revealed that more than 20 percent of deliberately or unconsciously prohibited items smuggled past the US Transportation Security Administration checkpoints, including at least 6 percent of the aircraft entered while carrying accidentally prohibited knives or other items with blades.
Less than 1 per cent claimed that they were delayed in discovering that they had travelled by mistake with firearms, ammunition or explosives.
The survey of more than 1,000 people - conducted by a jet charter service, Stratos Jet Charters Inc. - also found that younger travelers are more likely to violate the rules.
Of the respondents who admitted that they knowingly tried to fly with something banned by the TSA, 19.7 percent were millennials, compared to less than 15 percent, who were members of Generation X.
The most common items deliberately delivered to TSA agents were food and liquids.
More than 3 percent admitted to having knowingly carried blades through security, while 2.2 percent of female respondents and 3.7 percent of male respondents also confirmed that they had deliberately brought prohibited drugs onto the plane.
The company said it interviewed travelers across the country to find out how many accidentally brought smuggled goods through airport security and how many would have done it on purpose.
It is no surprise that the people who are most likely to carry smuggled goods - knowingly or unknowingly - by safety were the ones who fly most often.
However, the company points out that the TSA policies are somewhat complicated and confusing.
People are often unsure what liquids they can take with them or how much of them.
So it's no surprise that the largest amount of items confiscated by the TSA are prohibited liquids.
For a while, people thought TSA might consider books as smuggled.
Liquids are permitted on domestic flights, but not on international flights.
Elon Musk Doesn't Matter: Tens of Thousands of Tesla Customers Cancel Order
Electro-Thousand Sassa Elon Musk likes to announce with the huge number of pre-orders for his new Tesla “Model 3”.
So far, he has refused that some of the customers have already withdrawn their non-binding reservation.
In addition to the ever-triumphant figures on sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets, Tesla's boss Elon Musk has, for the first time, revealed a different, less glamorous figure in the announcement of the latest quarterly balance sheet: the number of cancellations in the new mass market model 3.
In recent months, Musk had often advertised the more than 500,000 pre-orders for the new car, the delivery of which is just beginning.
Now Musk admits: Of the total of 518,000 pre-orders, 63,000 have already been withdrawn.
Critics have repeatedly pointed out that these are only non-binding reservations.
In the event of a cancellation, Tesla will fully refund the 1000 Euro (US $1000 and UK £1000) “Reservation Deposit”.
At present 455,000 such non-binding reservations were available, Musk admitted in a conference call with analysts.
However, the Tesla boss does not believe that cancelling around 12 percent of all orders to date could be a problem.
His argument is that the challenge of ambitious growth targets is not demand, but production.
Last year, Tesla delivered 84,000 vehicles.
In 2018 - all models combined - it is expected to be 500,000, and in 2020 it is expected to be a million.
The demand for this is obvious.
According to Musk, there are currently 1800 reservations per day.
If Tesla manages to drive its brand-new production lines, which have never been tested in practice, with maximum utilization without major interruptions, anyone who orders a “Model 3” today can expect delivery at the earliest in the second half of 2018.
Many experts doubt that this is possible.
However, if there are major delays, the non-binding of reservations could become a problem for Tesla.
After all, the company cannot prevent dissatisfied customers from running away in crowds.
EPA leader Pruitt withdraws due to delay in obama era rules to reduce emissions
One day after being sued by 15 states, Scott Pruitt, head of the Environmental Protection Agency, withdrew his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the Obama era rules in order to reduce emissions of air pollutants that cause smog.
Pruitt presented the change as its agency proved to be more responsive to the needs of state environmental authorities than previous administrations.
He did not mention the action brought against his previous position in a Federal Appeal Court.
It is a time limit which will be set on 1 January 2014. In order to comply with the 2015 standards for ground-level ozone, the standard for ozone was completed by the Member States on 1 October.
Pruitt announced in June that he would delay compliance by one year, give his authority more time, study the plan, and avoid “interfering in local decisions or hindering economic growth”.
Pruitt, who was the prosecutor of Oklahoma prior to his appointment by President Donald Trump, has long been a reliable opponent of stricter environmental regulations.
Since his arrival in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly moved on to block or delay regulations that the chemical and fossil fuel industries are opposed to.
The sudden reversal of Wednesday is the recent legal setback for the Pruitt regulatory rollback agenda.
Last month, a federal appellate court in Washington ruled that the EPO administrator exceeded his authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule of the Obama administration that required oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leaks.
In an opinion published on Wednesday evening, Pruitt suggested that its turn of ozone standards simply reinforce CEPOL's willingness to cooperate with states through the complex process of timely compliance with the new standards.
“Under previous administrations, CEPOL has often failed to meet the deadlines for implementation and then waited to be charged by activists and others, and in an agreement to set the deadline for implementation,” said Pruitt, who sued CEPOL more than a dozen times in his previous job.
“We do not believe in regulation through court proceedings, and we take deadlines seriously.
We also take seriously the law and the authority that it gives us.”
Nevertheless, the EPO's opinion said that Pruitt will at some point use his “power of delay and all other legal powers” to ensure that the rules “are based on sound policy and the best available information”.
The Republicans in Congress are pressing for a more comprehensive recast of the ozone rules.
A draft law approved last month is intended to delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years.
The measure has not yet been put to the vote in the Senate.
The New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who led the coalition of the states that sued CEPOL this week, said that the group intended to maintain the legal pressure.
“The reversal of CEPOL - according to our complaints - is an important benefit for the health and safety of these 6.7 million New Yorkers and the more than 115 million Americans directly affected by the smog that flows into their communities,” Schneiderman said.
In this case, New York joined California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington, and the District of Columbia.
Soil ozone occurs when pollutants from cars, power plants, oil refineries, chemical plants and other sources in the atmosphere react to sunlight.
The resulting smog can cause serious breathing problems in sensitive groups of people, and contribute to thousands of premature deaths every year.
Public health representatives and environmentalists rejoiced about Pruitt's surprising change of course.
“It is worrying how much pressure it takes to get this sensible step from the person responsible for protecting the air that we breathe,” Lori Ann Burd of the Center for Biological Diversity said.
“We must continue to fight against the ideological crusade of the Trump government, to engage with polluters and their particular interests”.
Tumlingen celebrates 750 years of St. Hilarius Church
750 years of St. Hilarius Church: On the occasion of the Jubilee of the Mountain Church, the old cemetery area in Tumlingen will be built on Sunday, 16 June. At 4.30 p.m. on July 1, at 4.30 p.m., a serenade was invited.
Whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village is the historic St. Hilarius Resort is a popular place to stay.
Visitors to the sixth Benefiz Serenade can be enchanted by this powerful place.
The rescue and maintenance of the oldest building in the village have made Tumlingens friends and promoters their concern.
Walter Martini emphasizes: “It is a unique village gem”.
In 1267, the St. Hilarius Chapel was first mentioned in the Württemberg document book: Count Hermann von Sulz sold “the mountain with the parish church on it to Tumlingen and the Vogtei” to Magister Eberhard von Horb and his brother Dietrich for 20 marks of silver.
According to the document, in addition to the former parish church, Tumlinger Berg also had a stately court, to which the church or patronage law belonged and not vice versa.
So people lived there, too.
As can be seen from the description of the Upper Office of the City of Freudenstadt of 1858, next to the Lower Village and the Upper Village, which are still visible today in the site of Tumlingen, the “mountain” was the third, the ruling settlement core of the village.
Old maps dating back to around 1600 underpin these historical realities.
The patronage law arose from the early medieval law of the Church.
A Lord who built, equipped, and occupied a church with a priest remained the owner of that church and could inherit that own church.
This entailed the right to appoint a priest or to propose a new priest to the bishop.
There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower.
The larger of the two crushed on Christmas 1673.
The newly acquired bell then first sounded in 1692, but later had to be surrendered in the Second World War in 1942.
In the 30-year war (1616 to 1648), the windows were broken down and the bell ropes were stolen.
The roof was leaking.
In 1796, French troops were located near the church.
They broke out the pulpit and church chairs and used them as firewood.
Remains of the church threatened to collapse in 1809.
Until 1869, the Tumlinger Hilarius cemetery also served as the last resting place for the dead from Hörschweiler.
In 1823, the cemetery was extended and the church of Hilarius was abandoned.
Only the church tower was abandoned.
In the New Year's Eve of 1834, a storm split the church tower and half fell.
In order to prevent misfortune, the tower was broken down.
Only the tower dwarf that still exists today remained a witness to the 750-year-old history of the church.
Today, Horst Kallenberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem of the “Schaffigen Rentnern” succeed Dieter Dockhorn and maintain the Hilarius facility.
As organizers, the friends and promoters invite Tumlingens on Sunday, 16. July, at the sixth serenade on the old cemetery to St. Hilarius Chapel.
This is designed by the combo of the Kepler-Gymnasiums Freudenstadt and with contributions by Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis.
Head of the town Hartmut Romann speaks the final word.
The program starts at 4.30 p.m.
Entrance is from 15:30.
To end the serenade, a drink will take place in front of the cemetery.
“Enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with the wide view over meadows towards the forest”, the organizers highlight the fantastic view.
The serenade takes place only in dry weather.
The organizers hope for many supporters to preserve the historic St. Hilarius plant, which is important for tumles and audiobooks.
Tumlingens friends and promoters feel particularly committed to home care, as Serenade organizer Walter Martini reaffirms.
Association wants approval of wind turbines checked
“Boisheim is defending itself” does not see a legal condition for construction and has therefore turned to the council.
The association “Boisheim is resisting” has called on the council Andreas Coenen (CDU) to withdraw its approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Boisheimer Nette.
It was illegal.
The association argues that, at the time of approval, the No wind turbines could have been approved at the Boisheimer Nette on 31 December 2016, as at the time in Viersen only a wind power concentration zone existed at the city border to Schwalmtal.
Within this concentration zone, the construction and operation of wind turbines are generally possible, but at the same time the concentration zone causes an exclusion of the use of wind energy for the rest of the city.
Such zones should prevent the landscape from being “spared”.
Although the city of Viersen had decided a second wind power concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette a few days earlier by amending the land use plan, it had not been approved by the district government of Düsseldorf because of a faulty form.
“Due to the lack of planning law, the authorisation granted is still illegal and therefore also to be withdrawn,” said Christoph Erkens, Chairman of “Boisheim is resisting”.
State of the art: Before the summer break, the city council again decided on the wind concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette; approval of the district government is pending.
Erkens: “This excludes the granting of an authorisation for the construction of wind turbines in accordance with planning law”.
The circle confirms the receipt of the request.
“The correspondence has been received by the District of Viersen since last week,” said a speaker.
The circle takes it as an opportunity to re-examine the matter.
However, they are not likely to cause the procedure to be stopped.
In view of ongoing proceedings at the Administrative Court, the district did not want to comment on the content of the argument of the association “Boisheim fends off” on Thursday.
NEW Re, a subsidiary of NEW, plans to build four 200-metre-high wind turbines on an area at Boisheimer Nette.
Last year, the company, in which the city of Viersen is indirectly involved, had concluded lease contracts with the owner of the approximately 65 hectares of land.
With the construction of the four wind turbines, the electricity demand of around 11 400 households can be met - this corresponds to about one fifth of the electricity demand of all four households.
NEW Re wants to invest around 20 million euros.
Last summer, the City Council of Viersen gave the green light for the purchase of three wind turbines in the Linnich wind farm near Aachen, as well as a participation in a wind turbine in Übach-Palenberg in the Heinsberg district.
Car and tractor crashing together: woman dies in terrible accident
A terrible road accident occurred on the L 333 between Niederwallmenach and Bogel (Rhein-Lahn-Kreis) on Friday morning around 10 a.m.
A woman was wounded fatally.
Two more people were slightly injured.
The state road remained closed for hours.
According to police figures, a 17-year-old young woman from Bornich and her passenger car took the L 333 towards Bogel as part of the accompanying ride with her 53-year-old mother.
City and merchants plan “home shopping” weekend
Bad Langensalzaer and people from the region should rediscover the shopping opportunities in the city centre in September.
The trade association and the municipal administration want to spend the weekend on the 8th and 9th of September. September to entice the residents to shopping in the city centre.
As the chairman of the trade association, Christian König, announced, the “home shopping” weekend is intended to raise the awareness of customers about what offers their own city has to offer outside the usual supermarket goods.
A market with regional suppliers, similar to the weekly market, is therefore planned.
In addition, local companies will present themselves with their apprenticeship positions.
In addition, the shops in the city centre are to invite you to “midnight shopping”.
The action is not only targeted at residents of the city and the surrounding region.
In preparation are commercials on the radio, an internet video and printed bags that indicate the action weekend, according to Christian König.
The municipal administration and trade association cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry.
This will take the business association and the city to another stage of the “Attractive city center” project.
These include new offers such as the first “active day” of the fountain festival, including a Sunday open for sale, discussions with all traders and hosts to encourage them to participate actively.
Attractive offers on Saturday and the waiver of parking charges on that day are also part of the concept.
In addition, customer potentials should be re-opened or re-opened.
These include spa guests and tourists.
But also many locals would have lost sight of the city centre when shopping.
In the end, everyone would have to help to revive the city centre - to landlords, the businesses of the whole city and associations.
It was a good idea to use a network to overcome the lethargy that had spread in part, King said in the spring.
Birgit Streich, head of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry Center in Mühlhausen, announced that five cities in Thuringia are participating for the first time on the third “home shopping” day throughout Germany.
In addition to Bad Langensalza, these are Weimar, Sömmerda, Heiligenstadt and Bleicherode.
The day should “promote the appreciation of local trade and emphasise its importance for the common good of our cities,” says Streich.
The action under the leadership of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry and with many partners also makes it clear that every citizen can influence his or her own direct environment with his or her purchasing behaviour.
Two dead and several injured after explosion at US school
During construction work, a gas explosion occurred in the school building.
New people were injured.
In a gas explosion in the US city of Minneapolis, two people were killed and nine more were injured, some of them heavy.
According to the fire brigade, on Wednesday (local time), there was still an injured person in critical condition.
A person died when part of a school building collapsed during the explosion.
An initially missing person was later also recovered dead.
The dead were employees of the school.
As a cause of misfortune, the authorities suspected work on a gas pipeline.
Only a few people stayed in the Minnehaha Academy building during the holiday season.
Trump pressed after leaked transcripts of phone calls to Mexico due to payment of border wall
Transcripts of telephone calls between US President Donald Trump and leaders of Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post.
On 27. On 1 January, Trump, in a telephone conversation with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto, urged him to stop publicly saying that he would not pay for a planned border wall.
The US president insinuated him for publicly denouncing the wall. Reportedly, he said to him, “You can't tell the press.”
Trump started his presidential campaign with the promise of building a wall on the southern border of the US, and vowed to have Mexico pay for the project.
Transcripts of his first call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull were also published and revealed a tense exchange.
Mr. Mr. Trump said Mr. Turnbull said that trade for the US refugees emigrating to Australia was “ridiculous”, “nasty” and “stupid” and that the existence of trade mediated by the Obama government would make him look like a “depp” after proposing a ban on the resettlement of refugees to the US.
Mr. Mr. Trump ended the call after he told Mr. Turnbull, “this is the most unpleasant call for the whole day.”
Moore's Ford massacre: activists reinstate racist lynchact as a call for justice
A 1948 Ford Mercury drove through a group of spectators in rural Monroe, Georgia, rumbling towards the Ford bridge of Moore.
Before the car, which had four black passengers and a white driver, could reach the bridge, a group of white men with rifles emerged to block his way.
The leader of the mob - a middle-aged man in a pinstripe suit - took a long train on his cigar and looked through the windshield.
Inside, the inmates floated in fear.
“We want this n - r Roger!” the man yelled.
“Get him out of the car!”
Screaming torn the silence when a young black man was dragged from the passenger's seat.
Fortunately, this terrible scene, which took place on 22. July was played, just a recreation.
But when a noose is thrown around the neck of “Roger”, almost everyone in the audience exuded very real sigh.
Since 2005, civil rights activists have come back to Moore's Ford Bridge to imitate the night when two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and Mae Murray Dorsey - were lynched by Ku Klux Klan in 1946.
No one's ever been charged with the murders.
“It's really inconceivable that not a single person has been arrested in all these years - although we see them in our communities, although we know who they are,” said Tyrone Brooks, who helps organize the follow-up.
“It's a stain on a story, but it's a burden on our souls.”
Brooks is a 71-year-old former congressman of the State of Georgia and a life-long civil rights activist.
For him, the rectification serves as a dramatic call to action and represents an annual reminder to the Monroe community that an injustice has never been corrected.
“We want law enforcement, we want termination, we want healing, we want reconciliation, but first we need to get justice,” he said.
“We cannot reach healing and reconciliation until we receive justice.”
A coroner puts a sheet over the body of one of the victims of the Moore Ford Lynchen on 27. July 1946.
According to FBI files received from NBC News, more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding counties were suspected in the lynching process.
But no one has ever been charged.
Although the suspects have been at large for decades, civil rights people say that the double motivation for the lynch actions throughout the city has always been known: politics and sex.
In April 1946, a decision of the Supreme Court allowed the black citizens of Georgia to vote for the first time in the summer pre-election campaign.
Approximately at the same time as the election, according to the FBI, the black farm guard Roger Malcom stabbed a white landowner, Barnett Hester, during a fight - allegedly because of a woman.
Brooks said the rumor in town was that Hester slept with Malcom's wife Dorothy and that the baby she wore didn't come from her husband.
On 25. On July 1, 1946, Loy Harrison, a prominent white landowner, paid 600 dollars to free Malcom from prison, according to the FBI.
He was accompanied to prison by Dorothy and her cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey.
But when they moved away from prison and approached Moore's Ford Bridge, a Lynchmob surrounded the car.
“As it turns out, it was Harrison who prepared and ordered the murders,” concludes an FBI report.
“It is also obvious that there was a plot between the state and local prosecution, which was not only involved in the murders, eliminated evidence and covered up the identity of witnesses”.
Brooks makes it even more concise.
“It was an electoral massacre,” he said.
“They were all killed to send a message to black people in this community: “If you register and vote, this will happen to you.”
For almost a decade, Cassandra Greene has led the annual re-enact of the Moore Ford Bridge Lynch murders.
Their portrayal is vivid, poignant and is based on a kind of deep racism that many would like to believe no longer exists in America.
It's hard to watch, and it's even harder to look away, but Greene said that's the point.
“We don't want to talk about lynching, because then we're confronted with its ugliness in all of us,” she said.
“But I can't establish a relationship with you if you don't want to listen to me or don't want to hear what I've been through.”
The rehearsals for this year's production began in June, and on the first day, almost 30 actors - a dozen white and the rest black - pushed into a room and listened when Greene started a well-established overview of the piece.
Wade Marbaugh is Greene's co-director.
He has played the role of chief clan member for years, but he said the role never gets easier.
“I feel dirty because I'm not like that,” Marbaugh said.
“But I think it's very important to keep this story alive because we don't want to go back to those times.”
Actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, who play Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester, tried their lines on the other side of the room.
The play begins with Malcom, who yells at Hester and pushes him, angry that he slept with his wife Dorothy.
“I said, n - he, get away from my property!”
Rascona replied to the fire.
There's a break.
And then everyone (at least all black actors) breaks out in laughter.
Greene laughs loudest.
“What?” asked Rascona.
He's alarmed and confused.
Was I too hard?
“No,” Greene said, still giggling.
“I just don't think white people said he was.”
“Yes,” one of the other black performers joked.
“All you have to do is hit the hard 'R.'.”
And that's where the energy in space shifts, a sense of comradeship replaces the discomfort.
Everyone is busy getting this right, not only because of the game, but also because of the memory of the four people killed.
The scene starts again.
This time, when Rascona says the N word, he says it sharply and forcefully.
Absolutely no one laughs.
This repetition ends violently and quickly.
There are screams, shots and then silence.
A woman dressed in a mourning dress stands over the bodies of the actors and performs Billie Holidays grieving praise “Strange Fruit”.
Her voice breaks every second word.
About a hundred meters behind it, a group of about four dozen viewers wipes sweat and tears out of their eyes.
The audience is almost evenly divided between black and white.
A couple arrived from Ithaca, New York, to see the performance, many come down the street only.
They have all experienced Georgia's pressing moisture for almost eight hours when Brooks takes her on a pilgrimage to the tombs of the Malcoms and Dorseys.
Up to that point, the murders have remained an anecdote, but now that you're in the same country where the Lynch murders took place, the air feels spooky.
When the last notes of the song end, Greene invites the crowd to come closer and inspect the corpse.
Children squat at their heads, register the fake blood and the silent bodies and whisper to each other.
“They're not really dead,” a little boy mumbles as if he wanted to remember.
After a few minutes, Greene thanks the crowd - and suddenly it's over.
The actors throw the lynch rope away and wipe their tears.
Bradshaw hugs Marbaugh, the man in the suit who played the clan member.
Nick Rascona embraces two of his fellow players and then collapses in her arms crying, the emotional burden of the performance finally breaks through with him.
“It's okay,” one of the women whispers.
“We know that is not in your heart.
You did this for a reason.”
Later, the audience will sit down with the actors for dinner.
At a table, a white couple from Atlanta is talking about the recreation with a black pair they just met.
Denise Duplinski struggled to find words that felt the performance.
“It's hard to hear these terrible words and deeds coming from people who look like you and who do that because they look like you,” she said.
“What this really does to me makes me believe that lynching is still going on,” she added, “today it's just called police shooting.”
In the same room, Tyrone Brooks Hof holds his table, eats and reminds of civil rights.
He said he's already started planning the performance next year.
“The recreation is somewhat inspiring, because it describes the horror of what we have suffered, but it is also a moment of learning,” he said.
“It's like if we don't learn from it, it can happen again.
Those who do not study their own history, those who do not know their own history, are condemned to repeat them.”
“Divine Dawn” reconciled the Wagnerians in Bayreuth
Also in the fourth part of Richard Wagner's monumental work, director Frank Castorf relies on a colourful and frivolous staging against a gigantic six-story backdrop.
The revolving stage (designed by Aleksandar Denic) features either a shabby street corner with brick rest and dönerbude in Berlin, a “Plaste und Elaste” logo from GDR times or the New York Stock Exchange.
Before that, there is an open Mercedes classic car in which the Rheindaughters pose as Rockergirls, or alternatively an Isetta.
Stacked oil barrels are reminiscent of Castorf's leitmotif - money, power and greed - which draws through his “ring” staging.
The three Rhine daughters - sung by Stephanie Houtzeel, Wiebke Lehmkuhl and Alexandra Steiner - harmonize like in the “Rheingold”.
Kess seduce Siegfried (Stefan Vinke), tug a body in Hollywood style into the trunk and give the Krawallo clique.
Stephen Milling sings the gorgeous nasty hagen that surrounds the aura of a heavyweight boxer.
Brutally the scene when he slaps Siegfried.
Later, Gunther (Markus Eiche) has to believe in it.
The audience thanks the ensemble with strong applause.
Foster, Milling, Vinke and conductor Janowski are celebrated stormy, who humbly bends his hands to form the Merkel diamond.
There is great applause for the festival orchestra, which shows itself for the first time on stage - in view of the great heat again in casual casual clothing.
The performance of Frank Castorf and his registration team was highly anticipated.
In 2013, if he had to make a bark-in-a-pipe concert, five years later, there was great cheer in which the occasional “buh” cries went down.
Festival director Katharina Wagner should have been pleased about this.
“One realizes that the audience has grown together with the “ring” in a way,” she said shortly before the performance of the dpa.
The audience did not only make a form of peace with Castorf, but it also grew an understanding of its point of view.
I'm drawing a positive summary.
Max Menge works as a volunteer
They work in several places in their volunteer year.
Where in the world?
Quantity: Usually in steinfurt in the furniture exchange, once a week I help out here in Greven in the furniture bridge.
And I've been working at the school all day long.
What are your experiences with this?
Qty: It's a nice, wide spectrum I see here.
I deal with different people, with young people, with refugees, with young adults.
You are now 26 years old, a late volunteer.
How's that coming?
Qty: I graduated from high school.
And then a civil engineering degree, let's say, successfully canceled.
I realized for myself that it's the wrong thing for me, and I want to do something else, work with people.
And then I wondered what you're doing.
Make a social year, there is an insight, there you can see how it really is on the spot, at the focal point maybe, too.
And was it?
Qty: I've collected great impressions.
I'm going to start my studies in social services in the winter semester.
I will study dual, probably do a social worker training at the Herne Youth Office and study in Hamm at the University of Applied Sciences.
Isn't it a little unusual to have several different locations during volunteer service?
Quantity: Yes, it is very variable.
It probably always depends on where you make your FSJ.
You can do it from retirement home to youth work - in all sorts of facets of social work.
It was very varied with me.
I was also partially in OGS, in other words, in the afternoon care.
For me, that was just the thing that irritated me.
I could see my own strengths and see how it really works.
Unlike in Civil Engineering?
Quantity: Of course, this isn't about calculating statics.
You always have other people in front of you, who each have a completely different story behind them.
Whether a refugee, a teenager who has been taken out of the family - you always have to deal with it individually.
Very interesting.
And you had no fear of touch?
Quantity: I'm not the type for that.
It's an area that gives you a lot.
Lots of love, lots of kindness.
There are sometimes negative moments, but so life is.
Pearson cuts more 3,000 jobs and cuts dividends to revive business
The British education group Pearson said on Friday that it will reduce another 3,000 jobs and cut its interim dividend by 72 percent, as another restructuring programme will be launched to overcome the pressure that the company is facing.
The reduction in the number of jobs announced by Director General John Fallon for the most part at the end of 2018 and the beginning of 2019 is in addition to his previous restructuring, which has already lost 4,000 jobs.
Pearson announced in May a third cost reduction program a further £300 million ($394 million) cost reduction plan to revive a business hit by the rapid digital learning step.
The company, which sold its stake in Penguin Random House to its partner Bertelsmann last month, said that the outlook for the financial year was unchanged after an increase of 1 percent to £2.05 billion in the first half of the year.
Kabul convoy attack: NATO soldier killed in suicide attack
A suicide bomber attacked a military convoy in the Afghan capital Kabul, killed a Nato soldier and injured several others, officials say.
Five soldiers and one interpreter had been injured, a statement by NATO informed.
According to unconfirmed local reports, three civilians also died in the incident in the Qarabagh district.
The bombing is the last violent act that Afghanistan hit this month - on Tuesday, more than 30 people were killed in a mosque in Herat.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
NATO's statement states that the explosion occurred on Thursday evening when a joint patrol with the Afghan army was attacked by an “person-carried improvised explosive device”.
The statement states that all injured are in a stable state and are being treated in the U.S. military hospital at Bagram airfield.
Correspondents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group known as the so-called Islamic State (IS) in Qarabagh is a major concern for NATO troops in nearby Bagram.
According to the United Nations, there were at least 1,662 civilian deaths in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, of which about 20% were in the capital.
At the end of July, a suicide car bomb killed at least 30 people in a mainly Shiite district of Kabul.
The Taliban said they carried out this attack.
On 31. On May 1, a massive bombing in the city center killed more than 150 people with the country's deadliest militant attack since the US-led troops displaced the Taliban from power in 2001.
Violence underlines the precarious security situation in Afghanistan as US President Donald Trump weighs up the number of US troops supporting the military and police in the country.
Correspondents say that the suicide bombings in Kabul in recent weeks have also caused a crisis of public confidence in the government, its policies and, in particular, in the reputation of President Ashraf Ghani.
CEPOL reverses decision to delay the smog rule following complaints
The US Environmental Protection Agency has lifted a decision to delay regulation by the Obama Government, which requires states to reduce smog-causing emissions. This took place one day after 15 states sued the agency for the step.
CEPOL announced late on Wednesday the decision to advance the so-called “ozone provisions 2015” and said it demonstrates the Agency's commitment to cooperate with states.
“We believe in dialogue with and in responding to our state partners,” said EPO Chief Scott Pruitt in a statement.
In June, Pruitt announced the intention of CEPOL to delay the ozone rules - which are intended to measure emissions of pollutants in part of the country in order to determine where incisions need to be made in order to comply with stricter air quality standards - by one year until October 2018.
A group of 15 mostly democratic states, along with the district of Colombia, filed a lawsuit on Tuesday saying that the effort was illegal.
The government of President Donald Trump has tried to reverse a wide range of environmental requirements imposed by former President Barack Obama, as part of a broader agenda, which Trump claims will boost economic growth.
However, efforts have triggered the setback of democrats and nature protection groups who are concerned about the impact of major emissions on public health.
The EPA website says that inhalation of air that contains ozone “can reduce lung function and increase respiratory symptoms” such as asthma.
Local council wants common room
In the end, the decision was clear: in the event of two votes against, the Municipal Council of Fluorn-Winzeln decides to set up a Community area in the future elderly residence.
Before the discussion, there is an important information: the purchase contract for the remaining part of the property is signed, reports Mayor Bernhard Tjaden.
Although it will still be a long time before the area of the parish is in the parish's possession, there is now no obstacle to planning the project to be undertaken by a private investor.
There is a debate on this in relation to a Community area.
One of the two investors still in the boat offered to meet the community.
On the ground floor it would provide a living space - about 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with at least 70 square meters of space for a special price.
The administration and the majority of the municipal council pretend that such a communal area should not be provided as a meeting place only for the residents of senioric living, but openly into the municipality.
As an example, the word of the “knitting café” made the round.
The decision that was made by allocating funds to the current budget last autumn will be supported by funding opportunities.
The building is located in the rehabilitation area.
According to Tjaden, the establishment of a Community area would be eligible at 60 percent of 30 percent.
In order to signal to the investor that he does not want to throw a stick between his legs in this respect, the proposal provides for the statement that both saddle - which is based on the surrounding construction - and console roof - would be possible, which reduces the height of the saddle and makes the construction more economical.
Needless to say, it is not just Wilfried Sohmer who thinks this addition is.
If it helps, unanimously he passes the board.
It is not that easy for the common room.
Daniela Ruf refers to the many buildings with which one cannot make a very good progress, for this one is now leaning out of the window at the common room, she says: “I am doing so hard”.
Yvonne Staiger strongly advocates the common area - but absolutely opposed to local participation.
It sees behind it a concealed subsidy to already wealthy or even foreign investors.
That is not the case, because the acquisition of the area does not give a grant, but rather gives a real, in case of doubt marketable value, is the counterspeech.
Staiger's request to split the proposal for a decision accordingly finds three supporters.
This remains the case with two votes against the original programme, which Stefan Haller sums up in the following way: “If we take the decision in this way, we are taking a huge step towards closing a huge gap in our infrastructure”.
Collision with car: cyclist thrown on road
When crossing the road, an 82-year-old cyclist was captured by a car in Garath on Wednesday and severely injured.
According to the police, the 82-year-old Langenfelder had been on the bike path of the Schwarzer Weg road from Hilden at 12.20 p.m.
The senior wanted to cross the road at the height of the street Am Buchholzer Busch.
A passenger car driver in the same direction gave him priority.
When the Langenfelder drove onto the road, however, he apparently did not look out for the oncoming traffic.
He met with a car that was driving a 66-year-old Hildenerin.
The man was thrown into the street.
He suffered serious injuries and was taken to a hospital with a rescue cart.
FC Bayern Munich has to renounce David Alaba and Thiago in the Supercup against Borussia Dortmund
The Supercup takes place without him: David Alaba has to let the game go against Dortmund.
With personnel care, FC Bayern will travel to Dortmund for the first compulsory game of the new season.
Seven pros are missing the title defender in the Supercup against the Cup winner.
Personnel care at the German football record champion Bayern Munich is growing before the Supercup on Saturday (20.30 o'clock/ZDF and Eurosport) at cup winner Borussia Dortmund.
Trainer Carlo Ancelotti must also renounce David Alaba in the match with the BVB.
That was confirmed by the Italian on Friday.
Munich's Manuel Neuer, James, Thiago, Jerome Boateng, Arjen Robben and Juan Bernat are also missing.
For the five defeats in the past six test games, Ancelotti has blamed the physical condition and the lack of balance in the game of his team.
“We know that we are not in the best physical condition,” Ancelotti said, adding, “The most important point is balance in the team.
It wasn't good last time.”
However, the 58-year-old believes in an increase in performance in the first official compulsory game of the season.
“Football is also tactics, strategy, personality and motivation.
I have great confidence that my team shows these qualities.
The crew is ready.
We want to play intelligently,” said Ancelotti, who expects a “difficult, intense game”.
The duel of the two German football heavyweights captivates fans.
The game is sold out with 81,360 spectators, the German Football League (DFL) announced on Friday.
Hiking in the resin from star to star
The first “star path” is to be created in the resin throughout Germany.
The association Sternwarte Sankt Andreasberg plans this.
There is a planetary path in Göttingen - since 2003.
A “star path” meets the information needs of many resin visitors, it was called.
It connects nature, science, movement and sporting performance.
Members want to set up boards along the planned route and inform about stars and constellations.
In a first phase until 2018, the association plans “easy-to-reach installations in five to six locations” in the Upper Harz region.
The question would be St. Andreasberg, Braunlage, Hohegeiß and Sieber.
The information on the boards is to be supplemented via the Internet.
Therefore, good mobile network reception plays a role in the selection of locations.
Accessibility is also a criterion.
Later, the star path will be extended by train.
“On the starpath, viewers learn a lot of interesting facts, for example about the physics of the individual stars,” the association explained.
They also learned why stars have different colors or why one star is more luminous than another, even though it is much farther away.
It also shows in which constellation a selected star is located and when it is best to see.
The association has been operating since 2014 in the mountain town of St. Andreasberg is the highest observatory in northern Germany.
The location in the heart of the Harz National Park is one of the six darkest regions in Germany, according to the Federal Office of Nature Conservation.
Often from there, the Milky Way and even the Andromeda galaxy can be seen clearly with the naked eye.
Since 2003, at the initiative of the sponsoring association Planetarium Göttingen, there has been something similar to the planned Starwerg - the Planetenweg.
Starting in front of Gebhard's hotel in the Goetheallee, which forms the interior of our solar system, the planetary path with its stelae leads up to the Hainberg and the observatory - as well as an “alien” location in Diemarden (parish of the same) with the planet Sedna.
The steles with the individual planets - including the Pluto degraded to the dwarf planet at the endpoint - are positioned exactly at the distance and scale of one to two billion.
The earth shrinks to a sphere of 6.5 millimeters in diameter, while the sun, which is exactly 75 meters away, measures 70 centimeters.
The entire distance of the planetary path is about four kilometers.
While the light from the sun to the Pluto takes about eight hours, pedestrians need a good hour to the stele with Pluto.
So pedestrians are faster than the light in space.
The march to the next fixed star, however, would take another half a year.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for the first time, discuss a possible showdown
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who were supposed to stand in a collision course to stage the most exciting boxing fight in the near future below 147 pounds, met for the first time on Thursday.
They were in separate rooms in ESPN offices in Los Angeles until Garcia, the undefeated World Boxing Council lightweight champion, went down the hallway to welcome Lomachenko, the World Boxing Organization Super Feather Weight champion.
After Garcia's victory by unanimous resolution over former four-division world champion Adrien Broner on Saturday at Showtime, both fighters are members of the Top Five Pound-for-Pound list.
Garcia stretched out his right hand and said, “How are you, champion?
I wish you good luck.”
Lomachenko defends his belt against Miguel Marriaga on Saturday night at 7 pm on ESPN.
When the couple posed for photos, Lomachenko manager Egi Klimas noticed that a possible showdown between the fighters would be the “perfect order of magnitude”.
“I am a former feather weight,” Garcia recalled.
“I climbed up to 140 pounds for Broner, but I'm not that big.
I'm small for 140.
I want to get down to lightweight.
And he must move on lightweight [135 pounds] and then we fight.
That's what fans want.
Let's give them that.”
Lomachenko agreed.
“Boxing needs this fight.”
Klimas asked if it should be on pay-per-view, part of a strategy that Lomachenko has to fight with a 135-pound debut this year, to agree next summer with Garcia a date (37-0, 30 knockouts) which is also interested in the fight against the winner of Jorge Linares-Luke Campbell after their lightweight title fight in the forum on 23. September.
“This fight could take place in pay-per-view mode because all fans asked for it,” Garcia said, and later openly expressed himself struggling with the network that offers the best financial package.
We're the best.
No other names can generate this kind of attention.
Whenever they're ready . . . “”
Garcia said he appreciates Lomachenko as “an enormous fighter,” and he may participate in his Saturday fight.
But Lomachenko stopped at the generous praise for Garcia and said that he thought the three-battle champion from Riverside “looks very slow, I'm sorry Mikey... you wanted the co-off”.
Garcia said the focus was to show impact strength, then boxing.
They both said they could feel the momentum that was building up for their own struggle.
“This is the battle that needs to be carried out.
No other fight creates so much attention and enthusiasm.
I'm more than happy to work on it,” Garcia said.
Lomachenko said: “I waited for the top fighters, and this is Mikey.
It will be a great fight.”
Four injured by tyre placer
In an accident on the A7, on Thursday afternoon four people were seriously injured in part.
According to the first information, the driver of an Opel Zafira probably lost control of his vehicle after a tyre placer around 16:30 just before the market-wide junction.
The car hurled to the right into the embankment, where it overflowed and then remained on the roof in the green strip.
The four inmates - two adults and two children - were severely injured in the accident.
During the initial rescue service of the injured, the A7 was closed to the north for about an hour, after which traffic on the left lane could be passed by the accident site.
Fortunas Hoffmann: “Triple chain works better”
Andre Hoffmann hopes after the 2:2 season opener against Braunschweig that optimizing the defensive formation in Aue will bring points.
Andre Hoffmann was satisfied with the first season match, and the result would not have been the two opponent goals in the 2:2 against Braunschweig.
“These were two opponent gates too much, and we need to be even more careful in Aue,” says the defender of Fortuna Düsseldorf.
In the Erzgebirge, the triple chain is also to be further optimized.
And a goal after a free kick, the fortunes no longer want to capture themselves.
“For the future, it will be that no one stands on the line next to Michael (Rensing).”
Hoffmann is convinced that his team will be able to cope with the three-chain even after the experience in the preparation, rather than with the four-chain.
“I still don't know how we're going to act in Aue,” says his coach Friedhelm Funkel, but Hoffmann is sure of his business, “because we have players who can build well in the three-way chain on the half positions in Kaan Ayhan and Niko Gießelmann,” Hoffmann said.
“The prerequisite is, but that we harmonize even better and that we do not afford so many playback errors in construction.”
Of course Hoffmann also drives to Aue to win the game.
“Whether you can talk about a failed start after a draw, however, does not know.
The performance could be quite okay,” Hoffmann said.
“However, if we can stand with four points on Sunday and focus on the cup, we will certainly be able to talk about a proper season start.”
His coach didn't want to know about that.
“I only judge the start of the season after six to eight days of playing,” said Friedhelm Funkel, who does not want to speak of an advantage over Aue, just because the game of Saxons in Heidenheim had to be cancelled prematurely because of a severe weather.
“Now they can almost start the season with a home game,” said Sparkler and Hoffmann believes that Aue players might even be a little fresher, as they wouldn't have a heavy and complete game like Fortuna against an ascent favorite in their bones.
“But they don't know exactly where they are at the moment,” says Fortuna's defender.
While the guests from the Rhineland are a light favourite on Sunday in the meeting at the finally (almost) finished stadium of Aue.
“That we sweep them away just because we have the right to get among the first six is nonsense,” says Funkel, whose record is quite positive with only one defeat against Aue from nine games.
“There is no team in the 2nd Bundesliga, which must be beaten from the outset,” explains Fortuna's head coach.
“Making such a statement would be arrogant and arrogant.”
And so Sparkles does not want to experience his players on Sunday.
New results of Swedish asylum age assessment tests published
Recent results from tests for asylum seekers in Sweden, which have undergone a new method of assessing their age, show that more than 80 percent of the people tested are older than 18 years. But not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results.
The Swedish Forensic Medicine Authority (Rättsmedicinalverket) started the tests last year.
During the asylum procedure, they should clarify the assessment of age after the Swedish Migration Authority (migration cadavers) has been criticised for errors in assessing the correct age of some of the refugees who were under-age.
To date, Migration Ket has sent 6,880 cases to be tested, and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now completed a total of 2,481 tests from mid-March to 31 December. July 2017 published.
Eighty percent (2002) were judged to be 18 or older, while in another 25 cases the Forensic Medicine Agency assessed that the person was “possibly 18 years of age or older.”
In 432 cases, the conclusion was that the person “may be under 18 years of age”.
The tests are carried out only in cases where the age of the person is questioned.
According to Johan Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency, the results have been consistent over the past few months.
“We don't see a big difference in the statistics of the past months, the numbers are quite constant,” he said to The Local magazine.
The high proportion of cases in which the person was judged to be over 18 does not necessarily mean that the asylum seeker lied about his age.
In May, the Agency published the results of 581 tests and said that there are 442 cases “suggesting that the investigated person is 18 years of age or older”.
When the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet examined the 581 published results, it found that in 243 of these cases the person had frankly said that she would be 18 this year.
The method of medical age assessment in which X-rays of wisdom teeth and MRI shots of knee joints are taken, which are then analyzed by dentists and radiologists, has also been criticized in some areas.
A sceptic is the endocrinologist Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute, whose work involves assessing the biological maturity of people to see if they sooner or later than usual went through puberty.
“I had reason to think about it, and I don't think the type of measurement should be used.
Judging biological age in this way is very uncertain.
If we can't say it for sure, we shouldn't pretend we could,” he told Metro.
Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency, however, defended the accuracy of the tests: “In general, you can say that the risk of inaccurately judging a child as an adult is low.
The greatest risk is if the person is just under 18, in this case this is about 10 percent.”
Full plan
Work on the three bridges of Landstraße 108 between Lauterbach and Schramberg is progressing well.
On Wednesday, a seven-ton concrete section was installed at the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lauterbach.
“We are very good at the time, it's going great,” says Reinhold Leicht, construction manager at the Department of Road Engineering and Transport in the government presidency of Fribourg.
In April, the work started simultaneously on all three bridges between Schramberg and Lauterbach that need to be rehabilitated.
The end of construction is scheduled for October and it is easy to be sure that the timetable is met.
The first bridge, coming from Schramberg, leads over the Trombach.
It is a concrete arched bridge, covered with red coloured sandstone and has a total length of 4.80 meters.
It was built in 1900.
Like the other two bridges, it has now come to the years.
In order to ensure stability and road safety, the three buildings are now being thoroughly renovated.
The other two bridges lead over the Lauterbach stream.
They are made of red coloured sandstone.
Both were built in 1939 and are 12, respectively 10.60 meters long.
The bridge at the entrance of Lauterbach on Wednesday morning on the north side has now received a 1.30 m wide and seven tons heavy so-called bridge cap.
This is a edge attachment which is also used as a route of operation.
On Friday, a 2.20-metre wide bridge cap is to be used on the southern part of the bridge.
Then the pedestrian path should run.
The special feature is that these are finished parts, a patent of the Schramberg company Dizwo.
The other two bridges are already equipped with the patented bridge caps.
The installation of cables through the building in Lauterbach required a special feeling of fingertips.
There is also a fibre-optic cable, to which many companies are connected.
The residents were informed of the project in advance of the work by handouts.
In addition, fish and crabs had to be fished first.
For the bridges between the Bauhofgebäude and the Sammelweiher in the direction of Schramberg, traffic is regulated one lane by a traffic light.
The road in the area of the bridge at the height of the “Tannenhof” and “Sieben Linden” hotels is fully closed for construction work on the bridge at the entrance to Lauterbach.
The total cost of the three bridge relocations is 700 000 euros.
The whole thing is financed by the country.
AfD in Gerolstein: Colorful protest with German potato salad
It does not happen so often that parties pull together, but when it comes to the alternative for Germany (AfD) comes together, which is otherwise difficult to reconcile.
The parties represented in the Vulkaneifel Circle Day (CDU, SPD, Grüne, FDP, FWG, Left) are part of a broad alliance that peacefully flags this day, because the AfD in the Gerolsteiner Stadthalle Rondell invites you to the poster “big campaign start”.
And it's the start of well-known names - like Alice Weidel, who, together with Alexander Gauland, will be the top duo for the Bundestag election on 24 January. , and Deputy President Beatrix von Storch.
But those who are already on the ground hours before the start of the event do not want to listen to the AfD, but demonstrate.
The motto “The Eifel remains colorful”.
Originally, the city picnic was planned under the motto “all at one table” on the fountain square, but now takes place in the parking lot below the roundell - and thus directly in front of those who come to the AfD event in the city hall.
A colorful picture that is there.
And what Christa Karoli, chairman of the forum A World and one of the authoritative organizers, really pleased: “Great how many people have gathered here”.
There's music and plenty of food, including a “German potato salad that the AfD could eat without any problems,” says the woman who brought him.
The police have ordered many officials to Gerolstein, showing presence especially at the railway station, which is only a few meters away from the venues.
How did the AfD get to Gerolstein?
Mario Hompes of the AfD Vulkaneifel reported that he had made an effort to organise such an event and was awarded the contract.
The 45-year-old from Gönnersdorf first asked in Daun, but got a cancellation there because there was not enough parking space due to the already built Laurentiuskirmes.
So now the round, Hompes is pleased that “we can have such a nice event here”.
Looking at the event on the roundabout, he says: “This is the good right of people, the main thing, it remains peaceful”.
At around 8 p.m., a band provides entertainment at the front of the Rondellvorplatz, and in the Stadthalle there are various speakers, including the Rhine-Palatine AfD chairman Uwe Junge.
In the hall there are about 200 listeners waiting for the top candidate for the Bundestag election, Alice Weidel, and the Deputy President Beatrix von Storch to make their speeches.
The police presence is unchanged, but so far the officials had a quiet evening.
The AfD event lasts a little more than an hour, the guests in the front seat have a longer breath, but there too is to be cleaned up shortly after 9 pm.
The police can move away - no special incidents.
Trombone meets trumpet
A reunion with the Wolfacher trombonist Frederic Belli is available in the series Haslacher Klosterkonzerte tomorrow, Sunday, at 8 pm in the monastery church.
Together with the Bulgarian trumpet Miroslav Petkov he gives a concert under the motto “Black Sea meets Black Forest”, or even “Balkan folklore” meets a classical German education with roots in wind music.
Both soloists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and have solo positions in top European orchestras.
Petkov is a solo trumpet with the renowned Concertgebouw Orchestra Amsterdam and Frederic Belli is a solo solo musician of the SWR Symphony Orchestra.
Both combine the desire not only to cross the boundaries of their instruments, but also to merge the boundaries of different genres.
Thus Johann Sebastian Bach sounds like in a new garment, Daniel Schnyder's “world music” unites with Bulgarian folklore, and in the piece “Exchange Suite” by jazz echo laureate Nils Wogram, classical music, jazz and free play combine to create a fascinating overall work of art.
This core of the programme was premiered only this spring with huge success in Fribourg.
The renowned composer Nils Wogram wrote it especially for the two musicians and even more: the Haslacher Klosterkirche with its special acoustics is consciously involved in the concert.
Kristen Stewart talks about her bisexuality
“Some people love grilled cheese and will eat it until the end of their lives.
But I want to try it all,” says Kristen Stewart quite frankly about her bisexuality.
“Once I bite in grilled cheese, I think: 'Oh that was cool, what's next?'.
The most well-known relationship of the Hollywood star was that of her “Twilight” colleague Robert Pattinson, who eventually disassembled bitter.
Despite all this, the brunette actress assures the “Harper's Bazaar” magazine: “I was seriously in love with everyone I dated.
Or do you think I played it?”
After her separation, Kristen admitted that she was bisexual: “I have always lived and believed in dualism seriously.
So it has never confused or hindered me.
I just never liked being taken seriously.”
According to “Bang Showbiz”, she suffered particularly from this, but in school time, when she preferred to dress like a boy: “Not all girls are typical girls.
That really hurt me.
When I was 11, the kids told me I'd look like a boy.
I felt really attacked, scared and ashamed.
Now I look back and think to myself, 'Girl, be proud of you.'
Especially to the public, they do not like to explain their love life: “People expect you to act in a certain way and that annoys me.
And maybe some call me ungrateful, but I don't like to have to justify myself in front of the whole public.”
The Governor of West Virginia announces that he is changing party
. The Democratic Governor of West Virginia, Jim Justice, announced Thursday evening at a rally with President Trump that he would change the party.
Whether you like it or not, the Democrats have gone away from me,” said Governor Justice.
“Today I will tell you with many prayers and a lot of reflection... today I will tell you as a resident of West Virginia, I can no longer help you if I am a democratic governor.”
The rally broke out in cheer.
“Tomorrow I will change my registration to the Republicans,” Justice added.
“As a coach, I'd say it's time to play another game.”
Mr. Mr. Trump promised a big announcement at the West Virginia Rally.
Mr. Mr. Trump won West Virginia with 42 points, and Justice did not approve democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice, who according to Forbes is the only billionaire in the state, was elected in 2016.
Forbes notes that he owns coal mines in five states and inherited a coal business from his father.
It's worth about $1.59 billion.
Meanwhile, on Thursday evening, the Republican National Committee issued a statement saying, “The change of party of Governor Justice is another blow to a Democratic Party that would stop us rather than work to make our country great again.”
“With only 15 governorates and the control of the least legislative bodies in history, the announcement of Governor Justice is only the last rejection of a party that is from top to bottom without leadership and is unable to find a positive, unifying message,” RNC Chairman Ronna McDaniel said in a Explanation of the CBS News.
Coe praises “honest” Russian apology for doping scandal
The global head of athletics, Sebastian Coe, praised Thursday what he described as an obvious excuse from Russia to a doping scandal, but he repeated that it was not the time for the country to be resumed into sport.
Russian athletics chief Dmitry Shylakhtin said during the IAAF Congress on the eve of the World Athletics Championships that his country's exile from sport was correct and that he was determined to fight doping.
He said he was sorry for “all the athletes who got gold and silver medals taken away at competitions.”
Despite his comments, the IAAF Congress voted in favour of maintaining the ban imposed in November 2015 after a report by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) found evidence of state-sponsored doping in Russia.
“I thought it was a very open answer today, a very honest presentation,” said IAAF President Coe to the reporters.
“The entire Council and Congress were pleased that the Russian Federation recognized with itself that it has experienced some pretty hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is redesigned.”
Coe said he was also “pleased” that Russia accepted the criteria for its reintroduction.
“I think it was a very constructive day, and I think progress has been made, but Congress supports the Task Force's recommendations that this is not the time to reinstate Russia,” Coe said.
“We must do everything in the coming months to normalize this situation.
The guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the corrupted system,” he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes will compete as neutral players at the World Athletics Championships starting in London on Friday, according to the rigorous IAAF criteria.
Rune Andersen, Head of IAAF Task Force, said on Monday that Russia still needs to meet some of the criteria for resettlement.
Drug testing is still inadequate and forbidden coaches are still free, he said reporters in London after a lecture at the IAAF Council.
Mourning act for soldiers crashed in Mali
At a funeral ceremony in Fritzlar in northern Hessian, about 1000 people of the two soldiers killed in a helicopter crash in Mali thought.
The ceremony took place on Thursday in Domstadt under high security precautions.
Minister for Defence Ursula of the Leyen (CDU) said nothing about the unresolved cause of the crash.
However, she described the two lost pilots as “experts of their professions”.
“We bow to this supreme sacrifice they made on behalf of the Federal Republic of Germany,” she said.
The 33-year-old Major and 47-year-old Chief of Staff from North Hesse were killed in Mali, West Africa, on Wednesday a week ago.
Their coffins were transferred to Germany and transported to the Fritzlarer Dom Sankt Peter on Thursday accompanied by a wake of the Bundeswehr.
At lunchtime, only the family members in the Church farewell.
After that, the funeral celebrations began in the circle of the family, close friends, by representatives of the German Armed Forces and politicians.
Among them were Hesse's Prime Minister Volker Bouffier (CDU) and the Chief Inspector of the Federal Armed Forces Volker Wieker.
The mourners laid down roses, the relatives stood arm in arm on the coffins.
In front of the church, Fritzlarer and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on a canvas.
Defence Minister of the Leyen described the injured soldiers as “highly decorated” and experienced in action.
The Chief of Staff helped build up the operation of the Tiger combat helicopter in Fritzlar and was one of the first six trained Tiger pilots of his regiment.
Also Volker Bauersach, commander of the regiment to which the soldiers belong, said: “If this crew could not avert the crash, then no one would have managed it”.
Minister of the Leyen did not show doubts about the UN mission in Mali: the operation was dangerous.
But it is also of high importance “for a country from which we are separated only by two states,” she said.
After the funeral, the coffins were brought out of the cathedral.
When and where they are buried, the Bundeswehr did not provide any information on this.
Prince Henrik doesn't want a grave next to his wife
The man of the Danish Queen Margrethe (77), Prince Henrik (83), does not want to be buried next to his wife after his death.
That's what the royal house said on Thursday.
Traditionally, the Danish royal couple is buried in the Cathedral Church of Roskilde.
The sculptor Bjørn Nørgaard already made a sarcophagus for the two.
The Queen agreed with her husband's decision, the message continued.
Where Prince Henrik will be buried, be unclear.
But he has no intention of being buried in his French homeland.
Prince Henrik had never made a secret of the fact that he was not happy with his title.
After his wife Margrethe's ascent to the throne in 1972, he would have liked to become king.
In 2016, he retired and also took the title “princess meal”.
Since Henrik did not get the title and function he wanted in Denmark, he does not consider himself equivalent to his wife - even after death, Lene Balleby, the chief spokeswoman of the Danish royal house, said.
Where the 83-year-old's last resting place will eventually be, it is unclear.
However, it does not intend to be buried in its French homeland, but in Denmark.
He likes the country he's worked for over the last 50 years.
Born in 1965, Henri de Laborde de Monpezat, son of a noble French family, met Margrethe in London.
He worked at the Thames in the French Embassy.
While his later wife always flew to the people's expressions of sympathy, Prince Henrik had a serious stand with the Danes in his nearly 50-year reign.
In an autobiography, Henrik said about the first years in Denmark: “A few months after my arrival, everything I did was criticized.
My Danish was fluctuating, I preferred wine instead of beer, silk stockings instead of knitting socks, Citroën instead of Volvo, tennis instead of football.
Even for the Gauloises that I smoked instead of Virginia tobacco and who have had a reputation in this country to be the brand of socially critical intellectuals, I could not hope for indulgence.
I was different.
I seemed satisfied with this position and not ashamed.
That was two mistakes!”
Prime Minister Weil wants rapid re-election
CDU and FDP before possible majority in Lower Saxony
Lower Saxony's Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) is in favour of a rapid re-election of the country's parliament after the loss of the red-green government majority, but he does not want to resign.
Because on Friday it was in favour of the dissolution of Parliament.
Previously, the surprising resignation of a Green MEP from their rural group in Lower Saxony had plunged the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) into a severe crisis.
Five months before the official election date, the red-green coalition in Hanover lost its close one-vote majority in Parliament to the opposition from CDU and FDP.
Elke Twesten, the previous Green Member, established her step with the non-nomination for the 2018 election in her constituency in Rotenburg (Wümme).
“I see my political future in the CDU,” she said on Friday in Hanover.
CDU Group leader Björn Thümler wants to recommend to his group that they be accepted.
Together, CDU and FDP would have 69 seats in the Lower Saxon Landtag, SPD and Grüne 68 seats.
So far, the relationship has been reversed.
The new Land Day is scheduled to take place on 14 October. January next year.
Thümler said that the red-green state government now had to decide whether it could continue to govern without a majority in this situation.
However, Stephan Weil believes it is essential that the Landtag decides its self-resolution as quickly as possible.
The CDU Group is expected to decide on its next steps on Tuesday.
The National Constitution also provides for the possibility that the Land Day deprives the Prime Minister of confidence and elects a successor.
“Our constitution offers several options.
These possibilities must be examined in a legally clean way,” said Thümler.
“All questions will be discussed calmly if they are legally reasonably examined.”
Thümler called Twester's step “but something curious”.
The politician herself stressed: “I am not a traitor.
I feel very good”.
She described herself as a pendant of black and green.
The Greens called on the renegade Members to return their country mandate.
“We assume, of course, that she will immediately return her country mandate, which she received through the green country list,” said the country chairmen Meta Janssen-Kucz and Stefan Körner.
The chairman of the Green Group, Anja Piel, said: 'We very much regret Elke Twesten's decision'.
You deliberately decided not to hold a debate in the group.
“Even in the light of the fact that there were no differences in content, we cannot understand this step.”
SPD chancellor candidate Martin Schulz condemns the transition of Lower Saxon Green MEP Elke Twesten to the CDU as a betrayal.
“The behaviour of the former Green MEPs in Lower Saxony is not only betrayal to the voters, but also betrayal of red-green,” the Federal Chief of Social Democrats wrote on Facebook on Friday.
He supports Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD)'s decision to quickly re-elect the Land Day.
Twester's exit costs the majority in Lower Saxony red-green.
The politician “places her personal interests before the good of the country in her injured vanity and frustration,” said SPD Secretary General Hubertus Heil.
“It is a scandal that the CDU in Lower Saxony participates in this dirty intrigue game and tries to make political capital out of it”.
Lower Saxony's CDU leader Björn Thümler wants to recommend his MEP to include Elke Twesten in the CDU.
The SPD head of the political group in the Bundestag, Thomas Oppermann, accused Twesten of distorting the result of the 2013 country elections with personal career thinking.
The CDU was at that time the strongest force before the SPD, but SPD and Green had a wafer majority of one voice in the Landtag.
Interview with Agriculture Minister - How do we protect ourselves from poison beaters, Mr Schmidt?
Germany is discussing contaminated eggs.
How did the scandal happen?
How can consumers protect themselves?
Minister of Agriculture Christian Schmidt (CSU) speaks and answers in an interview with the editorial network Germany (RND).
Mr Schmidt, how can consumers protect themselves from poisoned eggs?
I can only encourage all consumers to look closely at the eggs in your refrigerator and check the stamp print.
On the consumer protection portal www.Lebensmittelwarnung.de, the federal states provide the latest information about the egg batches concerned.
Eggs affected should be destroyed or returned.
Even if, after everything we know at the moment, a health hazard is practically excluded.
Is Aldi now taking on the best possible crisis response - all eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the Enlightenment is not really perceived by the Federal Minister of Agriculture?
Food monitoring is the responsibility of the federal states.
Nevertheless, my House has immediately opened up and has been in close contact with the authorities of the countries since Germany became aware of the affliction.
All information and risk assessment are available to consumers.
Trade, like manufacturers, must ensure that the products sold are safe and safe to transport.
If eggs exceed the maximum residue level of 0,005mg/kg, they are not capable of transport.
However, unloaded eggs can be sold and consumed.
This time, it is not the fault of the companies.
Do production companies and consumers sit in the same boat?
According to current knowledge, the production plants are not directly liable.
On the contrary, they are expected to suffer economic damage due to the alleged illegal practices of service providers.
As always, there are too few inspectors in the event of an emergency.
Is it only the staff or the conclusive competence that is missing?
It was precisely the official controls that revealed the process.
The truth is, however, that food fraud and criminal energy can never be 100% excluded.
It is precisely for this reason that it is essential to ensure that such events are fully informed and that they are handed over to the public prosecutors in cases where there may be criminal offences.
I have already made it clear on several occasions that I expect full information from the authorities responsible.
Is regular alarmism really necessary in food scandals?
Consumers have the right to receive only safe and marketable food.
When an unauthorised insecticide is used in the food industry, consumers are rightly indignant.
The panicked product has put manufacturers, traders and consumers in a situation that is absolutely unnecessary.
In principle, it must be clear that the illegal use of the insecticide fipronil in the holding of food-producing animals is unacceptable and must be terminated immediately.
This must be done consistently and with high pressure at all levels.
I expect all the competent authorities to clarify matters quickly and without any gaps.
How football's financial rules affect Neymar's move to Paris
The rules aimed at preventing unhindered spending by European football clubs will not disturb Neymar's world record transfer from Spanish Barcelona to French Paris-Saint Germain.
Any consequences for Paris Saint-Germain will come from UEFA, because the governing organization that oversees the European game has the power to ban teams from accessing the prestigious Champions League tournament.
Financial fair play rules launched by UEFA in 2011 mean that PSG will eventually have to prove that Neymar's transfer was funded without major losses.
Barcelona has paid €222 million ($262 million) to buy out the Brazilian from its contract, and Neymar will receive a salary that will amount to several $10 million a year.
Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymar's move to France.
PSG can certainly make the money loose so that Neymar signs and takes him to a galaxy of other stars, given the funding of the team by the energy-rich ruler family of Qatar.
clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money on the purchase of players, but must counteract them with legitimate sources of revenue that allow them to break even points in their football-related business.
FFP was conceived by Michel Platini after his election as UEFA President in 2007.
The former French player believed that clubs that had taken on huge debts in their quest for success effectively cheated and risked ruining themselves when banks or owners withdrew their support.
In 2011, FFP shifted from focusing on club debt to monitoring its losses.
The change meant that the business model Roman Abramovich originally used in Chelsea in 2003 - bought a club with potential and then invested heavily to improve the team and build a global brand - should become a harder business.
During the current three-year FFP investment period, which runs until 2018, clubs can accept losses of 30 million euros.
And although Platini was disgraced by the Presidency in 2015, his UEFA successor, Aleksander Ceferin, continues to work to deter excessive spending.
“Surely FFP is not dead and we will certainly strengthen the rules for the future,” said Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for FFP at UEFA, to The Associated Press last week.
Although the PSG paid Neymar's buy-out clause in a lump sum, it can distribute the amount of the accounts for the duration of its contract.
Neymar has signed a five-year contract so that the transfer amount for the next five years of EUR 44.4 million can be reported in the annual accounts.
The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 has hit PSG together with Abu Dhabi, which is owned by Manchester City, with the most severe sanctions.
The PSG received a fine of 60 million euros (then 82 million dollars), which was subsequently reduced to 20 million euros - and it was ordered that the team members for the Champions League of the 2014/15 season remain limited to 21 players instead of the usual 25 players.
UEFA is looking for clubs that could try to outsmart their financial supervision by inflating their revenues from companies associated with the owners of a club.
While a Catalan company could sponsor PSG if the value of sponsorship were to exceed the standard market rates, UEFA would not allow this to be considered a legitimate income.
This was exactly what happened in 2014 when UEFA decided that the value of PSA sponsorship was inflated by the Qatar Tourism Authority.
It has been reported that part of PSG payments to Neymar could come from payments made by the World Cup 2022 Organising Committee in Qatar.
But PSG and Qatar in 2022 have denied that Neymar will become World Cup ambassadors and that such a maneuver could be easy for the UEFA regulators to find out.
The previous sanctions against PSG mean that UEFA will be even more attentive to any attempt to circumvent the rules.
UEFA had no preparatory talks with PSG about Neymar's transfer, said on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation.
They spoke with The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the PSG situation.
The latest published reports show that PSG 2015/16 achieved a profit of more than EUR 10 million with a turnover of EUR 542.4 million.
The accounts for the last fiscal year still need to be published.
PSG expects Neymar's arrival to be a blessing for sponsorship deals, merchandising and jersey sales.
The association expects that after signing, sales will increase by at least 30 percent.
The Spanish league was clearly irritated to see one of the best football players go, and she tried to prevent Neymar's withdrawal by claiming that PSG would violate the FFP.
“It is a clear case of “financial doping” with the club and the state,” said the president of La Liga, Javier Tebas, the Spanish daily AS in relation to Qatar's ultimate ownership of PSG.
Arsenal Manager Arsene Wenger, whose association is owned by an American sports tycoon, shares the reservations of La Liga against a state that finances an association.
“It is the consequence of ownership and that has completely changed the entire landscape of football over the last 15 years,” Wenger said on Thursday.
“Once a country has an association, everything is possible.
It will be very difficult to respect financial fairplay because you can go different ways or have different interests when a country has such a big player to represent a country.”
Swiss is looking for a new supplier of choggies
In recent years, Chocolat Frey has produced board chocolate for Swiss.
Now the sweet cooperation is about to come to an end: the airline rewrites the order.
Swiss spokeswoman Meike Fuhlrott confirmed on request of the news agency a corresponding report of the newspaper “Northwest Switzerland” on Friday.
According to current planning, the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018.
The products would be reviewed every two to three years and subject to quality control.
“We are very satisfied with the current supplier Chocolat Frey,” said the speaker.
Approximately 17 million small red-white packed chogging boards of 14 grams distribute the cabin crew to the passengers each year before landing.
Swiss did not want to provide any information about the costs.
According to “Northwest Switzerland”, industry insiders estimate the order volume to CHF 1.5 to 2 million - the Migros subsidiary generates annual sales of around CHF 1 billion.
But more importantly, the advertising effect is all the more important: for a cognitive manufacturer, it is a prestigious order.
The Swiss does not want to reveal how many applicants there are in the new tender.
Only Swiss manufacturers are eligible.
According to the newspaper report, Chocolat Frey wants to renew the contract beyond spring 2018.
For the sda, the largest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not available for comment.
Swiss has been distributing chocolate plates on board its flights since 2006.
Before Swiss concluded a contract with Migros's daughter, Barry Callebaut had delivered the chocolate tablets in cooperation with Hug.
Swiss introduced the possibility to place the logo two and a half years ago with the start of the cooperation with Chocolat Frey.
The airline works with various Swiss chocolate producers.
On long-haul flights, First Class customers will be spoiled with treats from the Sprüngli confectionery, while Business Class passengers will be spoiled with chocolate from Lindt and Chocolat Frey's Economy Class chocolate.
Swiss Schoggi from Chocolat Frey also distributes on the short haul, both in business and economy class.
Athletics - Diskus Olympic Champion Robert Harting achieves World Cup Final
The three-time world champion fights for a medal in the finals on Saturday.
His brother Christoph, Olympic champion of 2016, had failed in the national World Cup elimination and could only look at the Diskus competition from the grandstand.
Also with the first attempt, the Polish defending champion Piotr Malachowski, who threw 65.13 meters away, qualified for the final fight.
Nostalgia goes into the niche in “Wet Hot American Summer” and “Comrade Detective”
This repetition of the story is nostalgic at the same time because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80's, for the 90's grunge era (when the thought leaders David Wain and Michael Showalter turned the sketch comedy “The State” for MTV), and for themselves - that is, for 2001, before their stars, like Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd went to bigger things.
As a cultural artifact, it is also a parody and embodiment of our Facebook-enabled era of permanent memories.
But as a franchise, it feels like time is running out.
“First Day of Camp” worked surprisingly well, not only because of its absurd humor (it contained an original story for a talking can of vegetables produced by H. Jon Benjamin was spoken).
By stiffing themselves to the core of the gag - middle-aged actors play awesome children who grow up - they nevertheless managed to win back the last part of the joke.
“Ten Years Later”, with his adults now playing adults, is less emotionally rooted and his parody goes more according to the watering candy principle, including a reef to the stalker films of the 90's like “The Hand That Rocks the Cradle”.
At one point, a character pokes through an Apple Powerbook, some inline skates, and “a series of other things from 1991.”
Many of the central stories are the same.
The kind Coop (Mr. Showalter), now novelist, has still not forgotten Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) still hasn't lost his virginity.
And there's another crazy-evil plot that Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter), now by George H. W. Bush (a good impression of Michael Ian Black).
As always, the excourses are the best part of the franchise.
It's especially fun to see the eternally young Mr. Rudd, who shows Matt Dillon's underlip beard of “Singles”, whose former Big Man-on-Camp Andy now feels like an old cracker.
It's the moments of random madness that could heat up this franchise like some kind of repeating “Seven Up!” series until he achieves what I take as his logical conclusion: “Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later”, whose final scene will show the gang how they will play the film premiere of “Wet Hot American Summer” will visit.
Comrade Detective on Amazon is now reminiscent of another kind of nostalgia: the revival of the Cold War of “The Americans”, the film “Atomic Blonde” and even “GLOW” with its East-to-West wrestling iconography.
The comedy, created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka, with Rhys Thomas as director, claims to be a found TV series: a Romanian drama of the eighties with the two policemen as friends, two officers from Bucharest fighting for truth, atheism and the path of Marxism-Leninism.
The main roles - a hard-cut Gregor and an idealistic Iosef - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Ulici, whose dialogues are synchronized in English by Channing Tatum (also an executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
It's a brilliant idea.
But it's not much more than an idea.
There are some beautiful gags to watch (the police spend time watching chess on television, as Americans might do with football).
And the list of famous speakers - including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny - ensures a decent game 'Find the Voice Out'.
But “Comrade Detective” is so committed to the truthfulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a killer wearing a Reagan mask is included - that it often plays like a single one.
With six long episodes, it pulls away, and the comedy is not fast or frequent enough.
“Comrade Detective”, edited to a lesser length, could better deliver his agitprop satire, as Gregor and Iosef repeatedly visit the American Embassy, whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men devouring a bunch of hamburgers.
The message for the imagined communist audience is that Western culture can make everything a fodder for a pity.
The fictional Romanian creators were not wrong: we even do it with our own younger story and with their own.
Strike against drug mafia in the country
The police have managed to beat the Italian mafia in Baden-Württemberg.
On Wednesday morning, numerous objects were searched in the Schwarzwald-Baar-Kreis, in Rottweil, Konstanz, Esslingen and Stuttgart, as the state prosecutor Konstanz announced on Friday.
15 accused persons aged between 25 and 77 were arrested and arrest warrants have already been issued against them.
In addition, the officials secured large quantities of marijuana and cocaine, firearms and several hundred thousand euros.
In the case of simultaneous raids in Italy, two persons were arrested.
There were German warrants against the two suspects of Italians.
The two are therefore likely to be delivered to Germany.
The action involved Italian and Bavarian investigators.
In total, more than 300 police officers were deployed.
The members of the mafia are accused of organised drug crime, serious violence, attempted murder and robbery and extortion.
Since summer 2016, the Konstanz Public Prosecutor's Office has been investigating organised drug trafficking in southern Germany.
There was a lively exchange between the prosecutors in Constance and Palermo, and the investigators of the Rottweil Criminal Investigators had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily.
That is why the large-scale operation on Wednesday morning was also accompanied by four officials from Palermo.
In particular, Italian nationals closely related to the Italian mafia came to the attention of the investigations.
Also an incident on 27. May in Hüfingen, where several shots were fired into a restaurant early in the morning, should go to the account of the gang.
Wise complains of large gaps in the foreigner register
“Data from citizens who should not appear”: According to a report, the foreigners register in Germany has significant shortcomings.
This leads to some serious mistakes in asylum procedures.
According to a media report, Frank-Jürgen Weise, the representative for the refugee management of the Federal Government, drew attention to large gaps in the foreigners' central register.
Deficiencies in the data recorded there could lead to “sometimes serious mistakes” in asylum procedures and deportations, warned in a way in an analysis available to the “Süddeutsche Zeitung”.
According to the information, the register covers ten million people of foreign nationality, including about 5.7 million from non-EU countries.
The data is therefore managed by about 600 foreigners in Germany.
Because the data had not been sufficiently maintained, the data quality in part has not been good so far.
In individual cases, data from 1921 had been found, “of people who have long since ceased to be alive, or of citizens who have become German citizens and who should no longer appear in the register”.
“Incorrect data entry can significantly slow return processes,” says the report.
Moreover, statistics on persons subject to leave cover EU citizens who would not have to leave.
However, such false allocations led to “a distorted debate on the handling of expelled persons”, according to the analysis.
Meanwhile, it appears that the Federal Government has begun to send refugee families with children under 16 years of age back to Italy when they have arrived from there.
This is evident from an internal paper by the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF), reports the “Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung”.
The paper therefore states that BAMF has been conducting such procedures 'concerning families with children, with the exception of infants and toddlers, to Italy since 1 January 2007. June 2017 again through”.
Since the end of 2014, this was practically impossible, according to the newspaper, referring to the difficult situation on the ground.
Under the Dublin Agreement, refugees are responsible for the EU state they reach first.
If a migrant travels to another EU country, that country may return it to the country of entry.
In order to justify this, the Office is now writing: 'The absorption capacity for families with minor children in Italy has increased substantially'.
Italy provided guarantees for the reception and accommodation of families.
Even the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) considers these commitments to be sufficient.
Other EU countries would also send refugees back there under the Dublin Agreement.
Ulla Jelpke, spokesperson for the left-wing political group in the Bundestag, criticised this decision: “Families with children are threatening to receive unlawful reception conditions and to endanger the welfare of children because of the deficiencies in the Italian asylum system”.
Second best result achieved
A total of 220 litres of blood from people living in Oberreichenbach was already provided by the blood donation service to other people.
At least from the twelve citizens who were awarded on Friday.
First of all, Jürgen Greule, who, with his now 100 donations, now shared 50 liters of blood.
Traditionally, the ward appreciates multiple readiness to donate blood at the ward council meeting.
“It is ingenious how our body is designed for this, and we pay respect to the donors who provide their blood to strangers, as well as nonselfish,” said Mayor Karlheinz Kistner.
“A single blood donation helps several people,” explained Holger Maisenbacher, Head of Regional Preparedness of the German Red Cross (DRC), because the canned food is decomposed into its components.
So three people could benefit from a blood donation.
At the same time, Maisenbacher reported on the actions that will be carried out in Oberreichenbach in the spring.
“This year, we achieved the second best result with 114 donors,” said the DRC county preparedness manager.
Obviously, a few years ago, the change to the theatre house led to higher attendance.
Prior to that, Thomas Bockstadt, Susanne Reichle, Sandra Schöck, Thomas Reichle and Meta Umbeer were among the multiple donors and were awarded for 50 blood donations each.
Half as many have Herbert Mair and Dorothee Riexinger, while Tamara Pfrommer, Petra Schleeh, Stefanie Stoll and Uwe Vetter have given 500 milliliters of their lifespan ten times each.
The Bank of England will keep the interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged after the weak economic growth and the slowdown in inflation have dampened speculation about an increase.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain “sluggish” when it retained interest rates on family income in the midst of increasing pressure.
The Bank's Monetary Committee (MPC) policy makers voted 6 to 2 to keep interest rates to 0.25%, with fewer members aiming to increase this month as weak economic growth has weakened support for an increase.
In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank reduced its growth forecasts to 1.7% for 2017 and 1.6% for 2018, warning that the pressure on household income would continue, with inflation expected to rise to just under 3% in the autumn.
But it signalled that in the next few years, interest increases would be necessary to curb the inflation that Brexit is causing, and it said that credit costs might have to rise more than expected in the financial markets.
Members also voted in favour of withdrawing part of the Mammut Economic Recovery Package issued a year ago after Brexit.
It will require time for the funding plan to provide cheaper financial resources to banks from next February, although it has been said that it is now expected to make 15 billion pounds more available under this system - with GBP 115 billion.
Minutes after the decision on the interest rate, the bank said: “In the MPC's central forecast, gross domestic product (GDP) remains weak in the short term, as the pressure on the real income of households continues to affect consumption.”
Regarding interest rates, it reiterated that 'a certain tightening of monetary policy' would be necessary to cool down inflation and a 'slightly larger' scale than the markets expect.
Markets are currently predicting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another increase in 2020.
However, the Bank stressed that increases would be “gradual” and “limited”.
The Bank's downward adjusted growth forecasts for this and next year are in comparison with the 1.9% and 1.7% forecast in May.
It has maintained its growth forecast to 1.8% in 2018.
The pound fell against the dollar and the euro after these news.
The pound fell by 0.5% to $1.31 and fell by 0.4% to $1.11.
The decision not to change comes after the recent disappointing growth figures have stepped up expectations of an interest rate increase and GDP in the second quarter has risen from 0.2% in the previous three months to 0.3%.
Growth is expected to reach 0.3% in the third quarter, although it will recover slightly after the bank at the end of the year.
The latest inflation report provided little enthusiasm for households affected by rising inflation and minor salary increases, as the tightening first gets worse before it improves.
She added that monetary policy cannot “prevent” income falling over the next few years, but she added that wages will “recover significantly” at the end of her three-year forecast.
The economy is also strengthened by the rising demand for British goods, which is due to the weak pound, which will compensate for some of the lower consumption expenditure.
The decision comes one year after the reduction of interest rates to 0.25% last August after the shocking EU vote that caused the pound to fall.
The bank estimates that it will probably take four years for this to reach prices and the economy in full.
Prior to the Bank's last ruling on interest rates, the call for an interest rate increase had increased as inflation increased pressure on heavily constrained households, with three policy makers demanding an increase to 0.5% in July.
Inflation fell from 2.9% in June to 2.6% last month, although the bank said that this was expected and that it would attract again in the coming months.
The bank said that the excess in relation to its 2% target was 'entirely' attributable to the weak pound.
Andrew Montlake, Director at Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: “Given the recent decline in swap rates, the mortgage market is likely to become more competitive again, as lenders are looking for business and want to end the year in a positive way.
The market looks particularly good for those who are running out of existing deals and closing new mortgages, and many with free options and low rates are becoming more and more popular.”
NHS (The National Health Service) to prescribe controversial HIV drug to 10,000 people
Patients will have access to “transformative” HIV prevention treatment after a fight in front of the High Court against the funding of the drug in the NHS from September.
NHS England announced that pre-sexual preexposure prevention (PrEP), which can reduce the risk of infection in high-risk patients by around 86 percent, is now being delivered by Health Service through a first three-year study for an estimated 10,000 people.
He agreed to finance the trial after the Court of Appeal confirmed last year a ruling by the Supreme Court, according to which the NHS had the power to pay PrEP despite the claim that the local authorities should finance it.
The move announced on Thursday was welcomed by NHS England chief Simon Stevens as an “important new intervention”, while the National Aids Trust (NAT) called this a “decisive moment”.
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to allow people to register, and other clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced throughout England in April 2018.
Preexposure Prevention (PrEP) is a consequence of HIV preparations taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
Studies have shown that PrEP significantly reduces HIV transmission in those at risk of infection.
Taking PrEP before sexual intercourse means that just enough drugs are present in a person's body to prevent HIV infection.
Such drugs can be taken every day or so already two hours before sexual intercourse.
Those eligible for treatment include gay or bisexual men, transsexuals and persons with HIV-positive partners who have not been successfully treated.
Clinics identify appropriate participants who agree to the study, including men, women, transgenders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by antiretroviral treatment.
People who live in England and are registered with a family doctor can also register for a possible participation in their local participating sex clinic.
The program will be £10 million and NHS England signed a contract to deliver the drugs this week after an international competitive procurement.
The study is intended to assess the full potential of PrEP by collecting clinical evidence on how to use, absorb and implement it on a large scale.
Stevens said: “This major new intervention should complement and overtake the far-reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV.
It is another milestone in the progress of more than three decades in addressing one of humanity's greatest health challenges.”
Deborah Gold, Chief Executive at NAT (National Aids Trust), said: “This is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV.
PrEP, when targeted at vulnerable and vulnerable people, offers the opportunity to change the English HIV epidemic.
From September, people with high HIV risk will have access to this NHS-funded attempt in England to develop a new instrument that is truly individually controlled and not subject to negotiation with a partner, which will improve many, many lives.
We warmly welcome this announcement.”
Ian Green, Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Terrence Higgins Trust, said: “The priority must now be that the study is carried out quickly throughout the country and that no one at risk of HIV is left behind.
Now that the PrEP test medicine has been procured, we are on the right track to protect more than 10,000 HIV-infected people.”
Sharon Hodgson, shadow health minister, said: “The start of the PrEP process is welcome and overdue after months of delays and reluctance by the government.
The evidence shows how transformative this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and can stop the transmission of this life-changing infection.
This attempt takes us a step closer to understanding the benefits of PrEP.
Now it is important that this study is carried out as quickly as possible throughout the country to protect people who are HIV infected and that it will help us to move closer to ending the spread of HIV in society '.
Living the Great Life: Mezzanine and clever designer tricks have transformed this little Earls Court apartment into a generous home
Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, reduced in 2014 from a large house in Knightsbridge to an Earls Court apartment.
Located on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Joanne has not packed and sold her bags.
“Before that, I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger room,” says Joanne.
“I was looking for something that was comparable to my price.
I was shown this apartment in Earl's Court, and she had the same high ceilings.
I fell in love with her and made an offer that day.”
Since the first visit, the 1,000-square-foot apartment has been completely overhauled.
Originally a one-bedroom property with a nested layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - Joanne wanted to add storage space and a mezzanine to make the most of the generous ceiling height.
“I wanted high ceilings, large windows, lots of light.
That was my request,” she says.
To this end, she commissioned Erfan Azadi's Duck & Shed architecture and design studio from Notting Hill to use the 12.5-foot ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Joanne.
The ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms on top of each other, so the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine where you could stand.
Erfan had to think creatively to solve the preset.
“The steel mill is quite complicated,” he explains.
“We had to arrange the rooms so that they were stacked on top of each other without having to bend.
It wasn't just about building a simple platform, but putting the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the top or bottom function.”
This arrangement made it possible for Erfan to place two rooms in full height on top of each other - with much additional drama.
For the mezzanine floor, a classic Retrouvius copper light window overlooks the glamorous living area.
Mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program.
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theater, space and light.
A short corridor is mirrored at both ends to make it look longer.
In the kitchen, the mirror feels like a window to another room.
At the entrance, mirrored units provide space for all Joanne cutlery and glasses.
By perceiving a more glamorous space, the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen when not in use.
Folding kitchens are nothing new.
The special thing about this is that it is a garage door.
“A bit of engineering went in there,” explains Erfan from the steel-reinforced veneered MDF door.
“It is counterweight, so when you push up the door, it glides very easily.”
Thanks to the clever use of space and storage space, Joanne was able to gain an additional 16 m², an additional bedroom and an improved layout.
“At the end of the day you will sell the floor space - or how your property is valued,” says Erfan.
“In a rudimentary form, a real estate agent will occur and perform a calculation based on the size of the floor.”
Here they have managed to increase the floor space and at the same time use high-quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage.
“The materials are the things that touch you and that therefore help to create an emotional bond in a home,” says Erfan.
“You don't fall in love with the electrical outlets in the walls.
These are important, but they don't play with your heart.”
It shows that an apartment can turn from something standard to something quite amazing due to its good design and increased square metre count.
In fact, like Joanne, you could decide not to leave this.
Brothers fight for a $500 million real estate empire
Two brothers, four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty, are in a dispute over one of Victoria's largest real estate empires worth over $500 million.
Former director of the Carlton Football Club and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a villa in Toorak, just three doors away from his younger brother Paul. The latter brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and business assets are to be shared.
Paul has wanted to withdraw from the family business since 2014, but a sharp debate on the separation takes place in the Supreme Court.
Together with their mother Anna, the brothers own 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars, accumulated since the family bought a store on Smith Street, Collingwood, in 1973.
There, the Westco Jeans family founded and grew into a chain of 160 retail stores.
It was sold in 1999 for $85 million.
This money has been invested in real estate, and De Lutis's portfolio now includes offices in the city centre, the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento, the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller, and shopping malls in the suburbs.
According to an agreement with her late father, Colin - described by Paul as “the main operator and the dominant personality” in the De Lutis family - owns about two thirds of the company's assets and Paul about one third.
A court file says that this means that Colin owns $316 million in property and Paul owns $176 million in property.
The division of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul.
“The divisions proposed by Colin left him with what I thought was the best objects,” he wrote in a first affidavit in 2015.
Last Friday, after several failed intermediaries, the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place.
The brothers are now also fighting for control of the existing business - which, as Paul claims, Colin has ruled out.
Colin argues that this is not true, but accuses Paul of incompetent management of some possessions.
In an early affidavit filed by Colin, he says he hopes to settle the dispute.
“My Italian heritage dictates that the family is the most important priority,” he wrote.
The cost increases in this case, with hundreds of pages of affidavits, emails and reports from companies, including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and with leading lawyers, including Allan Myers, QC, and law firms held by both sides.
Ms De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated milk bars and delicatessen shops from the late 1950s and bought a shop in Brunswick in the early 1970s.
They used security to buy the Collingwood property where Colin opened the family's first jeans shop.
Colin says he started Westco there when he was “high school in my last few years when Paul was a little kid (about 10 years old).”
Anna De Lutis says that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to pass on their property kindly to their sons.
“Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to end up in court,” she wrote.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis group of companies, with Colin claiming that Mark was paid $10 million when he left the company and Luke $26 million.
Both Lukas and Mark were, Paul says, “bitter about the conditions of their financial separation.”
Colin was very restrained, although he was a former AFL board member, and after a 2015 biography by Eddie McGuire, he was the best friend of the television star.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers.
Only Colin replied by SMS to say “I really can't say much” because the case is before the courts.
“It's very, very sad that my brother Paul decided to sue me and pull our family name through the courts,” he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote in a letter to the court that he tried to meet his brother's demands.
“Our father would not have wanted Paul and I to end up in our current dispute,” he said, adding that he “still hopes for a solution.”
This hope seemed to be over on Friday.
“Our matter will be resolved by the courts in the near future,” Colin wrote.
Trump's new Chief of Staff plans to limit the President's media abstinence.
Others have tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly actually do it.
If so, he'll be the first.
Politico reports that the new White House Chief of Staff plans to restrict the flow of information to President Trump - including reports from the news media - in the hope of keeping the chief on a more uniform course.
Here's a piece of reporter Josh Dawsey:
“When John F. Kelly, the new White House Chief of Staff, met with senior officers on his first working day, he posed a major problem in President Donald Trump's White House, which he wanted to repair: bad information that gets into the hands of the President.
Kelly told the staff that information should flow about him - whether on paper or in briefings - because the president would make better decisions if he got good information.”
Kelly's diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to tame Trump by monitoring his media diet.
President Trump's relationship with television goes back decades - and now that he's in the White House, his television advertising is still strong.
“If Candidate Trump was upset about unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he received fair reporting from positions that were convincing,” said former campaign advisor Sam Nunberg to Politico in February.
Politicos Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that “the key to keeping Trump's Twitter habit under control, according to six former campaign officials, is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady praise.”
Okay, okay.
But the idea that Trump's Twitter habit was ever “under control” is ridiculous.
Maybe these campaign officials know something we don't know to others - that Trump's tweets would have contained more ignition without their intervention.
We'll probably never know anything about the tweets Trump didn't send.
If his employees have managed to keep him away from trouble a few times, then their efforts have paid off.
But no one has consistently prevented Trump from causing controversy.
Part of the problem is that people in a White House, which is made up of competing parties, are constantly trying to advance their own agenda by presenting Trump material that may promote their views of the world.
Politico - quite busy with this story - reported in May about the consultants' preference to provide the President with questionable information for strategic reasons.
This was an example described by Reporter Shane Goldmacher:
“Current and former Trump officials say that Trump can react like a volcano to negative press excerpts, especially those with damaging leaks, and that he is stiffening to find out where they come from.
That's exactly what happened at the end of February when someone maliciously sent to the President a printed copy of an article by GotNews.com, the website of the Internet provocator Charles C. Johnson, who accused Deputy Chief of Staff Katie Walsh of being “the source behind a pile of leaks” in the White House.
Although Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter for harassment, or that he did not offer concrete evidence, or that in the past, he made false accusations and revoked them.
Trump read the article and started interviewing employees about Walsh.”
Goldmaker added that the then Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and the White House Secretary-General, Rob Porter, “tried to implement a system to manage and document the paperwork Trump receives.”
How did that work?
Kelly's trying to do the same three months later.
Maybe he'll prove himself to be more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his advisors are still striving for influence.
These unchanging factors make Kelly's mission very difficult.
Most wanted criminals get mail from Europol
As the address is unknown, the help of the population is requested and hoped for.
Police across Europe are sending (virtual) postcards to dangerous criminals on the run this summer.
As the addresses of the wanted serious criminals are by nature not known, clues from the population are hoped and requested.
Europol reported on Friday on the action following the EU Most Wanted Advent calendar of winter.
Experience would have shown that many refugees are hiding in holiday destinations, it was said by Europol.
21 postcards were compiled for wanted criminals from 21 EU countries.
Since 2016 there is the website www.eumostwanted, more than 2.5 million times it has been viewed.
36 of the online requests have been arrested so far, at least eleven of them on the basis of post-publication information on the website.
Travelers negotiate a ditch and return to the 'Millionaire Series'
Some of the most prosperous owners of the West Midlands are back at war with some determined travelers who negotiated a ditch drawn by the community to reclaim a field in front of their mansions.
Travelers have parked their 20 caravans on a field outside a prosperous Solihull road called the “Millionaire Series”.
They brought horses, babies and an army of transporters after they were thrown out only in May, but without being deterred by a ditch excavated by the Council to prevent their ingenuity.
The tactful group found a gap in the defenses and pushed their vehicles through a section that remained unhindered to find a way.
Angry residents have urged the Council of Solihull, who said that it was “useless to deal with the problem”.
An anonymous resident said, “They moved there on Monday night after being sent by Bentley Heath, where they threw stones at the passers-by.
The Council must be forced into action by shame because it was useless in dealing with the problem.
The travelers were there in May, were moved on and are now back.
More arrived last night, probably more today.”
She added: “The Birmingham Council knows how to deal with it by holding long instructions to protect its parks.
I live on Streetsbrook Road and I'm not happy to continue to pay my municipal tax if the Council cannot even stop it.”
A resident who didn't want to be called said, “It's ridiculous, we just saw the last round of these travelers just to be plundered by another round.
The numbers have increased this time and you even saw a horse in the parking area.”
A council spokeswoman at Solihull said, “We are aware of an unauthorized camp in the countryside beyond Streetsbrook Road and are working with the Solihulls Police. We take the necessary legal steps to move on as soon as possible.
To support our collection of evidence, it is very important that as many residents as possible report an anti-social or criminal behavior to the police by calling 101.
This will help to provide a picture of the situation in which the court will have to consider when we will present our case.”
Birkenhof becomes Waldhotel Luise
The former Hotel Birkenhof becomes the Waldhotel Luise.
The house in front of the gates of Freudenstadts is currently being renovated and is due to be renovated on 1. This will be re-opened on March 1, next year.
That's good news for the city.
Because with the closure of the Hotel Birkenhof by the then Ambiente Betriebsgesellschaft mbH for the 13th century, the hotel was closed. On April 1, 2014, around 30 000 nights were lost per year and also income from the tourist tax.
In autumn 2014, given the dramatic increase in the number of refugees who came to the district, the hotel building was offered to the county office as a collective accommodation, causing controversial discussions.
The city prevented asylum seekers from being accommodated by drawing up a construction plan to secure the area as a hotel location.
The decision was not undisputed in the municipal council at that time.
But especially Freudenstadt's mayor Julian Osswald defended the hotel location and talked about serious prospects at the house back then.
He should be right.
The Group Luisenhotels with Managing Director Birgit Scherer, based in Bad Bergzabern, acquired the former Hotel Birkenhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it again a three-star plus-category house under the name Waldhotel Luise.
The group has four houses with the Freudenstädter object.
Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Herrenalb.
They are called Hotel Luise, Luisenpark, Parkhotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise.
The former Hotel Birkenhof has been in front of the entrance for a long time, and when you enter the house, it becomes clear what extensive renovation works are being carried out.
The floors were torn out, ceilings partially degraded, old bathtubs removed from the rooms.
The entire hotel building is a single construction site.
There is still much to be done by March.
“It's actually a nice hotel,” says Thomas Scherer in conversation with our newspaper.
Everything is to be renewed in the black forest style.
The rooms are equipped with large walk-in showers, the entrance area is redesigned, new windows are installed.
Everything should later become “pretty close to the citizens”, as Thomas Scherer expresses himself.
“We want to make a piece of jewelry out of it.”
Facilities include a swimming pool, a spa and a meeting room.
You don't want to position yourself on the high level of the hotels in Lauterbad, but already on an upscale downtown level, Scherer emphasizes.
The Waldhotel Luise, with its approximately 60 rooms, wants to stand wide, explains Scherer.
Individual holidaymakers, groups or business people should feel at home in the hotel.
He has already had talks with OB Julian Osswald and tourism director Michael Krause, says Scherer.
The ideas of the city are identical to those of the Hotel Group.
“We're on the same line.”
When asked about the amount of investment, Thomas Scherer does not want to determine exactly.
Nearly under a million euros, he expects.
The outdoor facilities are also being brought to the fore, which is already clearly visible.
A large terrace will be created in a courtyard, which will be accessible from the restaurant, which is public.
Thomas Scherer is optimistic: “Freudenstadt is a good market”.
Russia affair: US Special Investigator sets up Grand Jury
In the Russia affair with US President Donald Trump, special investigator Robert Mueller is said to have set up a so-called Grand Jury after a report.
The panel has started work in recent weeks, wrote the Wall Street Journal, referring to people familiar with the matter.
The newspaper regarded the step as a sign that Mueller has expanded and intensified his investigation.
The channel CNN reported that there are already first subpoenas of the panel in connection with a meeting between Trump's eldest son and a Russian lawyer.
US intelligence has been accusing the Kremlin of deliberately interfering in the 2016 presidential election campaign for a long time.
Mueller investigates whether there were any arrangements between Trump's campaign team and Moscow.
The investigation will focus on several men who acted as advisors to the Republican in the election campaign.
Mueller was also reported to be taking a closer look at Trump's private and business environment.
The Washington Post wrote a few weeks ago that the Special Investigator Trump had personally come to the centre and investigated the accusation that the President may have hindered the judiciary in the course of the affair.
The main task of Grand Juries is to examine available evidence in possible crime cases and to decide whether charges should be brought.
Grand Juries are therefore also called chambers of attorney.
Most of the time, they are switched on when the cases are larger and controversial.
The procedure always takes place behind closed doors.
The Board may also be assisted by the Public Prosecutor's Office to summon individuals to oath for questioning.
According to the CNN channel, summons have already been issued that are about the encounter between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer.
People who were involved in the meeting had been asked to make a statement, the report said.
They should also provide documents.
In addition to Trump Jr., Trump's advisor and son-in-law Jared Kushner and his then election campaign boss Paul Manafort were also present at the meeting.
Legal experts said on Thursday evening on US television that the engagement shows that Mueller is not being intimidated in his work and that he wants to act quickly if necessary.
However, it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on at the end of the day to decide whether to bring an indictment.
Nevertheless, the establishment of the Panel is the beginning of a new phase in investigations and a new cause for concern for President Trump.
In the midst of the new revelations, the President used a speech in West Virginia on Thursday evening to portray the Russia affair as a campaign of his political opponents.
“The history of Russia is a total invention,” Trump said.
The issue gives democrats a chance to 'feel good because they have nothing else to talk about'.
His special adviser, Ty Cobb, stated in a statement that he did not know about setting up a grand jury.
But they also usually work in secret, he stressed.
The White House is in favour of any measures that accelerated the work of the special investigator in a 'fair' way.
Former FBI chief James Comey said three times that the president wasn't being investigated.
There is no reason to believe that something has changed, it was further stated in the statement.
Mueller had only been deployed after Trump had fired Comey.
Because of this rash, accusations had been made against Trump that he wanted to obstruct justice.
Comey told a Senate committee in June that Trump asked him to stop investigating the then national security advisor Michael Flynn.
The President is under great pressure because of the investigation.
After depicting US media, the White House collected material against the special investigator and his employees.
That caused speculation as to whether Trump wanted to release Mueller.
Unlike an independent special investigator of the Congress, such as in the Watergate affair about the later resigned President Richard Nixon, Mueller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired by the Ministry of Justice at the insistence of the President.
However, several senators from both parties want to prevent such a step.
Two groups of Republican and democratic senators presented draft legislation on Thursday, according to which the special investigator could no longer be dismissed so easily.
Antarctica: Gigantic iceberg drives in Antarctica
In the West Antarctic, a gigantic iceberg of the almost seven-fold size of Berlin has disappeared from the Schelfeis.
This was announced by the Bremerhaven Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday.
The colossus, which weighs more than one trillion tonnes and weighs 5800 square kilometres, is now heading north and will probably take two or three years to melt.
With 175 kilometres in length and a width of up to 50 kilometres, it is one of the largest ice giants that researchers have registered in the past three decades.
There is no danger to humans.
According to researchers, the extent to which climate change has played a role in the eruption of the iceberg is unclear.
Overall, however, there has been a series of unusual crashes of ice shelves in the region for around 30 years, writes the US Snow and Ice Research Centre (NSIDC) in a fact background.
According to many researchers, this could be related to global warming.
The now broken colossus has been part of the Larsen C Schelfeis.
Schelfeis floats on the sea and is fed by large glaciers.
It grows further and further into the sea and regularly breaks down.
Larsen-C Schelfeis is located south of South America, almost at the top of the Antarctic Peninsula.
North of this shelting file was disturbed the balance of growth and abort a few years ago.
AWI researcher Daniela Jansen writes that a complete snooze had collapsed there.
There is a lot to say that the Larsen-C Schelfeis are also in danger, because the front edge has never withdrawn as far as it is at present.
In addition, the ice plate is under tension and may fall apart if a piece breaks down at a key point.
The melting of Schelfeis and Eisberg does not increase sea level, as they swim on the water and displace ice as much water as it results after melting itself.
However, the loss of the Schelfeiter causes the glaciers to flow directly into the sea and to drain much faster than before.
This could potentially increase sea levels, but only to a small extent, writes the British research project on Antarctic Observation (Midas).
According to AWI figures, the Larsen-C Schelfeis is the fourth largest Schelfeis in Antarctica, with almost 50 000 square kilometres.
At the transition from the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick, at the front edge to the free ocean about 200 meters.
It breaks down regularly there.
“Although it is a natural event and we are not aware of any direct link to climate change, the ice shield is now in a more vulnerable position,” said Martin O'Leary of Swansea University, UK.
“This is the widest retreat since the beginning of the records,” he also confirmed.
Among scientists, it is controversial whether the Larsen-C Schelfeis will grow again or go back in the long term and possibly collapse, his colleague Adrian Luckman said, adding: “Our models say it will be less stable”.
But this development will take decades.
Although these researchers have not led to the demolition of this gigantic iceberg due to climate change, many of the Antarctic Peninsula's ice skeletons have declined in recent decades.
This long tip of Antarctica stretches towards South America.
According to data from the British Antarctic Survey research programme, the ice surface of the Antarctic Peninsula has declined by 28,000 square kilometres since the 1950s.
The rise in temperature contributed to the decline.
The Antarctic Peninsula has warmed up by around three degrees over the past 50 years, making it one of the fastest growing areas.
CDU wants house rate at the staff
As it is becoming increasingly difficult to fill vacancies, the CDU is calling for the employers' association to leave in order to become more attractive.
Just before the summer break, the day of the circle has won 41 new positions in the administration.
More than 1100 employees and officials work for the district administration in Mettmann.
Now 17 apprentices have completed their first working day.
The faculty of the circle seems to be highly sought after.
Approximately 620 applications were made for the places to be awarded this year.
However, the circle still lacks staff to cope with the increased demands and tasks.
At present, there are still 50 unoccupied posts in the Mettmann district.
Among other things, doctors and engineers as well as general administration forces are being called for.
The CDU now wishes to take the initiative together with the FDP and the UWG on the day of the reign and to counter the shortage of staff in the administration.
According to the wishes of the parties, the administration should “develop a concept for the recruitment and development of personnel”.
The aim is not only to meet short-term needs for skilled workers, but also to counter the shortage of candidates in a forward-looking way, it says.
The overall concept should be oriented inwards and outwards, show concrete measures for cross-beginners and include a training offensive, demand CDU, FDP and UWG.
That sounds like a good approach.
Because the circle has to do with personal problems that were not known in the past.
Other cities recruit good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions.
We are talking about a real 'competition of public employers'.
In addition, there are a large number of employees who leave the service due to illness or age.
High time to act, so that no more vacancies remain vacant.
But Klaus-Dieter Völker, head of the CDU group, goes beyond the joint motion with his party.
He recently caused a fist-thick surprise in the circle when he publicly questioned the personnel cost cover and astonished the other parties.
Peoples would like to see all the possibilities for leaving the local employers' association reviewed.
“If we do not find a satisfactory solution here in the short term, the district administration should aim for a house tariff with the trade unions - perhaps also in cooperation with the municipal cities -” states peoples.
In doing so, the CDU is trying to pay employees and civil servants better than the tariff for the public service actually provides.
The salaries are currently exactly prescribed, increases or more money only exist if you move to a higher level that is oriented to professional years.
However, the tasks of the circle have grown more and more in recent years.
Only a few weeks ago, new rooms had to be set up in which employees took care of the provisions of the new Prostitute Protection Act.
Not least because of the increasing number of asylum seekers, the council Thomas Hendele and the county director Martin Richter have a problem: they have too little staff.
Italy tightening tone to NGO migrant lifeboats
Italy has warned NGOs using lifeboats for migrants in the Mediterranean that they should not continue unless they comply with new rules for their operations.
“If NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct, it is difficult to see how they can continue to work,” said Interior Minister Marco Minniti in an interview with the Turin daily La Stampa.
Minnitis's warning came a day after the Italian authorities seized a boat from the German aid organisation 'Jugend Rettet' because their team had effectively worked with human traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration.
The aid organisation, which has only been in operation for a year, refused to comment on detailed allegations by the Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.
“For us, saving human life is and remains our top priority. We are therefore very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment,” the organisation said in an opinion on social media.
“We cannot assess any allegations that are currently being made until we have collected all the information and can assess the situation.”
The Italian authorities have been monitoring the boat of 'Jugend Rettet', the Iuventa, since October.
It is believed that his crew will take on board dinghy migrants, delivered directly to them by human traffickers, and that smugglers will be able to depart so that the ships can be reused.
At least one such meeting allegedly took place only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast, according to the prosecutor's file, the content of which was published by Italian media.
The crew is suspected of overcoming the authority of the Italian Coast Guard to monitor rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not for any other reason.
Under the Code of Conduct, boats such as the Iuventa must, above all, have an Italian police officer on board to monitor their activities.
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have so far agreed to abide by the code: Save the Children, MOAS from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain.
The latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary, but acceptable, as they would not entail 'significant changes or disabilities' to their rescue operations.
Among those who refuse to sign is the Nobel Prize winner organization Doctors Without Borders (MSF).
Minniti has meanwhile said that the number of migrants arriving in Italy after the rescue measures has fallen sharply in recent weeks, resulting in a fruitful effort to strengthen the Libyan Coast Guard and cooperate with local mayors.
“In recent days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel,” the minister said.
He announced plans for further talks with Libyan mayors this month on economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving these countries in the hope of reaching Europe.
Climbs and Trials
Nine Weilermer bikers, the “Berlin outpost” and two guest riders met in Wachenheim in the North Palatinate to enjoy trials and sights for four days.
Three friendly guides were available for this purpose.
The accommodation in the Wachenheimer Tal proved to be a good starting point for the tours.
The castle and wine festival of Wachenheim was a welcome extra.
The first tour led to the Michaelskapelle above Deidesheim at hot summer temperatures along the vineyards.
It was followed by viewpoints, partly on towers, from which one could look far over the Pfälzer Wald and the upstream plains.
In between, there have always been longer climbs, for which long trials rewarded.
On the second day we went to Bad Dürkheim to the Saline and the Volksfest Wurstmarkt.
Once again, the vantage point was aligned with the vantage point, connected by “flowy” trials and moderate climbs.
Over the last two days, there have been many climbs.
Caves, rocks, towers, castles, ruins and retreats brought welcome breaks.
In Bad Dürkheim, the bikers breathed healing brine in the open-air inhalatory.
New Town was also approached.
After 173 kilometers and almost 4500 meters of altitude, the group had met the Pfälzer Wald from its best side - sporty and cultural.
Console instead of lawn - Bundesliga equips itself for e-sports
Are the sports stars in the future sitting in front of computer consoles instead of sweating through the stadium grass in the wind and weather?
The fact is that e-sports has long become a serious industry, a lucrative business - big stars, millions of fans and huge tournaments with high gaits included.
This is also recognised by the first Bundesliga federations, which are increasingly involved in this area.
The VfL Wolfsburg started in 2015, followed by FC Schalke 04 and finally by VfB Stuttgart, which founded an e-sports department in mid-July and signed two professionals for the FIFA 17 computer game.
“We hope that this will inspire new young target groups for the VfB,” says Managing Director Jochen Röttgermann.
He is sure that “there are still many clubs on this train”.
Next weekend, the FIFA World Cup in London will host the first Interactive Club World Cup, where gamers from different clubs compete.
In addition to Schalke and Wolfsburg, Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain and PSV Eindhoven have qualified.
Robin Dutt also sees great potential in e-sports.
The ex-trainer of Bayer Leverkusen and Werder Bremen now advises an agency for virtual football players.
“Real football has to deal in particular with the 14 to 30-year-olds that young people will continue to go to the stadium in the future,” says the 52-year-old.
And: The clubs tried to conquer all sorts of markets, especially the Asian ones.
With prominent e-athletes under contract, you could be present online much more often in these markets than sending the Bundesligamannschaft to Asia only once a year.
What exactly is this about?
In e-sports, computer games such as “League Of Legends”, “Dota 2”, “Counterstrike” or even the football simulation FIFA will be challenged at the competition level.
For a long time, as in normal sports, leagues have established themselves in which the professionals compete against each other.
And at the 2022 Asian Games, e-sport is already part of the official program.
But is it a real sport at all?
For many, the idea is certainly in need of getting used to.
Ingo Froböse has also dealt with the question for a long time.
For the professor at the German Sports School in Cologne, E-Sport is a sport because it is competitive and shows many biological and physical reactions that can also be found in classical sports - for example, increased heart rates, stress reactions, hormonal changes.
It also requires cognitive skills, a technical and tactical understanding and a fast response capability.
Professional gamers should not only train at the console, but also their body and pay attention to the diet.
“The fitte player is a good player.”
But frobous people also see problems: “Doping is becoming more and more an issue”.
Checks were difficult to carry out in online games, and in the scene the structures of classical sport were lacking.
Positively, the scientist highlights the high integrative effect of e-sport.
Players are traveling internationally, this is like a large global family, there are no intercultural barriers.
A study by Deloitte's management consultancy and the Federal Association of Interactive Entertainment Software (BIU) predicts rapid growth in e-sports.
In 2016, EUR 50 million had been implemented in Germany, mainly through advertising, sponsorship and major tournaments.
In three years, sales are expected to reach 130 million.
This is little against the nearly 2.4 billion euros of the Bundesliga football.
However, e-sport is “not far from the other established sports such as handball, basketball or ice hockey,” the Deloitte advisors write.
Many countries are already on the international side.
Major markets are Asia and the US, where ex-basketball players Shaquille O'Neal and baseball star Alex Rodriguez join the US Team NRG eSports.
Hollywood actor Ashton Kutcher invests in the eSport betting provider Unikrn.
There is also a lot going on in Europe.
In a Norwegian school, e-sport was introduced as a subject of education, says Froböse.
In the Netherlands and France, according to Dutt, football first league clubs are now obliged to set up an e-sports department.
“Germany lags behind in the European comparison,” explains VfB Executive Board Röttgermann.
It is no longer enough to fall into nostalgia and to clarify the old times.
The aim is to preserve the tradition of the association, but at the same time to align the company with the modern market.
“We live in a digitalized world,” Dutt says.
“You can't hold on to the fact that it's only football that keeps everything the way it always was.”
Poison eggs ade - The egg alternatives for cooking and baking
The scandal of poisoned eggs has affected almost all the states.
Aldi Süd and Aldi Nord have reacted and removed all eggs from sale throughout Germany.
Only eggs that have been proven not to contain fipronil should be placed on the shelves.
Michelle Carter convicted of the texts pushing Conrad Roy to suicide
A woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years for encouraging her boyfriend to suicide through texts and calls.
Michelle Carter, now 20, will spend 15 months behind bars of her conviction and five years suspended on parole.
Carter was convicted in June of the negligent killing of Conrad Roy, who was arrested on 13 June. On July 1, 2014, life took place.
The father of Roy said at the hearing on Thursday, “My family is inconsolable.
My son was my best friend.”
Carter was allowed to remain free until the call.
She was faced with a maximum penalty of 20 years, but her legal representatives argued that both her and Mr Roy suffered from a mental illness.
Dressed in red pants and a cream blouse, Carter stood there with tears in her eyes, folded hands, and eyes facing down when she was convicted.
“Their actions killed Conrad Roy,” the prosecutor told the court.
“She ended his life to make her own better.
She didn't take any responsibility,” she said.
“She didn't show any regret.”
But Carter's lawyer said it was a “terrible circumstance that she totally regrets.”
However, Judge Lawrence Moniz said that he did not find out that her “age or maturity, or even her mental illness, has a significant impact on her actions”.
A prosecutor read a statement from Roy's mother Lynn Roy saying that “there is no day when I do not mourn the loss of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and how I handle everything. I try to be there for his sisters, despite all the pain we will carry with us for eternity,” he says.
Roy's sister, Camdyn Roy, said that she was “persecuted” by the realization that she would never attend her brother's wedding or be an aunt for his children.
“Not having the only person I've been with every day since I was born is a pain I'll always keep with me for the rest of my life,” she said.
The case seems to set a legal precedent, as there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to ask another to commit suicide.
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by a carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle in 2014.
The case attracted national attention after Carter's text messages revealed that she had encouraged him to end his life.
“Hang up, jump off a building, stab yourself, I don't know, there are many ways,” she said in several messages she had sent in the two weeks before his death while he was on vacation with his family.
In the moments before his suicide, she wrote, “You have to do it, Conrad” and “All you have to do is turn on the generator and you will be free and happy.”
Judge Moniz said that Carter sought attention by the death of Roy and ordered that she should benefit from the case through some press.
The case shared the legal opinion.
One of the few who defended Carter was Amanda Knox, who was convicted of murder of her British roommate in Italy in 2007 before being acquitted two years ago.
Mrs. Knox, 30 years old, published a comment in the Los Angeles Times: “Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help, not prison.”
Joshua Kimmich: Learning from the new mini-lame of FC Bayern
It is no coincidence that Joshua Kimmich was allowed to be captain of the Audi Cup.
FC Bayern is giving the Confed Cup winner a big season - extra motivation doesn't hurt.
Something was different in his place in the cabin, Joshua Kimmich immediately saw that, even if the extra garment was very, very small.
But as far and wide on the second day of the Audi Cup, of course, no Philipp Lahm and no Manuel Neuer were to be seen, he put the tie to his arm.
“The coach did not announce it,” said the Confed Cup winner after his first assignment as Bavarian captain.
Well, the entry could have been better than the 0:2 against the SSC Naples.
But the sign from the coach could also be interpreted by Kimmich.
It was not the eight-year-old Arturo Vidal who was chosen as the leader of the C-Elf, consisting of youth players, debutants and professionals who had just come out of vacation.
Sugarl is best distributed to those to whom you trust a lot to keep in a mood.
So if you have been chosen to take on the heritage of Lahm, you can only use a little extra motivation.
Kimmich confirmed: “This is what you want as a player: taking responsibility”.
On Wednesday, the 22-year-old flew over the field as a mini-lame.
On the back right, this is his position, the white bandage on the arm did the rest.
And at all Kimmich in this starting formation seemed like the one who can best take the helm in his hand.
He gave instructions, tried to steer the unsettled troop.
He had the look for the whole thing, while many others were engaged with themselves.
Vidal with overplaying his lack of fitness (hardly worked out); Renato Sanches with connecting to the performances of the Asia trip (worked only conditionally); and Sebastian Rudy and Niklas Süle with not noticing negatively in their first appearance in the Bavarian jersey.
That worked out pretty well.
Süle ran up next to Kimmich, Rudy before the defense, both acting sovereign.
The well-known Napoli storm was often difficult, and Süle also tried to succeed a few times in the building of the game.
His colleague Rudy admitted that the result was “not as we hoped”.
But he also showed a decent performance during his debut.
Game relocation, speed change: “For this style I was also fetched”.
How unusual this Bavarian world is for the new additions, one saw after the match.
Rudy, for example, did not give one or two in the catacombs, but determined six or seven interviews.
Kimmich said goodbye to a few crisp statements in the back of his new players.
There he heard an interesting phrase from Süle: “What is going on here, I have already noticed.
With Bavaria, you just have to win every game”.
After all, he doesn't have to teach the new.
Alaba motivates ÖFB women
David Alaba believes in the success of our ÖFB ladies
Austria's most famous footballer contacted us on Twitter shortly before the match and wished the ÖFB ladies all the best.
The Bavarian legionnaire is almost a club colleague of ÖFB captain Schnaderbeck and fears with our ladies.
The tweet of the Austrian footballer of the year and champion league winner should be a special motivational splash.
Our ladies might also need the famous Bavarian Dusel.
Company satisfied with Rhine-Palatinate Minister: Economy praises Wissing's pace
It was often irreconcilable, the relationship between the country and the regional economy, when Eveline Lemke (Green) was still Minister of Economics of Rhineland-Palatinate.
This is evident after more than a year in which the new Minister for Economic Affairs Volker Wissing (FDP) is in office.
Chambers and companies from the region speak of a change in economic policy at the T V request - and at the same time reprimand the old minister.
Frank Natus, Chairman of the Trier Enterprise Association (VTU), says: “Wissing addresses the wishes of the economy that Lemke has blocked all”.
Natus sees the biggest turning point in infrastructure policy: the gap in motorway 1 between Kelberg and Adenau is now at the top of the country's priority list.
This year, the Ministry is hoping for a plan-finding procedure, and by 2021 construction law will be in place.
The western circumvention of Trier, which is in the urgent need of the Federal Transport Route Plan, also plays a role in the country's plans.
The aim is to start the route in December 2020, says Minister Spokeswoman Cornelia Holtmann.
Natus sees this as a guide to supporting regional but internationally competing companies.
As suggested by Wissing, the Trier Chamber of Commerce and Industry (Chamber of Commerce and Industry) strives for a Rhineland-Palatinate label in wine to increase sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of German wine exports that have been slowing down for ten years.
In addition, Wissing has an open ear for people who want to start their own company, praises the Chamber of Commerce.
The Trier Chamber of Crafts sees in the new Master Bonus an additional incentive for young trainees, says Managing Director Matthias Schwalbach.
A premium of 1000 euros is provided for the passed master examination and 2500 euros if graduates become self-employed within ten years of the master training.
However, the homework list for the country remains long.
At the same time, the country lacks the necessary staff, says Jan Glockauer, Chief Executive Officer of the Trier Chamber of Commerce and Industry.
Of 56 new engineers wissing wants to hire mobility at the local company, only 29 jobs have been filled so far.
The ICC is calling for more contracts to be awarded to external offices.
CDU Group Vice-President Christian Baldauf refers to the Court of Auditors' calculations that the country will invest more than EUR 20 million in obtaining national roads in 2017 and 2018.
Frank Natus also expects a concept of the country as it aims to address the shortage of skilled workers in the region.
It is also disillusionable that broadband has been extending in the country so far.
In 2016, regional companies only rated the grid supply with a score of 3.4 in an IHK survey.
They complained about tiring Internet connections and disconnections.
Ex-Minister for Economic Affairs Eveline Lemke is currently out of politics and is still on the Supervisory Board of Pro Wind.
The Green Group left Lemke in April to become president of a private university in Karlsruhe - where, after four months of disagreement, she already cleared the field again.
Audi is expected to change 850,000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers face a counter-reaction
One day before the announcement of Audi, BMW said that it would offer to update the software in more than 350,000 vehicles.
The BMW Chairman said that the company believed that “there are smarter options than driving restrictions”, referring to banning or restricting diesel vehicles in European cities - including Munich, where BMW is based.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions.
None of the companies described the undertakings as a recall.
European car manufacturers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with carbon dioxide emissions rules.
But the nitrogen oxides that emit diesel engines are considered carcinogens and can cause asthma.
The cost for car manufacturers to install systems to neutralise emissions from diesel vehicles is also increasing, which makes it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of coddling the powerful car companies and ignoring signs of the problem.
The companies are trying to avoid the faults of Volkswagen, which could regulate the use of so-called shutdown devices that could comply with the regulations when a car has been tested, but fall back under normal driving conditions.
In the United States, several Volkswagen employees were charged, others are investigated on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former head of thermodynamics was arrested in Audi's engine development in Germany.
Former manager, Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio, is Italian and is therefore not protected from extradition and could be brought to justice in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi was involved in German criminal investigations at Volkswagen after the authorities accused Audi of having installed a system to circumvent emission regulations in Europe, and a request focused on the United States was extended.
The involvement of Audi in the investigation could put a heavy burden on Volkswagen: the luxury car manufacturer contributes disproportionately to Volkswagen's profit.
This message was sent to the raft on Saturday at the Isar
The city wants to protect the Isar.
So that the Isar visitors also participate, tomorrow Saturday a raft drives through Munich, which has a special message.
Whoever moves to the Isar again on Saturday will see a big raft between Flaucher and Reichenbachbrücke.
And this is not a common raft with Isar tourists.
But the construction unit wants to clarify.
On the raft you can see a large info transparent.
It shows a garbage mountain.
The launch of a public campaign to appeal to Isar visitors.
With the motto “True love is...” the understanding of the Isar as a protected wild river should sharpen.
Last summer, the raft drove over the Isar and this year, too, there are other actions and measures to achieve a considerate and environmentally conscious behaviour.
Mordillos's tuber noses and laughter against suffering
Mordillo was at times one of the most published cartoon draftsmen, the tubby noses of his characters are his trademark.
At 85, the Argentinian still draws and works on a film.
His message: Laughter, “because there is too much suffering in the world.”
Guillermo Mordillo was born on 4 July. Born in Buenos Aires on August 1, 1932 as the son of Spanish immigrants.
In his early years as an artist, he struck his way through, among other things, as a sketch artist for greeting cards - which frustrated him.
“The happiest day in my professional life was the day when my job was lost,” he once said.
After staging in Lima, New York and Paris, he made a breakthrough at the end of the 1960s: with the publication of his cartoons in “Paris Match” and then also in the “Stern” and other leading magazines around the world.
Even in China, Mordillo found many fans.
Again and again, the artist was inspired by cities.
Large, round Mordillo figures march in drawings with the Leaning Tower of Pisa, Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow.
In the early morning, according to his own data, he still sits at the drawing table today, working almost ten hours a day.
Through calendars, puzzles, books for young and old, t-shirts, plush toys and watches, his drooly figures continue to be widely used worldwide.
For six years he has also been working on a cartoon and a TV series with his characters.
The main person in the movie “Crazy Island” is a giraffe - Mordillos's most popular animal in his drawings - that has a centipede as an opponent.
For the first time, his characters speak in the 3D film, which is to come to the cinema screen in 2019.
“I don't know exactly what they're going to say, it's weird for me,” Mordillo says.
The script is not written by him.
That's why he relies more on the TV series, which, like his original drawings, is produced without words.
Lavender from Provence threatened by climate change
It has become a symbol of Provence in southern France, but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change.
Lavender is decreasing due to drought-like conditions and disease-borne insects, causing a great headache for scientists and farmers trying to find solutions.
Eric Chaisse, expert at the CRIEPPAM Agricultural Research Institute in Provence, said: “The lavender in Provence is effectively at risk because the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change in recent years, which has brought much less rain in spring and much more in autumn.
This has an impact on the life of lavender.
There is also a small cicade, a microbacterium that transmits dwarf cicadas, and in very dry weather there are many of them.”
And there's a lot at stake.
Lavender oil attracts not only holidaymakers, it is also very much in demand for perfume and cosmetics.
Eric Chaisse said: “Instead of having very long plant ears with a large number of flowers, we have smaller, underdeveloped and either missing or weakened.
So we have fewer parts with essential oil.”
The solutions considered include better water distribution and slowing evaporation from the soil, but also spraying the plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and developing varieties that are more resistant to dryness.
The town of Geisa in the Thuringian Rhön celebrates its 1200 year anniversary this year.
This Saturday and Sunday is the festival of the Middle Ages.
Traders, guilds, merchants, vagants or a country-servant camp should be present in the city centre these days.
The murder of a journalist underlines the growing threat in Mexico
The employees of the weekly Riodoce usually meet on Wednesday to review their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the state of Sinaloa due to organized crime, corrupt officials and incessant drug wars.
But that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security.
They have been told that it is important to change their routines.
Two high-level journalists discuss what feels safer: to take their children to the office, who were the target of a grenade attack in 2009, or to leave them at home.
Security experts wrote three words on a panel on the front of the room: opponents, neutrals, allies.
They ask the reporters to suggest names for each column - no proof is necessary, perceptions and abdominal feelings are sufficient.
There are drug smugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected of being on the payroll of the government or cartels, a catalogue of criminals that make the mess of Mexico dangerous.
There is no rest from violence, and while the bodies are piling up throughout the country, more and more journalists are involved: at least 25 since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012. 589 are under federal protection after attacks and threats, and so far there have been at least seven deaths this year in seven States.
Among the latter is its editor and inspirator of Riodoce, co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.
“The biggest mistake is living in Mexico and being a journalist,” Valdez wrote in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs.
His absence is deeply felt, although his presence is everywhere - a large photo of Valdez, showing his middle finger with the word “Justice”, hangs on the facade of the Riodoce building. Two reporters in the 1930s, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear T-shirts that show his smiling face with glasses or his typical panama hat.
The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared themes, trauma, their nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.
Although a special federal prosecutor's office was established in 2010 to deal with the cases of journalists, according to the Committee on the Protection of Journalists, it has initiated only two criminal proceedings.
As with most thousands of murders associated with drug trafficking and organised crime every year, the murderers of journalists are rarely brought to justice.
With Riodoce, they still insist on treating the violence of Sinaloa, although they are inconsolable and although the terrain is now even more treacherous.
Without information about the murderers, without justice, the meeting to discuss security has little benefit, says Ibarra.
“It's very stupid to waste my time in this workshop,” he says.
“As long as we don't know why, we all suspicious.”
In the morning of the 15th. Valdez left the office of the Riodoce newspaper in the capital of Culiacan.
He only managed to drive a few blocks before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men. He was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot at him, probably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with “Twelfth River”.
The shooter drove away in his car and damaged it nearby.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He left a woman and two adult children.
Rumors tend to fly freely around Culiacan.
But on the subject of Valdez, there is practically nothing but silence.
Since Guzman's arrest last year and extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa has become one of the country's bloodiest battlefields, as rival factions fight here to fill the vacuum.
It doesn't matter that in Sinaloa every day someone or several people are shot on the street or that the cemetery is full of ornate, two-storey mausoleums for drug kings, which are larger than many houses for the living.
Forget for a minute that there is a state of “rest” when only one cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trade routes to the United States.
Nevertheless, and despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, broke up with the guilt that he could not protect his friend.
He believes that two misunderstandings contributed to the murder.
Initially, in February, there was the publication of an interview with Damaso Lopez, a leader of one of the rival cartel groups in the war with Guzman's sons.
This publication may have upset the sons, suspected gang members bought each copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to newspaper kiosks.
The second mistake was not to force Valdez to leave the country for his own safety after the seizure of another newspaper that had published the same story.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is seen as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists.
He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed that he would always be there.
He worked as an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003 when he joined five colleagues to set up Riodoce and sold $50 holdings.
In Sinaloa, “it was impossible to do journalism without encountering the drug problem,” Bojorquez said.
Over time, the newspaper earned a reputation for courageous and honest reporting, and sales and advertising increased.
Reporters loved to be able to publish hard-hits investigations without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by a publication where they could read stories that no one else dared to treat.
Eight years after the foundation of Riodoce, she received the prestigious “Maria Moors Cabot Award” for her coverage in Latin America.
That same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee for the Protection of Journalists for his courage in persecuting Mexican drug history, wherever it led.
He voluntarily admitted that he was afraid.
“I want to live on,” he said at the time of the CPJ award.
Drug trafficking in Sinaloa “is a way of life,” he said last October in an interview with Rompeviento TV.
“You have to take on the task that falls to you as a journalist - either that or you play the stupid.
I don't want to be asked, “What did you do in the face of so many deaths... why didn't you say what was going on?”
The Riodoce team misses Valdez, the fun bird who could curse like a dockworker, the friend who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.
They trusted his routine.
He'd always wear his hat.
He would always go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, and sit there at the same table.
Now they ask: Was his love of routine his spoilage?
His death has forced them to question their own assumptions about how best to do their job and stay alive.
“You don't like it when you deal with their wives, their children, their clean shops, their secret runways,” to move drugs.
“These things were not allowed,” Bojorquez said.
The result is, even in the best times, a high level of self-censorship and self-preservation.
Trust his own instincts.
If it smells wrong, stay away from it.
The trouble is, the editor of the Riodoce Andres Villarreal said that “smell a sense that can be deceived... and then the thing happened to Javier.”
The old rules, as he and others say, no longer apply in Sinaloa - just as they do in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states where a poisonous mix of lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home.
The landscape is constantly changing.
In the room where Riodoce employees met for security training, no cell phones were suddenly allowed. Days earlier, it became known that spyware sold exclusively to governments was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.
Outside, two policemen sought protection from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shade of a tree.
They were commissioned by the state government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-storey building in a middle-class district of Culiacan.
Half a joke, some of the reporters wondered if these officers were among the 50 percent of the police officers the governor himself described as untrustworthy.
It's been months since the reporters went into the mountainous landscape, where the drug gangs are de facto under control.
For this week's edition Riodoce looked at three main stories.
There was the murder of the brother of the former known boxer Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.
They also had an exposition on government spending, which focused on the governor's hometown.
And there was a group that kidnapped one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, one block from the prosecutor's office.
There was no official word about who was kidnapped or how it happened, so caution was advised when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favorite place of drug dealers and authorities.
A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician belonging to the ruling Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), which dominated almost the entire century all political levels.
Recently, several PRI governors were accused of high-profile cases of corruption.
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this place, including one where a son of El Chapo Guzman escaped a military raid.
Only a few months earlier, readers would have considered the column of Valdez to be the most informed source of the kidnapping.
“We used to know what happened,” said Villarreal, 46, nicknamed “El Flaco” because of his slim body stature.
“Now all channels of communication with our sources are broken.”
The Valdez office has been rededicated to the storage space for signs and stickers protesting the murders of journalists, because employees have become something they themselves would never have expected: activists on behalf of the press.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez grabbed a few characters and went to a demonstration the next morning about another journalist to the prosecutor's office.
Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez was killed in the western state of Michoacan.
A burned body was discovered and officials say it's his, based on DNA tests.
All over the country, journalists have become louder by writing down “SOS Press” in organized protests on sidewalks and buildings.
On that day, director Bojorquez is gone to Washington to seek international support for justice in the Valdez case.
At a meeting with the Governor of Sinaloa the day after the assassination of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities of spying on journalists and having them killed because they told the truth.
Since then, she has asked for it to be reassigned by the government because she is concerned that her anger has violated her objectivity.
Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were “surrounded” by organized crime, government officials involved in it, and an indifferent society.
In his last book “Narco-Journalism”, he wrote that reporters are killed not only by drug gangs, but also by order of politicians and security forces who were in the midst of organized crime.
Last year, the media security group “Articulo 19” allocated more than half of the attacks on journalists to the police and officials.
“In Mexico, you die because they want you to shut up,” Ramirez said.
Obviously, the murders have a deterrent effect.
Nobody forgets the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago.
Her body was found along with a note allegedly signed by the Zetas cartel: “Here I am because of my reports.”
A computer keyboard and headphones lay next to her severed head.
Some branches have chosen to close, such as the newspaper El Norte in northern border state Chihuahua after the murder of correspondent Miroslava Breach in March.
Others continue, as did El Manana of Nuevo Laredo after the assassination of her director in 2004.
In 2010, the Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed the drug cartels with an editorial on the front page titled “What do you want from us?”
Some journalists have fled their home states or even the country.
It's a painful decision.
It's hard to find work in exile, and they're still watching the streets looking for dangers.
And sometimes they are hunted, as it seems to the photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered in 2015 together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Veracruz.
For those who remain behind and continue work, it is a daily dance with risky decisions.
Ibarra, who once wanted to be a poet, admits that drug trafficking scares him.
“Mexico goes to hell, and that's why I became a reporter,” he said.
At midnight last Friday, when the last edition was finished, the editors of Riodoce sat on the sidewalk in front of the office and drank beer when all of their phones started humming.
A number of shootings with gang rivals and security forces near the seaside resort Mazatlan had left 19 confirmed dead.
The war continued to escalate, as promised by a number of cartel embassies in the region.
From the curb, they have published the news on the website of Riodoce via mobile phone.
The front page had to be changed the next day.
Sirens are howling up nearby - another shooting in the area.
Bojorquez took a look at the cops who kept watch to see if they were on standby.
If they were scared at all, they didn't show it.
Under the enormous portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper, whose middle finger was visible to all Sinaloa, the employees of Riodoce followed his footsteps.
“How can you think of closing,” Bojorquez said, “if the same day Javier was murdered, the intern asked me to send her to the street for reporting.”
Dinosaurs used camouflage to dodge his enemies
At first glance, it looks like a statue, though a frightening one.
Now researchers have found that the first findings of the incredible rhinoceros of a Canadian miner were received so well that experts described it as “Mona Lisa the Dinosaur.”
It was so well preserved that they even realized that his flaky skin was reddish brown - and they said she had something of a “restless past.”
The report in the magazine “Current Biology” called him “the best-preserved armored dinosaur ever found and one of the best dinosaur specimens in the world”.
The Fossil is a newly discovered type of Nodo aurier that lived in the middle of the Cretaceous period between 110 million and 112 million years ago.
Its incredibly well preserved state has amazed researchers who describe it as “truly remarkable”
According to reports in National Geographic, the armored herbivore is the best preserved fossil of its kind.
It was found by Shawn Funk when he was 21. March 2011 at the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada, dug.
He encountered something that seemed to be out of place from the surrounding rock and decided to look more closely.
The fossil he discovered was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.
They spent the next six years uncovering the wild animal within the 2,500 pounds (1,100 kg) of Earth Clump.
After all this hard work, the finished result is now ready to be revealed.
“If you blink a little with your eyes, you could almost believe it slept,” said the main author Caleb Brown, scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature is to be seen.
“It will go into science history as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaur specimens - the Mona Lisa of the dinosaur.”
Researchers have found that this herbivorous, although covered with armor and resembling a walking tank, was probably threatened by flesh-eating dinosaurs.
The heavily armored dinosaur used a red and white camouflage to hide from predators and used a shield technique known as a counter-shade, which is also used by many modern animals.
This would have allowed us to mix better in our environment and avoid our enemies, experts say, suggesting that it was threatened by larger dinosaurs.
The 110 million-year-old creature from the Nodo's family made headlines for the first time in May and is now on display at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.
Researchers have now studied the wild animal and called it Borealopelta markmitchelli according to the museum technician Mark Mitchell, one of a team that has spent more than 7,000 hours discovering it carefully.
The amazing preservation of the specimen allowed Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and shape of dandruff and armor over his body.
They discovered the counter shading, a common defense method in the animal kingdom, which means that the tip of the creature was darker than its underside.
Although countershading is common, the results are surprising, as the size of Borealopelta far exceeds that of today's living animals.
It suggests that the dinosaur was chased by enough pressure from flesh-eating dinosaurs, that evolution favoured concealment of confrontation as a means of survival.
But most of the contemporary animals that use counter shading - think of deer, zebras, or shingles - are much smaller and more vulnerable than prey, signaling that this Nodo aurier was exposed to a real struggle for survival.
“Strong predator behavior on a massive, heavily armored dinosaur shows how dangerous the dinosaur predators must have been of the Cretaceous era,” Brown said.
The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaur was reddish brown.
Scientists continue to investigate the animal for evidence of his life, including its preserved intestinal content, to find out what it ate as his last meal.
They believe that the dinosaur, when he died, fell into a river and was driven out into the sea, where he sank on his back to the bottom of the sea.
At that time, Alberta was as warm as Southern Florida today, and rivers and oceans probably spread much further inland than they are today.
“This Nodo Dog is truly remarkable because it is completely covered with preserved scaly skin, but it is also preserved in three dimensions and retains the original shape of the animal,” Brown said.
“The result is that today the animal looks almost the same as in the early chalk period.
You don't need to use much imagination to reconstruct it. If you just squint a little with your eyes, you could almost believe he's asleep.”
The chalk era was a time when huge theropodes, carnivorous dinosaurs standing on two legs, crossed the earth.
Although the king of them, the Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions of years after Borealopelta, the armored dinosaur was hunted by some of his fearsome ancestors.
This includes the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38-foot (11.5 m) long, six-ton monster.
Scientists, whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta was sank into the sea after death and mummified in the mud.
The creature was found by Shawn Funk when he was 21. March 2011 at the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada, dug.
According to the museum, it is the best-preserved armored dinosaur in the world, including skin and armor, and is complete from the muzzle to the hip.
On average, the creatures were about 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).
It contained two 20-inch-long tips that stood out from his shoulders.
Researchers believe that the armored herbivorous was swamped through Western Canada until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea.
But the dinosaur's underwater burial kept his armor in exquisite detail.
The petrified remains of this special specimen are preserved so well that the skin remains still cover bumpy armour plates along the dinosaur
As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, such a level of conservation is as 'rare as a lottery win.
The more I look at it, the more confusing it gets.
Stoned remains of the skin still cover the bumpy armour plates that carry the animal's skull.
His right forefoot is on his side, his five fingers are spread upwards.
I can count the shed on his sole.
In thunderstorm: mass carambola on A8: Many injured
Heavy accident on Thursday evening on the A8: Nearly 30 vehicles are involved in a mass carambola.
There are many injured, kilometres of traffic jams - and gaffers.
On the highway Stuttgart-Munich (A8) about 20 people were injured at a mass carambola on late Thursday afternoon.
According to the police, around 5 p.m. between Adelzhausen and Odelzhausen (Aichach-Friedberg district), almost 30 vehicles, probably including trucks, had crashed into each other during a thunderstorm.
The exact number of injured persons was not initially available.
It was a minor to moderate injury, said a police spokesman.
A large number of rescue vehicles was at the scene of the accident.
The A8 has been completely closed in the direction of Munich.
In the direction of travel Munich, a backlog of around ten kilometres was formed.
As an AZ reporter reports, massive disabilities were also experienced on the counter-carriageway - by numerous gaffers.
The fire brigade noted the registration plates of the vehicle handlebars, which now have to expect sensitive penalties.
Shortly after 18:45, a second accident occurred on the A8, this time between Augsburg and Dasing.
There was a collision between a car transporter and a car.
A rescue helicopter was on its way to the scene of the accident.
Deutsche Bahn: Group tests “Comfort Check-in”
It is a moment that almost everyone has experienced before: nothing suspecting you sit on the train and sleep.
Or you are deeply immersed in your work and just have a brilliant thought.
And then, pufff.
If the conductor comes and wakes you up ungently or tears the passenger out of the workflow.
Ticket control.
But the times of interruptions are soon over.
Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the careless ticket control system.
You simply confirm by mobile phone that you take your place and devalue the ticket.
Currently a test operation is running on two routes.
“If the offer comes up, we'll expand it.
It is expected to be available at the beginning of next year on many other long-distance routes in Germany,” said a railway spokesman.
“Comfort check-in” is the name of the ticket devaluation without a conductor.
In order to use them, however, some prerequisites must be met: you need a smartphone or a tablet.
And you have to have an online ticket - which most passengers already do.
It must also be purchased via the train app, DB Navigator, which is the most convenient way to book tickets anyway.
And last but not least, you need a seat reservation.
The “comfort check-in” works like this: you get on the train, call up your ticket under “My tickets”.
A button for electronic devaluation will then appear for the test customers.
The train attendants receive a message on their mobile devices that Passenger X is on the train and has occupied the booked seat Y.
If the train attendant takes place Y at ticket control, he knows that there is a passenger with an online ticket that has already been devalued.
So you can keep sleeping, keep working, keep silent.
The “check-in” has two advantages: one for the customer, one for the train - which in turn should benefit the passengers.
“If you want to travel relaxed without ticket control through our train attendants, simply check in yourself in the DB Navigator.
This allows passengers to personalise their travel time on the train,” says Michael Peterson, marketing director of DB Fernverkehr.
Second plus: “And our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs”.
Those who often travel by train know that in addition to delays and missed trains, ticket checks are among the biggest nuisances.
Often, you don't have all the documents you need for online ticket devaluation, but in any case one of your fellow travellers does.
Either the credit card or ID card is missing or there is a document to show.
The result is endless discussions between the train attendant and the passenger, which leads to a bad mood in the compartment or large area and delays in the control of your own ticket and ultimately takes the time to take care of other concerns.
Only a small number of test customers can still use the new service.
And only on the connections ICE 915 Dortmund-Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart-Essen.
Further train numbers on the same route are not yet unlocked.
How an activist got to learn the answer to the question: “Whose Streets?”
On 9. On August 1, 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shaken to its core.
Just a day after she arrived in New York City, she sat in St. Louis Born on the bed of an Airbnb apartment she rented and scrolled through Facebook on her phone.
She stumbled upon a post from someone in high school.
“The police just killed an 18-year-old child, and it's still on the street,” they said.
Confused, since no one else had posted the information on their feed, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
A user with the handle @TheePharoah was constantly retweeted on their timeline.
The rapper from the territory of St. Louis was about to tweet the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old killed by a white cop in Ferguson, Mon.
He posted a picture of Brown's lifeless body, which was stretched out on the street and would stay there for four hours.
“That's wild,” said Ferrell.
But death was nothing new for her and her community.
She dropped her phone to return to tweets about people on Canfield Drive later in the evening.
There were photos of the police band and people who screamed, and of a man who claimed to be Brown's father wearing a sign saying, “Ferguson's police just killed my unarmed son!”
She watched a live feed where a policeman stood in front of a group of protesters with a barking dog.
In another video, she said another policeman insured his rifle and yelled, “I'm going to... Animals kill everyone.”
“This is not common,” Ferrell remembered her statement.
“This is not the kind of murder we've gotten used to and we can call it typical.”
At that moment I felt chills.
I was angry and crying.”
She booked a return flight and went home the next day.
After landing at 11 p.m., she picked up her 6-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided that the two would go to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson in the next three years is the subject of a new documentary, “Whose Streets?” , in cinemas from 11.
It is a history of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and resilience from the point of view of the people who live in the community and have filled the streets to ask for answers.
When Ferrell drove to Ferguson with her daughter wearing a floral dress and a matching crown, they discussed a conversation they had countless times before this morning “about the black experience and the black state.”
“You remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe in?” she remembered what she said.
“We're going to Ferguson now because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and that wasn't right.
I couldn't take her,” Ferrell said later.
“What happened today is a culmination of what happened in the past.
She needs to know and see and be raised in it.
It must be well developed, not only activism and organization, but also know the different layers of black experience and the black constitution, and what we must do to become free to free ourselves.
Even though I'm lucky enough to give her an experience in which she personally doesn't experience blatant racism, she's no different from the next black women's child.
I feel like I'd do her a bad job keeping her away from it.”
The first stop when she arrived in Ferguson was on South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police department, which became a camp area when the activists were waiting for Officer Darren Wilson's possible non-indictment.
There Ferrell and her daughter connected with a local business owner who made lunch.
They prepared bags and helped pass them on to protesters.
Slowly a new kind of activism began to take shape for Ferrell.
“My activism turned out after the 9th She noted that she was a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis was president of the Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on food justice and health inequalities in black communities.
“I had no experience in organizing.
Everything has come.”
Weeks later, Ferrell met during an evening demonstration Sabaah Folayan, one of the co-directors of the film.
Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar just wanted to “document” what happened.
One question came to Ferrell's mind: “Do you want to document or are you trying to find a story that you can exploit?”
This scepticism was nourished by countless cases of people, often of white people - in a community that benefited from their pain and resilience.
As Folayan recently said in an interview, “We heard that people who were born and raised in Ferguson didn't center their voices and we wanted to do it differently.”
Folayan had already worked with the then co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the field known for his activism around death row inmates.
His commitment brought Ferrell closer to the project, along with six other locals, followed the team of “Whose Streets?” in the years after Brown's shooting.
“This documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks to us. We're talking,” Davis said.
“That was the main thing for me, how these people are depicted, because that's how I will be depicted.”
The goal was not to focus on Ferrell's experience - to show that the movement “is not a Messiah leader, but a community that comes together,” Folayan said - it proved to be the most open participant in the film.
As a result, documents of “Whose Streets?” surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrell's life, how she falls in love and marries her wife.
“I felt naked,” Ferrell said, laughing when she first saw the finished product.
“But I understand that there must be some vulnerability in this work and in the humanization of black people.”
In addition, Ferrell's story repeats the role of black gay women in the broader Black Lives Matter movement.
Two of the three founders of the movement, who, after the killing of the black teenager Trayby Martin in 2012, shaped the film “BlacklivesMatter” on social media, identify themselves as gay.
“Black gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement as a whole,” said Ferrell, “and therefore we are constantly fighting on different fronts.
Black, gay women must bear the main burden of everything.”
Folayan agreed to note that “the movement is really maintained by black women and many black women”.
However, it insists that “this is not an affirmative type of action”, in which Ferrell was chosen as the heart of the film because of her identity.
“She was the person who stirred up this energy,” she said.
“It's no coincidence, even though she was at the forefront, because in a life on these crossings as a black gay woman, so much is at stake.
You can feel their energy through the screen.”
Meanwhile, the news cameras in Ferguson have long disappeared, but the racial ties between the community and the police continue to exist.
Ferrell is on parole for 2½ years because of the blockage of a highway in a demonstration.
She describes the socio-political atmosphere of the area, which she calls her home: “A Chaos”.
Nevertheless, she clings to a song and she feels obliged to this memory since she went out on the street in Ferguson three years ago.
“It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It's our duty to win.
We need to love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose - except our chains.”
From “Dream” to “Magnitude”: TV readers discuss bit gallery
The Bit Gallery moves people, although it is not yet built.
But the idea of a shopping center at the south end of the pedestrian zone has split the population into supporters and opponents since the first presentation in 2009.
The subject hardly leaves one cold.
The topic is also discussed on our Facebook page “Volksfreund Bitburg”.
While some of them say to the Bit Gallery: “This would be a dream” (Anja Becker) or “This would be really great” (Nicole Schausten), from the other hand comes: “Does not need a human” (Siggi Betzen) or quite simply: “Magnitude!” (Lars Scholz).
While the supporters are counting on a gallery to move more customers into the city, which also benefits the rest of the business, the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone will bleed out.
In addition, the gallery is planned exactly on the property where the farmers' market hall is located, where 13 direct marketers offer their products.
This will end with the start of construction work.
The gallery creators want to integrate a market hall into the new building - to the Beda Square with the possibility to sit outside.
Simone Zimmer: “For many years we have been buying almost weekly in the farmers' market hall.
Mainly our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of the country women always very happy.
We also discovered the butcher's shop for ourselves.
We would like to see a chance to maintain this offer even during and especially after the construction of the gallery.
In other cities, there is.
Especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting.”
Gerd Densing: “Whether direct marketers settle in a market hall in the gallery depends on the amount of the rent.
This should not be very low in the new project.”
Eva Kilic: “Why shopping palaces in Bitburg?
Whether clothing, shoes, drugstore or supermarkets: I find this superfluous.
There's enough of that in our town.
You can see how many stores are empty here - some for months and years.
However, since there is not even a regular weekly market here, it is all the more important that we at least keep the market hall.
After all, the product offered there is fresh, is mostly offered directly by the producer and is also inexpensive.
As you can see, shops in a shopping centre are only rented by larger companies, because the rents there are often not wearable for a retailer.
It's a pity there are no more special shops, and what's left of them will probably disappear.”
Wolf Fandel: “A shopping centre with a market hall does not fit together for me.
And the gallery doesn't fit Bitburg.
Above all, where is the farmers' market hall going during the construction period?
The old Edeka would be the solution - even in the long run, if the bit gallery actually comes at some point.
Or does the ghost bit gallery manage to sell all the shops from Bitburg before?”
George Marquet: “This just won't work.
And no one needs a shopping center that's empty.
In my opinion, it would have been better to promote a real farmers' market instead of this gallery.
But for a farmers' market hall there is no room for meaningless construction projects in Bitburg, thanks to the insanely many - I think -.
If the farmers' market hall is destroyed, a piece of culture will disappear again.”
A matching resemblance: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Manning's DNA
In the middle of the room of the Fridman Gallery in New York you can see many faces - white, black and brown, almost imperceptibly similar - hanging on cables from the ceiling.
The 30 portraits were created by artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from cheek swabs and haircuts sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent out the excerpts from Fort Leavenworth prison, where the former intelligence analyst served a 35-year prison sentence after publishing classified diplomatic reports on WikiLeaks.
The new exhibition, which will take place on 2. A Becoming Resemblance (A matching similarity).
It is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline united her expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a transwoman and groundbreaking dissident, whose condemnation was transformed by Barack Obama when he had only three days left in office.
Dewey-Hagborg, through the algorithmic analysis of DNA extracted from Manning, from which 30 portraits were created, what someone might look like with these genomic data, has made a sharp, albeit somewhat intellectual comment not only on the formability of DNA data - the many ways in which they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also created for identity.
Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward, but has spoken openly about identifying as a woman since her puberty, was convicted of 20 charges in 2013, including six violations of the Spy Act, computer fraud, and theft.
Her picture was suppressed by the prison, so much so that there was only one photo - a grainy black and white selfie in which Manning is visibly uncomfortable sitting in a driver's seat wearing a platinum blonde wig - with which she was associated.
In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg just came from the great success of her 2012 project 'Stranger Vision'.
In it, the artist produced portraits of strangers from forensic artifacts such as cigarette studs and chewing gum by extracting the DNA from the waste to make a picture of what these people might look like.
That was the time she received an email from a newspaper magazine.
“They interviewed Chelsea Manning while she was in prison, and they wanted some kind of portrait to accompany this article,” said Dewey-Hagborg at a press preview of the new exhibition.
And she couldn't be visited at that time, and she couldn't be photographed, so you contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait.
The artist and her imprisoned muse became unequal pen pals, which exchanged several letters over the course of two years.
They even created a comic book “Suppressed Images” illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, which foresaw a future in which the President of Chelseas would convert judgment and would be able to see the exhibition in person.
The fact that only a few days after the book was published, Obama would actually demand Manning's release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas was a welcome kind of happy meeting.
There is also something deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition, as Donald Trump is waging a war against informants from the government camp and transgender troops to find new, tweetable ways to further inflame the rigid divisions that he was supposed to fix.
When Dewey-Hagborg was asked about the strange timing of all these things, she said that “things happen for a reason.”
In an artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery, Manning, with her oversized signature below it (the “i” in her family name has a heart), demanded an end to the “automatic fragmentation, the basis of which was gender, race, sexuality and culture.”
On the opposite wall is their mitochondrial DNA sequence - a centipede of Cs and Gs and As, written in pencil.
Dewey-Hagborg hoped by incorporating the 200 letters (or nucleotides according to the artist's advanced scientific lexicon) to show how amazingly similar, at least in biological terms, we are all.
“What people will hopefully take away from it is that our genome does not care who we are and how open genetic data is for interpretation and how subjective they are,” said Dewey-Hagborg, whose 2007 video work, Spurious Memories, is also on display.
“DNA data can tell so many different stories, so that's 30 of those stories.”
The last piece in the exhibition, which is stored in its own room, is a page from the above-mentioned comic book novel.
She shows Manning how she shows up with a hands-free phone in her hand from the disciplinary arenas of the United States like King Kong.
“If they cold your speech, then they won,” it says.
“So never shut up.”
“It came directly from a letter she wrote to me,” said the artist, who greets from Philadelphia.
“I still get goosebumps when I talk about it.”
Manning has not seen the exhibition in person - as it was anticipated in the comic book - but if she did, it will be welcomed in the middle of the room by the masks, by their own genomic simulacres, which collapse like hordes of protesters.
This was also targeted, like everything in the exhibition, up to the size (5” 2, Manning's stature), in which their genetic haplogroups were written with pencil.
“In the past, I had them on the wall, but I wanted them to feel like a crowd,” said Dewey-Hagborg of the portraits.
“I wanted it to feel like a mass movement formed with Chelsea, like the movement that was behind their liberation.”
Professor of the University of Northwestern and an employee of the University of Oxford wanted for killing
A nationwide human hunt is underway for a professor at Northwestern University and an employee at Oxford University, who are sought as suspects after a man was stabbed with fatal injuries in a luxurious apartment in Chicago.
On Monday, arrest warrants for Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) were issued for murder for their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, as the files of the Cook County District Court show.
The documents say that Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after several stitches.
A Community alert system published by the Chicago Police Department states that the body was killed on 27 May. July was discovered.
Officials received a call, arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body.
Cornell-Duranleau was still declared dead at the site of the event, and detectives are investigating the tricks as murder, while the police are actively looking for the two suspects, officials said.
Lathem has been an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, Vice President of University Relations, said in an e-mail statement that Lathem was now on leave and excluded from entering the Northwestern University campus.
“This is now a criminal matter under investigation by the competent authorities, and Northwestern University cooperates in this investigation,” Cubbage said.
Warren is Senior Treasury Assistant at Oxford University.
A spokesman from the University and Somerville College said in an email statement that “we are in contact with the police in the UK and ready to help the US investigation authorities in every way possible.”
The statement added that Warren's colleagues were shocked and wanted him to turn himself in.
Chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Department, Anthony Guglielmi, said he strongly urged the suspects to face up to the authorities.
“The police have an idea of their whereabouts, and our efforts to locate them are intensifying,” Guglielmi said.
Guglielmi said that local, regional and national authorities help to find the suspects.
Guglielmi said the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand Plaza building, who had just received a mysterious tip saying something happened in apartment 1008.
The police described the scene as very cruel.
Guglielmi said that it was unclear whether the incident was also taking place on 27 May. The event took place in July.
Security cameras confirmed that Lathem and Warren were in the building.
“We believe that Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship,” Guglielmi said.
The Grand Plaza management team published a statement to the residents: “The police are currently working on the timeline and background of the victim, exploring a variety of motives, including a possible domestic incident.”
“We will complete the WADA roadmap in the near future” - Russian deputy Prime Minister Mutko
Russian deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said it would not take long for the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) to be implemented for the restoration of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA).
“At a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the roadmap, RUSADA has been given the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD (UK Anti-Doping).
The WADA roadmap has been updated in this respect,” said Mutko on Thursday.
The PM commented on the second part of the WADA roadmap to comply with the code describing the criteria for reinstating RUSADA and recently published on the organisation's website.
According to Mutko, it does not contain anything that could cause concern for Russia.
“Everything has been announced, everything is being implemented.
And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and the WADA in the near future,” he added.
However, one of the criteria mentioned in the list states that the Russian anti-doping authorities have to publicly accept the reported results of the WADA-approved investigation by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren on alleged state-sponsored doping in Russian sport.
Regarding the matter, Mutko said: “We are conducting the investigation because our anti-doping system has confessed to a mistake.
All measures have been implemented.
But there were no state programs, and we will not admit something that does not exist.”
Mutko's words agreed with those of Vitaly Smirnov, the head of the independent Russian anti-doping commission.
In conversation with the Russian sales office RSport at the beginning of the day, Smirnov admitted problems to the past in Russian anti-doping organizations, but then added: “We have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations.
No one intends to accept this report unconditionally,” Smirnov added.
In November 2015, in the wake of the doping scandal, RUSADA was excluded from the implementation of doping controls in Russia.
However, it has been allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti-Doping (UKAD).
After a visit to the headquarters of the organization in Moscow in July, WADA Director General Olivier Niggli declared that RUSADA is moving “in the right direction” to be reinstated.
Aldi doesn't sell eggs anymore for now
This was shared by the business groups.
It was a purely precautionary measure that no health impairment could continue to be assumed, as stated in the communication.
From now on, only eggs that have been proven to have been tested negative for fipronilated anti-lice agents are expected to be delivered to Aldi.
Aldi wants to create clarity and transparency for its customers.
The start-ups that will help your business not to become the next Uber
Amy Errett wanted to measure the happiness of your e-commerce start-up with your employees, but the surveys didn't work.
Answers were often vague, little helpful, or even worse fraudulent.
And even if you promised anonymity, some workers didn't trust the trial.
“There was simply never consistency and objectivity,” said Errett, who runs the 75-person San Francisco e-Commerce Hair Care company Madison Reed.
She called people from outside for help.
A new breed of Human Resources startups is growing to help companies find out how their employees feel.
By creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement, it allows companies to conduct surveys, address special groups and demographic groups, provide employees with anonymity and complaint hotlines, and in some cases allow whistle blowers to Suite executives and directly contact the Board of Directors.
“You now have tools like Strava and Fitbit for tracking their health, but where is Fitbit for your business?” said Jim Barnett, co-founder and chief executive of Redwood City Start-up Glint, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement.
Errett said that she gained a better insight into what your employees think and feel during the three years with Glint.
In addition to the snap surveys and surveys of certain teams, it offers a heat map of the company, which at a glance shows which units have the most complaints and which executives have low consent results - so you can redrill why.
Businesses are getting to realize that they need to stay at the forefront of the workplace culture so that you don't become the next Uber involved in scandals since a former employee published a blog post describing an environment of harassment in which those who spoke were punished.
For start-ups like Glint, this desire for an overview is a lucrative business opportunity.
The global governance, regulation and compliance industry could have more than $118.7 billion in value in 2020, according to the financial website Let's Talk Payments.
Denver, Colorado, start-up Convercent, which helps companies prevent and detect bad behavior, saw an increasing interest and activity earlier this year amidst the Uber case in discredit.
Convercent has nearly 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber recently registered as a client.
Like Glint, Convercent lets companies send tailor-made “pulse” surveys, collect confidential answers in real time, and view the heat maps of your problem areas.
It also provides an anonymous SMS hotline that allows employees to report bad behavior.
And if the Chief Executive is involved, complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board.
“The court of public opinion has captured the regulators,” said Patrick Quinlan, founder and managing director of Convercent.
When a company is found that treats its employees badly or behaves unethically, it can experience costly consequences from consumer boycott, employee turnover and complaints, Quinlan said.
Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 locations, has used Convercent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of policy and procedures and have an easy way to reach their corporate headquarters.
Previously, if an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a phone number or email for the corporate headquarters, file a formal complaint, and hope he or she was taken seriously.
It was often an intimidation and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesdays General Counsel, who said there was no good way to track employee complaints.
Now that Convercent is in use, problems previously hidden by executives sitting in offices in cities or states - such as discrimination, harassment, or unfair practices - can be identified and addressed more quickly.
“I can get closer to this holistic, 360-degree view of employment experience,” said Vitrano, who runs the Risk Management Group of Ruby Tuesday.
“And we protect our shareholders from employment litigation.”
Companies began to take ethics, values and employee engagement more seriously in 2002, after the accounting firm Arthur Andersen collapsed due to ethical violations by the Enron scandal, said Quinlan.
But it took until the “social media came to their right” that companies realized that they could not prevent their dirty laundry from going online.
“Before using technology to monitor ethics, people used hope as a strategy,” he said.
Both Glint and Convercent offer your software as a service and charge companies recurring fees for using their products.
It is a business model and an opportunity that finds the consent of venture capital investors who have supported both start-ups.
Convercent received $10 million in February funding from companies like Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, raising the total capital to $47 million.
Glitter secured $10 million in November from Bessemer Venture Partners and brought all its funding to $60 million.
These investments are hardly surprising, given the interconnected nature of companies, culture and venture capital.
There is a growing set of research that shows that today's employees expect more from their jobs than they have done so far.
In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are only stakes.
The employees want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission.
“If people are happy to be in a company that owns their voices, and that the work you do is worth it, then they feel more committed to making this company successful,” said Nina McQueen, Vice President of Global Benefits and Employee Experience at LinkedIn, who is both Convercent and is also used by Glint.
Investors achieve returns when their portfolio companies run well. Businesses run well when employees are committed and engaged.
If third-party analytics tools promise to increase employee engagement and engagement, it's no wonder you'll find support.
The data on employee engagement according to the experts of the workplace culture is important.
But the data is useless if the managers of a company do not take action.
In fact, when a company asks employees for your feedback, it may have an expectation that change is on the way.
And if change doesn't come quickly enough, or not at all, it can grow disappointments and demotivate employees.
“If you're asking for 4,000 suggestions, you need to be ready to have 4,000 conversations,” said Russell Raath, President of Consulting at Kotter International Business Management Company, who saw companies that have relied too much on data collection.
“Because if you don't follow, employees will wonder, “Did you really hear me?
Are you taking care of this?
And who you don't care about, why would I? “”
Madison Reed, who is now conducting monthly employee surveys, was able to take action on the same day when a problem is reported about Glint, Errett said.
And after collecting feedback from frustrated employees, she was able to reorganize multiple teams within the company and add a communication training to address the issues through the speed of decision making and the quality of communication.
At Ruby Tuesday, the company is gaining new insights about employees, and it hopes that in the long run, this will lead to better retention of workers in an industry known for high revenue.
“If you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency, you will lose people,” Vitrano said.
“And if you lose people, you lose customers too.
And if you lose customers, you'll lose businesses.
The NCAA eliminates the two-day practices and makes a long day for the Bruins
It's at 11 pm when a lot of UCLA football players are talking on one side of the team's new practice fields on campus.
Some have undressed their jersey tops and show their backs full of sweat from the first day of the training camp.
For a good part of the team, these idle minutes are a lunch break.
Players enrolled in summer courses will return to their final exams after three hours of practice before returning to the Wasserman Football Center at 6:30 the next morning.
“This is a real pedal mill for the boys for the next three days,” said Bruins coach Jim Mora just before Monday became Tuesday.
The NCAA eliminates two-day exercises to ease the load of players, and it has actually extended its days - at least until the final on Friday.
Therefore, the first three UCLA trainings should start at 19:15 to meet the already packed schedule of players.
The compromise away from the two days is more than a day when the Bruins postponed the start of the camp almost a week after last season and did practical exercises during the summer school for the first time during Mora's six seasons in Westwood.
They are expected to perform 18 exercises during August. 20 before the formal game preparations for their kick-off against Texas A & M in September.
Mora said he would support the NCAA rule change, even if it added another point to the busy routes of the players.
“We put this enormous strain on them three or four days, and it's very challenging,” Mora said.
“And they just pushed it through, they keep poking, they're great people.
I think as soon as we get to Saturday and we have more time, it's gonna be really great.”
UCLA will end its practices once the camp is finished, which, given the clear lines of sight of its fields from an adjacent parking lot and the adjacent Luskin Center, an upscale hotel that has already been thrown with footballs that cleared a protective net behind a gate post, will not be an easy task.
Bruins players are supposed to occupy the hotel from this weekend, but Mora admitted that there might be a problem once these rooms are vacant during the season.
“We will use our security,” Mora said.
“This is a real problem, and it is not far fetched to think that people there rent a room and then there adjust to record an exercise.
If you have the videotape of an exercise, it's a pretty good deal.
But we have security forces there, and we have security forces in car park 8.
We'll do the best we can with what we have.
I'm not too worried about that.
We have a plan.”
Facebook wants to intensify factual review in the fight against fake news
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with false reports to third party fact reviewers and then display their results under the original post, said the world's largest online social network on Thursday. It is one of his efforts to fight so-called fake news.
The company stated in an opinion on its website that it will start using updated machine learning methods to detect possible false positives and send them to fact reviewers who may be displaying results of the fact check from the original article.
Facebook was criticised as one of the main distribution points for fake news, many of which believe that they also influenced the 2016 US presidential elections.
The problem has also become a major political issue in Europe, with the French voters flooded with false stories in the run-up to the presidential elections in May, and Germany supports a plan to punish social media networks if they fail to succeed in hateful postings such as before the elections there in September.
On Thursday Facebook said in a separate statement in German that a test of the new facts review will be launched in the USA, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
“In addition to understanding which stories are being challenged by third-party fact reviewers, people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share,” said Sara Su, product manager for Facebook messages on a blog.
She added that Facebook will continue to test its feature on the “related article” and work on other changes to its news feed to reduce false messages.
Creating a cartoon novel: A castle in the history of England
In his recent past, the little Scotney Castle was featured in a squeeze music video and was a loophole for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970s and 1980s.
But Scotney has witnessed 700 years of turbulent history from his cozy seat in the Bewl River Valley in Kent, and has now become the inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes, a mophaired Yorkshireman with a passion for historical documents.
“I think it's so nice to look at someone's handwriting who's been dead for 300 years,” he says wistfully.
“What a personal relationship to hold this letter in my hand.”
'A Castle in England' spans the ages from the Middle Ages to the ages of Edward and documents the families who lived in Scotney. Each story has been illustrated by another emerging British artist - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
It's not Rhodes's first book based on an archive: he wrote 2014 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories', a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project he unexpectedly found emotional.
“I reacted so only to the thumb print on the side of a letter written by a double agent in the 1700s who worked for the Jacobines,” he says.
“This is his thumb print!
And letters always smell of smoke, because then a fire was lit because of the light.
For someone who lives 300 years later, the smell has an effect, as if he were there himself.
Oh, I love archives!”
For someone so struck with old papers that he was supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived in a castle for almost four months (“To be honest, I overrated my welcome greeting a little”), all this seems too beautiful to be true.
Rhodes spent his days exploring the Victorian “new” castle, looking through the archives and studying the many treasures and curiosities of the castle, such as the mounted hyena heads on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the ditch.
He walked through the grounds and the ruins of the old castle and spoke to landscapes, gardeners, and sometimes the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book.
Then, at night, he drank “whiskey and started writing.”
The intimate history of Scotney is relatively unknown, as the National Trust was only given full access in 2006 when the last heiress, Elizabeth Hussey, died.
When Rhodes arrived a decade later, the employees just started to look after the archive he described as “hundreds of years when aristocrats said “Oh, throw it to the attic.”
Diaries, letters from the time of the English Empire, maps representing who had what: “One might think that country conflicts would be boring,” Rhodes says, “but there was a birch fighting for the two families.
Boys, let it all go!”
Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to immerse yourself in English history on a broader basis, including 'The Labourer', which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the 1381 peasant uprising.
“There is a record of a turmoil that occurred in the castle in 1380, in this book entitled 'Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex',” says Rhodes.
“The peasant uprising began in this area, and I thought an uprising was a good start.
Maybe they're connected?”
Other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - such as The Priest, which tells the story of the Jesuit patron, whom the Darrell family hid during the English Reformation for seven years.
Or 'The Smuggler', where smuggler Arthur Darrell from the 18th century. It was depicted in the 16th century, staging its own funeral by filling a coffin with stones (a discovery that was made only years later when its coffin was excavated).
The Darrells are Rhodes' favorite family of Scotney: “The gentlemen seemed to be quite crooks, repeatedly making debts and spending money on things they couldn't afford.
Other generations of Darrell men solved their debt crises by marrying rich old women - I imagine them a bunch of handsome boys, with a talent to recruit heirs.”
After the end of his engagement in the castle, Rhodes is looking for other unique writing experiences
He has spent a two-week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic book novel about Elämänmäki, the site of a sanatorium from the early 20th century. It was reclaimed by nature since then.
But Scotney has a special place for him.
“I was sad to leave,” he says.
It was like, “Oh, now I have to deal with the bloody life again.”
Campaign launched: over 300 years old Marienkapelle in Rhöndorf shrouded
With the casing of the 301-year-old Marienkapelle in Rhöndorf, the city of Bad Honnef started its campaign on Friday to launch a new umbrella brand (a roundabout of Thursday).
Until Thursday, Mayor Otto Neuhoff and his marketing team around Nelson Artz want to keep the logo and slogan secret.
At the end of August there will be a festival on the island of Grafenwerth as the highlight of the campaign.
“Too beautiful for us.
Right?” , the creators of the action have been asking since yesterday on the posters at the Rhöndorfer Chapel.
“We think that (of course!) ,” they write on their website unlocked yesterday.
“But we use this measure to attract your attention.
And to make it clear that some things are better than they seem.
Basically, we firmly believe that as Bad Honnefer, we citizens are well aware of the beauty and attractiveness of our city.”
The action is about more than just a logo and a slogan, it goes on.
“It is necessary to formulate a single promise, one that gives the city a distinctive unique selling point”.
After all, it is in competition with other municipalities.
The city of Bad Honnef can cost an average five-digit amount of its new umbrella brand and campaign.
Military reforms in Turkey - Erdogan's fear of the army
Every year at the beginning of August in Ankara, the Supreme Military Council (YAS) advises on retirement and promotion in the officer's corps.
So is this week.
At first glance, a normal operation.
But nothing is routine with the Turkish armed forces one year after the coup attempt.
The meeting was no longer held in the General Staff building, as was the case earlier, but in the Prime Minister's office.
Under the chairmanship of the Head of Government, the five Vice-Prime Ministers and the Ministers for Defence, Home Affairs, Justice and Foreign Affairs have also taken part in the discussions.
The civilians in the YAS were outnumbered.
The government is pulling the reins in the military.
Chief of Staff Hulusi Akar remains in office, but the commanders of the army, the air forces and the navy were discontinued.
Since the failed coup, head of state Erdogan has fired 169 of the 326 generals and admirals.
More than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of alleged ties to the movement of the exile sermon Fethullah Gülen, which Erdogan sees as the wielder of the coup attempt.
There have been negotiations in Ankara since this week against 486 people who have been directly involved in the coup attempt.
Even the day after the coup, Erdogan had called the attempt to overthrow a “gift of God” because he gave him the opportunity to “completely clean” the armed forces.
But is Erdogan really in control of the army?
At the end of February, the newspaper “Hürriyet” published an article titled “Discomfort in Military Headquarters”.
In the General Staff, there were concerns about an increasing “Islamization” of the army, which manifests itself, among other things, in the lifting of the headscarf ban for female soldiers, the newspaper wrote.
In any case, the large-scale cleansing of the army and the security forces continues.
In mid-July, Erdogan ordered another 7395 public servants to fire, including 2303 police officers and 546 soldiers.
It seemed like Erdogan tamed the military.
The generals were formerly considered to be the masters of the country.
Three times, they cited their role as guardians of the secular state order.
After his election victory in 2002, Erdogan pushed the power of the military back step by step, not least with reference to the European Union's reform requirements.
Former officers say Erdogan is deliberately driving forward the Islamization of the Armed Forces.
In the magazine “Vocal Europe”, an unnamed officer who sought asylum after the coup attempt for fear of persecution abroad warned that in a few years the Turkish army would be “full of extremists and salafists”.
If that is the case, such a development could not leave NATO cold.
In any case, after the cleanings, there are doubts about the readiness of the Turkish army to operate in the alliance.
Leadership structures and operational skills are “weakened,” NATO diplomats say.
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
There will be a new US immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card, President Donald Trump said, quoted by the media.
It provides for the reduction of legal immigrants to 50,000 per year, stricter rules for obtaining visas for temporary work permits and restrictions on family-oriented visas.
The new rules are proposed by the Republicans and supported by the President.
The draft law is to be discussed in the two chambers of the Congress.
“This law will reduce poverty, increase wages and save billions of dollars for taxpayers, and will do so by changing the way the US is spending green cards on citizens from other countries.”
The law will prevent chain migration and replace the current system.
This new application procedure will benefit candidates who speak English, who have the financial means to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy,” said Trump, quoted by the American media.
Ministry wants to rehabilitate route for racetrack shuttle
Over the past few months, the future of the racecourse shuttle has been disputed over and over again - now it is to be done very quickly.
Before the end of the year, it is planned to build on the marodic route on which the tourist train runs.
According to the Ministry of Transport, construction work on the track will begin this year in order to secure the future of the cramped shuttle in the long term.
“With the decision to continue ordering and rehabilitating the Ilmenau-Rennsteig route, the country is committed to this connection, which is particularly important for tourism,” explained transport state secretary Klaus Sühl on Friday in Erfurt.
The cost of the repair of the route was estimated at about 2.5 million euros.
Of this sum, the country assumed 75 percent.
The contract, on the basis of which the shuttle is to be ordered from the country in the future, is currently being finalised, Sühl said.
The Ministry and the Südthüringen Bahn as operators already agree on the technical details.
“This negotiates the roadmap, the vehicles used and the quality standards,” Sühl said.
The planned contract between the Ministry and the railway company will be concluded for a period of eleven years.
This means that the Rennsteig shuttle should be ordered regularly on December 2017.
The Rennsteig shuttle is a popular tourist rail service between Ilmenau and Rennsteig stations.
In the past few months, a pilot operation has tested whether the route is used by enough people to order it again in the future.
The route is also very fragmented in parts.
The rise of sex robots is real, and we should be worried
Just when you thought it couldn't get even crazier in 2017, a new report on the technological developments in the field of sex robots is coming up.
Yeah, actually.
Sex robots are a big deal right now.
Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years.
According to Noel Sharkey, Emeritus Professor of Robotics and Artificial Intelligence at Sheffield University and co-founder of the FRR, we need to start taking their rise seriously.
Customers can choose the eye color of the robot, its shape of the nipple and the type of fingernail.
“People are making fun of them, but companies are delivering a lot of them, and we will see them even more often,” Mr Sharkey said when he published his new report.
Modern sex dolls have evolved from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with consciously human reactions achieved by artificial intelligence.
The user can also “customize” his robot according to his beliefs, choosing everything from the eye color of the robot to the shape of the nipples to the type or color of his fingernails.
But it's getting even more worrying because many robots have the “personalities” that would make a Stepford woman look progressive.
Modern sex dolls have evolved into robots with a silicone skin.
The RealBotix robot, for example, allows its users to adapt their robots to the characteristics they find appealing, such as shyness.
And then there are the Roxxxy Gold sex robots developed by True Companion with pre-programmed personalities such as “Frigid Farrah”, which gives the impression of shyness and “Wild Wendy” with an “adventurous” personality.
“Roxxxy Gold has a personality that is as personalised as possible,” the True Companion website ravages.
So she likes what you like, and she does not like what you do not like, etc.
She also has her moods during the day - just like real people!
She can be tired, fixed to conversation, or she can be “in mood”!”
There are many worrying aspects of this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the submissive female characteristics, the allusions to rape, when you take a step towards Frigid (that is, reluctant) Farrah, worry you most.
On its website True Companion Roxxxy compared with a vibrator, but for men.
“If women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can't men have Roxxxy?” is stated on the website.
However, these sex robots are not just a fetish or just another sex toy.
Their emergence and increasing sophistication indicate something darker and deeper in our culture, a retreat from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with submission as an optional addition.
Most men, of course, will not hold sex robots, and while the FRR notes their increasing popularity, they remain on the verge of consumer culture for the time being.
But what leaked out of the peripheral zones can be very instructive in terms of the spirit of the time we live in.
And many people are not strange or offensive until the free market gives them permission to do so.
There is a certain overlap that these sophisticated sex robots appear at a time when women's rights are threatened worldwide, when there is a president in the White House who bragged about sexually attacking women.
The most dissuasive aspect of the television series 'The Handmaid's Valley' ('The Magds' report) is not the graphic images, the intertwined bodies and the pierced eyes, but how realistic this vision is.
The Republic of Gilead is a leap, but at the moment this does not feel like a big leap.
The goal behind these sex robots is to make a physical resemblance to actual women as realistic as technically possible (albeit with porn star proportions).
Their builders want them to feel human, to imitate the movement of a real body.
But, put to the point, when it comes to their “personalities”, the robots do not represent real women.
You can't break up with your companion or just leave.
You have no mediation or a background story, nothing that suggests independence or anything that could interfere with the imagination of total subjugation.
In other words, they are pleasing slaves.
Or to put it in the 2017 speeches: maid
Trump's big performance?
He makes Mitt Romney the epitome of common sense
It has become a triumph of the Trump era that the political divisions that polarized the US electorate have also divided small-scale families.
Around Christmas and Thanksgiving there were newspapers in the United States with advice on how to deal with the horror of Trump's choosing relatives.
We're all allegedly trying to pop our filter bubbles.
Less noticed is Trump's power to bring families together.
I mention this because my cousin, a left-wing poet who lives in Chicago and has been working with the Republicans in our family for a long time, visited me in New York this week.
She reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.
With Trump in the White House, everyone she knows, including the Republican kinship with which she had fought for decades because of politics, is suddenly on the same side and quite peculiar.
This is certainly a good thing about the dining table, but I notice in a further context that this also entails considerable risks.
The left was strengthened by Trump, but the disruptive effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right.
When we talk about “normalization” and Trump, we refer to the creepy possibility that one day his bibs will no longer repel us.
However, there is an even more frightening long-term scenario in which Trump “normalizes” Republicans of the right wing, which suddenly appear to be the epitome of rationality compared to its standards.
I find myself today affected by an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's hilarious version of the madman - the dog on the roof of the car, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew what his tax return looked like) - both of which are indeed a very mild offence compared to Trump.
When Trump leaves, the next Republican candidate only needs to be mentally healthy to qualify as an immeasurable improvement.
When my cousin was in town, we took our kids to the carousel at Central Park, the biggest carousel in the New York Park department, and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don't need caffeine.
The horses are huge, the fibreglass designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are growling and the animals twist to look with fear over their own shoulders - extremely dark and the climbing music mediates this in a strange way.
So many clichés of a city disappoint: the views of tall buildings get old, the skylines become too familiar to offer a lot of excitement, and the reality of the city does not meet the dream.
Thirty-five years later, and I'm still not quite over the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is indeed not a Swiss cottage - the theme pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage does not count - but a large roundabout in northern London.
However, the Central Park carousel is still a strange magical experience, as here two two-year-olds, an 11-year-old and two women in the 40's can go on and all have a great time.
If I could have rated the carousel, I would have given him the full score, but fortunately no one asked for it.
On the other hand, this week, I was forced to evaluate my “experience” with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could pull through my credit card.
In the coffee house on the corner of my street it's the same, plus the option to match the score with a 15% tip - this to buy something over the counter.
This not only slows down what should actually be a neutral exchange, but also exerts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where no one is required.
The poor woman in the department store was terribly grinning, while I was tired of the experience of giving her my five-star credit card.
Oscar Pistorius with chest pain transferred from prison to hospital
Pistorius left the prison for a hospital visit for the second time.
Last year, he was hospitalized for treating cuts on his wrists that he suffered from prison authorities after a case in his cell.
Pistorius was convicted of murder after an appeal by the prosecutors against a first murder sentence.
He killed Steenkamp in the early hours of Valentine's Day 2013 by shooting her several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his Pretoria house.
Pistorius claimed that he thought his girlfriend was a nightly intruder hiding in the cabin.
The prosecutors have announced their intention to appeal this time against Pistorius's six-year imprisonment, which they say is too lenient.
The National Law Enforcement Authority said that it would appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa and that the appeal could be heard this year.
Pistorius is in danger of increasing his sentence to 15 years if the prosecutors succeed.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
As a farmer Arnold finds a strange egg
As the last of the Blumberg schools, the fourth graders from Fützen and Epfenhofen were dismissed on holiday and in the secondary schools.
Three of the dismissal students will go to secondary school, four to secondary school.
On Tuesday evening, head of the school Angelika Sitte welcomed the parents and representatives of the public at the Bürgerhaus Biesental in Epfenhofen.
The 29 pupils of the four classes, led by Sophia Schumacher and Regine Meder, chose a young eagle to be raised in the chicken yard, but then released to freedom.
To this end, the cheerful crowd performed a musical entitled “The Eagle in the Chicken Court”.
Farmer Arnold found a strange egg, and let it breed from his chickens.
Instead of a chicken chick, a little eagle came out.
But the hope of making him a chicken fell apart, the eagle spread out his wings on a high mountain and escaped.
After that, classes three and four showed a chicken dance in Yvonne Frank's rehearsal.
The hens danced with the young gockles, the cylinders wore to the bet.
The eagle stands for integration, said head of school Angelika Sitte.
Although the young animal is different from the other young animals (chicks), it is one of them.
He'll never be like a chicken.
His destiny is to be free.
She wished every fourth grader to feel accepted in his new school.
It was followed by a word of thanks to the colleagues, the former head of the school Michael Müller, who repeatedly intervenes in school bottlenecks, and the parents.
The caring season is now over, explained class teacher Sophia Schumacher.
She reluctfully dismiss her students after two years of teaching, because it was a really great time.
Finally, she could rely on the fourth graders.
At the end, all students sounded a song of daylight saving time and holiday season.
In doing so, the children had great joy.
Eight first graders have already been registered for the new school year.
Two Bulgarians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
Two Bulgarians were imprisoned for illegal campings in Greece, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, quoted by television, informed.
In the morning of the 1st On August 8, a group of illegal tented people, including the two Bulgarians, was arrested by the police in Sithonia.
On the same day, they were released while an investigation is currently underway.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported to bTV that the Bulgarians were released later.
The Greek authorities have tightened control of free camping and are imposing significant fines on anyone who is found to stay in a place that is not intended for this purpose.
The checks shall continue throughout the season.
The Ministry said that the court can impose a fine.
Software Update for Diesel Vehicles: What People Need to Know Now
How exactly does the software update take place?
Do diesel drivers have to participate in the campaign?
The most important questions and answers at a glance.
At the Diesel Summit, BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW Group offered software updates for a total of around 5.3 million cars.
They are intended to improve the emission behaviour of cars of Euro 5 and partly Euro 6 emission classes.
Euro 4 diesel or worse are excluded.
Anja Smetanin of the ACE Auto Club Europa gives estimates:
Is the new action mandatory?
No, the negotiated software updates are voluntary.
“The mandatory updates previously apply only to the vehicles that have cheating software,” says Anja Smetanin.
The Federal Motor Transport Office (KBA) ordered their retrofitting.
How and when will customers be notified of updates?
Manufacturers have announced a rapid implementation in the coming months, but have not yet specified a precise date.
Daimler has informed us that he or she should write to each person concerned.
If an inspection is due anyway, it will be done within their framework.
How long should the overall changeovers last?
“Hard to say,” says Smetanin.
This depends on the commitment of the manufacturers and on political pressure.
“Because we have seen that car manufacturers have not acted voluntarily on the subject of the environment so far.”
How long should the update take?
The conversion itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop.
It could be more time consuming to get an appointment.
What do drivers who do not drive a car from BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW Group do?
The ACE advises to wait.
It is believed that foreign producers would follow, says Smetanin.
Is there a threat of a massive fall in the price of Euro 4 cars?
The ACE fears that.
But precisely in the regions where driving bans are threatened.
In rural areas, there has been no loss of value for older diesel engines.
The ACE advises to wait for a sale.
LL Cool J receives Kennedy Center Award
The Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most glamorous events in Washington.
The first award ceremony under President Trump promises to become political.
One of the winners does not want to come - out of protest.
LL Cool J (49) is the first rapper to receive one of the coveted awards from the renowned Kennedy Center.
As the cultural institution announced on Thursday, singer Gloria Estefan (59), Lionel Richie (68) and choreographer Carmen de Lavallade (86) and TV producer Norman Lear (95) are among the honoured.
The awards will be presented at the beginning of December.
Traditionally, US President Donald Trump will host a reception and participate in the ceremony together with his wife Melania.
The winner Lear, who became known with progressive TV series, has already announced that he would not attend the gala.
He said to the New York Times: “This presidency has decided to completely neglect the arts and human rights - even to deprive them of the means - and that is burdening me”.
59-year-old Estefan stressed that she would use the conversation with Trump to clarify her point of view.
According to the former President John F. Kennedy named Kennedy Center is the largest cultural institution in the US capital.
Previous winners include Meryl Streep, Aretha Franklin, Robert De Niro, George Lucas, Tom Hanks and Sting.
We make the city worth living
Roland Wacker, Haslach's city builder, will retire next year.
The position has already been advertised, but suitable candidates are rare.
Wacker has been a city builder for 31 years.
And he's still enjoying the work, as he communicates in the press talk.
He reports on varied, but also demanding tasks awaiting his successor.
At the same time, he is surprised that no application yet meets the requirements profile.
The city is looking for an architect or civil engineer at the earliest opportunity.
In this way - while respecting the regular notice periods - there is still enough time for a start-up.
As Haslach acts as the Lower Building Law Authority for the Administrative Community, the applicant must have appropriate degrees.
Because this function definitely wants to keep the city.
If they could no longer fill it out, citizens would have to go to Offenburg for consultation.
But being close to the city and to the city itself is important, says Wacker, who reports on a good working climate and a good mood between the authorities and citizens.
In more than 30 years in office, some significant projects have accumulated, which Wacker is proud to look back on.
“We make the city worth living,” he is sure about the construction office and its employees.
In the future, however, varied projects will continue to be on the agenda: the redesign of the former Hukla area and the Niederhofenparkplatz, for example, has been initiated.
The Kinzigbrücke bridge between Bollenbach and Steinach is being renewed, and the stadium renovation is still a topic.
The latter alone will be worth around EUR 1.5 million, “if we do it right,” Wacker estimates.
“All in all, great tasks await my successor.
The work here is fun.”
In terms of design, there is a lot of room for manoeuvre for a city builder.
With Haslach's own construction yard and gardening shop, many things can be reacted quite flexibly.
“There is a lot to be done,” Wacker said, and the design of the green spaces is often praised by citizens and visitors.
Since the old town is listed as an ensemble, it is important to “have an eye for what fits in” when new buildings are approved, the outgoing city builder emphasizes.
In any case, the city builder bears high responsibility.
He's a builder, “in the end, everything's going over my table.”
He can count on many years of employees in support and coordination: Markus Neumaier (building construction) has been with us for ten years, Manfred Schöner (civil engineering) for 15 years.
Wacker also wants his successor to stay for a long time: “We are looking for someone who really wants to identify and stay with the job”.
Continuity is important not only for a good working climate, but also for the further design of the city.
Anyone who wishes to inherit Roland Wacker should have completed his studies as a diploma engineer or a bachelor's degree in architecture, according to the City of Haslach, and have good expertise in the fields of construction planning and planning law.
The City Building Office is responsible for civil engineering, building management, land purchase, urban property management, urban farm with building yard and town gardening, and the Lower Building Law Authority, including monument protection.
Bicycle thrown on lines: southern railway line blocked
According to the police, the hitherto unknown perpetrators had thrown the blue bike from the railway crossing in the area of Leobener Straße (B116) on the lines.
These were so severely damaged that the approaching freight train had to be stopped.
Investigators are assuming two male perpetrators and have been looking for them since night hours.
A pink scooter and a bicycle driver had been observed by witnesses near the scene.
“This goes far beyond a Lausbubenstreich,” ÖBB spokesman Christoph Posch said to the APA.
The perpetrator or perpetrators would have put themselves at great risk and also put train traffic at risk.
In addition to damage to the locomotive and the plant, as well as the minutes of delay and the cost of rail substitute transport, penals from rail customers could also be sent to the perpetrators.
Overall, the spokesman said, it was assumed that there was a 'significant' sum.
The damage was repaired on Friday afternoon and rail traffic on the southern railway line could be carried out without any disabilities.
Almost ten passenger trains had failed on Friday morning, two of which concerned long-distance transport.
Freight trains did not fail, but they were delayed.
According to ÖBB spokesman Christoph Posch, about 200 meters of overhead cables had to be replaced.
Isolators and masts have also been damaged.
Red meat, dairy products and chocolate could help alleviate IBD (inflammatory bowel disease)
Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.
But a new study claims exactly the opposite: a diet rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products could alleviate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel disease.
The incurable state, which affects around 1.3 million in the US and 300,000 in the UK, causes stomach cramps and flatulence, recurrent or bloody diarrhea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
While those affected are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products in order to alleviate their symptoms, researchers at Washington University found that the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins contributes to developing immune cells that promote a tolerant intestine.
The senior researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells patrol the intestine to ensure that harmful microbes hiding in food do not penetrate the body.
Cells capable of causing inflammation are compensated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues.
If the balance tends too far towards inflammation, it can result in inflammatory bowel disease.
Experiments found that a type of tolerance-promoting immune cell occurs in mice carrying a particular bacterium in their intestine.
And the bacterium needs tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells.
Professor Colonna said: “We have established a connection between a bacterial species - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the intestinal microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.
The more tryptophan the mice had in their food, the more they had of these immune cells”.
He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and a diet rich in tryptophan promotes more tolerant, less inflammatory intestinal milieus, if the same system also works in humans.
The postdoctoral student Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan investigated some kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when she found that a group of study mice had such cells, but another group of the same tribe, which was housed separately, did not.
She suspected that the difference had to do with the intestinal microbiomes of the mice - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi that usually live in the gastrointestinal tract.
The intestines of the mice were sequenced to DNA and six bacterial species were found, which were present in the mice with the immune cells, but without them missing from the mice.
Mice were raised in a sterile environment, so they lacked an intestinal microbiome and they did not develop this type of immune cells, and they received the L. reuteri and the immune cells.
To understand how the bacteria affected the immune system, researchers L. reuteri grew in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of fluid - without the bacteria - to immature immune cells isolated from the mice.
The immune cells developed into the tolerant cells.
When the active component was purified from the liquid, it proved to be a by-product of tryptophan metabolism known as indol 3 lactic acid.
When researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the feed of the mice, the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent, but if the tryptophan values were halved, the number of cells decreased by half.
Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that people have the same tolerant cells as mice, and that most of us protect L. reuteri in our gastrointestinal tract.
It is not known whether tryptophan by-products from L. reuteri develop the cells in humans as in mice, but defects in genes related to tryptophan were found in people with inflammatory bowel disease.
She said, “The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote, since these cells control inflammation on the internal surface of the intestine.
Potentially, high tryptophan values in the presence of L. reuteri can lead to an extension of this population.”
Jose Mourinho believes Manchester United has committed a “genius” with Nemanja Matic
At Manchester United signed a “genius” with Nemanja Matic, Jose Mourinho believes after the midfielder made his debut against Sampdoria on Wednesday evening.
Chelsea's 40 million pounds signature began with a 2:1 win in Dublin, the last pre-season game before the UEFA Super Cup against Real Madrid starts on Tuesday, and impressed in the keeper role when people like Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira marched at will.
Matic, however, had been excluded from the preparation Asian tour of the Blues and only managed 45 minutes, which Mourinho admitted that he had to improve before the start of the Premier League season.
“He needs time, but his experience, intelligence, a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football,” Mourinho said.
“We'll help him get ready sooner than later.”
In addition to Matic, Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku started at Aviva Stadium when Mourinho formed his start XI for the beginning of the season.
The Independent unveiled this week that Mourinho wanted three more new commitments, but he insisted that the club had already done a “fantastic job” to fulfill three of its four priority new commitments.
“To get three out of four, I thank the club for that,” he added.
“I'll be happier if they get for me four out of four, but they've made a lot of effort.”
Boeing “paints” Dreamliner in the sky
The US aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the silhouette of a Dreamliner into the sky.
The pilots flew from Seattle in the US state of Washington, but the drawing began in Marquette in the US state of Michigan and moved across the US in the form of a Dreamliner, which is several thousand kilometers.
The action lasted 18 hours and a minute.
On the radar screens was the form of a Dreamliner.
The whole thing was an endurance test for new engines.
Boeing had previously made such advertising.
The number “787” and the Boeing logo were painted in the sky.
New low for Martin Schulz - Hanover, we have a problem
As the wind turns, when Sigmar Gabriel was still head of the SPD, Social Democratic Prime Ministers always looked to Berlin with some concern before the elections.
Just no disturbance from the party centre, just no headwind from the covenant - that was the most important wish of the electoral fighters.
Since Martin Schulz led the party, this has changed fundamentally.
Since then, employees from the Willy-Brandt-Haus have been watching the events in the SPD-ruled state capitals with growing horror.
What Schulz has received from there since the beginning of the year would not even be described in terms of headwinds.
It was deep.
One at a time.
After the surprising end of the red-green majority in Lower Saxony, the Federal CDU sees a general signal against coalitions of SPD and Greens.
“This shows once again: Red-green simply cannot rule reliably,” CDU Secretary General Peter Tauber said to the editorial network Germany (RND).
The surprising political leave of a Green Member plunged the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) into a serious crisis.
Five months before the country's election, his red-green coalition thus lost its one-vote majority to the opposition from CDU and FDP.
Green Federal Executive Michael Kellner has asked the renegade Lower Saxon Green Member Elke Twesten to return her mandate.
The transition to the CDU means a clear distortion of the voter's will.
Elke Twesten must immediately return her mandate,” said the Federal Executive and Election Campaign Manager of the Greens to the editorial network Germany (RND).
“All this must not be true,” a SPD electoral champion sighs when the new Hiobsbotschaft reaches the party centre on Friday morning.
Stephan Weil, SPD Prime Minister of Lower Saxony, is there without a government majority after the Green MEP Elke Twesten transitions to the CDU.
It is the preliminary culmination of a whole series of large and small crises in SPD national associations.
And no one knows what's next.
The misery began with the unexpectedly significant defeat at the Saarland election in March.
A blue eye, no more, the comrades calmed down at the time.
After the regional elections in Schleswig-Holstein and North Rhine-Westphalia, everything will be different.
That became the same - and it all became much worse.
The defeat in Kiel brought the SPD to deceive, the Düsseldorf bankruptment killed the party smoothly.
The comrades struggled again in the weeks after that.
Then, when they had just taken up new courage, the G-20 summit came from Hamburg.
And with him came the next blow.
Mayor Olaf Scholz, the last strong SPD leader, lost his nimbus that weekend because he was sitting in the Elbphilharmonie while his town was burning.
And because in crisis communication afterwards, he did pretty much everything wrong that you can do wrong.
Since then, Scholz has been fighting for his political survival.
Now Stephan Weil, too.
Because of the VW flue gas affair and its role in the Supervisory Board, the Prime Minister of Lower Saxony has been criticised for a long time.
Bad survey values were added.
Nevertheless, or perhaps precisely because of this, Weil has been increasingly trying to set accents in the covenant over the past few weeks.
The efforts of the former mayor of Hanover to expand his power in Berlin were not hidden, even comrades around Martin Schulz.
They had him granted because they promised that Weil would stabilise the party.
Now the exact opposite could happen.
In doing so, because the Lower Saxon Greens are basically not to blame for the party-internal constraint.
And Schulz certainly doesn't.
For some time, the comrades try to keep their own rows closed.
Their anger is directed at the Greens, and above all at the renegade MEP Twesten.
“It is intolerable and damaging to democracy, as Mrs Twesten puts her own career interests above the interests of everyone else,” says Matthias Miersch, head of the party links in the SPD Bundestag Group, the editorial network Germany (RND).
Mrs Twesten was elected to Parliament not because of her person as a direct candidate, but through the list of the Lower Saxon Greens, according to the Lower Saxon Member.
The logical consequence is that she returns her mandate.
Thomas Oppermann, head of the SPD Bundestag Group, complains of an “undemocratic maneuver”.
“The voter's will four years ago was clear: the people made Stephan Weil the prime minister,” Oppermann, who leads the Lower Saxon SPD as the top candidate in the Bundestag election, says the RND.
“Now the personal career thinking of a future CDU MEP distorts the election result,” Oppermann continued.
He called for the background to be clarified.
I want to know whether there has been more or if there have been further commitments from the CDU Lower Saxony.
Grants for the centre III
Anyone who wants to rehabilitate their house that has come into the years can soon get support from the country.
Mayor Albert Schindler and three representatives STEG City Development informed about this on Wednesday in Empfingen.
At the beginning of the information event, Schindler gave another look back at what has happened so far.
Since 1991, there have been rehabilitation areas in Empfingen.
At that time, in the rehabilitation area I from 1991 to 2004, the Land of Baden-Württemberg took over two thirds of the subsidy amount.
In the refurbishment area II from 2005 to 2016, the subsidy still stood at 60 percent.
For Schindler, the refurbishments so far are a “success project” - it is important to promote interior development as well, and not only to open up new construction areas.
On 4. On 1 April, the Karlsruhe government presidency informed that there will be a rehabilitation area III.
The amount of funding is 833 333 euros, of which 500 000 euros would come from the country, the rest from the municipality of Empfingen.
How does a rehabilitation area develop?
According to Schindler, one will investigate where the “really old” houses are.
However, it also plays a role in whether there is any interest in rehabilitating the planned area.
If necessary, the territorial boundaries could then be shifted again.
The STEG met Martin Keller, Gaby Pietzschmann and Sarah Gotzel on Wednesday evening.
Keller presented the contents of the federal-state program “Social City”, in which the rehabilitation would be carried out.
At the heart of the programme are the revitalisation of inner cities, the improvement of living and working conditions and the maintenance and development of infrastructure.
The measures would be carried out on an object-by-object basis, i.e. per property.
The rehabilitation area would then eventually be defined as a statute.
The grant period has been running since 1 January 2007. January 2017 to 30. April 2026.
However, until September of this year, the inventory would first be carried out, in which the parties involved in the rehabilitation area would receive a questionnaire to fill out.
In November or December, the Statute Decision is to be taken as far as possible so that the reorganisation can begin next year.
Pietzschmann then explained that each municipality had to carry out the aforemenent preliminary investigations.
It is a question of assessing the urban maladministration and deciding when to rehabilitate and to what extent.
A rehabilitation note will then be entered in the land register for the respective property.
Pietzschmann himself will return to Empfingen and get a picture of the situation, she promised.
Gotzel stressed that a key success factor for the project was the participation of the stakeholders.
That is why there will be questionnaires which will be sent to the citizens in the coming weeks and which can be completed by the end of the summer holidays.
The yellow questionnaire is the “building and land sheet”, which deals, among other things, with the construction condition and the rehabilitation intentions.
The grey questionnaire, the 'Household and housing sheet', provides information on the size, distribution and inhabitants of a residential area.
The blue “farm return” shall only be completed if business premises are operated in the building.
However, it should be noted that Gotzel pointed out that a completed questionnaire is not a request for funding at the same time.
Moreover, new construction measures were not eligible.
Schindler also stressed that the distribution of subsidies works according to the “greyhound principle” - who comes first, grinds first.
You cannot “reserve” funding for later.
Finally, photos of the project “City Centre II” were shown to make the present a rehabilitation “tasty”.
British inventor puts himself a microchip to get into the house and car with one hand movement
A British inventor is the first in the country to be equipped with a microchip so that he can open his front door, enter his office and even start his car with one hand movement.
Steven Northam, 33, had implanted the tiny chip between thumb and forefinger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology through his company BioTeq.
He's been with Dr. Geoff Watson, an advisory anaesthesiologist at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester, Hants, has joined forces to ensure that the implant process is conducted according to medical standards.
The technology resembles a cat and dog implanted microchip and lasts only 30 seconds.
Mr. Northam's company also wants to change the locks on houses and cars so that they are compatible with the chip, all for a surcharge of £300 per lock.
The married father of one has now installed both at home and in his BMW Z4 technology, which starts when his hand is at the wheel.
The advertising costs of the White House cost the taxpayer thousands
The White House's decision to fly a naval helicopter to the South Lawn for an event that highlights American manufacturing last month costs taxpayers up to $24,000, according to the military information given to TIME Magazine.
The green and white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One, when the President is on board, was the heart of the event on 17. July in the White House with American construction programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and senior White House officials took a tour of products from all 50 countries.
The Connecticut helicopter was exhibited alongside a Maine yacht, a Wisconsin fire truck and a Mississippi forklift.
The White House military office demanded the presence of the helicopter in a fragmentary order or FRAGO, barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn, according to the records of the Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter.
“I just wanted you to be aware of this because it is such an unusual event with high visibility,” the commander of the HMX-1 wrote to his superior, the deputy naval commander for aviation, on the eve of the event.
The message indicated that the helicopter was on 17. The event arrived at the South Lawn on July 1, around 7 in the morning, at 3 pm, and remained until the lawn was cleared between 6 pm and 9 pm that evening.
The note adds that if the departure from the White House was delayed, a second crew would be required for the return flight due to the limited hours of service.
The original flight crew was at the helicopter during the event, while the unit's security personnel remained on the ground with the aircraft during the time.
It was not clear from the records made available to TIME whether a second flight crew was ultimately required.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using state property for political purposes.
Records indicate that HMX-1 has asked if the event could violate the determination.
“One question we asked was whether it was a violation of the Hatch Act and we were informed that this was not the case,” the commander wrote.
“Sounds like you're locked,” the deputy commander replied.
The Made in America event was designated by the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act.
But official events also have political overtones.
At the event, the President gave impetus to the reform of the health reform that was underway in the Senate, and he propagated efforts to curb government regulations.
The use of the aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One for politically advantageous purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.
Presidents are obliged to use them for the trip.
But requesting their use only for a photo surgery is unusual.
Trump conducted an investigation in February, when the presidential aircraft operated taxi services against the backdrop of its first campaign rally in Melbourne, Florida, and his Twitter account is full of reports complaining about the use of the presidential aircraft by its predecessor.
“The White House is thrilled with the show “Made In America” - showing products from all 50 countries manufactured by American workers using American materials,” said White House Deputy Press Secretary, Lindsay Walters.
HMX-1 crews often perform training flights around Washington and South Lawn to set the US president at the White House with precise centimeters.
When Trump was at the G20 summit in Germany in early July, HMX-1 conducted 58 practice landings in the White House.
The flight for the “Made in America” event counted in the training needs of the flight crew for the month, said an official.
Helicopter units flew an additional 11 hours that day for “non-presidential support missions”.
The White House said that taxpayers did not take over the burden for any of the other props presented at the event.
A spokesman from Sikorsky said that the company was not involved in issuing the helicopter on the South Lawn.
HMX-1 does not maintain budget records for presidential flights and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event.
However, according to the US Department of Defense hourly rates for the financial year 2017, the DoD refund rate for the VH-3D is $24,380 per hour of flight.
Unit records record the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the Marine Corps Air Facility's home base in Quantico, Virginia.
The White House argues that the actual cost of operating the helicopter is far below this rate.
“The cost of setting taxpayers on the basis of the estimates for refund rates is highly misleading,” Walters said.
“These estimates include personnel, maintenance and many other hidden costs included in the annual appropriations.”
According to a 2015 RAND study, DoD reimbursement rates do not include personnel costs, but take into account fuel, maintenance and contract costs.
At that time, the former White House press secretary, Sean Spicer, defended the use of the helicopter for the event.
“The idea is to present things that are made in America this week,” Spicer said.
“And I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud that they contribute to our national security, and I assume that hundreds, if not thousands, of people depend on it.
And I think, like most Americans, we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked tirelessly.
It is, of course, appropriate to emphasise this.”
It was not clear whether Trump interacted with the helicopter when he entered his tour of the South Lawn for the event, but he sat down in the driver's seat of a fire truck.
In the White House, Trump spoke to representatives of Sikorsky and joked with the media about his own fleet of company products.
“I know Sikorsky very well,” the President said, “I have three of them.”
TC BW Neuss before tricky task
Top runner of the Second Tennis Bundesliga takes part in the third table of the Sechsdorfer SV.
The TC Blau-Weiss Neuss will take place tomorrow at 11 am in Kiel at the third table of the Sechsdorfer SV.
Despite the five matches still flawless, the top runner of the Second Tennis Bundesliga has maintained its sense of reality.
Team leader Marius Zay has respect for the opponent.
“This is a compact team that always plays in a very similar formation.
Especially on the back positions I find the team very good.”
Imports from the high north are especially important for class and stability at the Suchsdorfer SV.
“Their Danes and Finns can even point to bets in the Davis Cup.
And they are also strong in the double,” says Zay with views of Harri Heliovaara (Finland), Andre Göransson (Sweden), Sören and Esben Olesen, Martin Pedersen and Andreas Bjerrehus (all Denmark).
“It's gonna be hard for us, as always.
You need a good portion of luck.”
The Neusser team for the trip to the far north stands practically.
His debut for blue and white could be Maxime Janvier.
If the French currently active in the Challenger Tournament in Italian Biella does not make it to the Bundesliga match, Zdenek Kolar (Czech Republic), playing at the tournament in Czech Liberec, will make his first bet this season.
The undefeated Chilean Hans Podlipnik-Castillo was on the ball yesterday with the Belarusian Andrei Vasilevski at the ATP tournament in Kitzbühel.
He should be in Kiel as well as Botic Van de Zandschulp, Niels Lootsma (both Netherlands) and Belgian Julien Cagnina.
After his two victories last Sunday against the Club an der Alster, Máté Valkusz could join the team again.
If it is not enough for the 18-year-old Hungary, who was still the number one junior world ranking in January 2016, someone from the coaching staff around Marius Zay is filling up the squad.
How America can harm OMV
Donald Trump did not seem really happy when he put his signature under the law on tightening sanctions against Russia on Wednesday evening.
“In his haste of enacting the law,” the Congress packed in a few “unconstitutional regulations,” he corroded.
The reaction from Moscow was as sharp as expected, and even Brussels foamed against the US advance.
After all, the draft provides for the punishment of European companies that help the Russians to build gas pipelines into the EU.
Since then, investors of the domestic OMV, which together with other European companies co-financed the construction of the Russian Baltic Sea pipeline Nord Stream 2, have been concerned.
The threat scene is huge.
Nevertheless, it is too early for an assessment of the consequences, according to the official statement of the oil group.
In fact, Donald Trump himself would have to bring the sanctions to life by executive order.
Twelve weapons to choose from.
“The press” has looked at which of the Group could fend off and which could really hurt him.
Narco's Season 3 Trailer: Without Pablo Escobar, the Cali Cartel is put into focus in the Netflix hit series
Despite the second season of Narcos, which Pablo Escobar's killer unveils, Netflix's series is not over yet.
The seasons three and four were already confirmed by the streaming service, the first received their first trailer and showed the latest villains of the show.
With season three, the DEA has focused its attention on the richest organization of drug trafficking in the world: the Cali cartel.
Led by four powerful godparents, they operate “like a Fortune 500 company” only with more state bribes and violent actions.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) is the leader of the cartel, Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) is her head, Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) commands the Mexican compound, and Chepe Santacruz Londono (Pepe Rapazote) is located in New York.
In the newly released trailer, Pedro Pascal returns as Javier Peña, the guy who invites American and Colombian law enforcement agencies to support the war on drugs.
Other new actors are Matias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishe and Arturo Castro.
The third season of Narcos will take place on 1 January. Begin September.
Roll backwards: the city hits 46 kitchen aids
The city organizes the Kita lunch again itself.
With fixed contacts for the children and an assignment to the team.
The clock is turned back in the municipal day care centres.
For the first time. On September 9, the city of Krefeld takes over the food supply in the municipal daycare facilities (Kitas) again in its own direction.
For Sonja Pommeranz, Deputy Head of Youth Aid, this is good news: “We were all very pleased”.
Cooked is still out of the house: a caterer takes over this task and delivers freshly cooked chilled.
The city operates 46 day care centres in the Krefeld region, and in 44 children get a warm meal at lunch time.
During the last kite year, 2800 children sat at the tables, and the demand is growing steadily.
“Meanwhile, not only children who are cared for 45 hours a week eat lunch at the kita,” explains Pommeranz.
“The offer is also valid in 35-hour care if children stay until 2 pm.”
46 Part-time workers have been recruit from 1 January. September kitchen service: you heat the delivered dishes, add salad, raw food and fruit, portray the meal individually, give out the food, clear, rinse and clean the kitchen.
“The employees are permanently assigned to a kita,” says Pommeranz.
The size - there are two-group facilities as well as seven-group facilities - determines the length of the hour.
“The kitchen helpers are now firmly part of the Kita team,” says Pommeranz satisfied.
“So they are much more involved and it is easier for the kital management to implement pedagogical concepts”.
It is also about healthy food and cooking lessons.
“Let the children help to prepare the food”.
The direct connection of the kitchen power to the team makes sense.
Also for the children.
“They have a known force in the kita, a person familiar to them, and not constantly changing people”.
This continuity is important for children.
The cleaning of the kita rooms - previously also the task of the kitchen staff - will be carried out by special cleaning personnel in the future.
This variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - has, in addition to improving the quality of the kitchen performance, the charm that it has proved to be the most economical for the city in comparison with the cost of self-administration and external procurement, according to the press office.
And that, though 46 part-time workers are being rehired.
“But these hours are not so much of a weight for about 750 people in the education area,” says Sonja Pommeranz.
Afghan democracy depends on the political role of women, says UN
Elections can only be representative if all members of society, including women, play a role, said the head of the UN mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday.
Nicholas Haysom, acting head of the United Nations Mission, said that hundreds of women will run the council elections in the provinces. Three women are running for the role of Vice-President and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women.
“The role of women cannot be overestimated,” he said on Wednesday in a statement.
Elections can only be truly representative and credible if women participate fully and are involved in all parts of the electoral process.
Afghan elections for the provincial council and the presidential elections will take place on 5 May. April.
The Taliban have published threats against an election process coinciding with the transition from international fighting to an advisory role.
This year, for the first time, the elections will be handed over the power peacefully from one democratically elected government to the next.
Haysom said a strong role for women will further strengthen Afghanistan's democratic success.
The Afghan independent electoral commission reports that 1.2 million women are registered by 3.6 million voters in total.

Men try to rob 13-year-old girl
Two young men aged 19 and 23 are said to have tried to rob a 13-year-old girl on Thursday.
According to the police, the men addressed the 13-year-old, who was on Kolping Street with friends, about 2.55 p.m. because they wanted to make a phone call with the girl's cell phone.
The 13-year-old, however, rejected the request and continued with her friends.
Then one of the perpetrators tried to grab the girl's cell phone and necklace, which, however, failed.
Without prey, the duo escaped.
The two young men were later arrested by the police.
The investigation is underway.
GMB concern about investment in McVitie factory in Glasgow
A trade union wants to verify the long-term commitment to production at its Glasgow plant with managers of biscuit producer McVitie.
GMB Scotland said the company was silent about the future of investments at the Tollcross site.
More than 500 employees work in the factory, which produces Hobnobs and Rich Tea biscuits, among other products.
McVitie's owner Pladis said he has invested more than £5 million in recent years.
He added that employees and trade union representatives would be “experienced first” if their activities changed.
In a letter to the company's branch manager, GMB asked Scotland McVitie's “to express concerns that funding for the modernisation of production lines is not being driven forward”.
GMB senior organizer Drew Duffy said, “The fact that we can't gain clarity from the general site manager about Tollcross's business needs and investment plans for the future is deeply affecting our members.
Generations of families have worked here, and workers are heavily concentrated on the local community and the Greater Glasgow region, an important pillar of decent employment in an area of high unemployment and social disadvantage.
Therefore, under the perspective of jobs, wages and prosperity, and against the background of Brexit, the rising cost of living and the chronic decline in production, the eastern end of Glasgow urgently needs a flourishing production presence at McVitie”.
A spokeswoman at Pladis said: “The branch manager at Tollcross just received a letter from GMB Scotland yesterday, and the company will respond directly to it, because we value the ongoing commitment of employees and trade union representatives.
Two months ago, we had a regular meeting with employees and GMB representatives at Tollcross, where some questions were discussed openly.
We discussed with our employees that, like all companies operating in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate, we are constantly reviewing our business - and this applies to all our business areas and locations - to remain competitive.
She added: “In recent years, we have invested more than £5 million in our Tollcross site, especially in production lines and operational improvements.
We fully recognise the heritage of Tollcross as a production site. If our operations at the site change, the employees and their union representatives will be the first to know.”
Did the PSG Barcelona warn against Neymar three years ago?
The site of La Liga may regret their interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain will not let down in her pursuit of Neymar after making an offer of £189 million to trigger his release clause, but did they warn Barcelona three years ago about the world record robbery?
The sensational approach has heated up the transfer window in the summer, because the Ligue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than twice the previous brand, with Paul Pogba returning to Manchester United last season for 89 million pounds.
After completion, Neymar becomes the most expensive player in the world and the most paid professional athlete in the world. PSG offers wages of more than £500,000 per week.
Barcelona is angry at the way Neymar forced his way out, although a source near the Catalan board insists that the club has always done its best to take care of him since he arrived from Santos in 2013.
But was the football world warned three years ago by the PSG president of this prospect?
When Manchester City expressed interest in signing Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi had a strict warning for any club that wanted to sign one of PSG's best players.
“I'm not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players, then we will stand in opposition to them, we will contact their players,” Al-Khelaifi said.
“We respect all clubs.
But if they try to have one of our players signed with them, this will have consequences.”
Barcelona seems to have crossed this line, with the Spanish association expressing interest in the PSG midfielder Marco Verratti at the beginning of this summer.
PSG made it clear that they would not allow the International to leave Italy under any circumstances, and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of its price offers for Neymar.
Roller Reversed and Damaged
On the night of Friday to Saturday, an unknown perpetrator deliberately knocked over a scooter parked in Königsfelder Straße in front of the property number 30 and thus caused material damage of more than 200 euros to the disguise of the vehicle.
The police Schramberg, phone 07422/27 01-0, asks for clues.
The police are looking for witnesses to an accident on the B 215 between Stolzenau and Leese.
Because a car came to him in his lane, the driver of a VW Touran had to dodge and touched the guardrail.
On Thursday evening, the 34-year-old from Rehburg-Loccum and his VW travelled towards Leese on the B 215 from Stolzenau at around 19.55.
In the area around Stolzenau, a passenger car came to meet him on his lane, so he had to dodge to the right.
The Touran rider touched the guardrail.
Damage to property was caused by the car.
The driver of the oncoming car, a Mercedes Benz, had overtaken a truck and continued his journey without caring about the road accident.
According to the accident victim, it may be good that the Mercedes driver had not even noticed the accident.
The police are now asking witnesses of the incident and the driver of the polluter vehicle to contact the Commissioner in Stolzenau at 05761/92060.
Interview: “Domspatzen report relieves Pope brother Georg Ratzinger”
The Regensburg Domspatzen report on the abuses relieves Pope brother Georg Ratzinger.
That's what author and historian Michael Hesemann means.
The final report on the abuse scandal in the Regensburg Domspatzen continues to provide for discussions.
Christian Weisnder, spokesman of the reform movement “We are Church”, explained after publication to the German press agency, that he expected a new one from the former Bishop of Regensburg and today's Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as from the Cathedral Chapel Master Georg Ratzinger, 93-year-old brother of the emeritus Pope Benedict XVI Excuse me.
It would serve the reputation of the Catholic Church very much if Müller and Ratzinger expressed their deep regret at their own omissions or their false assessment of the events at that time.
The Vatican's “Osservatore Romano”, on the other hand, criticised the fact that 'double standards' were used in the reporting of violence in the domes.
Regarding the attacks in Regensburg, no one doubts that they are “shameful and shameful acts”, which would have to be punished and prevented in the future; however, the “degree of media manipulation” is striking, according to the author Lucetta Scaraffia, historian and member of the Italian National Bioethics Committee.
“The habit of calling the Catholic Church a source of all evil is already part of everyday experience and prepares public opinion to consider it normal,” writes Scaraffia.
In an interview with the Bavarian Radio, Princess Gloria von Thurn and Taxis also said: “You like going to church and this is a found eating”.
In addition, she pointed out that in her youth “blows were a normal educational means”, “to cope with naughty children, like I was one of them”.
They would find it unfair to apply today's standards to previous decades, because the world has changed.
In connection with the reports of the abuses, Pope brother Georg Ratzinger also appeared often.
Quite wrongly, writes author and historian Michael Hesemann, who wrote with Ratzinger the memorial book “My Brother the Pope” (translated into 12 languages).
“I have to protect Georg Ratzinger,” says Hesemann, “because all this had nothing to do with him,” he evaluates the results of the final report.
What exactly is in the 440-page report submitted by the lawyer Ulrich Weber, who was commissioned by the Diocese of Regensburg with the Enlightenment?
A total of 547 Regensburg domesticus were sexually abused between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s “with high plausibility” victims of attacks, 67 domesticus.
In the final report, Georg Ratzinger, who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994, stated: “In summary, it can be noted that in many cases forms of physical and mental violence have been applied by Domkapellmeister R.
Particularly with high emotionality, punishment for students could also be more violent.
Nevertheless, unlike many other accused people, it is striking that many victims appreciated the general humanity of R. and, therefore, in many cases despite violence, even connect positive memories with him”.
In this interview, Hesemann explains why he believes that the final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburg Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger relieves the burden.
Mr Hesemann, the 440-page report on the “Incidents of violence against patrons of the Regensburg Domspatzen” gives a contradictory picture of Dom Kapellmeister Georg Ratzinger.
On the one hand, many students highlight his “humanity”.
On the other hand, he also appears to be a cholerist and perfectionist, who often became tangible when a dome was not a top performer.
As a biographer, how do you value this final report?
Michael Hesemann: If you take the trouble and read the entire 440-page report from front to back, you have to ask yourself why the name Georg Ratzinger even appears in it.
He has only eight pages dedicated to him and is clearly exempted from any suspicion of complicity or co-knowledge in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.
The violence at the preschool also took place outside its sphere of effectiveness.
You can at best accuse him of learning about it too late or of not taking initial hints seriously enough.
The Domspatzengymnasium, on which he worked, was perceived by practically all respondents as - literally - “salvation”, “heaven” and “better world”.
The vast majority of his students, Georg Ratzinger, also exposes a very excellent testimony, describes him as “warm-hearted”, “popular”, “sincere”, “competent” and “understanding”, as an extremely good-hearted teacher who regularly supplied the boys with cakes, biscuits and sweets and was “always surrounded by grapes of children”.
Only a minority complains about his perfectionism and high emotionality, which has led to anger.
That he not only banged with chairs and threw the keychain on the floor, but also spread slaps and pulled too naughty guys on his hair or ears, he himself admitted years ago, deeply regretted and apologized for it.
In order to save his honour, however, it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the period in question, the 1960s and 1970s, with parents as well as with teachers.
Do you also know such breeding methods?
Of course, I think of each of us who was born before 1968.
I have also experienced this in a secular school, a state grammar school.
Compared to what this report is actually about, namely the appalling sexual abuse and violence at pre-school, these are, of course, trivial.
One wonders whether it is not more related to his notoriety and role as brother of Benedict XVI that many media have just crashed on him.
Many people who have never understood him are still working diligently on the Bavarian Pope.
The truth is, however, that the report relieves Georg Ratzinger in every respect.
In the media, a great deal has been reported on the subject of abuse in the Regensburg Domspatzen in the context of the report.
Is Georg Ratzinger also being charged with any involvement or co-knowledge of sexual abuse in the final report?
Michael Hesemann: Clearly no.
Not one of the 67 victims of sexual assault claims to have entrusted himself to the master of the cathedral.
Not even the parents were inaugurated.
“I have never dared to talk to my father or mother about it,” said one of the people in question, “It was all very embarrassing to me.”
The real problem in educating sexual abuse was, and still is, that most victims are silent out of shame.
If they did not even entrust themselves to parents and siblings, then certainly not to a choir leader, who would have been, in a way, a colleague of the perpetrators.
How do the pupils of Domspatzen assess Ratzinger's role in relation to the cases of abuse?
Michael Hesemann: An interviewed student put it this way: “With regard to sexual abuse... I see... no case in which he (Georg Ratzinger) would have had timely insights and could have stopped the respective perpetrator.
I think it's... really absurd to assume that he, of all things, is... have opened jacks more forceful, clearer, or even sooner, than to their parents, boarding school leaders, trustees, etc.
That you talk to him about sex... unthinkable.”
The report thus comes to a very clear conclusion: “The fact that students concerned in advance and/or their environment were entrusted to them could not be confirmed in the course of the investigation”.
As far as sexual abuse is concerned, Georg Ratzinger is therefore to be released from any co-knowledge.
He cannot be accused of not preventing him or bringing him to the notice.
There is therefore no reason to associate his good name with these disgusting crimes, as has unfortunately happened in some cases.
There was a lot of “violence” in the media at the Regensburg Domspatzen.
The former master of the cathedral, Georg Ratzinger, is accused in the report “Looking Away”.
Does he have to live with that accusation?
Michael Hesemann: This is the big problem that everything was mixed and blended into a huge melange of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere in the middle of it, Georg Ratzinger.
But that, in turn, is an abuse of the report.
There is a clean separation: between the preschool and the gymnasium of domspatzen, between sexual abuse and violence, and, let us say, other accusations.
In addition, the report deals with incidents from 1945, that is to say from four decades, in which Georg Ratzinger was not the choral director of the Domspatzen.
All the terrible beating pedagogy, the cases in which boys were harassed and malritated by sadistic teachers and suffered horribly under them, all happened at the preschool in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where really scandalous conditions must have prevailed.
But they had nothing to do with Dom Kapellmeister Georg Ratzinger, because he only saw the boys when they were already at the Domspatzengymnasium.
On that, as most witnesses emphasize, the theme “preschool” was taboo.
One was only happy to have escaped her and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even “paradise” states.
What was different at the Domspatzengymnasium?
Michael Hesemann: There was discipline, but there was no sadistic violence.
This also applies to Georg Ratzinger, in which the report concludes that “many victims appreciated R.'s general humanity and, therefore, in many cases, even connect positive memories with him despite violence”.
At the most, that leaves the accusation of looking away.
However, despite all efforts, the report could only define two periods during which it was told about the conditions at preschool.
The first time in 1970/71, when he began to establish himself and did not want to hear anything from the events at a school where he was just not active and responsible (according to the witness), and then only around 1993.
Georg Ratzinger consistently closed his ears before the conditions?
Michael Hesemann: No, because as early as 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the High School of Domspatzengymnasiums, which the report even reproduces.
In this, he points out to them that “the punishment of beating continues to be practised in preschool”.
Even in view of the danger of negative press releases, he recommended urgent intervention.
This was, of course, at a time when legal clarity existed, when punishments were already banned in Bavaria.
Before that, they took place in a legal grey area, as everyone knows.
It was also difficult for him to estimate where the people concerned might have been exaggerated or dramatised and where the permissible limit had really been crossed.
You can't say he's always looked away.
That's just not true.
It was only in 1980 that the punishment for the beating of schools was officially abolished in Bavaria.
Princess Gloria of Thurn and Taxis claimed that it was unfair to apply today's pedagogical standards to the time.
How do you see that?
Michael Hesemann: We historians are talking about the “pitfalls of anachronism”, that is, the danger of evaluating the past according to today's moral standards.
The princess is right.
But this does not, of course, apply to sexual abuse, which at all times was abominable, nor to what was committed in preschool of abomination and violence against innocent children's souls, which goes far beyond what was then usual.
That's all terrible and I'm glad it's finally being reworked.
But at the same time I have to protect Georg Ratzinger, because all this had nothing to do with him.
His means of disciplining and punishment, that is, slapping and pulling his hair and ears, were widespread in the 1970s.
When physical punishment was forbidden, he also strictly adhered to it.
What picture of his Regensburg period did Georg Ratzinger give in the talks with you for the book “My Brother the Pope”?
Did the subject of punishment also come up?
Michael Hesemann: Well, the book is about the life of his brother Joseph, that is, Pope Benedict XVI, tells from his perspective, where the domesticus played only a minor role.
Nevertheless, I do not conceal in any way that he led a strict regiment there.
But this must also be said: without this perfectionism, without the demand for unconditional discipline, it would have been impossible for him to form a world-class institution from the Regensburg Domspatzen, which had until then been more nationally known, true cultural ambassadors of Europe and its musical tradition, which has been published twice in in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).
With cookies and candies alone, you don't make big singers out of unruly boys and stand in front of every success, no matter in any field, but always discipline, passion and self-overcoming.
What kind of person did you experience Georg Ratzinger during the talks on her book?
Michael Hesemann: By working on the book and beyond, I really got to know Georg Ratzinger very well and have repeatedly experienced him as a wonderful, humorous, gracious, deeply believing and good-hearted person, of whom one cannot imagine that he could do anything to a fly.
I regularly see how many former domesticus still today, 23 years after his emeritus, regularly keep in touch with him, visit him, read him to him - he is almost blind - and treat him like a member of her family.
Those who still do not forgive him for being strict with them are clearly in the minority.
Most of the domes today are grateful to him for enriching their lives and teaching them the world of music.
And that he was always a good, fatherly teacher - a strict father, certainly, that may be - but also a lovable respectsperson, to whom they still look up today and whom they adore.
And please, once again, quite clearly: all that was accused of him are methods of education that were on the agenda at that time.
We can be glad that we have overcome this time long ago.
But it is highly unjust to make a man a medial scapegoat just because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother.
The evil intent behind it is all too obvious.
Because the report that has just been published relieves him.
Now the decency would dictate that a 93-year-old man who has earned great merits and without the outside of Bavaria and perhaps even Germany probably no one would know the Regensburg Domspatzen finally leave in peace.
