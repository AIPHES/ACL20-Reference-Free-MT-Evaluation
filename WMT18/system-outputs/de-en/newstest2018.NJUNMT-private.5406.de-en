Munich 1856: Four maps that change your view of the city
An irren institution where young people are to meet today.
A mine chapel where the S-Bahn tunnel is now being dug.
Small gardeners manage the former land of farmers.
The oldest official card in Munich promotes exciting stories to day.
It is annoying if maps are not up-to-date.
Everyone who has had to get worked up because the Auto-Navi displayed a green meadow instead of a bypass.
The historical maps of the Bavaria-Atlases digital gallery, an offer of the Bavarian national government's chance of chance, are anything but current - but this is precisely why they are very revealing.
Especially if you compare them to current online cards.
Then it becomes clear how cities and municipalities have changed in the distribution area of the Munich Merkur since the 19th century.
The Bavarian digital atlas is a patchwork carpet that cannot be recognized as such.
More detailed maps for cities and municipalities, so-called UrUNK UNK, have been integrated into the large overview map.
According to the Bavarian surveying administration, the survey was created between 1810 and 1864 and the first survey of Bavaria was carried out.
Your client: Napoleon.
Since the spring of 1800, the French army commander occupied Bavaria during the Second Coalition War with Austria.
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a topographic recording of Bavaria - for military purposes, of course.
Although French troops finally withdrew with the peace of Lunéville from 9 February 1801: It was today's neighbors who created the idea of a nationwide map of Bavaria.
UNK st Max IV. Joseph drove the project further, founded the "UNK UNK Bureau" - and thus the Bavarian surveying administration.
The original exposure sheet for Munich dates back to 1856 and can be found on the website of the Bavarian National Library, like all the others.
The comparison UNK her / Today is the most impressive example of the state capital.
The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.
An example of this is Untersendling, which appears relatively isolated in the map of 1856.
Sendling was incorporated as a district in Munich 21 years after drawing up the map, that is, 1877.
Today, Untersendling lies in the middle of the city.
The houses of Untersendling concentrate around 1856 along the present Plinganserstrasse, which was only named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser in 1878, a leader of the uprising of Bavarian farmers against Austria in 1705.
Where the Westpark is today, you see nothing but fields - at first glance: When zooming in, a smaller card with dozens of lines and numbers appears: Hand-numbered flourpieces were derived from the so-called "UrUNK."
Small parcels no longer occupy farmers there - but small gardeners of the "Land in Sun" plant.
A large green area is located north of Untersendling.
The Theresienwiese, which has been the site of the Oktoberfest since 1810, was in fact still a meadow - not a concrete desert - in the 19th century.
On the other side of the Isar, the historical map provides an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.
In today's Au-Haidhausen district, in the UrUNK blatt, not only is the street name "at Gasteig" or from the hill "UNK der LüUNK" - but also in large letters "Irren Anstalt."
Yes, here at the AuerUNK straße, people were once locked in with delusions.
In 1858 / 59, the Munich County Irrenanstalt "UNK der Auer LüUNK" was founded.
In 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden headed the institution - the psychiatrist who was brought in connection with the death of King Ludwigs II.
"He was progressive for his time and finished, for example, the anchor of the so-called irors.
He also banned the use of force against the inmates, "says Hermann Wilhelm, director of the Haidhausen Museum, who has worked with the Anstalt for an exhibition.
There was room for 280 patients at first, and it was then extended to 500 places.
At some point this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the UNK sirrenanstalt in UNK 1905.
The Isar-Amper hospital in Munich-Ost, one of Germany's largest psychiatrists, has been located there since 2006.
In the area of the former Auer Anstalt young people are now meeting in Salesianum in Munich.
The order bought the building complex in 1920 and converted it into a youth home with training facilities.
To the west is the football pitch of TSV München Ost, east of homes from the 1980 "s.
In 2015, the children's house "Casa Don Bosco" was built in architectural terms along the lines of the original building of the Irrenanstalt, which was destroyed during the Second World War in bomb attacks.
The Marienplatz was listed as the "main square" around 1856, while the Kaufinger street was called "Kaufinger UNK."
The Second World War also brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich.
In December 1944, the Allied bombs took many holes into the city centre.
A big one remained to this day - at the Marienhof.
The English Institute, small business houses and a medieval mine chapel were once at the Marianshof, where the preparatory work was carried out these days and on 5 April 2017 the second S-Bahn railway stop was held.
The slider can be used to compare the old Munich map with the aerial photo of today - and to fill the hole at the Marienhof.
Civil Rights Group publishes travel warning for Missouri
The National Association for the Promotion of Farming has issued a warning to colored people who travel to Missouri for discriminatory policies and racist attacks by the state.
"The NAACP Travel Advisory for the State of Missouri, which is due to enter into force by 28 August 2017, calls on African-American travelers, visitors and Missourians to take special care when travelling through the state.
A recent Missouri law that makes it harder for people to seek discrimination, as well as the law enforcement authorities of the state that disproportionately target minorities, prompted the group to issue the travel warning, said NAACP.
"You have violations of citizens' rights that happen to people.
They are stopped because of their skin color, they are beaten up or killed, "said the president of the Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, the Kansas City Star.
"We hear complaints in such a frequency that we have not heard yet."
It is the first such warning issued by the organization for a state in the US.
The group cited incidents such as racist offences against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died in questionable circumstances at the beginning of the year, after he had no more petrol during the state's journey and was detained by the police in Missouri without being accused of a crime.
The Council also draws attention to a recent report by the office of the Attorney General of Missouri, which shows that 75% black motorists in the state are more likely to be stopped than whites.
"The recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families, friends, and employees about what might happen in Missouri," Chapel said.
"People must be prepared to bring in deposits or let relatives know that they are travelling through the state."
Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest figures from the FBI's hate speech reporting program, which ranked the state at 16 in terms of the number of such injuries.
The travel warning is also a response to a new Missouri law that would make it more difficult to sue a company for housing or employment discrimination.
Previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after the States had passed immigration laws, which require local law enforcement agencies to arrest people for abuse of migration, which is what the LU considers.
Travel warnings are usually issued by the foreign ministry to other countries, but lately, interest groups have used the measure to respond to certain laws and trends within the US.
Weidezaunprojekt is Elemental
The UNK bacher WeideUNK n project is a success project and will be continued next year.
The CDU-Bundestag-appointed Peter UNK and Kordula Kovac have presented themselves with a picture on the spot.
The UNK demann family's legal court brought together representatives of the CDU local association of fishermen, together with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two members of parliament.
Markus UNK demann initially provided insights into his farm, in which he manages 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, supplies 40 dairy cows and as many young animals and houses them in five holiday homes.
For him the "Black Forest Milk" is the alternative-free marketing route for the milk of his cows, UNK demann said.
On the table of the holiday guests are exclusively regional.
Since he is also chairman of BLHV UNK bach, he called the Weidezaunprojekt "UNK ar UNK."
I cannot be profitable on such steep areas.
The green area care for a lot of work, much has to be done with the Motorsense.
"Here we have to contend with the conditions and with the topography," UNK demann stressed.
In 2003, he took over the parental farm and managed it without chemical plant protection and fertilizer, even if he did not run a bio-farm.
For Mayor Thomas Schneider, it was clear: "The municipality recognized the importance of the Weidezaunproject and is pleased with the support of the Leader."
Farmers would have to be supported at a cost of between EUR 3000 and EUR 4000 per hectare.
It is hoped that this will allow the afforestation of the land to continue for a long time.
"The greatest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and are concerned about how to continue their operations," stressed the Mayor.
Farmers are often criticised for their support.
In 2013, a total of 25 plots of 11 participants were fenced in via the WeidezaunUNK.
The area of disclosure is 40 hectares, which cannot be replanted until at least 2023.
Of the total cost of EUR 71 500, half was supported by Leader, a quarter was financed by the municipality of UNK bach.
Thus, farmers remained EUR 12 610, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometres of ditch.
"The great advantage is the longevity of fences," UNK demann explained.
Kordula Kovac stressed: "You are doing a really good job, without farmers and rural women it is not possible."
Peter UNK also said: "Best food is produced here."
The Baden-Württemberg Landscape Plant Directive (LPR) enables the state to promote soft fences.
The aim is to keep the Black Forest open.
A prerequisite is the existence of a support framework known by the LPR.
In addition, the area to be fenced in must not be subject to heavy-duty management (35% slope) and must therefore be threatened by afforestation.
The UNK bacher Weidezaunprojekt 2018 is currently running the application of eight participants with 24 parcels, who want to build nearly 16 kilometres of fence.
The area of disclosure corresponds to 35 hectares and the calculated cost is more than €112 000.
Is nothing more sacred?
Now, Trump's White House is taking over the statue of Liberty.
The surest sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues.
Americans value them, as do any others - hence the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein in Baghdad's Firdos Square in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologues of the Trump regime, certainly knew what he was doing when he took a symbolic axe in a heated dispute with Jim Acosta of CNN about the president's proposals to drastically restrict legal immigration.
To be fair, Miller did not attack the statue itself.
A horde of boat owners and Liberty imitators would have laughed him if he had done so.
But he attacked their meaning, and in particular the meaning that was attributed to her when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus was added to his base in 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument.
When Miller Acosta shouted: "I don't want to go into a whole thing about history, but the statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the world.
The poem to which you refer, which was added later and is not part of the original statue of Liberty. "
Miller is factually correct, but, as he put it himself, it is not really about history.
It is about the contemporary response to Lazarus's stirring words, the only one in which a state invites not only any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "Your waste, your poor, your weeds, your masses."
There has never been a time when the "miserable waste" on our screens was better to see.
Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people are not welcome in Trump's US.
This conflict, because of the importance of a statue, is part of a broader political and cultural conflict: It is indeed a conflict over America's importance.
Lazarus - and her friends, who fought to place their words on the ground after their death - knew very well that they took a highly political act.
The sculpture was intended to show the connections between French and American republicanism by portraying the feminine embodiment of freedom in a worn-out classic image.
Lazarus changed this meaning: In her poem, the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice.
And she gives herself a very different name: Mother of the exiles.
The combination of the poem with the picture is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American nativism.
And just as Lazarus changed the significance of the statue, the right-wing people wanted to change it for a long time.
The great writer Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John of the Baptist for Trump's coming, argued in 2010 that the statue of Liberty was not inviting anyone, but rather a neo-conservative early world that brought the American flame.
It is supposed to carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
The torch is not intended to illuminate the way to the United States. "
Limbaugh has come up with something quite unusual
The significance of the statue is very much a question of the position of perception.
The great fanciful act of Lazarus was to see it as seen by the exhausted, miserable but hopeful people after long and often terrible trips on the decks of ships.
It is a matter of literally seeing the world from the perspective of people who seek refuge and an opportunity to improve their lives.
Her statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome they must hear.
And that, of course, is not the perspective that Miller and Trump ever want to recognize.
Their torchlight is not intended to illuminate the path, but to ignite the hatred that is their only source of power.
World Cup 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish members of the UK team
Eilidh Doyle remembers a time when only two Scots were part of the UK team.
Neil Black, UK track and field performance director, says that the 16-member Scottish contingent will "make a massive contribution to the team in the World Cup."
A record number of Scottish athletes were selected for London 2017, which will start on Friday.
Black believes that "something special is developing in Scotland" and that the United Kingdom's athletics must learn something from it.
"We welcome it and we try to understand it, and we will continue it until we find it," said Black.
"I am talking to people in the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think that it has something to do with what they have done.
Scottish athletes think that it has something to do with what they have done.
British athletics: It has something to do with what they have done.
And also with the type on the street corner.
Whatever the combination of circumstances, it is absolutely brilliant. "
Several of the Scottish athletes are medals-winners, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m track, while Eilidh Doyle was elected team captain by the team.
"Eilidh is quite modest.
Her captain's speech was incredible, "says Black.
"A number of athletes, whether Scottish or whatever they live or train, went out of the room and felt very proud and motivated.
The passion and the real feeling that Eilidh brought in naturally were great. "
The Commonwealth silver medal winner, who will compete in the 400 m hurdles at their fifth World Cup, says that it is "incredible" that 16 Scots are in the British team.
Scotland's best total of athletes at the World Cup so far was seven, achieved in 1983 and 2015.
Muir, a medium-distance runner, leads along this path, and last year set five British and two European records.
It will take part in the 1,500 m and 5,000 m runs.
Chris O Azores Hare, who runs 1,500 m, is another Scot to watch after a great season that included the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games.
Doyle remembers her first World Cup, when the only other Scot in team Lee McConnell was.
The team captain says that she is "immensely proud" of the fact that many of her compatriots are not only part of the team, but in some cases they will also mix at the medals and the Finals.
"The special thing about being a team captain is that she was elected by the other members of the team, so it was a great honour anyway, but she added to know that my team mates voted for me."
"Obviously I am very proud of all the Scots that belong to the team.
It only shows how far we have come.
And they are here as established athletes, athletes who want to climb up to podiums.
What is my speech as a captain?
Yes, I think she went well.
I just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation, because we have a World Home Championship.
So it is really important to rely on this home support and to benefit from the fact that we are back in the Olympic Stadium.
I get a second chance to go and compete there and it will simply be a great atmosphere out there. "
Block critics on Facebook: Don't worry about a public office if you cannot sustain voters "heating up
The father of our country knew something of bad press.
Americans loved George Washington, but it did not take long for newspapers to beat him for everything, from domestic politics to its political principles.
He shunned the criticism, certainly.
But he has not silenced his critics.
After all, in 1783, Washington said: "Freedom of speech can be taken away - and, stupid and mute, like the sheep, we are fought for battles."
That brings me to Maryland as Governor Larry Hogan, who must work to be more like Washington.
Hogans employees have blocked and deleted contributions from at least 450 people who have expressed their opinion on their official Facebook page.
And the American Civil Liberties Union suspended him at the beginning of this week.
The staff of the governor dismissed the action as frivol, and the online comment was full of a backlash with "Na, and?."
"It's just Facebook," said many people.
But it is important.
And it is especially important if it is a type like Hogan.
This is a Republican governor in an overwhelmingly democratic state that is remarkably popular.
He has the second highest approval of the 50 governors of the nation.
Hogan is not a reactionary hogan head.
He has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict adherence to principles.
He was also very adept in using Facebook as a primary means of connecting with his constituents and playing his hair-free head after chemotherapy on his side.
Thus, blocking people who come to the side of the Governor - a public forum that is called official and paid by public-tax dollars - is unnecessary and, ultimately, dangerous.
In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogans spokesperson Amelia Chasse defended the governor's actions and argued that blocking comments was nothing more than a moderation.
But it is too easy to use the image of troll or spammers or hateful-filled people who swing the whip online.
The post spoke to some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.
And these are only real people who speak to their elected leaders: A teacher, an entrepreneur and a priest, not trolls.
They all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not profan.
The priest quoted the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogan's Catholic faith.
Law lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., was not hateful, but she asked about hate crimes.
"I politely commented that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crime and other current news," wrote it in the commentary section of the message "The Post."
"I do not appreciate this idea when a number of people take a position on the same subject, some people regard it as a so-called collective action rather than as a large group of citizens affected."
What the governor's staff called a "concentrated spam attack," others would probably call "intercession."
The Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment.
It is much cleaner than in the past if you had done the same thing, if staff were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical editorials, or to arrest and silence demonstrators.
But that is exactly what is happening digital.
Hogan is not the first public official to be criticized for impacting Facebook and other social media.
President Trump is being sued by Twitter users blocked by his Twitter feed.
One of the first milestones in this issue came last week in Virginia.
The Chairman of the Board of Supervisors of Loudoun County violated First Amendment, according to US district judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when they banned a voter from their Facebook page.
And in Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit from ACLU for his use of Facebook and Twitter.
This should not be so difficult.
At the time of Washington, the time of affordable car had a similar effect to the Internet.
The number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous writers suggested his leadership.
And even then, Washington had anonymous trolls.
The people who used pseudonyms such as "Juricola," "Valerius," "Belisarius" and "Portius" wrote all the letters to newspapers that made Washington's decisions.
Petitions criticising his position on the Amity Treaty, trade and shipping with the United Kingdom overpower his office, according to the historical documents collected by the George Washington Project's online papers.
But he has not silenced them.
Freedom of speech, difference of opinion and discourses are at the heart of our nation.
True leadership means accepting that.
Ronan Rafferty hopes for home comfort in the Renaissance Club.
Former European No 1 Ronan Rafferty will hope for home comfort in the next three days, as the Renaissance Club in East Lothian will host the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open.
The Northern Ireland, which links to the final round in the Archerfield last year before he lost against Paul Eales, is associated with the new venue and acts as tournament ambassador to Jerry Saradi on behalf of the club founder and CEO.
"I saw how the Renaissance Club was built, and we see how it achieved its glory with this event," said Rafferty.
"The players will see this course from his best side, he is in a great state.
Jerry did a great job when he fixed this place.
He is a fervent advocate of this game and is proud of his performance here.
This is a great showcase for this course. "
The Englishman Eales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time, although he won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour in his 32-year career.
"This really feels special," said the player in Southport.
"I couldn't defend Extremadura Open because it was taken out of the program every year after I won it.
Coming back to this part of the world is magical.
It is a wonderful place to play golf.
Last year's memories come back, and it was something special for me and my wife, Mrs Sharon, to win here last year.
It was a really special time and one that we will always appreciate. "
Gary Orr, who came to the European Senior Tour earlier this year after his 50th birthday, returns to the action on UNK boden.
This event will be the first Scottish appearance since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
"It always means a bit more when you play at home," said Orr, the man from Helensburgh.
"You want to do it well, but you also feel this extra pressure.
I really enjoyed playing again and I played a solid golf.
I am glad to see how things have gone. "
With the trio in the field are the former Masters winner Ian Woosnam and the Senior Major Champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and the former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are among the six Scots in the field, the others are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
Admission is free, parking is £5 per car with one passenger and £10 per car with two or more passengers.

Less lung cancer caused by passive smoking
In the last two decades, fewer and fewer people have died from lung cancer due to passive smoking.
Scientists from the University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) have come to this conclusion in a study.
"According to our estimates, 167 lung cancer deaths per year are due to passive smoking," said study manager Heiko UNK.
As a comparison, he approached his own study on the subject of 1994.
At that time, there were 400 lung cancer deaths per year in Germany due to passive smoking.
The new research is published in the International Journal of Public Health.
Home connections are proving to be very complex
The construction works at Villinger Straße are in full swing and "are reasonably in time," says the head of the farm Fred Heinze.
In the area of home connections, the situation is more complicated than expected, as there is a lot of underground noise, which is not noted in the plans.
The traffic, which continues to hinder the construction work, is a major problem for the company Stumpp.
"Car drivers" ignorance of red traffic lights and barriers is enormous, "says Heinze.
The road is closed and only the regular buses are allowed to pass through.
Angelo Caruso, Marvin Kostorz and Tim Kostorz of Stumpp have been working on the bridge for weeks.
"The hot days were quite exhausting.
But fortunately we were supplied with cool mineral water by our friend Fritz Matt, "says Marvin Kostorz.
Poverty and death in Indonesian Goldland
When Bardina Degei cook the dinner, it does not use a stove.
It even rarely uses a pot.
In her wooden house in Enarotali, the capital of the UNK ai rain in the troubled Indonesian province of Papua, the housewife usually puts a sweet potato - locally called "nota" - directly into the fireplace.
After half an hour, the charted bulb is taken from and swallowed with eager, unwashed hands.
Degei sits on the lotus floor - she has no furniture - where she also carries out her daily work.
An eimer in a roofed room serves as a latrine.
As the youngest of her husband's four wives, she was not assigned fields.
Polygamy is common here.
Of course, working late can be dangerous: Most village men are unemployed and many drink hard, and there are soldiers here.
"Nobody dares to walk around in the village after 5 p.m.," she says.
It is a rare insight into daily life in the highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony that was taken in Indonesia in 1969 after a disputed referendum, when only 1,026 elders were to vote by a public landing in front of the occupying forces.
An existing movement that fought for independence against Dutch rule quickly turned against the government of Jakarta, which controls the region and excludes foreign journalists or legal observers from it.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua, with the independent part of Papua New Guinea covering the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is as remote as it is, and includes a 90-minute flight from the provincial capital Jayapura to Nabire, followed by a romantic 5-hour drive by car.
There is no public transport.
The city, with about 19,000 inhabitants, consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences and corrugated cardboard roofs converted by rust into various yellow-brown tones.
Very few Indonesians have made their journey here, let alone journalists and virtually no foreigners.
Before Christian missionaries arrived, Mee Pago Papuans called Uga Tamee.
There have also been other changes.
"We were not used to wearing these clothes," says Degei and points to her lively, hand-woven Turban, her dark shirt and her bright skirt.
"In the past we had only leaves on our bodies."
Papua is Indonesia's poorest province, where 28% of people live below the poverty line and some of the worst rates of child mortality and literacy in Asia.
But it is Indonesia's gold land as well.
The largest and most profitable gold mine in the world, Grasberg, owned by the Freeport McMoran of Phoenix, is only 60 miles from UNK ai, a high-land province of the size of New Jersey with 153,000 inhabitants.
In 2015 alone, Freeport has mined gold and copper worth $3.1 billion.
Moreover, Papua has an estimated $78 billion worth of wood resources.
But these riches are a source of misery for Papua, ensuring that Indonesia's powerful military maintain a suffocating presence.
A 2005 study in the New York Times reported that Freeport paid nearly $20 million to local military personnel and units between 1998 and 2004, including up to $150,000 to a single officer.
Papuan demands for greater autonomy threaten these golden goose and are mercilessly treated.
According to activists, more than 500,000 Papua have been killed and thousands have been raped, tortured and detained by the Indonesian military since 1969.
Mass killings in Papuan's tribal highland in the 1970 "s became genocide in accordance with the Asia Commission on Human Rights.
In the region alone, the Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful demonstrators last year.
"We Are All VerUNK" is said in a 2016 report by the Archdiocese of Brisbane, which includes reports of last year's atrocities, such as unlawful executions and torture - rape and violent attacks are particularly popular after another report.
"It is difficult to count the number of victims because incidents happen every week," says Andreas Harsono, Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch.
The screws have increased as Papuas's resources bring an influx of settlers from other parts of Indonesia.
The population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83% Christian, but demographic changes are occurring as Muslim economic migrants come from the densely populated islands of Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Javanese Warung Cantins sell fried chicken and Gado-Gado, a mixed vegetables served with peanuts.
Local people are fighting to stay here.
"The migrants have begun selling chickens and vegetables on the traditional market cheaper than the local Papua," explains Abeth You, a 24-year-old panic indigenous who moved to the provincial capital of Jayapura.
"It has cost the indigenous Papua - the mum [the women] of Papua - their market."
Indonesia's President Joko Widodo, known as Jokowi by the people, promised to address the inequalities and violations of rights in Papua during his 2014 election campaign.
The former carpenter secured 27 of the 29 districts of Papua - including UNK ai - on the way to the Presidential Palace in Jakarta.
But in Papua, little has changed, and today the locals feel cheated.
"Our hearts are broken because we voted for Jokowi in 2014, with the expectation that he will fulfil our hopes that justice will be restored," says You.
Indeed, only two months after Jokowi's inauguration in October, UNK ai suffered a low.
On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children was out and sang Christmas songs in front of a campfire in Enarotali, when two Indonesian soldiers broke through darkness on a motorcycle.
The fervent children told them that they should turn on their headlights.
One of the soldiers took offense on their tone and later came back with four soldiers, according to the local pastor Yavedt Tebai.
The soldiers who had drunk jaded and beat the group with their rifles, said victims and witnesses.
Then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children.
A child, the 16-year-old Yulianus YUNK o, was beaten so badly that he fell into the coma.
A few hours later, the building of the nearby government commission was set on fire and things escalated the next day.
About 1,000 young Papua men, women, and children gathered at a football pitch in front of the local police station and the military command center to demand justice.
They wore ceremonial hunting arches and performed the Waita dance - continuously and imitating a bird song - by Papuas Mee Pago tribe.
Some demonstrators began to throw stones on police and military posts.
When the mood was heated, a command was sent to the soldiers via an internal radio: "If the masses resist more than three times, they shoot it dead," it is said in an official document released by TIME, which was not released to the local media.
Yeremias Kayame, 56, the head of the Kego Koto quarter of Enarotali, saw the threat and called for calm and urged the crowd to return home.
Nobody was in the mood to listen.
"When I turned around, I was suddenly shot into my left wrist," he said TIME on the veranda of his colorful painted wooden house.
Kayame still does not know who fired, but says that the ball came from the ranks of the soldiers gathered here.
"It was overflowing, many shots were fired," he adds.
The native man Alfius Youw was hit three times, so his cousin, who was a witness to the shooting.
"I ran to him and studied his body to make sure that he was," said Yohanes, who, like many Indonesians, bears only one name, the TIME in dark mood.
"I saw that he was dead... I kissed him."
Yotje Mende, the chief spector of Papua Police, told reporters that his officers only wanted to "secure" their station because they were attacked.
"We must defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us," said the Speaker of Papua Police, Commissioner Pudjo Sulistiyo, in 2015.
"It is about life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five young demonstrators were killed and many others injured.
The news of the killings was only 'filtered' to Jakarta the following day.
Three weeks in Jayapura, Jokowi delivered a passionate speech expressing sympathy for the families of the victims and vowing to address the historical grievances in Papua.
"I want this case to be resolved immediately so that it will not happen in the future," he said.
Security Minister Wiranto said in October 2016 that he was setting up an out-of-court mechanism for resolving historical violations of human rights.
But the excuses began almost immediately.
"Most injuries occurred a long time ago.
Some were in the 90's and early 2000's.
The point is that we have committed ourselves to addressing these violations, but there are processes that need to be passed, "he said.
Then Wiranto made a retreat when he spoke to TIME in Jakarta on 5 June, saying that he had no plans to set up a complaint mechanism in Papua.
Instead, "everything is regulated by law," he said.
Wiranto, accused by the UN of "crimes against humanity," which claimed more than 1,000 deaths in East Timor's bloody vote of 1999, said that 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua had already been resolved.
Families of the victims of the panic responded with fierce infidence.
"I have been interviewed four times over the last three years, but no progress has been made," says Yohanes.
"I am tired."
He says that years later he still lives in fear.
"I am afraid," he says.
"I am afraid to be arrested by the military is afraid to be shot."
His brother Yacobus repeated the view that the people of UNK ai are afraid to discuss the incident.
He says that he was beaten by the military after helping to bury four of the victims.
"After I had buried the corpses, the military looked for me," he says.
The foundries have not stopped.
On Tuesday, the Indonesian police shot at villagers in UNK ais neighborhood Deiyai.
During a confrontation between villagers and the manager of a construction company that refused to bring an unconscious man to hospital, one person died and 17 others were injured, including children.
The man who was 24-year-old Ravianus Douw, who drowned when he was fishing in a nearby river, died on his way to the hospital.
Excited villagers protested in front of the company's location office.
The police said that villagers threw stones on officers who responded by firing warning shots.
But locals say that the mobile Brigade (Indonesian paramilitary police) started shooting at the crowd and killed one.
"We were so panicked, we are afraid that there will be revenge," says the 29-year-old Dominggu Badii, who lives near the hospital and was witness to how the injured were quickly admitted here.
"I have been hiding for two days in my house."
The Deiyai Parliament has called for the officers involved to be held accountable and for the police's mobile brigade to be withdrawn from the area.
UNK ai has always been a trouble for the Indonesian Government.
The lack of meaningful development reinforces the discontent of the tribesmen Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal who live in the green highlands of Papua.
Many joined the "Free Papua Movement" (OPM), the rebel army that claims to defend Papua's rights by launching sporadic attacks and kidnappings by Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the top OPM leaders come from UNK ai, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
In response to this, thousands of people in UNK ai have been arrested and arbitrarily detained in recent years, on the pretext of "safeguarding national sovereignty."
Some never appear again.
Among the people of Papua, UNK ai is known as "a tragic, forgotten place."
Poverty strengthens discontent.
The little rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive for locals.
Bread is just as out of reach.
The people here are building everything they eat: Nota and fruit and vegetables.
Agriculture is the job of women, who can deal with four or five fields of sweet potatoes each.
They keep most of the harvest for the family, while the rest is sold on the local market.
Ten pieces of Nota cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Over time, economic inequalities between native Papua and the new migrants have grown, and have increased since the opening of new routes to Nabire airport.
The few jobs that exist in the region usually go to the more educated and wealthier migrants.
Papua rarely has the capital or the skills needed to run their own businesses in a competitive manner.
"The young people are not interested in staying in the village... because there are no jobs or money here," says John Gobai, chairman of the UNK ai tribal council.
Isolation keeps the eyes of the world away from Papua.
Moreover, restrictions on reporting remain tense for international media.
At the beginning of the year, French journalists Franck ESCUDIE and Basille Longchamp were deported for lack of coordination with associated institutions from Papua, although they were granted rare permission to film.
According to Phelim Kine, the Asia Deputy Director of Human Rights Watch, Jowi's campaign promises to lift reporting restrictions in order to promote transparency and development were not realized.
"There are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to report Indonesia's most troubled eastern provinces of Papua and West Papua: Visa refusal and a black list," he said in a statement.
Lack of press control means that international pressure on Indonesia's government remains largely confined to Papuas's immediate neighbors.
In March, six Pacific states - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands, and the Solomon Islands - called for the UN Human Rights Council to investigate "various and widespread violations" in Papua.
The OPM has historically supported the same countries.
The spokesperson of the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Arrmanatha Nasir, rejected the group's accusations and said journalists in Jakarta: "Indonesia still has a democratic system to cover up and there is free media, so it is difficult.
People on the ground want more foreign governments to take note of this.
When an official delegation from the Netherlands, led by the Human Rights Ambassador Kees Van Baar, Jayapura visited on May 4, locals broke their silence and urged him to attend "We want freedom," according to a meeting.
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019, but Papua say that they are unlikely to vote for Jokowi again.
"Jokowi is a man with good intentions, but he is surrounded by the people who are involved in the UNK ai shots," says Gobai, leader of the tribal council.
He wants Jokowi to know that, apart from being under the constant threat of a predatory military, the people of UNK ai are in poor educational and health services.
Gobai says that the Phalai people, like other Papua, regard their voice for Jokowi as a "guilt" that he must repay.
"They don't need money, they just want justice," he says.
Despite threats and intimidation, families of the victims of panic carried out a final symbolic act of Trotsk: The suffering of a victim was buried on a site exactly opposite the police and the military station.
They know that they may never have justice, but at least they do not let those responsible forget their crimes.
"A member of our family was killed," says Yacobus with sintered head.
"What else can we do?"
Fire capture the "Torch" skyscraper of Dubai for the second time
A fire found its passage on Friday in one of the highest residential towers in the world in Dubai, forcing hundreds of residents to flee the 337-metre-high 79-storey building.
It is the second fire which, in just two years' time, sweeps through the high-rise building, which one happens to call the Torch Tower (torch-tower).
The building was evacuated, injuries were not reported and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame.
"We slept and we stood up at fire alarm and shouting people.
We ran down the stairs, and it took about 10 minutes to get down from the 50 floor, "told a resident who gave his name as George, Reuters.
Dubai's civil protection authorities said that fire-fighting units shot fire at around 4: 00 p.m. local time (00.00 GMT) and cooled the building.
The government said that it is working to provide shelter for those affected.
The incident can revive issues related to the safety of materials used in the outer areas of high-rise buildings around the world.
An investigation by the management of the Torch building after its fire in 2015 showed that most of the damage was caused by the fairing, the exterior covering for decoration or insulation.
In the United Kingdom, the police said that they believe that the system of plates for insulation and cladding at the London Grenfell Tower in June could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire in which around 80 people died.
No Davis Cup Reform: Continued Best-of-five
The president of the International Tennis Federation (ITF) was defeated at the General Assembly with his large Davis Cup Coup.
At the meeting in Ho Chi Minh City, the revolutionary proposal for this sport to play Davis Cup single only on two win rates was not supported by the required two-thirds majority.
The five-sentence classic, which is often very long, but which is also very much appreciated, remains the traditional competitor.
63.54% of member countries voted in favour of the reform, so ITF President David Haggerty's goal has been narrowly missed.
"We respect this decision, but we are disappointed that our Member States have not adopted the entire package of reforms for the Davis Cup and Fed Cup.
We need a change to ensure the long-term future of these iconic and historic competitions, "said Haggerty.
They will continue to work to improve the application.
After many objections, it was not even put to the vote that the final would be carried out in a neutral place.
New in 2018 are only comparatively small details: For example, the finalists in the Davis Cup and the Fed Cup will have the right to host the next year in the first round.
In order to reduce the costs for the organisers, training venues and so on will be made easier and players will have to take less official media appointments before the Davis Cup.
More than 1 out of 5 U.S. travelers brings prohibited items to the aircraft, finds a survey
A survey of air passengers found that more than 20% deliberately or unknowingly prohibited items were smuggled past the control points of the US Transportation Security Administration, including at least 6% of which were flying while accidentally carrying KUNK or others.
Less than 1% claimed that they had discovered late that they had mistakenly traveled with firearms, ammunition, or explosives.
The survey among more than 1,000 people - carried out by a jet charter service, Stratos Jet Charters Inc. - also found that younger travelers tend to flout the rules.
Of those questioned who confessed that they knowingly tried to fly with something forbidden by TSA, 19.7% were Millennium als, compared to less than 15% who were members of Generation X.
The most common items deliberately passed by TSA agents were food and liquids.
More than 3% admitted that they had knowingly carried objects with blades through security checks, while 2.2% of female respondents and 3.7% of male respondents also confirmed that they had deliberately introduced banned drugs into the aircraft.
The company said it had questioned travellers across the country to see how many accidentally smuggled goods would have been through airport security and how many would have deliberately done so.
It is no surprise that the people most likely to carry smuggled goods - knowingly or unknowingly - through security were those who fly most frequently.
However, the company points out that the TSA guidelines are somewhat complicated and confusing.
People are often unsure about what liquids they can take with them or how much of them.
So it is no surprise that the bulk of the liquids seized by TSA are liquids.
For a while, people thought that TSA could view books as smuggled goods.
Liquids are allowed on domestic flights but not on international flights.
Elon Musk doesn't care: Tens of thousands of Tesla customers cancel orders
UNK-UNK endsassa Elon Musk likes to give with the huge number of preorders for his new Tesla "Model 3."
He has so far failed to understand that some of the customers have already withdrawn their non-binding reservation.
In addition to the ever-triumphant figures on sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets, Tesla's chief executive Elon Musk has for the first time revealed a different, less glossy figure in the announcement of the latest quarterly balance sheet.
In the last few months Musk has frequently promoted the more than 500,000 pre-orders for the new car, which is just beginning to be delivered.
Now Musk admits: Of the 518,000 pre-orders, 63,000 have already been withdrawn.
Critics have repeatedly pointed out that these are only non-binding reservations.
In the event of a cancellation, Tesla will pay the €1000 (US $1000 and UK £1000) "Reservation Payment."
Currently, 455,000 of these non-binding reservations were made, Musk admitted in a telephone conference with analysts.
However, the Tesla boss does not believe that the cancellation of up to 12% of all orders could be a problem.
His argument is that the challenge to ambitious growth targets lies not in demand, but in production.
Last year, Tesla delivered 84,000 vehicles.
In 2018 - all the models put together - it should be 500,000, and in 2020 it should be one million.
The demand for this is obvious.
According to Musk, 1,800 reservations are currently made per day.
If you order a "Model 3" today, you can expect delivery at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - when Tesla manages to drive its brand new production lines, which have never been tested in practice, without major interruptions at maximum capacity.
Many experts doubt that this is possible.
However, if there are major delays, the non-binding nature of the reservations could become a problem for Tesla.
After all, the company cannot prevent unhappy customers from walking away in droves.
EPO Chairman Pruitt is withdrawing to reduce emissions because of the delay in the Obama-Era rules
One day after being taken to court by 15 states, Scott Pruitt, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, withdrew his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the Obama era's rules to reduce emissions of smog-causing air pollutants.
Pruitt presented the change when his agency proved to be more responsive than previous administrations to the needs of public environmental authorities.
He did not mention the action brought against his previous office in a federal court of appeal.
It is a deadline which expired on 1 October for states to meet the 2015 standards for ground-level ozone.
Pruitt announced in June that he would delay compliance by one year to give his authority more time, study the plan and avoid "interfering in local decisions or hindering economic growth."
Pruitt, who was before his appointment by President Donald Trump's Public Prosecutor in Oklahoma, was for a long time a reliable opponent of stricter environmental regulations.
Since his arrival in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly moved to block or delay regulations that the chemical industry and the fossil fuel industry are resisting.
Wednesday's sudden reversal is the latest legal setback for Pruitts's regulatory rollback agenda.
Last month, a federal appeals court in Washington ruled that the EPO administrator exceeded his authority when he sought to commit the implementation of an Obama administration rule delaying oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane emissions.
In an opinion published on Wednesday evening, Pruitt suggested that his U-turn on ozone standards simply reinforces CEPOL's willingness to cooperate with states through the complex process of timely compliance with the new standards.
"Among previous administrations, CEPOL has often failed to meet the deadlines for implementation and then waited to be charged by activist groups and others, and to agree on the date for implementation," said Prulauitt, the job of the EPO.
"We do not believe in legal regulation and we take deadlines seriously.
We also take the law and the authority we have seriously. "
Nevertheless, the EPO's opinion stated that Pruitt will eventually use its "power to delay and all other legal powers" to ensure that the rules are "based on sound policy and the best available information."
Congressional Republicans are pressing for a more comprehensive overhaul of ozone rules.
A bill approved last month is intended to delay implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years.
The measure has not yet been put to the vote in the Senate.
The New York Attorney General, Eric UNK derman, who led the coalition of states that had been sued by CEPOL this week, said that the group intended to maintain legal pressure.
"The reversal of CEPOL - after our complaints - is an important benefit for the health and safety of these 6.7 million New Yorkers and the more than 115 million Americans directly affected by the smog that flows into their tailoring communities."
New York joined in this case California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, and the District of Columbia.
Ground-ozone occurs when pollutants from cars, power stations, oil refineries, chemical plants and other sources in the atmosphere react to sunlight.
The resulting smog can cause serious respiratory problems for sensitive groups of people and contribute to thousands of premature deaths every year.
Representatives of public health and environmentalists applauded Pruitts "surprising change of course.
"It is disturbing how much pressure it needs to get this reasonable step from the person responsible for the protection of the air we breathe," said Lori Ann Burd of the Center for Biological Diversity.
"We must continue to fight against the Trump administration's ideological crusade to bend to polluters and their special interests."
Tumlingen celebrates 750 years of St. Hilarius Church
750 Years of St. Hilarius Church: On the occasion of the anniversary of the mountain church, the old cemetery area in Tumlingen is invited to a Serenade on Sunday, July 16, at 4.30 p.m.
Whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village, the historic St. Hilarius complex is a popular place to stay.
Visitors to the sixth Benefiz Serenade can be enchanted by this powerful place.
The rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the village have made Tumlingens their concern.
Walter Martini emphasises: "It is a unique village jewel."
In 1267, the St. Hilarius Chapel was first mentioned in the Württemberg Book of UrUNK: Count Hermann von Sulz sold "the mountain with the parish church of Tumlingen and the VogUNK to Horgb."
According to the wording of the document, on Tumlinger Berg, in addition to the former parish church, there was also a stately court, one of which belonged to the church or the right of patronage, and not the other way round.
So there were also people living there.
As can be seen from the description of the Upper Office of Freudenstadt in 1858, next to the Unterdorf and Oberdorf, which can still be seen today in the village of Tumlingen, the "mountain" of the third village.
Old maps dating back to the year 1600 underpin these historical realities.
The law of patronage was established from the early medieval law of the church.
A gentleman who built a church, abandoned it and occupied it with a priest, remained the owners of that church and was able to inherit this own church.
This involved the right to appoint a priest or to propose a new priest to the bishop.
There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower.
The biggest of the two crumbled at Christmas 1673.
The newly created bell then sounded for the first time in 1692, but had to be released later in the Second World War in 1942.
In the 30-year war (1616 to 1648) the windows were taken and the bell parts were stolen.
The room was very small.
In 1796, French troops moved near the church.
They broke the pulpit and church chairs and used them as firewood.
Remains of the church threatened to collapse in 1809.
Until 1869, the Tumlinger Hilarius cemetery also served as the last resting place for the dead from hearing-welding.
In 1823 the cemetery was enlarged and the Hilary Church was abandoned.
Only the church tower was left standing.
In 1834, a storm split the church tower and half collapsed.
In order to prevent an accident, the tower was broken down.
Only the tower tower tower still exists today was preserved as a witness to the 750-year-old church history
Today Horst Kallenberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem from the "UNK UNK" as successor to Dieter Dockhorn take care of the Hilarius facility.
As the organiser, the friends and supporters invite Tumlingens on Sunday, July 16, to the sixth Serenade in the old cemetery to the St. HilariusUNK.
This is designed by the Combo des Kepler-GyUNK ums Freudenstadt and with speeches by Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis.
UNK vorUNK er Hartmut Romann speaks the final word.
The programme will start at 4.30 p.m.
Admission is from 3.30 pm.
At the end of the Serenade, there is a trunk in front of the cemetery.
"Enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with a wide view over meadows towards the forest," the organizers will reveal the fantastic view.
The Serenade takes place only in dry weather.
The organizers hope for many supporters to preserve the historic St. Hilarius plant, which is important for tumours and hearing welders.
The friends and supporters of Tumlingens are particularly committed to home care, as Serenade-Organisator Walter Martini reaffirms.
Association wants to have wind wheels approved
"Boisheim resists" does not see any legal condition for the construction and has therefore turned to the land council.
The Association "Boisheim has called on Landrat Andreas Coenen (CDU) to withdraw his approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Boisheimer Nette.
It was unlawful.
The association argues that at the time of the approval on 30 December 2016, no wind turbines could have been approved in the Boisheimer Nette, as at that time only the city limit to Schwalmtal had wind power.
Within this concentration zone, the construction and operation of wind turbines are possible in principle, but at the same time the concentration zone results in the exclusion of the use of wind energy for the rest of the city.
The aim of these areas is to prevent the landscape from being "saved."
The city of Viersen had decided a second wind power concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette a few days earlier by amending the land-use plan - but the district government of Düsseldorf had not approved it because of a formal error.
"As a result of the lack of planning law, the granting of a permit is still illegal and therefore also to be withdrawn," said Christoph Erkens, Chairman of Boisheim.
Current state of affairs: The town council decided again before the summer break the wind concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette; the district government has yet to approve it.
Statement: "This excludes from planning the granting of an authorisation for the construction of wind turbines."
The circle confirms the receipt of the request.
"The relevant letters have been received by Viersen County since last week," said a speaker.
The circle is giving them the opportunity to re-examine the matter.
However, they are not expected to result in the procedure being stopped.
With a view to ongoing proceedings at the Administrative Court, on Thursday the circle did not want to comment on the content of the arguments put forward by the association "Boisheim wUNK sich."
The NEW Re, a subsidiary of NEW, is planning to build four 200 meter wind wheels on an area on the Boisheimer Nette.
Last year, the company in which the town of Viersen is indirectly involved had already entered into lease contracts with the owner of the approximately 65 hectares of land.
The construction of the four wind turbines is intended to meet the electricity needs of around 11 400 households - equivalent to about one-fifth of the electricity needs of all four households.
The NEW Re wants to invest about 20 million euros.
Last summer, Viersen's town council gave the go-ahead for the purchase of three wind turbines at the Linnich wind farm near Aachen and a stake in a wind energy plant in Übach-Palenberg in the district of Heinsberg.
Car and tractor go together: Woman dies in the event of terrible
One terrible road accident occurred on Friday morning at 10 a.m. on the L 333 between Niederwallmenach and Bogel (Rhein-Lahn circle).
A woman was fatally injured.
Two more people have been slightly injured.
The provincial road remained closed for hours.
According to police data, a 17-year-old young woman from Bornich, with her passenger car, is in charge of accompanied driving with her 53-year-old mother as accompanying the L 333 in the direction of Bogel.
City and shopkeepers plan "home shopping" weekend
Bad Langensalzaer and people from the region are expected to rediscover the shopping opportunities in the city centre in September.
The business association and the city administration want to take advantage of the weekend on 8 and 9 September to attract the residents to shop in the city centre.
As the chairman of the trade association, Christian König, announced, the "Home Shopping" weekend is intended to make customers aware of what offers their own city has to offer away from the usual supermarket goods.
It is therefore planned to create a market with regional suppliers, similar to the weekly market.
In addition, local companies will present themselves with their training places.
In addition, the shops of the city centre are to be invited to the "midnight shopping."
The action is not only aimed at residents of the city and the nearby region.
In preparation are advertising spots on the radio, an Internet video and printed bags that indicate the event weekend, Christian König said.
The city administration and the business association cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry.
This is another stage of the project "UNK UNK UNK UNK."
These include new offers such as the first "active day" to the Brunnenfest including Sunday's sales announcement, talks with all traders and hosts to encourage them to participate actively.
Also attractive offers on Saturday and the waiver of parking fees on this day are part of the concept.
In addition, customer potential is to be re-developed or re-developed.
This includes spa guests and tourists.
But many locals would also have lost sight of the city centre when shopping.
At the end of the day, everyone would have to help revive the city centre, including landlords, businesses throughout the city and clubs.
It was necessary to overcome lethargy with a network, some of which had spread, King said in the spring.
Birgit Streich, director of the IHK-Center in Mühlhausen, announced that five Thuringia cities are participating for the first time in the third "home shopping" day in Germany.
In addition to Bad Langensalza these are Weimar, Sömmerda, Heiligenstadt and UNK cherode.
The day should "promote the appreciation of local trade and highlight its importance for the common good of our cities," he stressed.
The action under the leadership of the Chamber of Commerce and with many partners also makes it clear that every citizen with his / her purchasing behaviour can influence his / her own direct environment.
Two dead and several injured following explosion at US school
During construction work there was a gas explosion in the school building.
New people have been injured.
A gas explosion in the US town of Minneapolis has killed two people and injured nine more, some of them heavy.
According to the fire brigade, on Wednesday (local time) an injured person was still in a critical state.
One person died when part of a school building was cut in the explosion.
A first mischief was later also recovered dead.
The dead were school employees.
As an accident, the authorities suspected work on a gas pipeline.
At the holiday time only a few people stayed in the building of the MUNK aha Academy.
Trump put pressure on Mexico for paying the border wall after leaked transcripts of telephone calls
Transcripts of telephone calls between US President Donald Trump and Mexican and Australian leaders were published by the Washington Post.
On January 27, Trump called on Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto to to stop publicly saying that he would not pay for a planned border wall.
The US President shouted at him because he publicly denounced the wall, saying to him: "You cannot tell the press."
Trump launched his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall on the US's southern border, and swore to let Mexico pay for the project.
Transcripts of his first call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull were also published and revealed tense exchanges.
Mr. Trump said Mr. Turnbull that a trade for the US had proposed to take over refugees who emigrated to Australia "ridiculously," mies "and" stupid, "and that the insisting on trade was introduced by the Obama administration.
Mr. Trump ended the call after he said to Mr Turnbull, "this is the most unpleasant call for the whole day."
Moores Ford Massacre: Activists re-launch racist Lynchakt as a call for justice
A 1948-he Ford Mercury drove through a group of spectators in the rural Monroe, Georgia, and went to the Ford Bridge of Moore.
Before the car, which had four black passengers and a white driver, could reach the bridge, a group of white men with rifles appeared to block his way.
The leader of the MUNK - a middle-aged man in a needle striker's suit - took a long train on his cigar and looked through the windshield.
Inside, the inmates were in fear.
"We want this n ---- r Roger!" Snug the man
"Get him out of the car!"
Shrines torn the silence when a young black man was torn apart from the front-passenger seat.
Fortunately, this terrible scene, which was played on 22 July, is only a reflection.
But when a noose is thrown around the neck of "Roger," almost all of them met very real sighs in the audience.
Since 2005, civil rights activists have returned to Moore's Ford Bridge to imitate the night when two black couples - Roger Dorothy and Malcom and George and Mae Murray Dorynsey - were trained by Ku Klux Klan in 1946.
No one has ever been charged with murders.
"It is truly incredible that in all these years, not one person has been arrested - although we see them in our communities, although we know who they are," said Tyron Brooks, who helps to organise the post.
"It is a stain on a story, but it is a burden on our souls."
Brooks is a 71-year-old Congressman of the State of Georgia and a civil rights activist for a lifetime.
For him, reproduction serves as a dramatic appeal to action, and is an annual reminder of the Monroe community that an injustice has never been corrected.
"We want prosecution, we want an end, we want healing, we want reconciliation, but first we need justice," he said.
"We cannot achieve healing and reconciliation until we get justice."
A forensic practitioner puts a blanket on the body of one of the victims of the Moore-Ford Lynch on 27 July 1946.
According to FBI records received from NBC News, more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding counties were suspected in the Lynchtrial.
But no one has ever been charged.
Although the suspects have remained free for decades, civil rights activists say that the double motivation for the Lynch actions throughout the city was always known: Politics and sex.
In April 1946, a decision by the Supreme Court allowed black citizens in Georgia to vote for the first time in the pre-election campaign in the summer.
Roughly at the same time as the election, according to the FBI, the black farmer Roger Malcom has set down a white landowner, Barnett Hester, during a fight - allegedly for a woman.
Brooks said that the rumor in the city was that Hester slept with Malcoms Dorothy and that the baby she wore was not from her husband.
On July 25, 1946, Loy Harrison, a prominent white landowner, paid $600 to free Malcom from prison, according to the FBI.
He was accompanied by Dorothy and her cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey to prison.
But when they moved away from prison and approached Moore Ford Bridge, a Lynchmob surrounded the car.
"As it turns out, it was Harrison who prepared and ordered the murders," this concludes an FBI report.
"It is also obvious that there has been a plot between state and local prosecution, which has not only been involved in the murders, removed evidence and covered up the identity of witnesses."
Brooks makes it even more concise.
"It was an electoral massacre," he said.
"They were all killed to send a message to black people in this community:" If you register and if you vote, you will be able to do so here. "
For almost a decade, Cassandra Greene conducted the annual reproduction of Moore Ford Bridge Lynch murders.
Their portrayal is vivid, profound, and is rooted in a kind of deep racism that many would like to believe is no longer in America.
It is hard to look, and even harder to look away, but Greene said that this is the point.
"We do not want to talk about lynching, because then we will be confronted with its hype in all of us," she said.
"But I cannot build a relationship with you if you do not want to listen to me or do not want to hear what I have gone through."
Rehearsals for this year's production started in June, and on the first day almost 30 actors - a dozen whites and the rest of blacks - pushed into a room and lauded when Greene started a well-played overview.
Wade Marbaugh is here Greenes Co-director.
He has played the role of chief clan member for years, but he said that the role will never be easier.
"I feel dirty because I'm not so," said Marbaugh.
"But I think it is very important to keep this story alive because we do not want to return to these times."
On the other side of the room, actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, who play Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester, tried their lines.
The play begins with Malcom, who is hitting him and wobbling him, angry that he slept with his wife Dorothy.
"I said, n --- he, vanishes from my property!"
Rascona reciprocates the fire.
There is a pause.
And then everyone (at least all black actors) breaks out in laughter.
Greene laughs the loudest.
"What?!," Rascona asked.
It is alarmed and confused.
Was I too tough?
"No," Greene said, still laughing.
"I simply do not think that white people said 'n --- he' at the time."
"But," one of the other black actors quipped.
"You just have to hit the hard 'R.'.
And that is exactly where the energy in the room is shifting, a feeling of camera replaces the unease.
Everyone is busy getting this right, not only because of the game, but also because of the memory of the four people killed.
The scene begins again.
This time, when Rascona says the N word, he says it sharply and forcefully.
No one laughs at all.
This repetition ends violently and quickly.
There are cries, shots and then silence.
A woman dressed with a dream dress is standing above the bodies of the actors and delivering the laughing words "Strange Fruit" to Billie Holidays.
Your voice breaks with every second word.
About a hundred meters behind it, a group of about four dozen viewers blur sweat and tears from their eyes.
The audience is almost evenly divided between black and white.
A couple came from Ithaca, New York, to see the performance, many only come down the road.
They have experienced Georgia's depressing moisture every almost eight hours when Brooks takes her on a pilgrimage to the Tombs of the Malcoms and Dorseys.
Until this point, the murders have remained an anecdote, but now, when you are on the same country where the Lynch murders took place, the air feels spooky.
When the last notes of the song end, Greene invites the crowd to come closer and inspect the corpse name.
Children hoard at their heads, register the fake blood and the quiet body and whisper each other.
"They are not really dead," a little boy is murdering as if he wanted to remember it.
After a few minutes Greene thanks the crowd - and suddenly it is over.
The actors throw the LynchUNK away and wipe out their tears.
Bradshaw surrounded Marbaugh, the man in the suit who played the clan member.
Nick Rascona is surrounded by two of his fellow players and then breaks into their arms, and the emotional burden of the performance finally breaks through with him.
"It's okay," whispers one of the women.
"We know that this is not in your heart.
You did so for one reason. "
Later, the audience meets the actors for dinner.
A white pair from Atlanta chat at a table, excited about the post with a black pair they have just met.
Denise Duplinski fought to find words that have left behind the performance.
"It is hard to hear these terrible words and deeds... coming from people who look like you and who do so because they look like you," she said.
"What this really does with me leads me to believe that lynching is still going on," she added, "today it is called only police shooting."
In the same room, Tyron Brooks Court keeps his table, he eats and reminds of civil rights.
He said he had already started to plan the performance next year.
"The adjustment is somewhat inspiring, because it describes the horrors of what we have endured, but it is also a moment of learning," he said.
"If we learn nothing from it, it can happen again.
Those who do not study their own history, those who do not know their own history, are condemned to repeat it. "
"GötterUNK UNK" reconciled the Wagnerians in Bayreuth
In the fourth part of Richard Wagner's monumental work, director Frank Castorf also sets himself on a colorful-frivole staging in a gigantic six-storey setting.
The turnstage (designed by Aleksandar Denic) shows either a shabby street corner with the wall rest and dönerbude in Berlin, a "plaste and elastste" logo from GDR times or the New York Stock Exchange.
Prior to this, an open Mercedes classic car, in which the RheinUNK cker poses as rockergirls, or UNK a Isetta.
Stacked oil barrels recall Castorfs's leitmotif - money, power, and greed - which runs through its "ring" staging.
The three butchers of the Rhine - sung by Stephanie Houtzeel, Wiebke LUNK kuhl and Alexandra Steiner - are harmonious as they were in the "Rheingold."
Kess seduce Siegfried (Stefan Vinke), in Hollywood style unravel a body in the boot and give the ties-clique.
Stephen Milling sings the wonderfully fiesen Hagen that surrounds the aura of a heavy weight boxer.
Brutally the scene when he beats Siegfried.
Later Gunther (Markus UNK) must also believe in it.
The audience thanks the ensemble with strong applause.
Stormy celebrations include Foster, Milling, Vinke and conductor Janowski, who is modest and forgets his hands to the Merkel-Raute.
There is great applause for the Festival Orchestra, which is showing itself for the first time on stage - in view of the great heat again in empty leisure clothes.
The show was eagerly awaited by Frank Castorf and his team
If he had to go through an arrow concert in 2013, there was great jubilation five years later, with the sporadic "Buh" calls.
The festival's director, Katharina Wagner, should have been pleased to hear about this.
"You notice that the audience has grown together with the" Ring "in a way," she said shortly before the performance of the dpa.
The audience not only made a form of peace with Castorf, but also grew an understanding of its view.
I draw a positive conclusion.
Max UNK works as a volunteer
They work in several places in their voluntary year.
Where else?
Quantity: Usually in Steinfurt in the furniture exchange, once a week I help out here in Greven in the furniture bridge.
And I have also worked at the school in the open whole day.
What are your experiences with this?
Lot: It is a beautiful, broad spectrum that I see here.
I have to deal with different people, young people, refugees and young adults.
They are now 26 years old, a late-working volunteer.
How does this come about?
Lot: I have made my UNK.
And then a civil engineering study, let's say, successfully aborted.
I realized for me that it is wrong for me and I want to do something else, work with people.
And then I asked myself what you are doing.
Make a social year, there is an insight, there you can see how it is really on the spot, in the focus point, too.
And was it?
Lot: I have collected some great impressions.
I will start my studies in social affairs in the winter semester.
I am going to study dual, probably doing a social worker training at the Youth Welfare Office Herne and studying in Hamm at the University of Applied Sciences.
Is it not a bit unusual to have several different locations during the voluntary service?
Quantity: Yes, it is very variable.
It's always important where to do your FSJ.
It can be done from retirement to youth work - in all kinds of facets of social work.
It was very varied with me.
I was also partly in the OGS, in other words in the afternoon care.
For me, that was exactly what irritated me.
I was able to see my own strengths and see how it really works.
Unlike in civil engineering studies?
Lot: Well, this is not a matter of counting static.
There are always other people in front of their heads who have a different history.
Whether a refugee, a young person who has been taken out of the family, is something that must always be dealt with individually.
Very interesting.
And you did not have any fears of contact?
Quantity: For this I am not the type.
It is an area that has a lot to offer.
A lot of love, a lot of friendliness.
There are sometimes negative moments, but that is how life is.
Pearson cuts a further 3,000 jobs and cuts the dividend to revive the business
The UK educational group Pearson said on Friday that it would cut a further 3,000 jobs and cut its interim dividend by 72%, as another restructuring programme would be launched to overcome the pressure that the company is facing.
The redundancies, which Director-General John Fallon announced for the most part for the end of 2018 and the beginning of 2019, are in addition to his previous restructuring, which has already lost 4,000 jobs.
Pearson announced a third cost-cutting plan in May to cut costs by another £300 million ($394 million) to revive a business that was hit by the rapid move to digital learning.
The company, which sold its stake in Penguin Random House to its partner Bertelsmann last month, said that the outlook for the financial year was unchanged after an increase of 1 percent to £2.05 billion in the first half of the year.
Convoy attack from Kabul: NATO soldier killed in suicide bombing
A suicide bomber attacked a military convoy in the Afghan capital Kabul, killed a NATO soldier and injured several others, officials say.
Five soldiers and one interpreter were injured, announced a statement by NATO.
Unconfirmed local reports indicate that three civilians also died in Qarabagh.
The bombing is the last act of violence that hit Afghanistan this month - more than 30 people were killed in a mosque in Herat on Tuesday.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
NATO's opinion states that the explosion took place on Thursday evening, when a joint patrol with the Afghan army was attacked by an 'improvised bomb attack carried by people'.
The statement states that all injured persons are in a stable state and are treated at Bagram airfield in the US Military Hospital.
Correspondents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group known as the Islamic State (ISIS) in Qarabagh is a major concern for NATO forces in the nearby Bagram.
According to the United Nations, there were at least 1,662 civilian deaths in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, of which about 20% were in the capital.
At the end of July, a suicide bomb killed at least 30 people in a mainly Shia district of Kabul.
The Taliban said they had carried out this attack.
On May 31, a massive bombing in the center of the city killed more than 150 people with the country's most deadly militant attack, since the US-led troops ousted the Taliban from power in 2001.
The violence highlights the precarious security situation in Afghanistan, as US President Donald Trump is considering increasing the number of US troops supporting the military and police in the country.
Correspondents say that the suicide attacks in Kabul in recent weeks have also caused a crisis of public confidence in the government, its policies, and, in particular, in the reputation of President Ashraf Ghani.
EPO makes a decision to delay the smog rule following complaints
The US Environmental Protection Agency has lifted a decision to delay regulation of the Obama administration, which requires states to reduce smog-causing emissions, one day after 15 countries overthrew the agency for the sake of the damage.
Late on Wednesday, CEPOL announced the decision to take forward the so-called "ozone provisions 2015," and said that it demonstrated the Agency's obligation to cooperate with states.
"We believe in dialogue with and that we respond to our state partners," said EPA chief Scott Pruitt in a statement.
Pruitt announced in June CEPOL's intention to measure ozone rules - which aim to measure pollutant emissions in part of the country to determine where cuts need to be made in order to comply with stricter air quality standards by October 2018.
A group of 15 mostly democratic states, together with the district of Colombia, lodged a complaint on Tuesday saying that the effort was illegal.
President Donald Trump's administration has tried to reduce a wide range of environmental requirements that former President Barack Obama has imposed as part of a broader agenda that Trump claims to boost economic growth.
However, efforts have triggered the setback of the democrats and nature protection groups, which worry about the impact of major emissions on public health.
The EPA website says that breathing in air containing ozone "can reduce lung function and increase respiratory symptoms," such as asthma.
Municipal Council: Community area
In the end, the decision was clear: With two votes against, the town council of Fluorn-WinUNK decides to establish a Community area in the future residence of the elderly.
Before the discussion there is an important information: The contract of sale for the missing land is signed, says Mayor Bernhard Tjaden.
Although it will still be necessary for the area previously belonging to the parish to be in municipal ownership, there is no longer any obstacle to planning the project to be undertaken by a private investor.
There is a discussion on a Community area for this.
One of the two remaining investors has offered to come to the municipality.
On the ground floor it would provide a living area - around 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with a surface area of 70 square meters for a special price.
The administration and the majority of the municipal council would like to see such a common space not just as a meeting point for the inhabitants of the welfare-friendly residential area, but as an open place to the community.
As an example, the word from the "knitting café" was round the corner.
The decision made last autumn by allocating funds to the current budget is being sweetened by means of funding.
The building is located in the redevelopment area.
The establishment of a Community area would, according to Tjaden, be eligible for 60 per cent of 30 per cent.
In order to signal to the investor that they do not want to throw a stick between their legs in this respect, the proposed decision provides for the finding that both the saddle - which is based on the surrounding height - would be economical as well.
It is not only Wilfried UNK mer who says that this addition is unnecessary.
If Coreper's helps: Unanimously, he passes the body.
It is not so easy for the Community area.
Daniela's reputation refers to the many buildings with which you are not quite able to make progress, but now you are opposed to the common space from the window, she says: "I am hard to do it."
Yvonne Staiger is very much in favour of the community area - but absolutely against a community participation.
It sees it as a covert subsidy to investors who are already willing to invest, or even outside.
This is not the case, because the acquisition of the area does not give a grant, but gives a real value that is marketable in case of doubt, is the counter-statement.
Mrs Staiger's request to split up the proposal for a resolution is supported by three.
Thus, with two votes against the original programme, which so summarizes Stefan Haller: "If we take the decision in this way, we will take a giant step towards closing a huge gap in our infrastructure."
Collision with car: Cyclists are hurled on the road
On Wednesday in Garath, an 82-year-old cyclist was hit by a car and was seriously injured.
As the police announced, at 12.20 p.m. the 82-year-old LangenUNK with his bike on the street Schwarzer Weg was out of the direction of Hilden.
The senior wanted to cross the track at the height of the street Am Buchholzer Busch.
A passenger car driver in the same direction gave him priority.
When the LangenUNK took to the road, however, he apparently did not pay attention to the traffic on the other side.
He met with a car that managed a 66-year-old woman.
The man was thrown to the streets.
He suffered severe injuries and was taken to a hospital with a car.
FC Bayern München must waive David Alaba and Thiago at the Supercup against Borussia Dortmund
The Supercup takes place without him: David Alaba must have the game shot against Dortmund.
The FC Bayern will travel to Dortmund for the first mandatory game of the new season.
Seven professionals are missing the title defender in the Supercup against the Cup winner.
The staff at the German soccer record champion Bayern Munich will be growing with Cup winner Borussia Dortmund before the Supercup on Saturday (20.30 pm / ZDF and Eurosport).
Coach Carlo Ancelotti has to do without David Alaba in the duel with the BVB.
That was confirmed by the Italians on Friday.
Also missing are the Münchnern Manuel UNK, James, Thiago, Jerome Boateng, Arjen UNK and Juan Bernat.
For the five defeats in the last six test games Ancelotti has blamed the physical condition and the lack of balance in his team's game.
"We know that we are not in the best physical constitution," said Ancelotti and added: "The most important point is the balance in the team.
Last but not least, that was not good. "
However, the 58-year-old believes in an increase in performance in the first official compulsory game of the season.
"Football is also tactics, strategy, personality and motivation.
I have great confidence that my team shows these qualities.
The team is ready.
We want to play intelligently, "said Ancelotti, who expects a" difficult, intensive game. "
The duel of the two German soccer heavyweights captivates fans.
The match is sold out with 81,360 spectators, the German Football League (DFL) announced on Friday.
Walk from Stern to Stern
The first "Star Path" is to be created in the "Voting Mission."
This is planned by the association SternUNK Sankt Andreasberg.
There is a planetary path in Göttingen - since 2003.
A "star trail" responds to the information needs of many Harz visitors, it was said.
It combines nature, science, movement and sporting performance.
Members want to set up information panels along the planned route and inform them about stars and constellations.
In a first phase until 2018, the association plans "well accessible installations at five to six locations" in Oberharz.
St. Andreasberg, Braunlage, Hohegeiß and Sieber would be eligible.
The information on the boards is to be supplemented by the Internet.
This is why a good mobile network reception plays a role in the selection of locations.
Accessibility is also a criterion.
Later, the Starbase Path will be extended by train.
"On the star path, the viewer will learn a lot of interesting facts, for example about the physics of the individual stars," explained the association.
They also learned why stars have different colors, or why a star lit more than another, even though it is much further away.
It also shows the star in which a selected star is located and when it is best to see it.
Since 2014, the association has operated the highest situated observatory in northern Germany in the mountain town of St. Andreasberg.
According to the Federal Office for Nature Conservation, the location in the middle of the national park of the national park of the city is one of the six darkest regions in Germany.
Often the Milky Way and even the Andromeda galaxy are visible with the naked eye.
Since 2003, at the initiative of the association Planetarium Göttingen, there has been something similar to the planned star werg - the planetary path.
Starting in front of Gebhards Hotel in Goetheallee, which forms the interior of our solar system, the planetary path with its Stelen leads up to Hainberg and to the Observatory - as well as an "alien community" site.
The panels with the individual planets - including Pluto, reduced to dwarf planets, at the end point - are situated exactly at the distance and scale of one to two billion.
The earth thus shrinks on a ball of 6.5 millimetres in diameter, while the sun, which is exactly 75 metres away, measures as much as 70 centimetres.
The entire distance of the planetary path is about four kilometres.
While the light from Sun to Pluto takes about eight hours, pedestrians need a good hour to stop with Pluto.
Thus, pedestrians are faster than the light in the world.
But the march to the next fix would take half a year.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for the first time, discuss a possible showdown
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who were supposed to be on a collision course to stage the most exciting boxing fight under 147 pounds in the near future, met for the first time on Thursday.
They were in separate rooms in ESPN offices in Los Angeles, until Garcia, the unwritten World Boxing Council light weight champion, went down the corridor to welcome Lomachenko, the World Boxing Organization Super-FederUNK.
After Garcias victory by unanimous decision on the former four division champion Adrien Broner on Saturday on Showtime, both fighters are members of the Top Five Pound-for Pound list.
Garcia stretched out the right hand and said: "How do you, champion?
I wish you good luck. "
Lomachenko defends his belt against Miguel Marriaga on Saturday evening at 7 pm on ESPN.
When the couple posed for photos, Lomachenko-Manager Egis noted that a possible showdown between the fighters would be the "perfect magnitude."
"I am a former feather weight," recalled Garcia.
"I went up for Broner [to £140], but I'm not so big.
I am small for 140.
I would like to come down to light weight.
And he must move on light weighted [135 pounds] and then we fight.
That is what the fans are asking for.
Let us give them that. "
Lomachenko agreed.
'Boxes need this fight '.
Climate asked if it should be on Pay-per-View, part of a strategy that Lomachenko has to fight with a 135-pound debut this year Luke to agree next summer's clash with Garcia's Jorge Campbell weight 0.
"This fight could take place in pay-per-view mode, because all the fans asked for it," Garcia said and expressed himself openly later to fight in the network that offers the best financial package.
We are the best.
No other names can generate this kind of attention.
Whenever they are ready... "
Garcia said that he regarded Lomachenko as "an enormous fighter," and he might participate in his Saturday struggle.
But Lomachenko held on the generous praise for Garcia, saying that he thinks the Riverside triple-fight champion looks "very slowly, I'm sorry Mikey... you wanted the co-off."
Garcia said that the focus is to show impact, then boxing.
Both said they could feel the momentum that has been built up for their own struggle.
"This is the fight that must be carried out.
No other fight brings so much attention and enthusiasm.
I am more than happy to work on it, "said Garcia.
Lomachenko said: "I have been waiting for the top fighters, and that is Mikey.
It will be a great battle. "
Four injured after tyre burst
In the event of an accident on the A7, four people were seriously injured on Thursday
According to initial information, the driver of an Opel Zafira lost control of his vehicle at 4.30 p.m. shortly before the entry point MarktUNK, presumably after a tyre platzer.
The car moved to the right into the embankment, where it overcame and then remained on the roof in the green strip.
The four occupants - two adults and two children - were seriously injured in the accident.
During the initial supply of the injured by the rescue service, the A7 to the north was closed for about one hour, and the traffic on the left-hand lane could be passed by the accident site.
Fortunas Hoffmann: "Triple chain works better"
After 2: 2, Andre Hoffmann hopes to mark the start of the season against Braunschweig, that the optimisation of the defence formation will bring points to Aue.
With the first season game Andre Hoffmann was satisfied, with the result would not have been the two opposite at the 2: 2 against Braunschweig.
"These were two counter-sides too much, and we need to be even more careful in Aue," says Fortuna Düsseldorf's defense player.
In the Ore Mountains, the three chain is also to be further optimized.
And a gate after a free kick-off is no longer intended to catch up.
"For the future, it will be the case that no one will take the line alongside Michael (Rensing)."
Hoffmann is convinced that his team will be able to cope better with the tricycle even after the experience gained in the preparation process than with the four-fold chain.
"I still do not know how we will act in Aue," says his trainer Friedhelm Funkel, but Hoffmann is sure of his cause, "because we just said in the trierkette Hoffmann on the semi-positions in Kaan Ayhan and.
"It is a prerequisite, but that we should be even more harmonious and that we should not afford so many playing errors in the structure."
Of course Hoffmann also goes to Aue to win the game.
"But whether you can talk about a failed start after an undecided decision does not know.
The performance might well be okay, "said Hoffmann.
"If, however, we are able to find four points on Sunday and focus on poker, we will certainly be able to speak of a regular season start."
His trainer didn't want to know about this.
"I judge the start of the season only after six to eight days of playing," said Friedhelm Funkel, who does not want to speak of an advantage over Aue just because the game of Saxony in Heidenheim was aborted prematurely.
"Now they can start the season almost with a home game," Funkel and Hoffmann said that the players from Aue might even be a little fresher, as they don't have a heavy and complete game like Fortuna against a career favorite.
"But they do not know where they are at present 100%," says the defenders of Fortuna.
It is true that the guests from the Rhineland, as a light favourite on Sunday, will meet in the stadium of Aue, which is finally (almost) finished.
"The fact that we sweep them away just because we are entitled to be among the first six is nonsense," says Funkel, whose balance sheet is positive in only losing Aue from nine games.
"There is no team in the 2 Bundesliga that you have to beat from the outset," says Fortunas Chief coach.
"Making such a statement would be arrogant and arrogant."
And so Funkel doesn't want to see his players on Sunday.
New results of the Swedish Asylum Age Assessment Test published
The latest results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden, which have been subjected to a new method of medical assessment of their age, show that more than 80% of the people tested are over 18 years old, but not everyone believes in the accuracy.
The Swedish Forensian Medicine Authority (UNK tsmedicUNK verket) started the tests last year.
During the asylum procedure, they are intended to clarify the assessment of age after the Swedish Migration Agency (Migration Management Board) was criticised for errors in the assessment of the correct age of some refugees who were minors.
So far, Migration verket has sent out 6,880 cases to be tested, and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,481 tests from mid-March to July 31, 2017.
Eighty percent (2002) were assessed as 18 or older, while in a further 25 cases the Forensic Medicine Agency judged that the person was "possibly 18 years or older."
In 432 cases, the conclusion was that the person is "possibly under 18 years old."
The tests are only carried out in cases where the age of the person is questioned.
According to Johan Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency, the results are consistent in recent months.
"We see no big difference in statistics of recent months, the numbers are fairly constant," he said to the magazine The Local.
The high proportion of cases in which the person has been judged to be over 18 years does not necessarily mean that the asylum seeker has lied over his age.
In May, the Agency published the results of 581 tests and said that there were 442 cases "proposing that the person examined be 18 years or older."
When the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet looked at the 581 results published, it found that, in 243 of these cases, the person had frankly said that she would be 18 years old this year.
The method of medical age assessment, in which X-rays of wisdom teeth and MRI shots of knee joints are made, which are then analyzed by dentists and radiologists, has also been criticised in some areas.
A skeptic is the endocrinologist Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute, whose work involves the assessment of the biological maturity of humans to see whether they went through puberty sooner or later than usual.
"I had reason to think about it, and I do not think that the type of measurement should be used.
Judging biological age in this way is very uncertain.
If we cannot say it safely, we should not act as if we could, "he said to the newspaper Metro.
Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency, however, defended the accuracy of the tests: "In general, you can say that the risk of a child as an adult being wrongly judged is low.
The greatest risk is when the person is just under 18, in this case about 10%. "
Fully in the Plan
Work on the three bridges of road 108 between Lauterbach and Schramberg is progressing well.
On Wednesday, a seven-ton concrete section was installed at the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lauterbach.
"We are very good at the time, it is running super," says Reinhold Leicht, head of construction at the Department of Road and Transport in the Regional Bureau of Freiburg.
In April, the works began simultaneously on all three bridges in need of renovation between Schramberg and Lauterbach.
The end of the building is scheduled for October and it is a pity that the timetable will be adhered to.
The first bridge, coming from Schramberg, will take you over the Trombach.
It is a concrete vaulted bridge covered with red bunker stone and has a total length of 4.80 meters.
It was built in 1900.
Like the other two bridges, it has come into the years.
In order to ensure stability and road safety, the three buildings will now be thoroughly renovated.
The other two bridges lead over the Lauterbach.
They are made of red bunker stone.
Both were built in 1939 and are twelve, or 10,60 metres long.
The bridge at the entrance of Lauterbach on Wednesday morning on the northern side has now received a 1.30 m width and seven tons of so-called bridge cap.
This is a border fortification which is also used as an operating route.
On the southern part of the bridge a 2.20 meter wide bridge cap will be used on Friday.
Then the pedestrian path is to be followed.
The special feature is that these are finished parts, a patent of the Schramberger company Dizwo.
The other two bridges are already equipped with the patented bridge caps.
The construction of the building in Lauterbach requires a special touch of sensitivity.
There is also a fibre optic cable to which many companies are connected.
The residents were informed of the project in advance of the works by hand papers.
In addition, fish and crustaceans had to be fished first.
For the bridges between the building building of the building and the assembly yard in the direction of Schramberg, traffic is regulated by a traffic light.
For construction work at the bridge at the Lauterbacher UNK entrance, the street in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotels "Tannenhof" and "UNK Linden" is completely closed.
The cost of the three renovation operations amounts to a total of EUR 700 000.
It is financed by the country.
AFD in Gerolstein: Bunter UNK bei UNK elsalat
It is not so often the case that parties are pulling together, but when it comes to the alternative for Germany (AfD), they come together, which otherwise is difficult to reconcile.
The political parties represented in the UNK eifel UNK (CDU, SPD, UNK, FDP, FWG, UNK) are part of a broad alliance that shows peacefully flag on this day because the AfD campaign in the Gerolsteiner Stadthalle.
And well-known names - like Alice Weidel, who together with Alexander Gauland forms the top duo for the parliamentary election on September 24, and the deputy Federal President Beatrix of Storch.
But those who are already on site hours before the start of the event do not want to listen to AfD-Artists, but rather to UNK.
The motto "The Eifel remains colorful."
Originally, the city picnic was planned under the motto "All at one table" on the Brunnenplatz, but now takes place in the parking lot below the Rondells - and thus right in front of the city hall event.
A colorful picture that can be found here.
And what Christa Karoli, President of Forum One World and one of the relevant organizers, is really pleased about: "How many people have come together."
There is music and a lot of food, including a "German potato salad," which the AfD could easily eat, "says the woman who brought him with him.
The police have ordered many officials to Gerolstein, and they are also present at the train station, which is only a few metres away from the venues.
How did the AfD actually come on Gerolstein?
Mario Hompes reports from the AfD Volcanic Eifel that he has tried and won the event.
The 45-year-old from Gönnersdorf had initially asked for in Daun, but received a cancellation there, because due to the already built Laurentiuskirmes there were not enough parking spaces.
So now the Rondell, Hompes is pleased that "we can have such a nice event here."
Looking at the event at Rondellvorplatz, he says: "This is the good right of people, the main thing, it remains peaceful."
This is also the case: Around 20 o'clock a band provides entertainment on the Rondellvorplatz, in the Stadthalle several speakers, including the Rhineland-Palatinate AfD chairman Uwe UNK.
There are about 200 listeners in the Chamber who are waiting for the top candidate for the Bundestag election, Alice Weidel, and Deputy Federal President Beatrix of Storch to make their speeches.
The police presence is unchanged, but so far the officials have had a quiet evening.
The AfD event takes a little more than an hour, the guests on the first floor have a longer breath, but there is also a need to clean up shortly after 9 pm.
The police can stop - no special incidents.
Posaune meets trumpet
A relisten with the WolUNK Posaunisten Frederic Belli is available in the series Haslacher monastery concerts tomorrow, Sunday, at 8 pm in the monastery church.
Together with the Bulgarian Trompeter Miroslav Petkov, he presents a concert under the motto "Black Sea meets Black Forest," or even "Balkan folklore" meets a classical German education with roots in brass music.
Both soloists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and hold solo positions in top European orchestras.
Petkov is a solo trompeter at the renowned Concertgebouw Orchestra Amsterdam and Frederic Belli is the solo singer of the SWR Symphonic Orchestra.
Both combine the desire not only to cross the boundaries of their instruments, but also to merge the boundaries of different genres.
In this way Johann Sebastian Bach gets dressed in a new outfit, Daniel Schnyders "World Music" combines with Bulgarian folklore, and in the piece "Exchange Suite" of the UNK zechopreiUNK UNK, Nils Wogram.
This central part of the programme was premiered only this spring with huge success in Freiburg.
The renowned composer Nils Wogram wrote it especially for the two musicians and more: The Haslacher monastery church with its special acoustics is consciously included in the concert.
Kristen Stewart talks about her bisexuality
"Some people love grilled cheese and will eat it until the end of their life.
But I want to try it all, "says Kristen Stewart quite openly about her bisexuality.
"Once I bite in grilled cheese, I think: 'Oh that was cool, what comes next?'.
The best-known relationship of Hollywood star was that of her Twilight colleague Robert UNK inson, who ultimately went bitterly apart.
In spite of all this, the brünette actress assures the "Harper Valentine's Bazaar" magazine: "I was seriously in love with everyone I have recorded.
Or do you think I had played it? "
After her separation, Kristen admitted that she was bisexual: "I have always lived dualism and believed it seriously.
So I have never been confused or obstructed.
I never liked to be taken seriously. "
She was particularly affected by this, according to the "Bang Showbiz" but in school time, when she preferred to wear like a bub: "Not all girls are typical girls.
That really hurt me very badly.
When I was eleven, the children told me that I would look like a book.
I felt really attacked, frightened and ashamed.
Now I look back and think: 'Girls, be proud of you!'
She doesn't like to explain her love life to the public in particular: "People expect you to keep you in a certain way and that annoys me.
And perhaps some people call me thankless, but I do not like having to justify myself to the general public. "
West Virginia Governor announces that he will change the party
. The Democratic Governor of West Virginia, Jim Justice, announced in a rally with President Trump on Thursday evening that he would change the party.
Whether you like it or not, the democrats have moved away from me, "said Governor Justice.
"Today I will tell you with many prayers and much reflection... today, as a resident of West Virginia, I will tell you that I can no longer help you if I am a democratic governor."
The rally broke out in jubilation.
"Tomorrow I will change my registration to the Republicans," Justice added.
"As a trainer, I would say that it is time to play another game."
Mr. Trump promised a big announcement at the West Virginia Rally.
Mr. Trump won West Virginia with 42 points, and Justice did not endorse Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice, which, according to Forbes, is the only billionaire in the state, was elected in 2016
Forbes notes that he owns coal mines in five states, and inherited a coal business from his father.
It is worth about $1.59 billion.
In the meantime, on Thursday evening, the Republican National Committee issued a statement saying: "The party change of Governor Justice is another blow to a Democratic Party that would prevent us rather than work to make our country great again."
"With only 15 governors and control of the least legislative bodies in history, the announcement by Governor Justice is only the last rejection of a party that is from top to bottom without leadership and is unable to find a positive, unifying message to RNC.
Coe praises "honest" Russian apology for doping scandal
Sebastian Coe, the world leader in athletics, praised on Thursday what he described as an obvious apology from Russia for a doping scandal, but he repeated that it was not the moment for the country to be re-introduced into sport.
Russia's athletics chief Dmitry Shylakhtin said during the IAAF Congress on the eve of the World Championships in athletics that his country's exile from sport was correct and that he was determined to fight it.
He said he is sorry for "all athletes who have been picked up gold and silver medals in competitions."
Despite his comments, the IAAF Congress voted to maintain the ban imposed in November 2015, after a report by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) found evidence of state-sponsored doping in Russia.
"I thought it was a very open answer today, a very honest presentation," said IAAF President Coe to reporters.
"The entire Council and Congress were pleased that the Russian Federation itself recognized that it had experienced some rather hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is reorganised."
Coe said that he was also "pleased" that Russia accepted the criteria for its reintroduction.
"I think it was a very constructive day and I think that progress has been made, but Congress supports the recommendations of the Task Force that this is not the time to re-establish Russia," Coe said.
"We need to do everything we can in the coming months to normalise this situation.
The guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the degraded system, "he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes will compete as neutral players at the World Athletics Championships, which will start in London on Friday, according to the stringent IAAF criteria.
On Monday, the Chief Executive of the IAAF Task Force, Rune Andersen, said that Russia still had to meet some of the criteria for re-establishment.
Drug tests are still insufficient and banned trainers are still free to operate, he said reporters in London after a lecture at the IAAF Council.
Mourning ceremony for soldiers who have fallen down in Mali
At a funeral in Fritzlar in northern Hessen, around 1000 people thought of the two soldiers killed in a helicopter crash in Mali.
The ceremony took place on Thursday in the Domstadt under high security conditions.
On the outstanding issue of the crash, Defence Minister Ursula von der Leyen (CDU) said nothing.
However, she described the two successful pilots as "experts of their profession."
"We bow to the highest sacrifice they have made on behalf of the Federal Republic of Germany," she said.
The 33-year-old Major and the 47-year-old North Hessen Staff Captain died on Wednesday a week ago in West African Mali.
Her coffins were transferred to Germany and on Thursday she was taken to the Fritzlarer Dom Sankt Peter by the Bundeswehr's death guard.
At noon, only the relatives in the church took farewell.
After that, the funeral began in the circle of the family, the closest friends, representatives of the Bundeswehr and politicians.
Hessens Prime Minister Volker Bouffier (CDU) and the General Inspectorate of the Bundeswehr Volker Wieker were among them.
Guests of mourning laid down roses, the relatives stood arm by the coffins.
In front of the church, Fritzlarer and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on a canvas.
Defense Minister of the Leyen called the ousted soldiers "highly decorated" and invaded.
The UNK ptmann was one of the first six Tiger Tiger Tiger Tiger pilots trained in his administration.
Volker Bauersachs, commander of the regiment to which the soldiers belong, also said: "If this crew could not turn its back on the crash, no one would have been able to do so."
Doubts about the UN mission in Mali did not emerge from Minister von Leyen: The mission was dangerous.
But it is also of great importance "for a country from which we are separated only by two states," she said.
After the funeral, the coffins were taken out of the cathedral.
When and where they are provided, the Bundeswehr did not provide any information about this.
Prince Henrik does not want a grave next to his wife
The man of the Danish Queen Margrethe (77), Prince Henrik (83), does not want to be buried next to his wife after his death.
That was what the Royal House announced on Thursday.
Traditionally, the Danish Königspaar is buried in the Domkirche of Roskilde.
The sculptor Bjørn Nørgaard already produced a sarcophagus for the two.
The Queen agreed with the decision of her husband, as stated in the communication.
Where Prince Henrik is buried is still unclear.
However, he does not intend to be buried in his home country in France.
Prince Henrik had never made a secret of the fact that he was not happy with his title
After joining his wife in 1972, he would have liked to become king.
In 2016, he retired, also earning the title "PrinzUNK hl."
Since Henrik in Denmark did not get the title and function he wanted, he did not consider himself equal to his wife - even after death, Lene Balleby, the chief spokeswoman of the Danish Royal House, explained.
Where the last 83-year-olds' resting place will ultimately be, is not yet clear.
However, he does not intend to be buried in his home country in France, but in Denmark.
He likes the country for which he has worked over the last 50 years.
In 1965, the son of a French noble family, Henri de Laborde de de Monpezat, was born in London.
He worked at the Thames in the French Embassy.
During his later wife, Prince Henrik had a difficult stand with the Danes in his nearly 50-year reign.
In a autobiography, Henrik said for the first years in Denmark: "A few months after my arrival, everything I did was criticised.
My Danish was pregnant, I preferred wine instead of beer, silk stockings instead of knitting socks, Citroën instead of Volvo, tennis instead of football.
Even for the Gauloises, which I smothered in place of Virginia tobacco and which in my country had the reputation of being the brand of society-critical intellectuals, I could not hope for indulgence.
I was different.
I seemed to be satisfied with this position and not ashamed.
These were two errors! "
Prime Minister Weil calls for rapid re-election
CDU and FDP before possible majority in Lower Saxony
After losing the red-green majority of the government, Lower Saxony's prime minister, Stephan Weil (SPD), is in favour of a rapid re-election of the country day, but he does not want to resign.
Because, on Friday, we were in favour of the dissolution of Parliament.
Prior to this, the surprising departure of a Green MEP from her regional group in Lower Saxony had plunged the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) into a severe crisis.
Five months before the official election date, the red-green coalition in Hannover lost its narrow one-vote majority in parliament to the opposition from the CDU and the FDP.
The former Green MEP Elke TUNK justified her move with the non-nomination for the 2018 election in her constituency in Rotenburg (UNK mme).
"I see my political future in the CDU," she explained on Friday in Hannover.
CDU Chairman Björn Thümler wants to recommend his group to accept them.
The CDU and the FDP together would have 69 seats in Lower Saxony's Landtag, the SPD and the Green Party 68 seats.
So far, the relationship has been reversed.
The new country day will be elected regularly on 14 January next year.
Thümler said that the red-green state government must now decide whether it can continue to govern in this situation without a majority.
However, Stephan Weil considers it essential that the country's day should decide on its own resolution as soon as possible.
The CDU Group is expected to decide on how to proceed on Tuesday.
The state constitution also provides for the possibility that the country day will deprive the Prime Minister of confidence and elect a successor.
"Our Constitution offers several options.
These possibilities must be examined in a legally correct manner, "Thümler said.
"We will be able to discuss all the issues calmly when they have been looked at in a legally reasonable way."
Thümler called TweUNK Step "but something strange."
The politician himself stressed: "I am not a traitor.
I feel very good. "
She referred to herself as a follower of black-green.
The Greens called for the breakaway MPs to return their country-day mandate.
"We assume, of course, that they will give back their country day mandate, which they have received through the green country list, with immediate effect," announced state leaders Meta Janssen-Kucz and Stefan Körner.
The Chairman of the Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance, Anja Piel, said: 'We very much regret the decision of Elke TUNK'.
She has deliberately chosen not to hold a debate in the group.
"Even in the light of the fact that there were no differences in content, we cannot understand this step."
The Social Democratic Party's candidate, Martin Schulz, condemns the transfer of the Lower Saxony Green MEP Elke TUNK to the CDU as a betrayal.
"The behaviour of former Green MEPs in Lower Saxony is not only a betrayal of voters, but also a betrayal of the Red-Green," wrote the Federal Social Democrat Chief on Facebook on Friday.
He supported the decision by Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) to re-elect the country's day quickly.
The exit tweUNK costs red-green in Lower Saxony the majority.
The politician says "in her wounded vanity and in her frustration her personal interests ahead of the country's well-being," criticized SPD Secretary General Hubertus Heil.
"It is a scandal that the CDU in Lower Saxony is playing this dirty intrigue game and trying to capitalize on it."
Niedersachsens CDU Chairman Björn Thümler wants to recommend to his members that Elke TUNK be admitted to the CDU.
Thomas Oppermann, the leader of the Social Democratic Party (SPD), accused TUNK of distorting the result of the 2013 rural election with personal career thinking.
The CDU was the strongest party before the SPD, but the Social Democratic Party and the Green Party had a razor-thin majority of one vote in the country's parliament.
Agriculture Minister interview - How do we protect ourselves from gifteiern, Mr Schmidt?
Germany is discussing contaminated eggs.
How could the scandal happen?
How can consumers protect themselves.
Agriculture Minister Christian Schmidt (CSU) is in interview with the editorial network Germany (RND).
Mr Schmidt, how can the consumer protect himself from poisoned eggs?
I can only encourage all consumers to take a close look at the eggs in your fridge and check the stamp print.
On the consumer protection portal www.UNK UNK UNK ung.de, the Länder provide the latest information on the affected eggs.
Affected eggs should be destroyed or returned.
Even if, according to everything we know at the moment, there is virtually no risk to health.
Does Aldi now take on the best possible crisis response - all eggs out of the supply - because the central role of the reconnaissance is not really perceived by the Federal Minister for Agriculture?
Food monitoring is the responsibility of the Länder.
Despite this, my House has got up immediately and has been in close contact with the authorities of the countries since it became known that Germany was suffering.
All information and risk assessment are available to consumers.
Trade, like manufacturers, must ensure that the products sold are marketable and do not pose any health risks.
If eggs exceed the maximum residue limit of 0,005mg / kg, they will not be marketable.
Uncontaminated eggs can, however, be sold and consumed.
This time it is not the companies that are to blame.
Are production companies and consumers in the same boat?
According to current information, production companies are not directly to blame.
On the contrary, they are liable to suffer economic damage due to the alleged illegal practices of service providers.
As always, in the event of an emergency, there are too few inspectors.
Is there only a lack of staff or of coherent competence?
It was precisely the official controls that revealed the operation.
The truth is, however, that food fraud and criminal energy can never be excluded 100%.
It is precisely for this reason that it is essential to ensure that these events are properly investigated and handed over to the public prosecutor's offices in cases where criminal offences may be committed.
I have already made it clear on several occasions that I expect the authorities responsible to provide full information.
Is the regular alarm in food scandals really necessary?
Consumers have the right to receive only safe and marketable food.
When an unauthorised insecticide is used in the food industry, consumers are rightly outraged.
The money that has been adulterated has put producers, traders and consumers in a situation that is absolutely unnecessary.
As a matter of principle, it must be clear that the illegal use of insecticide Fipronil in the keeping of food-producing animals is unacceptable and must be stopped immediately.
This needs to be worked on consistently and with high pressure at all levels.
I expect all the competent authorities to ensure that the facts are swiftly and fully investigated.
The impact of football's financial rules on Neymar's move to Paris
The rules aimed at preventing unimpeded spending by European football clubs will not interfere with Neymar's world record transfer from Spanish Barcelona to French Paris-Saint Germain.
There will be some consequences for Paris Saint-Germain of UEFA, because the governing organisation that has monitored the European game has the power to ban teams from accessing the prestigious Champions League tournament.
Financial fair-play rules, launched by UEFA in 2011, mean that PSG will eventually have to prove that the transfer of Neymar was funded without major losses.
Barcelona has paid EUR 222 million ($262 million) to buy the Brazilian out of its contract, and Neymar will receive a salary of several ten million dollars a year.
Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymar's move to France.
PSG can certainly make money available so that Neymar signs it and puts it into a galaxy of other stars, given the funding of the team by the Qatar ruling family, rich in energy.
Clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money on acquiring players, but they have to deal with legitimate sources of revenue that enable them to break the corner in their football-related business.
FFP was designed by Michel Platini after his election as UEFA President in 2007.
The former French player believed that clubs that had incurred huge debts in their quest for success were effectively cheating and risking to ruin themselves when banks or owners withdrew their support.
In 2011, FFP shifted from focusing on clubs "debts to monitoring their losses.
The change meant that the business model that Roman Abramovich originally used in Chelsea in 2003 - bought a club with potential and then invested heavily to improve the team and build a global brand - should become a tougher issue.
During the current three-year FFP programming period, which runs until 2018, clubs can accept losses of €30 million.
And, although Platini fell out of favor by the presidency in 2015, his UEFA successor, Aleksander Ceferin, continues to advocate discouraging excessive spending.
"Certainly FFP is not dead and we will certainly strengthen the rules for the future," said Andrea Traaning, who is responsible for FFP at UEFA, vis-à-vis The Associated Press last week.
Although the PSG has paid the Neymar buy-out in a lump sum, it may distribute the amount for the accounts for the duration of its contract.
Neymar has signed a five-year contract, which will allow the transfer rate of EUR 44.4 million to be entered in the annual accounts for the next five years.
The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 hit the PSG, together with Abu Dhabi, which is owned by Manchester City, with the most severe sanctions.
The PSG received a fine of €60 million (then $82 million), which was later reduced to €20 million - and ordered team members to remain limited to 21 for the Champions League of the season 2014 / 15 otherwise.
UEFA is looking for clubs that could try to overlist their financial supervision by inflating their revenues from companies associated with the owners of a club.
While a Catalan company could sponsor PSG if the value of sponsorship were to exceed the standard market rates, UEFA would not consider this to be a legitimate income.
This was exactly what happened in 2014, when UEFA decided that the value of PSA's sponsorship was inflated by the Qatar Tourism Authority.
It has been reported that part of the PSG payments to Neymar could be made by the organizing committee of the World Cup 2022 in Qatar.
But PSG and Qatar 2022 have denied that Neymar will become World Cup ambassadors, and that such maneuvers for UEFA regulators could be easy to find out.
The sanctions against PSG thus far mean that UEFA will be even more attentive to any attempt to circumvent the rules.
UEFA had no preliminary discussions with PSG about Neymar's transfer, and on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation were told.
They spoke to The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity, as they were not authorised to discuss the PSG situation.
The latest published reports show that PSG has achieved a profit of more than €10 million in 2015 / 16 with a turnover of €542.4 million.
The accounts for the last fiscal year have yet to be published.
PSG expects Neymar's arrival to be a blessing for sponsorship deals, merchandising, and tricot sales.
The association assumes that sales will increase by at least 30 percent after the signature.
The Spanish League was clearly irritated to see one of the best football players going, and it tried to prevent Neymar's move by claiming that PSG would violate the FFP.
"It is a clear case of" financial doping "with the club and the state," said the president of the La League, Javier Tebas, the Spanish daily AS in relation to Qatar's ultimate ownership of PSG.
Arsenal Manager Arsene Wenger, whose club is owned by an American sports tycoons, shares the reservations of La Liga against a state that finances an association.
"It is the consequence of ownership and that has completely changed the entire football landscape over the last 15 years," Wenger said on Thursday.
"As soon as a country has an association, everything is possible.
It will be very difficult to respect financial fair play because you can go different ways or have different interests when a country has such a big player to represent a country. "
Swiss is looking for a new supplier of chocolate.
In recent years UNK at Frey has been producing aboard chocolate for Swiss.
Now the southern cooperation is coming to a possible end: The airline resigns the contract.
Swiss spokeswoman Meike Fuhlrott confirmed on request of the news agency sda a corresponding report from the newspaper "UNK UNK" of Friday.
According to current planning, the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018.
The products would be checked every two to three years and subject to quality control.
"We are very satisfied with the current supplier UNK at Frey," said the spokeswoman.
Around 17 million small rotary-white cup boards of 14 grams distribute each year the cabin crew before landing to passengers.
The Swiss did not want to provide any information about the costs.
Industry experts estimate the order volume according to "northwestern Switzerland" at CHF 1.5 to 2 million - the Migros subsidiary generates annual sales of around CHF 1 billion.
But the advertising effect is more important: For a chocolate manufacturer, it is a prestigious order.
The Swiss does not want to reveal how many candidates there are in the new call for tenders.
However, only Swiss manufacturers are eligible.
According to the newspaper report, UNK at Frey wants to renew the contract beyond the spring of 2018.
For the sda, the largest Swiss chocolate manufacturer could not be contacted for an opinion.
Since 2006, Swiss chocolate panels have been distributed on board their flights.
Before Swiss entered into a contract with Migros's daughter, Barry Callebaut, in cooperation with Hug, supplied the chocolate tablets.
The opportunity to place the logo was introduced two and a half years ago with the start of the cooperation with UNK at Frey.
The airline works with various Swiss chocolate producers.
On long-haul flights, First Class customers will be treated with treats from the Confiserie UNK gli, in Business Class nake passengers Schoggi from Lindt and in Economy Class Schoggi from UNK at Frey.
Swiss Schoggi is also distributed on the short run by UNK at Frey, both in Business and Economy Class.
Athletics - Diskus Olympic Champion Robert Harting reaches World Cup finals
The three world champion fights for a medal on Saturday in the final.
His brother Christoph, Olympic champion of 2016, failed in the national World Cup decision and could only look at the Diskus competition from the grandstand.
Also with the first attempt, Polish title defender Piotr Malachowski, who threw 65.13 meters far, qualified for the final fight.
Nostalgia goes into "Wet Hot American Summer" and "Comrade Detective" into the niche.
This repetition of the story is nostalgic at the same time for the glorious days of the Amy characters of the 80 "s, for the 90-year-grunge era (as the protagonists David Wain and Michael Showalter called themselves).
As a cultural artifact, it is also a parody and a embodiment of our Facebook-enabled era of permanent memories.
But as a franchise, it feels like time is running out.
"First Day of Camp" worked surprisingly well, not only because of its absurd humors (it contained an original story for a speaking high-class vegetables, which was spoken by H. Jon Benjamin).
By climbing up to the core of the gags - actors of middle age play horny children who are grown up - they nevertheless managed to get the last part of the joke back.
"Ten Years Later," with his adults who are now playing adults, is less emotionally rooted, and his parody goes more like a scattering edge, including a riff on the stalker films of the 90 "s.
At one point, a character strolls through an Apple Powerbook, some inline skates and "a series of other things from 1991."
Many of the central stories are the same.
The lovely Coop (Mr. Showalter), now novelist, has still not forgotten Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) has still not lost his virginity.
And there is another crazy-evil plot in which Ronald Reagan (including Mr. Showalter) is involved, which is now supported by George H. W. Bush (a good impression of Michael Ian Black).
As always, the Excursions are the best part of the franchise.
It is especially fun to see the ever-young Mr. Rudd, who shows Matt Dillons of "singles," whose former Big Man-on-Camp Andy now feels like an old boy.
It is the moments of random madness that could heat up this franchise like a kind of repetitive "Seven Up!" Series until he achieves what I assume to be his logical conclusion: "Wet American Summer Twenty."
"Comrade Detective" on Amazon now recalls a different kind of nostalgia: The revival of the Cold War of "The Americans," the film "Atomic Blonde" and even "GLOW" with his West.
The comedy created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka with Rhys Thomas as a director states to be a found TV series: A Romanian drama of the 1980s with the two policemen as friends, two officers from Bucharest fighting for truth.
The main trolls - a hard-headed Gregor and an idealistic Iosef - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu ulici, whose dialogues are dubbed by Channing Tatum (also an executive producer) and Joseph.
It is a brilliant idea.
But it is not much more than an idea.
There are some nice gags to watch (the police spend the time watching chess on television, as Americans may do with football).
And the list of famous speakers - including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali, and Chloë Sevigny - provides a decent game "Find out the Voice."
But "Comrade Detective" is so committed to the truthfulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a killer wearing a Reagan mask is involved - that it often plays like a single.
In six long episodes, the comedy is not fast or frequent enough.
"Comrade Detective," which was edited for a smaller length, could deliver his Agitprop satire better, as Gregor and Iosef keep visiting the American embassy, whose lobby is always occupied by two big hamburgers.
The message for the imagined Communist audience is that Western culture can make everything to feed for money.
The fictitious Romanian creators were not wrong: We do it even with our own recent history and with theirs.
Strike against drugs mafia in the country
The police have succeeded in striking a blow against the Italian mafia in Baden-Württemberg
On Wednesday morning, numerous objects were searched in the Black Forest-Baar-Kreis, in Rottweil, Konstanz, Esslingen and Stuttgart, as the public prosecutor, Konstanz, announced on Friday.
15 accused persons aged between 25 and 77 have been arrested and arrest warrants against them have already been issued.
In addition, officials ensured larger quantities of marijuana and cocaine, firearms and several hundred thousand euros.
Two people were arrested in Italy during a simultaneous raid.
There were German arrest warrants against the two suspects of Italy.
The two are therefore likely to be delivered to Germany.
The operation involved Italian and Bavarian investigators.
In total, more than 300 police officers were deployed.
The members of the mafia are accused of organised drug crime, serious acts of violence, attempted murder, robbery and blackmail.
Since the summer of 2016, the Prosecutor's Office of Konstanz has been investigating drug trafficking in southern Germany.
Between the prosecutors in Konstanz and Palermo there was an intense exchange and the investigators of the Kripo Rottweil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily.
Therefore, the large-scale operation was accompanied by four officials from Palermo on Wednesday morning.
The investigation focused in particular on Italian nationals with close ties to the Italian mafia.
Also an incident on May 27 in Hüfingen, at which several shots were fired early in the morning into a restaurant, should go to the account of the gang.
How to complain about large gaps in the register of foreigners
"Data from citizens who should not appear": According to a report, the register of foreigners has serious shortcomings in Germany.
This leads to some serious errors in asylum procedures.
According to a media report, the Federal Government's Refugee Management Officer, Frank-Jürgen UNK, has drawn attention to large gaps in the immigrant central register.
Shortcomings in the data recorded there could lead to "sometimes serious wrong decisions" in asylum procedures and deportations, warned way in an analysis presented by the "Süddeutsche Zeitung."
According to the Register, 10 million people of foreign nationality are included, including some 5.7 million from non-EU countries.
The data will therefore be managed by some 600 foreign authorities in Germany.
Because the data had not been sufficiently maintained, the quality of the data had not been good in some respects.
In individual cases, data from 1921 had been found, "from people who have long since ceased to be alive, or from citizens who have become German citizens and who should no longer appear in the register."
"Incorrect data entries can significantly slow down return processes," the report states.
In addition, the statistics on people who travel outside the EU cover EU citizens who do not have to leave.
Such false attribution, however, "led to" a distorted debate on the handling of exit persons, "so it is stated in the analysis.
Meanwhile, the Federal Government appears to have started sending refugee families with children under 16 years of age back to Italy when they arrived from there.
This emerges from an internal paper from the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF), reports the "Neue OsnabUNK er Zeitung."
The paper therefore states that the BAMF will carry out such procedures "concerning families with children - with the exception of infants and small children - after Italy since 1 June 2017."
This has been virtually impossible since the end of 2014, according to the newspaper, referring to the difficult situation on the ground.
Under the Dublin Agreement, refugees are the responsibility of the EU State which they reach first.
If a migrant travels to another EU country, that country can return him to the country of entry.
As a justification, the Office now writes: "In the meantime, the absorption capacity for families with under-age children in Italy has increased substantially."
Italy has provided guarantees for the reception and accommodation of families.
Even the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) considers these commitments sufficient.
Other EU countries would also send refugees back there under the Dublin Agreement.
The internal speaker of the left-wing faction in the Bundestag, Ulla Jelpke, criticised this decision: "Families with children are at risk of receiving conditions that are contrary to human rights and endangering the best interests of the child."
Second best result achieved
A total of 220 litres of blood from people living in Oberreichenbach has already been provided by the blood donation service for other people.
At least of the twelve citizens who received the award on Friday.
Especially Jürgen Greule, who now shared 50 litres of blood with his 100 donations.
Traditionally, at the municipal council meeting, the municipality acknowledges the multiple willingness to donate blood.
"It is brilliant how our body is designed for this, and we pay tribute to donors who make their blood available to strangers, and also selfishly," stressed Mayor Karlheinz Kistner.
"A single blood donation helps several people," explained Holger UNK enbacher, the German Red Cross's director of the district council, for the preserves are broken down into their constituents.
Three people could already benefit from blood donation.
At the same time UNK enbacher reported about the actions that will be carried out in Oberreichenbach in the spring.
"This year, with 114 donors, we achieved the second best result," said the head of the DRC.
Obviously, a few years ago, the change to the theatre house led to higher numbers of participants.
Before that, Thomas Bockstadt, Susanne Reichle, Sandra Schöck, Thomas Reichle and Meta Umbeer were among the multiple donors and received an award for 50 blood donations each.
Half as many score Herbert Mair and Dorothee Riexinger, while Tamara Pfrommer, Petra Schleeh, Stefanie Stoll and Uwe Vetter ten times a 500 millilitres of their lifeline.
The Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged, after weak economic growth and a weakening of inflation have dampened speculation about an increase.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain "sluggish" when it maintained interest rates on family incomes in the midst of growing pressure.
The Bank's Monetary Committee (MPC) leaders voted with 6 to 2 to keep interest rates to 0.25%, with fewer members seeking to increase this month, as weak economic growth weakened support.
In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank reduced its growth forecasts to 1.7% in 2017 and 1.6% in 2018, warning that the pressure on household incomes would continue, with inflation expected to rise to close to 3% in the autumn.
But they signaled that, in the coming years, interest rate hikes would be needed to rein in Brexit-fueled inflation, and they said that borrowing costs might have to rise more than expected in financial markets.
Members also voted to withdraw part of the mammoth stimulus package issued a year after Brexit.
It will demand time for the financing plan to provide cheaper funding for banks from next February, although it has been said that it is now expected to provide GBP 15 billion more under this system - £115 billion.
Minutes after the interest rate decision, the Bank said: "In the MPC's central forecast, gross domestic product (GDP) remains weak in the short term, as pressure on real household incomes continues to weigh on consumption."
On interest rates, she reiterated that "a certain tightening of monetary policy" would be needed to cool inflation and a "slightly larger" extent than markets expect.
Markets are currently forecasting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020.
However, the Bank stressed that increases would be "gradual" and "limited."
The Bank's downward-revised growth forecasts for this year and next year are compared to the 1.9% and 1.7% forecast in May.
It has maintained its growth forecast to 1.8% in 2018.
The pound fell after this news against the dollar and the euro.
The pound fell by 0.5% to USD 1.31 and fell by 0.4% to EUR 1.11.
The decision does not change after the recent disappointing growth figures have dampened rising expectations for a rate hike, and GDP has risen from 0.2% in the second quarter to 0.3% in the preceding three months.
Growth is expected to be 0.3% in the third quarter, although the bank is expected to recover slightly towards the end of the year.
The recent inflation report offered little enthusiasm for households, which will be affected by rising inflation and slight salary increases, as the tightening will get worse first, before it will improve.
She added that monetary policy cannot "prevent" the income drop in the next few years, "but she added that wages will" recover significantly "at the end of their three-year forecast.
The economy is also strengthened by rising demand for British goods, owing to the weak pound, which will compensate for some of the lower consumption spending.
The decision comes one year after the fall in interest rates to 0.25% last August, following the shocking EU vote that caused the pound to fall.
The Bank estimates that it will probably take four years for this to reach prices and the economy in full.
Before the Bank's recent interest-rate judgment, the call for an increase in interest rates increased, as inflation increased pressure on hard-pressed households, with three policymakers demanding an increase to 0.5% in July.
Inflation fell last month from 2.9% in June to 2.6%, although the Bank said that this was expected and that it would pick up again in the coming months.
The Bank said that the excess relative to its 2% target was "entirely" attributable to the weak pound.
Andrew Montlake, Director at Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: "Given the recent decline in swap rates, the mortgage market is likely to become more competitive, as lenders are clamoring for business and want to end the year.
The market looks particularly good for those with existing deals coming to an end and new mortgages, and many with freephone options and low rates are becoming more and more popular. "
NHS (The National Health Service) is expected to prescribe 10,000 controversial HIV drug
Patients will have access to a "transformative" HIV prevention treatment as of September, following a fight before the High Court against funding the drug in the NHS.
NHS England announced that a pre-intercourse pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), which can reduce the risk of infection in high-risk patients by about 86 percent, is now supplied by the health service for a first three-year.
He agreed to finance the process after last year's Court of Appeal confirmed a ruling by the Supreme Court that the NHS had the power to pay for the PrEP, despite the claim that local authorities should finance it.
The action announced on Thursday was welcomed by NHS UK boss Simon Stevens as "important new intervention," whereas the National AIDS Trust (NAT) called this "decisive moment."
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool, and Sheffield will be among the first to allow people to register, and more clinics will follow in October, before it will be introduced throughout England in April 2018.
Preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a consequence of HIV preparations taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
Studies have shown that PrEP significantly reduces HIV transmission in case of infection risks.
Taking prep before intercourse means that just enough drugs are present in a person's body to prevent an HIV infection.
Such drugs can be taken every day or even two hours before sexual intercourse.
Among those eligible for treatment are gay or bisexual men, transsexuals and people with HIV-positive partners who have not been successfully treated.
Clinics identify suitable participants who agree with the study, including men, women, transgender and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by antiretroviral treatment.
People who live in England and are registered with a family doctor can also register for possible participation in their local participating sex clinic.
The programme will be £10 million and NHS England signed a contract to deliver drugs this week after an international competitive procurement.
The study will assess the full potential of PrEP by gathering clinical evidence on how it is used, absorbed, and implemented on a large scale.
Stevens said: "This great new intervention should complement and overtake the far-reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV.
It is another milestone in more than three decades of sustained progress in addressing one of humanity's biggest health challenges. "
Deborah Gold, Chief Executive of NAT (National AIDS Trust), said: "This is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV.
Prep, if targeted at needy and vulnerable people, offers the opportunity to change the English HIV epidemic.
From September onwards, people with high HIV risk will have access to this NHS-financed experiment in England to develop a new instrument that is truly individually controlled and not subject to negotiation with a partner, which will improve many lives.
We warmly welcome this announcement. "
Ian Green, CEO of Terrence Higgins Trust, said: "The priority must now be that the study is carried out quickly throughout the country and that no one who has a risk to HIV is left behind.
Now that the PrEP Test Medicine has been obtained, we are on track to protect more than 10,000 people infected with HIV. "
Sharon Hodgson, Minister for Health, said: "The start of the PrEP process is welcome and overdue after months of delays and slow government implementation.
The evidence shows how transformative this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and can stop the transmission of this life-changing infection.
This attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the benefits of PrEP.
Now it is important that this study is carried out as soon as possible throughout the country to protect people who are HIV-infected and that it will help us move closer to bringing an end to the spread of HIV in society.
Living the big life: Mezzanine and clever designer tricks have transformed this little Earls Court apartment into a generous home.
Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, fell from a large house in Knightsbridge to an Earls Court apartment in 2014.
It is located on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Joanne has not packed and sold her bags.
"Before that, I lived in a much larger room with my ex in Knightsbridge," says Joanne.
"I was looking for something that was comparable to my price.
I was shown this apartment in Earls Court and it had the same high ceilings.
I fell in love with her and made an offer on that day. "
Since the first visit, the 1,000 square foot large apartment has been completely overhauled.
Originally a one-room property with a nested layout - you had to walk through the kitchen to get to the bedroom - Joanne wanted to add storage space and an mezzanine to make the most of the generous ceiling height.
"I wanted high ceilings, large windows, lots of light.
That was my request, "she says.
To this end, she commissioned the architecture and design studio Duck & Shed of Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill to use the foot 12.5 high ceilings and to create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live.
The ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms above each other, so the architectural challenge was to create an mezzanine where one could stand.
Erfan had to think creatively to solve the preset.
"The steel mill is quite complicated," he explains.
"We had to arrange the rooms in such a way that they were stacked over each other without us having to walk.
It was not just a question of building a simple platform, but of putting steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below. "
This arrangement allowed Erfan to place two rooms in full height - with much additional drama.
For the mezzanine, a classic copper window from Retrouvius looks down over the glamorous living area.
Mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program.
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre, space and light.
At both ends, a short corridor is mirrored to let it work longer.
In the kitchen, the mirror feels like a window in another room.
At the entrance, mirrored units offer space for all cutlery and glasses of Joanne.
By perceiving a more glamorous space, the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used.
Folding kitchens are nothing new.
The special thing about this is that it is a garage door.
"A bit of engineering went into it," Erfan explains from the steel reinforced MDF door.
"It is important in reverse, so that when you push the door up, it glides very easily."
Thanks to the clever use of space and storage space, Joanne was able to gain an additional 16 m ², an additional bedroom and an improved layout.
"At the end of the day you will sell the base area - or how your property is appreciated," says Erfan.
"In a rudimentary form, a real estate agent will enter and carry out a calculation based on land size."
Here they have managed to increase the floor area and at the same time use high-quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage.
"The materials are the things that touch you and therefore help to create an emotional bond in a home," says Erfan.
"You do not fall into the electric sockets in the walls.
These are important, but they do not play with your heart. "
It shows that a flat can be transformed by a good design and an increased square meter of something by default into something quite amazing.
Indeed, like Joanne, you could decide not to leave them.
Brothers fight for $500 million in real estate empire
Two brothers, four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty, are engaged in a dispute over one of the largest property empires in Victorias, worth more than $500 million.
Former Director of the Carlton Football Club and developer Colin De LUTIS lives in a villa in Toorak, only three doors away from his younger brother, Paul, who has brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify.
Paul wanted to withdraw from the family business since 2014, but a sharp dispute about separation is taking place in the Supreme Court.
Together with her mother Anna, the brothers own 38 real estate worth more than half a billion dollars, accumulated since the family bought a business at Smith Street, Collingwood, in 1973.
There, the Westco UNK family founded and grew into a chain of 160 retail stores.
It was sold in 1999 for USD 85 million.
This money has been invested in real estate and the portfolio of De LUTIS now includes offices in the city centre, the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento, the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller and shopping centres in the suburbs.
According to an agreement with her late father, Colin - described by Paul as "the main operator and the dominant personality" in the De LUTIS family - owns about two-thirds of the company's assets and Paul about one-third.
A file of law states that this means that Colin's property is worth $316 million and Paul owns $176 million.
The division of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul.
"The divisions proposed by Colin left him with what I thought was the best objects," he wrote in 2015 in a first Affidavit.
Last Friday, after several failed mediation, the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place.
The brothers are now also fighting for control of the existing business - of which Colin, as Paul claims, has ruled out.
Colin argues that this is not true, but Paul argues that some properties are under incompetent management.
In an early Affidavit submitted by Colin, he says he hopes to settle the dispute.
"My Italian legacy prescribes that the family is the most important priority," he wrote.
The cost increases in the case, with hundreds of pages of Affidavits, e-mails and reports from companies, including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and leading lawyers including Allan Myers, QC.
Mrs De LUTIS and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated milk bars and delicatessen shops from the late 1950 "s and bought a business in Brunswick in the early 1970s.
They took advantage of the security to buy the Collingwood property, which opened Colin the first jealous shop of the family.
Colin says that he started Westco there when he was "high school in my last years, when Paul was still a small child (about 10 years old)."
Anna De LUTIS says that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to pass on their property amicably to their sons.
"Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to end up in court," she wrote.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De LUTIS group, with Colin claiming that Mark was paid 10 million dollars when leaving the company and Luke 26 million dollars.
According to Paul, both Lukas and Mark have become bitterly embittered about the conditions of their financial separation. "
Colin was very reluctant, although he was a former AFL member of the board and was the best friend of the TV star after a 2015 biography by Eddie McGuire.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De LUTIS and their lawyers.
Only Colin replied by SMS to say "I really can't say much," because the case is before the courts.
"It is very, very sad that my brother Paul has decided to sue me and to draw our surname through the courts," he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote in a letter to the General Court that he had tried to satisfy his brother's demands.
"Our father would not have wanted Paul and I to end in our current dispute," he said and added that he "still hope for a solution."
On Friday, this hope seemed to be over.
"Our matter will be resolved by the courts in the near future," Colin wrote.
Trump's new chief of staff is planning to reduce the president's media abstinence.
Others tried it and failed.
Perhaps John F. Kelly can actually do so.
If so, it will be the first.
Politico reports that the White House's new chief of staff is planning to restrict the flow of information to President Trump - including news media reports - in the hope of keeping the boss on a more even course.
Here is a play by Reporters Josh Dawsey:
"When John F. Kelly, the White House's new chief of staff, met senior officials on his first working day, he posed a major problem in President Donald Trump's White House, which he intended to repair: Poor information that was in his hands.
Kelly told employees that information about him should flow, whether on paper or in briefings, because the president would make better decisions if he were given good information. "
Waiter's diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to tame Trump by watching his media diet.
President Trump's relationship with television goes back decades - and now that he is in the White House, his television advertising is still strong.
"If candidate Trump was angry about unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he received fair reporting from positions that were to be persuaded," said former campaign adviser Sam Nunberg in February to Politico.
Policy Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that "the key to keeping Trump's Twitter habit under control, according to six former campaign officials, is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a constant praise price."
Okay.
But the idea that Trump's Twitter habit was ever "under control" is ridiculous.
Perhaps these campaign officials know something that we do not know for others - that Trump's tweets would have contained even more fuel without their interventions.
We will probably never know anything about the tweets Trump has not sent.
If his employees have managed to keep him out of trouble several times, their efforts have been worthwhile.
But no one has consistently prevented Trump from causing controversy.
Part of the problem is that in a White House composed of competing parties, people repeatedly try to advance their own agenda by presenting Trump with material that may promote their views from the world.
In May, politico - which is all about this story - reported on the preference of consultants to provide dubious information to the President for strategic reasons.
This was an example described by Reporters Shane Goldmacher:
"Current and former Trump officials say that Trump, like a volcano, can respond to negative press excerpts, especially those with shameful leaks, and that he is intent on figuring out where they come from.
That is exactly what happened at the end of February, when someone maliciously gave the president a printed copy of an article by GotNews.com, the website of the Internet vocalist Charles C. Johnson, who accused Deputy Head of Katie Walsh. "
Although Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter for harassment, or had not offered any concrete evidence, or had in the past made false accusations and revoked them.
Trump read the article and began to ask employees about Walsh. "
Goldmacher added that former Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and White House Secretary General Rob Porter "tried to implement a system to manage and document Trump's paperwork."
How did this work?
Kelly tries to do the same three months later.
Perhaps he will prove himself as a more effective manager than a priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his advisers still seek influence.
These immutable factors make Kelly's mission very difficult.
Most wanted criminals get mail from Europol
Since the address is unknown, the assistance of the population will be requested and hoped.
The police across Europe this summer (virtual) sends postcards to dangerous criminals on flight.
Since the addresses of the wanted serious criminals are not known by nature, information from the population is hoped for and requested.
Europol reported on Friday on the action following the "EU Most Wanted" -Advent calendar of winter.
Experience has shown that many people are hiding in tourist destinations, as was said by Europol.
21 postcards for wanted criminals from 21 EU countries have been put together.
Since 2016 there is the www.eumostwanted website, more than 2.5 million times it has been viewed.
36 of the on-line rights have been arrested so far, at least eleven of them on the basis of information made available on the website.
Travellers negotiate a moat and return to the 'millionaire rice'.
Some of the wealthiest homeowners of the West Midlands are once again at war with some determined travelers who have negotiated a ditch drawn from the community to reclaim a field in front of their mansions.
Travellers have parked their 20 caravans on a field outside a prosperous road of Solihull, which is called the "millionaire series."
They brought horses, babies and an army of transporters after they were thrown out only in May, but without being deterred by a ditch buried by the Council in order to prevent their incursions.
The tacle group found a gap in defence facilities and pushed their vehicles through a section that remained unobstructed to find a way.
Angry residents have pushed the Council of Solihull to say that it is "useless to deal with the problem."
An anonymous inhabitant said: "They moved there on Monday evening, after being sent back by Bentley Heath, where they threw stones onto the passers-by.
The Council must be forced into action by shame, because it was useless in dealing with the problem.
The travellers were there in May, moved on and are now back.
More came last night, probably more today. "
She added: "The Birmingham Council knows how to deal with this by keeping long instructions to protect their parks.
I live on Streetsbrook Road and I am not happy to continue paying my common tax if the Council cannot even stop it. "
A resident who did not want to be called said: "It is ridiculous, we have just seen the last round of these travellers just to be plundered by another round.
The figures have increased this time, and even a horse has been seen in the park area. "
As one speaker of the Solihull Council said, "We are aware of an unauthorised camp on the land beyond Streetsbrook Road and work with the police of Solihulls.
In order to support our collection of evidence, it is very important that as many residents as possible report anti-social or criminal behaviour to the police by calling 101.
This will help to provide a picture of the situation in which the Court will have to examine when we will present our case. "
From birhof, Waldhotel Luise will become
The Waldhotel Luise will be transformed from the former Hotel birhof.
The house at the gates of Freudenstadts is currently being renovated and will be reopened on 1 March next year.
This is good news for the city.
With the closure of the Hotel Birkenhof by the then Ambiente UNK gesellschaft mbH on 13 April 2014, around 30 000 nights were lost per year and revenue from the tourist tax was also lost.
In the autumn of 2014, with dramatically increasing numbers of refugees coming to the county, the hotel building was offered as a collective accommodation to the County Council Office, causing controversial discussions.
The city prevented asylum seekers from being accommodated by drawing up a development plan in order to secure the area as a hotel location.
The decision at the time was not uncontroversial in the municipal council.
But especially Freudenstadts OberUNK meister Julian Osswald defended the location of the hotel and talked at the time of serious visitors to the hotel.
He should be right.
The Luisenhotels group with its managing director Birgit Scherer, based in Bad Bergzabern, purchased the former Hotel birhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to turn it back into a three-star Waldhotel Plus category.
The group has four houses with the Freudenstadt object.
Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Herrenalb.
They are called Hotel Luise, Luisenpark, Parkhotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise.
The former Hotel birhof has been standing in front of the entrance for a long time and, when you enter the house, you will see the large amount of renovation work that is being carried out.
The floors were torn out, some of the ceilings were dismantled, old bathtubs were removed from the rooms.
The entire building is a single construction site.
There is still much to be done by March.
"It is actually a nice hotel," says Thomas Scherer in conversation with our newspaper.
Everything is to be renewed in Black Forest style.
The rooms are equipped with large walk-in showers, the entrance area is transformed and new windows are installed.
Everything should become "nice to the citizen," as Thomas Scherer puts it.
"We want to make a piece of jewelry."
Swimming pool, wellness area and a meeting room are all equipped.
The staff were very friendly and helpful. The hotel was
The Waldhotel Luise, with its approximately 60 rooms, wants to be more spacious, explains Scherer.
Both individual holidaymakers, groups or business people should feel at home in the hotel.
He has already had talks with OB Julian Osswald and tourist director Michael Krause, he said Scherer.
The city's sights are identical to those of the Hotel Group.
"We are on the same line."
When asked about the level of investment, Thomas Scherer does not want to be precise.
Just under EUR 1 million, he reckons.
The exterior systems are also brought to the front, which is already clearly visible.
In an inner courtyard there is a large terrace, which will be accessible from the restaurant, which is open to the public.
Thomas Scherer is optimistic: "Freudenstadt is a good market."
Russia affair: US special investigators set up Grand Jury
In the Russia affair for US President Donald Trump, special investigators Robert Mueller are alleged to have appointed a so-called Grand Jury after a report.
The panel has begun its work in recent weeks, wrote the Wall Street Journal on the basis of people who are familiar with the matter.
The newspaper took the step as a sign that Mueller had extended and intensified his investigation.
CNN reported that there are already some preliminary charges from the panel in connection with a meeting between Trump's oldest son and a Russian lawyer.
For some time now, US intelligence agencies have accused the Kremlin of deliberately interfering in the 2016 presidential election campaign.
Mueller examines whether there were deals between Trump's campaign team and Moscow.
The investigation will focus on several men who campaigned as Republican counsellor.
According to reports, Mueller also examined more and more Trump's private and business environment.
The "Washington Post" wrote a few weeks ago that the Special Envoy Trump had personally moved to the center and accused the president of possibly obstructing justice in the course of the affair.
The main task of Grand Jurys is to examine evidence available in possible criminal cases and to decide whether to prosecute.
Grand Jurys are therefore also known as the UNK UNK.
Most of the time, they are involved in larger and controversial cases.
The procedure is always carried out behind closed doors.
The Board may also be involved by the Public Prosecutor's Office in order to invite persons to interrogate under oath.
According to CNN, preliminary charges have already been issued about the meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer.
People who took part in the meeting had been asked to make a statement, as stated in the report.
They should also provide documents.
In addition to Trump Jr., Trump's adviser and son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and his then-election chief, Paul UNK fort, also attended the conversation.
Legal experts said on US television on Thursday evening that the appointment showed that Mueller was not intimidated in his work and that he wanted to act quickly if necessary.
However, it should not necessarily be the case that the Grand Jury will be turned on at the end to decide on the prosecution.
Nevertheless, the establishment of the panel marks the start of a new phase in investigations and a new cause for concern for President Trump.
In the midst of new revelations, on Thursday evening, the President used a speech in West Virginia to portray the Russia affair as a campaign of his political opponents.
"Russia's history is a complete invention," Trump said.
The issue gives the democrats a chance to "feel good, because they have nothing else they can talk about."
His special adviser, Ty Cobb, stated in an opinion that he did not know anything about the creation of a Grand Jury.
However, he stressed that these work normally in secret.
The White House is in favour of any measures to speed up the work of the Special Investigator in a 'fair' manner.
The former FBI chief James Comey said three times that the president would not be investigated.
There is no reason to think that something has changed in this respect, as stated in the statement.
But Mueller had only been used after Trump fired Comey.
Because of this outrages, accusations against Trump had been made that he wanted to obstruct the judiciary.
In June, Comey told a Senate Committee that Trump had asked him to stop investigating the then national security adviser, Michael Flynn.
The President is under great pressure for the investigation.
According to U.S. media, the White House collected material against the special broker and his staff.
This triggered speculation about Trump's intention to dismiss Mueller.
Unlike an independent Congressional Special Envoy, such as the Watergate affair surrounding the then-resigned President Richard Nixon, Mueller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired by the justice ministry at the insistence of the president.
But several senators of both parties want to prevent such a move.
Two groups of Republican and Democratic Senators put forward draft laws on Thursday that would make it impossible for the Special Envoy to be dismissed so easily.
Antarctica: Giant Eisberg drives Antarctica
In the Westantarktis, a gigantic iceberg from the nearly seven-fold size of Berlin has been removed from the Scheldt.
This was shared by the Bremerhavener Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday.
The colossus, which weighs more than one trillion tonnes and has a size of 5800 square kilometres, is now going to drive north and will probably take two or three years until it has melted.
With a length of 175 kilometres and a width of up to 50 kilometres, it is one of the biggest giant ice giants that researchers have registered over the past three decades.
He does not pose a threat to people.
According to research, the extent to which climate change has played a role in breaking off the iceberg is unclear.
However, for about 30 years there has been a series of unusual collapses of ice elves in the region, writes the US Research Centre for UNK and Ice (NSIDC) in a factual background.
According to many researchers, this could be linked to global warming.
The now broken colossus has been part of the Larsen-C ice ice.
Schelfeis floats on the sea and is fed by large glaciers.
It is therefore growing ever further into the sea and regularly breaks down.
The Larsen-C-Schelfeis lies south of South America almost at the tip of the Antarctic peninsula.
To the north of this ice-cream, the balance of wax and breakage was disrupted a few years ago.
AWI researcher Daniela Jansen writes a complete ice cream.
There is a lot to say that the Larsen-C-Scheldt is also in danger, because the front edge has never been as far removed as it is at present.
In addition, the ice plate is under stress and can fall apart if a piece is broken down at a key point.
The melting of Schelfeis and Eisberg does not increase the sea level, as they swim on the water and ice suppresses as much water as it does after the melting itself.
However, the loss of the ice on the river Scheldt means that the glaciers can flow directly into the sea and flow much faster than before.
This could possibly increase sea levels, but only to a small extent, writes the United Kingdom's research project on Antarctica (Midas).
According to AWI figures, the Larsen-C-Scheldt is the fourth largest ice-cream in Antarctica, covering almost 50,000 square kilometres.
On the transition from the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick, at the front edge to the free ocean about 200 meters.
There it breaks off regularly.
"Although it is a natural event and we are not aware of any direct link to climate change, the Ice Shield is now in a more dangerous position," said Martin O fucking Leary of Swansea University, UK.
"This is the most lenient retreat since records began," he also confirmed.
Among scientists, it is controversial whether the Larsen-C-Scheldt will grow again or fall back in the long term and possibly fall together, "his colleague Adrian Luckman said," Our models say that it will be less stable. "
But this development will take decades.
Although these researchers do not attribute the demolition of this gigantic iceberg to climate change, a great many of the Antarctica Peninsula's iron shelves have fallen apart in recent decades.
This long corner of Antarctica stretches towards South America.
According to the British Antarctic Survey research programme, the ice surface of the Antarctic Peninsula has fallen by 28 000 square kilometres since the 1950s.
The rise in temperature has contributed to the decline.
The Antarctic Peninsula has warmed by about three degrees over the past 50 years, making it one of the fastest growing areas.
CDU wants a special rate for staff
Because it is becoming increasingly difficult to fill vacancies, the CDU is calling for the employers' association to leave in order to become more attractive.
Just before the summer break, UNK stag has opened 41 new posts in the administration.
More than 1100 employees and civil servants work for the district administration in Mettmann.
Now, another 17 apprentices have their first working day behind them.
The teacher posts at the circle seem to be highly sought after.
Some 620 applications were received for the places to be awarded this year.
However, there is still a shortage of staff to cope with the increased demands and tasks.
At present there are still 50 vacant posts in the Mettmann district.
Among other things, we are looking for doctors and engineers as well as general administration.
The CDU, together with the FDP and UWG, now wants to take the initiative in the UNK stag together with the German Free Democratic Party (FDP) and the UWG to counter the shortage of skilled workers in the administration.
According to the wishes of the parties, the administration should "develop a concept for personnel recruitment and personnel development."
The aim is not only to provide short-term training to skilled workers, but also to counter the shortage of candidates in a forward-looking manner, it is said.
The overall concept should be oriented towards the inside and outside world, show concrete measures for cross-entry participants and include a training offensive, the CDU, the FDP and the UWG demand.
That sounds like a good approach.
Because the circle has to do with staff problems that were not known before.
Other cities recruit good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions.
We are talking about a genuine 'competition between public employers'.
In addition, there are a large number of employees who leave the service due to illness or age.
It is therefore high time to act so that more jobs are not left vacant.
But Klaus-Dieter UNK, member of the CDU Group, goes beyond the joint request with his party.
He recently caused a lazy surprise on the day of a chalk, when he publicly questioned the staff cost coverage and startled the other parties.
People want to see a review of all the possibilities for leaving the municipal employers' association.
"If we do not find a satisfactory solution here in the short term, the district administration with the trade unions - perhaps also in cooperation with local cities - should aim for a national tariff," so the people.
In doing so, the CDU is trying to pay the employees and civil servants better than it actually provides for the provision of tariffs for the public service.
Salaries are currently strictly prescribed; increases or more money are only available if you change to a higher level based on professional years.
But the tasks of the circle have grown more and more in recent years.
Only a few weeks ago, new spaces had to be set up in which employees took care of the provisions of the new law on prostitution.
Not least because of the increasing number of asylum seekers, Landrat Thomas Hendele and District Director Martin Richter have a problem: They have too few staff.
Italy exacerbates the sound of NGO migrants "rescue boats
Italy has warned NGOs using rescue boats for migrants in the Mediterranean that they cannot continue to do so unless they adhere to new rules for their operations.
"If NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct, it is difficult to see how they can continue to work," said Minister of the Interior Marco Minniti in an interview with the Turin daily La Stampa.
Minnitis warning came a day after the Italian authorities seized a boat from the German Youth Rettet aid organisation because their team had effectively cooperated with traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration.
The aid organisation, which has only been in operation for a year, refused to comment on detailed allegations made by the Italian Public Prosecutor Ambrogio CARTOSIO.
"For us, saving human life is and will remain our top priority, so we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment," said the organisation in an opinion on the social media.
"We can assess all the accusations that are currently being made only after we have gathered all the information and can assess the situation."
The Italian authorities had been monitoring the boat of 'Youth Rettet', Iuventa, since October.
It is believed that his crew will take infra-red migrants, which are delivered directly to them by traffickers, and that the smugglers will be able to leave so that the ships can be used again.
At least such a meeting was said to have taken place only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast, according to the file of the prosecutor whose content was published by Italian media.
The crew is suspected of ignoring the authority of the Italian Coast Guard to monitor rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not for any other reason.
Under the Code of Conduct, boats such as Iuventa must have an Italian police officer on board to monitor their activities.
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have so far agreed to adhere to the code: Save the Children, Moas from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain.
The latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be deemed unnecessary but acceptable, as they would not entail "substantial changes or obstacles" to their rescue operations.
Among those who refuse to sign, the Nobel laureate organisation is Médecins sans Frontières (MSF).
Minniti has now said that the number of migrants arriving in Italy following the rescue measures has declined sharply in recent weeks, suggesting that efforts to strengthen the Libyan Coast Guard and to cooperate with the local civil service have come to fruition.
"In the last few days we have started to see light at the end of the tunnel," said the Minister.
He announced plans for further talks with Libyan mayors this month on economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger, and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving these countries hoping to reach Europe.
Increases and trials
Nine Weilermer UNK, the "Berlin outpost" and two guest riders met in Wachenheim in the North Palatinate to enjoy trials and sights for four days.
Three friendly guides were available for this purpose.
The accommodation in the Wachenheimer Valley proved to be a good base for the tours.
The castle and wine festival of Wachenheim was a welcome extra.
The first tour led to MichaelUNK elle above Deidesheim at hot summer temperatures along the vineyards.
There were observation points, some of which were towers, from which one could view far beyond the PUNK zer forest and the upstream plains.
In between, there were always longer increases, for which long trials were rewarded.
On the second day we went to Bad Dürkheim to the Saline and the Volksfest sausage market.
Once again, the viewpoint at the viewpoint, connected by the "flowige" trials and moderate increases.
On the last two days, many metres of altitude were called for again.
Caves, rocks, towers, castles, ruins and recreational huts brought welcome breaks.
In Bad Dürkheim the bikers used saline water in the outdoor inhalation.
New town was also introduced.
After 173 kilometres and almost 4500 metres of altitude, the group had met the PUNK zer Forest from its best side - sporty and cultural.
UNK statt UNK - Bundesliga UNK sich für E-Sport
Will the sport stars be sitting in front of computer consoles instead of fighting in the wind and weather over the stadium?
The fact is that e-sports has long since become a serious industry, a lucrative business - including big stars, millions of fans and huge tournaments with high scales.
This has also been recognised by the first federal league associations, which are increasingly involved in this area.
FC Schalke 04 and the last VfB Stuttgart, who founded an E-Sport department in mid-July and took two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17 under contract.
"We hope to attract new young target groups to VfB," says Managing Director Jochen Röttgermann.
He is certain that there are still a number of clubs on this train.
This weekend, FIFA, the World Football Association, will be organising the first Interactive Club World Cup in London, where the gamblers of different clubs will compete.
In addition to Schalke and Wolfsburg, Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain and PSV Eindhoven have qualified.
Robin Dutt, too, sees great potential in e-sport.
The ex-trainer of Bayer Leverkusen and Werder Bremen now advises an agency for virtual football players.
"Real football, in particular, has to deal with the 14-30 year-olds that young people will continue to go to the stadium in the future," says the 52-year-old.
And the clubs tried to conquer all sorts of markets, especially the Asian ones.
With prominent e-athletes under contract, you could be present on these markets much more often online than just sending the German federal league team to Asia once a year.
What exactly is it about?
In E-Sport, computer games such as "League Of Legends," "Dota 2," "Counterstrike" or even FIFA's football simulation are fought at the level of competition.
For a long time now, as in normal sports, leagues have established themselves in which the professionals compete against each other.
E-Sport is already part of the official program at Asia Games 2022.
But is this a real sport?
For many, the idea is certainly worth getting used to.
Ingo FrobUNK has also been dealing with the question for a long time.
For the professor at the German Sports Academy in Cologne, E-Sport is a sport because it is competitive and displays many biological and physical reactions that can also be found in classical sports - for example, increased heart rates, stress reactions.
It also needs cognitive skills, technical and tactical understanding, and rapid responsiveness.
Professional gamers should not only train their bodies at the console, but also take care of their diet.
"The fit player is a good player."
But acrobatic also sees problems: "Doping is becoming more and more a topic."
Controls were difficult to implement in online games, and the structures of classical sport were missing in the scene.
On the positive side, the scientist highlights the high integrative effect of e-sport.
Players are travelling internationally, this is like a large global family, and there are no intercultural barriers.
A study by Deloitte and the Federal Association of Interactive Entertainment Software (BIU) predicts rapid growth for e-sport.
In 2016, €50 million had been implemented in Germany, mainly through advertising, sponsorship and major tournaments.
In three years, sales are expected to be 130 million.
This is little against the nearly EUR 2.4 billion of the Football League.
However, e-sport is "not far from other well-established sports such as handball, basketball or ice hockey," writes Deloitte consultants.
Many countries are already on the international stage.
Major markets are Asia and the USA, where ex-basketball players Shaquille O Brazilian Neal and Baseballstar Alex Rodriguez participate in the US team NRG eSports.
Hollywood actor Ashton Kutcher invests in the eSport betting provider Unikrn.
There is also a lot of work to be done in Europe.
In a Norwegian school, e-sport was introduced as a subject of instruction, says FrobUNK.
In the Netherlands and France, according to Dutt, football clubs are now obliged to set up an e-sport department.
"In European comparison, Germany lags behind," explains VfB's Board of Management Röttgermann.
It is no longer enough to fall into nostalgia and to clarify the old times.
The aim is to preserve the tradition of the association but at the same time to align the company with the modern market.
"We live in a digitised world," says Dutt.
"There is no way to hold on to the fact that everything is as it always was in football."
Poison eggs - The egg alternatives to cooking and baking
In the meantime, almost all the Länder have been hit by the scandal of toxic eggs.
Aldi Süd and Aldi Nord have reacted and taken all eggs out of sale throughout Germany.
Eggs are only to be taken into the shelves, which are shown to have no fipronil.
Michelle Carter condemned for the texts that Conrad Roy is pushing for suicide.
A Massachusetts woman was sentenced to two and a half years because she encouraged her friend to commit suicide by means of texts and calls.
Michelle Carter, now 20, will spend 15 months of her conviction behind bars, and five years have been suspended on probation.
Carter was convicted in June of his careless killing by Conrad Roy, who died on 13 July 2014.
The father of Roy said at the hearing on Thursday: "My family is uncomforting.
My son was my best friend. "
Carter was allowed to remain free to appeal.
She was faced with a maximum sentence of 20 years, but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy suffered from a mental illness.
Dressed in red trousers and a creamy blouse, Carter stood with tears in his eyes, with folded hands and looking down eyes, when convicted.
"Their actions have killed Conrad Roy," the prosecutor told the court.
"They ended his life in order to make their own better.
She took no responsibility, "she said.
"She has not shown any remorse."
But Carters lawyer said it was "a terrible circumstance that she deeply regrets."
Judge Lawrence Moniz said, however, that he did not find out that her "age, maturity or even mental illness have a significant impact on her actions."
A prosecutor read a statement by Roys's mother, Lynn Roy, who said that there is "no day when I do not mourn the loss of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and to follow everything, and I try to be there for his sisters, despite all my pain we will carry with us for eternity, "says
Roys's sister, Camdyn Roy, said that she was "persecuted" by the realization that she would never attend her brother's wedding or be an aunt for his children.
"Not to have this only person with whom I have been together every day since my birth is a pain that I will always keep with me for the rest of my life," she said.
The case seems to set a legal precedent, because there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to ask another to commit suicide.
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle in 2014.
The case attracted national attention after Carters revealed text messages that they had encouraged him to end his life.
"Hang up, spring from a building, tell yourself, I do not know there are many ways," she said in several messages she had sent in the two weeks before his death, while he was on holiday with his family.
In the eyes of his suicide, she wrote: "You have to do it, Conrad" and "Everything you have to do is turn on the generator and you will be free and happy."
Judge Moniz said that Carter sought attention by the death of Roy and ordered that she should benefit from the case through any press.
The case has divided the legal opinion.
One of the few who defended Carter was Amanda Knox, sentenced in 2007 for murder of her British fellow citizens in Italy before being acquitted two years ago.
Mrs Knox, 30 years old, published a comment in the Los Angeles Times: "Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help, not prison."
Joshua Kimmir: Learning from the new FC Bayern Mini-Lahm
It is no coincidence that Joshua Kimmir was allowed to run as captain at the Audi Cup.
The FC Bayern cheers the Confed Cup winner a great season - extra motivation does not hurt.
There was something different in his place in the cabin, so Joshua Kimmir immediately saw me, even if the additional item of clothing was very small.
But since no Philipp Lahm and no Manuel UNK were to be seen on the second day of the Audi Cup, he made the binding to his arm.
"The trainer did not announce it," the Confed Cup winner later, after his first bet as a Bavaria captain.
Good, the stand could have run better than the 0: 2 against the SSC Naples.
But the character of the coach could interpret Kimme as well.
It was not the eight-year-old Arturo Vidal who was chosen as the game leader by the pro C-Elf, made up of young players, debutants and just out-of-holiday professionals.
You prefer to distribute sugar to those who have a lot to chew, who you want to keep at your whim.
So if you have been chosen to take up the heritage of Lahm, you can only use a little extra motivation.
Kimmir confirmed: "This is what you want as a player: Take responsibility."
On Wednesday, the 22-year-old flipped over the field as a mini-Lahm.
On the right side, this is now its position, the white binding on the arm did its rest.
And Kimme worked like the one who can best take the helm in his hand in this initial formation.
He gave instructions, tried to guide the played force.
He had a look for the whole, while many others were self-employed.
Vidal by overplaying his lack of fitness (did not fold); Renato Sanches with it, to devil come out to the performance of the Asia trip (also only partially folded); and Sebastian Rudy and Niklas.
That, after all, worked very well.
Süle ran alongside Kimme, Rudy before the defense, both acting sovereign.
The famous Napoli storm was often difficult, and Süle also tried to build up a game a few times.
His colleague Rudy admitted that the result was "not as we hoped it would."
But he, too, did a decent job on his debut.
Relocation of games, change of pace: "I was also called for this style."
How uninhabited this Bavaria world is for the new entrants was seen after the match.
Rudy, for example, did not give one or two interviews in the catacombs, but determined six or seven.
Kimmir decided to leave after a few tough statements in the back of his new fellow players.
There he heard an interesting sentence from Süle: "What is going on here, I have already noticed.
In Bavaria, you simply have to win every game. "
After all, he no longer needs to teach the new.
Alaba motivates ÖFB-UNK
David Alaba believes in the success of our ÖFB-Ladies
Shortly before the match, Austria's best known footballer reported on Twitter and wanted the ÖFB-UNK all the best.
The Bavarian legionnaire is a kind of club-mate of ÖFB-UNK änin Schnaderbeck and is a member of our Ladys.
The tweet of the Austrian soccer of the year and the Champions League winner should be a special motivational injection.
Our ladies might well need the famous Bavaria-Dusel.
Businesses satisfied with Rhineland-Palatinate Minister: Business praises Wissing Tempo
It was often irreconcilable, the relationship between the country and the regional economy, when Eveline Lemke (Green) was still the Minister of Economy of Rhineland-Palatinate.
This is evident after more than a year in which the new Minister for Economic Affairs, Volker Wissing (FDP), is in office.
Chambers and enterprises from the region speak of a change in economic policy - and at the same time they blame the old minister - to T V's question.
Frank Natus, Chairman of the Association of Trierer Enterprises (VTU), says: "Wissing responds to the wishes of business, which Lemke has all blocked."
Natus's biggest U-turn is in infrastructure policy: The closure of the motorway 1 between Kelberg and UNK au is now at the top of the country's list of priorities.
This year, the Ministry hopes for a planning process, until 2021 the construction law will be in place.
The WestumUNK Trier also plays a role in the country's plans, which is in the urgent need of the BundesUNK UNK geUNK.
The aim is to start the route in December 2020, says Minister-spreader Cornelia Holtmann.
Natus sees this as a signpost to support regional but internationally competing companies.
The Chamber of Commerce and Industry (IHK) Trier, as suggested by Wissing, aims to create a Rhineland-Palatinate label for wine in order to increase sales in supermarkets and to halt the trend of German wine exports, which have lasted for ten years.
In addition, Wissing has an open ear for people who want to set up their own company, praises the Chamber of Commerce.
The UNK skammer Trier sees in the new Master Bonus an additional incentive for young trainees, says Managing Director Matthias Schwalbach.
It provides for a premium of €1000 for the recognised master examination and €2500 for graduates to become self-employed within ten years of their master training.
But the homework list for the country remains a long one.
According to Jan UNK auer, Chief Executive of IHK Trier, the country lacks the necessary staff for the planned road construction.
Out of 56 new engineers that Wissing plans to employ mobility at home, only 29 posts have been filled.
The Chamber of Commerce demands that more orders be given to external offices.
Christian Baldauf, a member of the CDU group, refers to Court of Auditors' calculations, the country invests more than EUR 20 million less in the maintenance of national roads than proposed in 2017 and 2018.
Frank Natus also expects a country's approach to address the skills shortage in the region.
It was also sobering to see the roll-out of broadband in the country so far.
In 2016, regional companies only rated network supply in an IHK survey with a rating of 3.4.
They complained about faltering Internet connections and breakdowns.
On the other hand, the former Minister for Economic Affairs, Eveline Lemke, is currently out of politics and is still on the Supervisory Board of the wind turbine company Pro Wind.
The Green Group left Lemke in April to become president of a private university in Karlsruhe - where, after four months of disagreements, it has already returned to the field.
Audi is expected to change 850,000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers face a backlash
One day before the announcement of Audi, BMW said that it would offer to update the software in more than 350,000 vehicles.
The BMW President said that the company believes that "there are more intelligent options than driving restrictions," referring to European cities - including Munich, where BMW is based - to ban or restrict diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe would be modified to reduce its diesel emissions.
None of the companies described the undertakings as a call-back.
European car manufacturers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with rules on carbon dioxide emissions.
However, the nitrogen oxides that emit diesel engines are considered carcinogens and can cause asthma.
The cost to car manufacturers of installing plants to neutralise the exhaust gases emitted by diesel vehicles is also increasing, which makes it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also being accused of spoiling powerful car companies and ignoring signs of the problem.
Companies are trying to avoid Volkswagen's mistakes, which have allowed the use of so-called 'turn-off' devices that have managed to regulate emissions in order to comply with the regulations when a car has been tested but is driving back under normal driving conditions.
In the United States, several Volkswagen employees have been charged, while others are being investigated on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former head of thermodynamics was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany.
The former manager, Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio, is Italian and is therefore not protected from extradition and could be tried in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi was involved in German criminal investigations at Volkswagen, after the authorities accused Audi of having installed a system to circumvent the emissions regulations in Europe, and a request focused on the United States was extended.
The inclusion of Audi in the investigation could place a heavy burden on Volkswagen: The luxury automobile manufacturer contributes disproportionately to Volkswagen's profits.
This message has the floss on Saturday at Isar.
The city wants to protect the Isar.
For Isar's visitors, tomorrow Saturday a raft passes through Munich, which has a special message.
If you take it to the Isar again on Saturday, you will see a great raft between UNK cher and Reichenbachbrücke.
And this is not a common floss, with Isar tourists.
But the building department wants to clear up.
On the raft you can see a large information transparent.
It shows a mountain of rubbish.
The launch of a publicity campaign to appeal to the Isar visitors.
The motto "True love is..." is to sharpen understanding for the Isar as a protected game flow.
As early as last summer, the raft crossed the isar and this year, there are other actions and measures to achieve responsible and environmentally responsible behaviour.
Mordillos KnollennUNK and the laughter against the suffering
Mordillo was, at times, one of the most widely published cartoonists, the boys of his characters are his trademark.
Also with 85 the Argentinean still draws and works on a film.
His message: Laugh, "because there is too much suffering in the world."
Guillermo Mordillo was born on 4 August 1932 as the son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires.
In his first years as an artist, he worked as a draftsman for greeting cards - frustrating him.
"The happiest day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job," he once said.
After stations in Lima, New York, and Paris, he made a breakthrough at the end of the 1960s: With the publication of his cartoons in Paris Match and then in the "Stern" and other leading magazines around the world.
Even in China, Mordillo found many fans.
Time and again the artist was inspired by cities.
Large, circular Mordillo figures can be found in drawings with the sliding tower of Pisa, Big Ben in London and Red Square in Moscow.
In the early morning, according to his own figures, he is still in the drawing table today, working almost ten hours a day.
His threatening figures continue to be widely spread throughout the world through calendars, puzzles, books for young and old alike, T-shirts, ploughs and watches.
For six years he has also worked on a cartoon film and a TV series with his characters.
The main person in the film "Crazy Island" is a giraffe - Mordillos most popular animal in his drawings - who has a thousand feet as an opponent.
For the first time, his figures speak in the 3D film, which is due to come to the cinema wall in 2019.
"I don't know exactly what they will say, it's strange for me," says Mordillo.
The script is not written by him.
This is why he is more inclined to focus on the TV series, which, like his original drawings, is produced word-free.
Provence lavender threatened by climate change
He has become a symbol of Provence in the south of France, but there is a warning that he is threatened by climate change.
Lavender is falling due to drought-like conditions and working age that is passing through disease, causing major headaches for scientists and farmers who are trying to find solutions.
Eric Chaisse, an expert at CRIEPPAM in Provence, said: "Lavender in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant has been exposed in recent years to the effects of climate change, which has caused much less rain in the spring.
This has an impact on the life span of lavender.
There is also a small Zikade, a micro-bacterium that transmits dwarf cicadas, and in very dry weather there are many of them. "
And there is a lot at stake.
Lavender oil attracts not only tourists, but also perfumes and cosmetics.
Eric Chaisse said: "Instead of having very long plant watches with a large number of flowers, we have smaller, underdeveloped and either missing or weakened.
So we have fewer parts with essential oil. "
The solutions that are considered include better water distribution and slowing down evaporation from the soil, but also spraying plants with a protective mixture of clay and water, and the development of varieties capable of drought.
The small town of Geisa in the eastern Rhön is celebrating its 1200-year anniversary this year.
The peak is this Saturday and Sunday with a medieval festival.
Crow, ignition, dealer, vaginal or a land ice camp are to be experienced in the city centre these days.
The murder of a journalist highlights the growing threat in Mexico
Riodoce weekly officials usually meet on Wednesday to review their plans for reporting the recent chaos in the Sinaloa state by organized crime, corrupt officials, and ceaseless drug wars.
But on that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security.
They have been told that it is important to change their routines.
Two high-ranking journalists are discussing what is more secure: To bring their children into the office, who were the target of an attack with grenades in 2009, or to let them go home.
Security experts have written three words on a blackboard at the front of the room: Opponents, neutrals, allies.
You ask the reporters to propose names for each column - no evidence is needed, enough perception and abdominal feeling.
There are drug traffickers, politicians, businessmen, journalists suspected of being on the government's pay list or cartels, a catalogue of criminals who are making Mexico's chaos dangerous.
There is no respite from violence, and while corpses are accumulating throughout the country, there are more and more journalists: At least 25 since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012, and five federal states were under threat.
Among the latter is her editor and inspiration of Riodoce, co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.
"The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his numerous books on drug-related violence.
His absence is deeply felt, although his presence is present everywhere - a large photo of Valdez that shows his midfinger with the word "Justice" glasses hanging on the facade of the Riodoce building, two reporters wearing the 30 years.
The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared themes, trauma, nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.
Although a special Federal Public Prosecutor's Office was established in 2010 to deal with the cases of journalists, according to the Committee on the Protection of Journalists, it has only initiated two criminal proceedings.
As with most of the thousands of murders associated with drug trafficking and organised crime every year, journalists' murderers are rarely brought to justice.
At Riodoce, they still insist on treating the violence of Sinaloa, although they are uncomforting and although the terrain is more traitarian now.
Without information about the murderers, without justice, the meeting to discuss security is of little use, says Ibarra.
"It is very stupid to waste my time in this workshop," he says.
"As long as we do not know why, we distrust everyone."
On the morning of May 15 Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the capital of Culiacan.
He managed to drive a few blocks far before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men, forced out of his car and shot 12 times, presumably because of the newspaper's name - the "twelften."
The shooter drove away in his car and damaged it nearby.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He left a woman and two adult children.
Rumors tend to fly around freely in Culiacan.
But on the subject of Valdez there is practically nothing but silence.
Since Guzman's arrest last year and extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa has become one of the country's bloodiest battlefields, with rival factions struggling to fill the vacuum.
There is nothing to do with the fact that in Sinaloa, one or more people are shot on the street every day, or that the cemetery is full of ornate, two-storey mausoleums for drug kings that are larger than many homes for the living.
Forget, for one minute, that there is a state of "calm" when only a cartel has control over the coastal state, with its valuable ports and drug trade routes to the United States.
Nevertheless, and despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, was guilty of not protecting his friend.
He believes that two misunderstandings have contributed to the murder.
First, in February, there was the release of an interview with Damaso Lopez, a leader of one of the rival cartel factions in war with Guzman's sons.
This release may have upset sons, suspected gangsters bought every copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to newspaper kiosks.
The second mistake was not to force Valdez to leave the country for its own security after the seizure of another newspaper that had published the same story.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is regarded as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists.
He had survived for so long that his friends and colleagues assumed that he would always be there.
He was an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003, when he joined five colleagues to create Riodoce and sold 50 US dollars of ownership.
In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to do journalism without encountering the drug problem," Bojorquez said.
Over time, the newspaper earned a reputation for its courageous and honest reporting, and sales and advertising increased.
Reporters loved being able to publish hard-hitting surveys without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else dared to treat.
Eight years after the establishment of Riodoce, she received the prestigious "Maria Moors Cabot Award" for her reporting in Latin America.
In the same year, Valdez won the Committee's International Press Freedom Award for the Protection of Journalists for its courage in the pursuit of Mexican drug history, wherever it led.
He voluntarily admitted that he was afraid.
"I want to live on," he said at the time of the CPJ award.
Drug trafficking in Sinaloa "is a way of life," he said last October in an interview with Rompeviento-TV.
"You have to take on the job that falls to you as a journalist - either that or you play the stupid.
I do not want to be asked: 'What did you do in the face of so many dead... why did you not say what was going on?'
The Riodoce team missed Valdez, the fun bird who could fly like a dockers, the friend who was generous with hugging and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.
They relied on his routine.
He would always wear his hat.
He would always go to El Guiabo, the bar opposite the office, and always sit at the same table.
Now they ask: Was his love of routine his corruption?
His death has forced them, too, to question their own assumptions about how best to do their job and stay alive.
"They don't like to deal with their women, their children, their clean shops, their secret runways" to move drugs.
"These things were not allowed," Bojorquez said.
The result, even in the best times, is a high degree of self-censorship and self-preservation.
Trust his own instincts.
If it smacks wrong, it will stay away.
The anger is, said the publisher of Riodoce Andres Villarreal, that "smell a sense that can be deceived... and then the thing happened to Javier."
The old rules, as he and others say, no longer apply in Sinaloa - just as they do in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero, and other states where a toxic mix of lucrative government smuggling routes is weak.
The landscape is constantly changing.
In the space where Riodoce employees met for security training, mobile phones were suddenly not allowed, days before it became known that spyware sold exclusively to governments was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.
Outside, two policemen sought protection from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shadow of a tree.
They were mandated by the state government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-storey building in a middle-class district of Culiacan.
Half in joke, some of the reporters wondered whether these officers were among the 50% of the police officers that the governor himself described as untrustworthy.
It has been months since the reporters went to the mountain landscape, where drug gangs are de facto under control.
For this week's issue, Riodoce has played on three main stories.
There was the murder of the brother of the former well-known boxer Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.
They also had an exposé on government expenditure, which focused on the home town of the Governor.
And there was a group that carried out a kidnapping in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block away from the prosecutor's office.
There was no official word about who was kidnapped or how it happened, so caution was needed when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows: That the restaurant is a favourite local of drug traffickers and authorities.
A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician belonging to the ruling Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), which dominated all political levels almost the whole century.
Recently, several PRI governors were accused of high-profile corruption cases.
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this place, including one in which a son of "El Chapo" Guzman escaped a military assault.
Only a few months earlier, readers would have seen the Valdez column as the most informed source of the abduction.
"In the past we already knew what happened," said Villarreal, 46, with the nickname "El Flaco" because of its slim body stature.
"Now all channels of communication with our sources have been broken."
The Valdez office has been turned into a storage room for signs and stickers protesting against the murders of journalists, because the staff have become something they themselves would never have expected: Activists on behalf of the press.
Reporters Miriam Ramirez grabbed a few signs and went to a demonstration next morning for another journalist to the office of the prosecutor.
Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez was killed in the western state of Michoacan.
A burned body has been discovered and officials say, based on DNA tests, that it is his.
Throughout the country, journalists have become more vocal by writing down in organized protests "SOS Press" on walking paths and buildings.
On that day, director Bojorquez is away in Washington and is trying to gather international support for the judiciary in the Valdez case.
At a meeting with the Governor of Sinaloa the day after Valdez's murder, Ramirez accused the authorities of plotting and murdering journalists for telling the truth.
Since then, she has asked for her to be re-divided by the government because she is concerned that her anger has broken her objectivity.
Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were "surrounded" by organized crime, government officials involved in it, and an equal society.
In his last book "Narco-Journalism," he wrote that reporters are not only killed by drug gangs, but also on the orders of politicians and security forces who were under a blanket with organized crime.
Last year, the media watchdog group Articulo 19 assigned more than half of the attacks on journalists to the police and civil servants.
"In Mexico, you die because you want you to keep your mouth," said Ramirez.
It appears that the murders have a deterrent effect.
No one forgets the death of the blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state Tamaulipas six years ago.
Your body was found together with a note allegedly signed by the Zetas cartel: 'Here I am because of my reports'.
A computer keyboard and headphones were positioned next to their separate head.
Some branches have chosen to close, such as the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state Chihuahua after the murder of the correspondent Miroslava Breach in March.
Others continue as El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did after the murder of her director in 2004.
In 2010, the Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed the drug cartels with an article on the front page entitled "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists have fled from their home countries or even from the country.
It is a painful decision.
It is difficult to find work in exile and they are still watching the streets and looking for dangers.
And sometimes they are hunted, as seems to be the photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered in 2015, along with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after fleeing Veracruz.
For those who are left behind and continue to work, it is a daily dance with risky decisions.
Ibarra, who once wanted to be a poet, admits that drug trafficking is frightening him.
"Mexico is going to hell, and that is why I became Reporters," he said.
At midnight last Friday, when the last issue had already ended, the editors of Riodoce were sitting on the sidewalk in front of the office and drank beer, once all their phones started to hum.
A number of shooting foundries with gang rivals and security forces near the resort of Mazatlan had left 19 confirmed dead.
The war escalated further, as promised by a number of cartel embassies in the region.
From the brothstone edge, they have published the news on the Riodoce website about mobile phones.
The title page had to be changed the next day.
Sirenen shot up nearby - another shooting facility in the area.
Bojorquez looked at the policemen who kept guards to see if they were willing.
If they were afraid at all, they did not show it.
Under the tremendous portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper, whose midfinger was visible to all of Sinaloa, the staff of Riodoce followed his footsteps.
"How can you just remember," Bojorquez said, "If on the same day that Javier was murdered, the practitioner asked me to send her to the streets for reporting."
Dinosaurs used camouflage to escape his enemies
At first glance, it looks like a statue, albeit a terrifying one.
Researchers have now discovered that the first findings of the incredible rhino of a Canadian miners have been so well received that experts described it as "Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs."
It was so well received that they could even find that his scaly skin was reddish brown - and they said that it had had something of a "troubled past."
The report in the magazine "Current Biology" described it as "the best preserved armored dinosaur ever found and one of the best dinosaurs in the world."
The fossil is a newly discovered species of Nodosaurier, which lived in the middle of the chalk period between 110 million and 112 million years ago.
His incredibly well preserved state has been puzzled by researchers who describe it as "really remarkable."
According to reports in National Geographic, the armored herbivores are the best preserved fossil of its kind.
It was found by Shawn Funk when he grub on March 21, 2011 at the Suncor Millennium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada.
He met something that seemed out of place from the surrounding rocks, and decided to look more closely.
The fossil he discovered was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palontology.
They spent the next six years uncovering the wild animal within the 2,500 pound (1,100 kg) heavy Earth clump.
After all this hard work, the finished result is now ready to be revealed.
"If you blink only a little with your eyes, you might almost believe that it has slept," said the main author Caleb Brown, scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature is to be seen.
"It will enter the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaurs - the Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs."
Researchers have found that, although it is covered with armor and resembles a changing tank, this herbivores were probably threatened by meat-eating dinosaurs.
The heavily armored dinosaurs used a red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and used a shielding technique known as counter-repulsion, which is also used by many modern animals.
This would have allowed him to mix better into his environment and escape from his enemies, say experts, suggesting that it was threatened by larger dinosaurs.
The 110 million-year-old Nodosaurier family made headlines for the first time in May and is now visible in the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.
Researchers have now studied the wild animal and named it Borealopelta markmitchelli after the museum technician Mark Mitchell, one of a team that spent more than 7,000 hours discovering it carefully.
The amazing conservation of the Exemplar enabled Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and form of scales and armor over his body.
They discovered the Contershading, a common defense method in the animal kingdom, meaning that the top of the creature was darker than its bottom.
Although the debate is common, the results are surprising, as the size of Borealopelta far exceeds that of the animals living today.
It suggests that the dinosaur was driven by enough pressure from meat-eating dinosaurs, that evolution encouraged the concealment of confrontation as a means of survival.
But most of the contemporary animals that use the entertainments - think of deer, zebra, or belt animals - are much smaller and more vulnerable than prey, indicating that this nodosaurier has been subjected to a real struggle for survival.
"Strong predator behavior on a massive, heavily armored dinosaurs show how dangerous the dinosaur predators of the chalk age must have been," Brown said.
The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaur was reddish brown.
Scientists continue to study the animal for information about his life, including his preserved content, to find out what he had eaten as his last meal.
They believe that the dinosaur, when he died, ran into a river and was driven out into the sea, where he sank on his back to the bottom of the sea.
At that time, Alberta was as warm as South Florida today, and rivers and oceans probably spread much further inland than they are today.
"This Nodosaurier is truly remarkable because it is fully covered with preserved scaly skin, but also remains in three dimensions and maintains the original shape of the animal," said Brown.
"The result is that the animal looks almost the same today as it was in the early chalk age.
You don't need to use much imagination to reconstruct it, and if you just look at it with your eyes, you might almost believe that it is sleeping. "
The chalk age was a time when huge theropodes, carnivorous dinosaurs, which stood on two legs, crossed the earth.
Although the king of them, Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions of years after Borealopelta, the armored dinosaur was hunted by some of his fearsome ancestors.
This includes the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 foot (11.5 m) long six tons of heavy monsters.
The scientists, whose latest findings are published in the journal Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta was plunged into the sea after death and masked in the mud.
The creature was found by Shawn Funk when he grub on March 21, 2011 in the Suncor Millennium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada.
According to the museum, it is the best preserved armored dinosaur of the world, including skin and armor, and is complete from the snout to the hips.
The creatures were, on average, about 18 feet (5 meters) long, weighing up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).
It contained two 20-inch-long tips that raged from his shoulders.
Researchers believe that the armored herbivores were swung through Western Canada until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea.
But the dinosaur's underwater equipment kept his armor in exquisite detail.
The hidden remains of this special Exemplars are so well preserved that the skin's treks still cover holprige tank plates along the dinosaur.
As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, such a level of conservation is as rare as winning the lottery.
The more I look at it, the more confusing it becomes.
Hidden remains of the skin still cover the wooden armoured plates bearing the skull of the animal.
His right forefoot is on his side, his five fingers are snatched up.
I can count the scales on his sole '.
In the thunderstorm: Mass carambolage on A8: Many injured
Heavy accident on Thursday evening on the A8: Almost 30 vehicles are involved in a mass carambolage.
There are many people injured, kilometres of traffic jams and gaffer.
On the highway Stuttgart-Munich (A8) about 20 people were injured at a mass ambolage on the late Thursday afternoon.
According to the police, at around 5 p.m. between the exit points Adelzhausen and Odelzhausen (district of Aichach-Friedberg), almost 30 vehicles, including probably trucks, were joined together during a thunderstorm.
At first, no information was available on the exact number of injured.
They are minor to medium-severe injuries, said a police spokesman.
A large number of life-saving vehicles were at the scene of the accident.
The A8 was completely blocked in the direction of Munich.
In the direction of Munich, there was an approximately ten kilometres back-stau.
As an AZ reporter reported, there were also massive obstacles on the counter-road - through numerous gaffer.
The fire brigade listed the characteristics of the vehicle drivers, who now have to reckon with severe penalties.
Shortly after 18: 45 there was a second accident on the A8, this time between Augsburg and Dasing.
There was a collision between an automobile transporter and a passenger car.
A rescue helicopter was on the way to the accident site.
Deutsche Bahn: Group tests "comfort check-in"
It is a moment that almost everyone has ever experienced: Nothing unsuspecting is sitting in the train and sleeping.
Or you are deeper into his work and just have a brilliant idea.
And then: Puff.
Comes the conductor and arouses an ungentle or tear the passenger out of the middle of the workflow.
Ticket control.
But the times of interruptions are soon over.
Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the complete ticket control.
You simply confirm by mobile phone that you take your seat and devalue your ticket.
Currently, a test operation is running on two routes.
"When the offer arrives, we extend it.
It is expected to be available on many other long-distance routes in Germany at the beginning of next year, "said a train spokesman.
"Comfort Check-in" is the name of the train's ticket rating without conductor.
In order to be able to use them, however, some conditions need to be met: You need a smartphone or a tablet.
And you have to book an online ticket - which most passengers already do.
It is also necessary to use the train app that DB Navigator bought, which is the most convenient way to book your tickets.
Last but not least, you need a seat reservation.
Because the "comfort check-in" works like this: You get into the train, call your ticket on "My Tickets."
The test customers will then receive a button for electronic devaluations.
The train crew will receive a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is in the train and has taken the booked seat Y.
If the train driver comes to Y when checking the ticket, he knows that there is a passenger with an online ticket that has already been paid off.
We can therefore continue to sleep, continue to work, remain silent.
The "check-in" has two advantages: One for the customer, one for the train - which in turn should benefit passengers.
"If you want to travel without ticket control by our train crew, you simply check in the DB Navigator.
This allows passengers to organise their travel time on the train more personally, "says Michael Peterson, DB's Marketing Board.
Second Plus: "And our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs."
People who often travel by train know that, in addition to delays and missed trains, the driving card controls are one of the biggest irritants.
Because often you do not have all the documents you need to validate online tickets yourself, but in any case one of your fellow travellers does not have all
Either the credit card or the identity card is missing or any other document you need to show.
The result is endless discussions between train crew and passenger, which leads to a bad mood in the section or in the greater area, delays in checking your own ticket, and finally gives conductors the time to deal with other issues.
Only a small number of test customers can use the new service.
And only on the connections ICE 915 Dortmund-Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart-Essen.
Further race numbers on the same track are not yet activated.
How an activist came to learn the answer to the question: "Whose Streets?"
On 9 August 2014, BUNK any Ferrell was shaken to its core.
Just a day after she arrived in New York City, the St. Louis buildings were sitting on the bed of an Airbnb apartment, which rented and scrolled through Facebook on her phone.
She stumbled over a post from someone from high school.
"The police have just killed an 18-year-old child, and it is still on the street," it said.
Confused, because no one else posted the information on their feed, closed it Facebook and opened Twitter.
A user with the handle @ TheePharoah was constantly rescued on her timeline.
The rapper from the area of St. Louis was about to live tweets the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old black man killed by a white policeman in Ferguson, Mo.
He poted an image of Brown's lifeless body, which was stretched out on the street and would stay there for four hours.
"That's wild," Ferrell thought.
But death was nothing new for them and their community.
She moved her mobile phone to return later in the evening to tweets about people on the Canfield-Drive.
There were photographs of the police band and people who cried, and of a man who claimed to be Brown's father wearing a sign saying: "Ferguson police have just killed my unarmed son!"
She observed a live feed where a policeman stood in front of a group of demonstrators with a bark dog.
In another video, she said, another policeman escaped his gun and cried: "I will kill you... animals all."
"This is not usual," Ferrell reminded himself of her statement.
"This is not the kind of murder to which we have become accustomed and which we can call typical."
At this moment I felt chills.
I was angry and wept. "
She booked a return flight and went home the next day.
After landing at 11 p.m., she took her 6-year-old daughter out of her father's house and decided that the two would go to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened in the following three years with Ferrell and Ferguson is the theme of a new documentary, "WUNK Streets?," in cinemas starting from 11.
It is a story of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and resilience that consists of the people who live in the community and who have filled the streets to demand answers.
When Ferrell drove to Ferguson with her daughter, wearing a flower dress and a matching crown, the two had a conversation that they had "about the black experience and the black state" many times before this morning.
"You remember, as I taught you, when black people have to fight for what they believe?" She remembered what she said.
"We are now going to Ferguson because the police have killed an 18-year-old boy and that was not right.
I could not take her with me, "said Ferrell later.
"What happened today is a climax of what happened in the past.
She must know and see it and be brought up in it.
It must be well developed, not only activism and organization, but also the various layers of black experience and the black constitution, and what we must do to become free in order to free ourselves.
Although I am lucky to give her an experience in which she personally does not experience blatant racism, she is no different from the next black woman child.
I feel I would be doing her a bad job of keeping them out of it. "
The first station, when they arrived in Ferguson, was on the South Florissant Road, a place facing the police authority, which became a Campsite when activists were waiting for the possible non-prosecution of officer Darren.
There, Ferrell and her daughter joined a local business owner who had lunch.
They created pockets and helped to pass them on to demonstrators.
Slowly, a new type of activism for Ferrell's shape began to take shape.
"My activism changed completely after August 9," she said and noticed that she was a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis president of the Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on eating justice.
"I had no experience in organizing.
Everything has come. "
Weeks later, Ferrell met one of the film's co-directors during an evening demonstration Sabaah Folayan.
Folayan said that she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar only wanted "document" what happened.
One question came to Ferrell's mind: "Do you want to document or try to find a story you can exploit?"
This skepticism has been fed by countless cases of people, often white people, in a community that has benefited from their pain and resilience.
As Folayan said recently in an interview: 'We had heard that people born and raised in Ferguson did not center their voices and we wanted to do it differently'.
Folayan had already worked with the co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the field known for his activism around Todestrakt inmates.
His commitment brought Ferrell closer to the project, and together with six other locals, he followed the team of "WUNK Streets?" In the years following Brown's shooting.
"This documentary is not someone who speaks to us or speaks to us," said Davis.
"This was the main thing for me as these people are presented, because that is how I will be presented."
The goal was not to focus on Ferrel's experience - to show that the movement "was not a Messiah leader, but a community that came together," FolayUNK said.
As a result, documents of "WUNK Streets" show surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrells's life as she falls in love and marries her wife.
"I felt like naked," said Ferrell and laughed when she saw the finished product for the first time.
"But I understand that there must be some vulnerability in this work and in the humanisation of black people."
In addition, Ferrell's story repeats the role of black gay women in the wider Black Lives Matter movement.
Two of the three founders of the movement who, after the killing of the black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012, marked the film "BlackLivesMatter" in social media identify themselves as gay.
"Black, gay women in leadership positions have taken the movement as a whole," said Ferrell, "and therefore we are constantly fighting on various fronts.
Black, gay women must bear the brunt of everything. "
Folayan agreed to note that "the movement is really maintained by black women and many black women."
She insists, however, that "this is not an affirmatic type of action," in which Ferrell was chosen as the heart of the film due to her identity.
"She was the person who rocked this energy," she said.
"It is no coincidence, although she was in the front line, because in a life at these crossroads as a black gay woman so much is at stake.
You can feel your energy through the screen. "
Meanwhile, the news cameras in Ferguson have long since disappeared, but the racial links between the community and the police continue.
Ferrell is on probation for 2 ½ years due to the blocking of a highway at a demonstration.
It describes the socio-political atmosphere of the area that it calls its home: "Chaos."
However, she is clinging to a musical and she feels committed to this memory since she took to the streets in Ferguson three years ago.
"It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It is our duty to win.
We must love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose except our chains. "
From "dream" to "megalomania": TV readers discuss bit gallery.
The bit gallery moves people, although it is not yet built.
But the idea of a shopping centre on the southern end of the pedestrian zone has divided the population into supporters and opponents since the first presentation in 2009.
The topic hardly leaves one.
The topic is also discussed on our Facebook page "Volksfreund Bitburg."
While some say to the bit gallery: "This would be a dream" (Anja Becker) or "That would be real class" (Nicole Schausten), comes from the other side: "Do not need any man" (Siggi).
While supporters rely on a gallery to attract more customers to the city, which also benefits the rest of the shops, opponents fear that the pedestrian zone will then be bluffed out.
In addition, the gallery is planned exactly on the land where the farmer market hall is located, where 13 direct-marketing companies offer their products.
This will end with the start of construction work.
The Gallery-Macher wants to integrate a market hall into the new building - to Beda-Platz with possibility to sit outside.
Simone Zimmer: "We have been buying in the farmer's market hall for many years.
Mainly our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of the ladies of the land.
We have also discovered the butchery for us.
We would like to see a chance to keep this offer alive even during and, above all, after the construction of the gallery.
In other cities, this is also the case.
Especially the Kleinmarkthalle in Frankfurt is interesting. "
Gerd Densing: "Whether direct marketers settle in a market hall in the gallery, the amount of the rent depends on the amount of
But this is not likely to be very low in the new project. "
Eva Kilic: "Why shopping columns in Bitburg?
Whether clothing, shoes, drugstores or supermarkets, I find that superfluous.
There are enough of them in our town.
You can see how many shops are empty here - some for months and years.
However, since there is not even a regular weekly market, it is all the more important that we keep at least the market hall.
After all, the goods on offer there are fresh, most of them offered directly by the producer and are, on top of that, cheap.
As you can see, shops in a shopping centre are rented only by larger companies, because the rents there are often not acceptable to a retailer.
It is a pity that there are almost no more special deals, and what remains of them will probably disappear. "
Wolf Fandel: "A shopping centre with a market hall does not fit together for me.
And the gallery does not fit to Bitburg.
Above all: Where should the farmer's market hall go during the period of construction?
The old Edeka would be the solution - even in the long term, if the bit gallery actually comes at some point.
Or does the UNK Bit Gallery manage to sell all shops from Bitburg before? "
George Marquet: "This will simply not work.
And no one needs a shopping centre that is empty.
In my opinion, it would have been better to promote a real farm market, rather than this gallery.
But for a farmer's market hall, there is no room for pointless construction projects in Bitburg, thanks to the crazy number of them, I think.
If the farmers' market hall is destroyed, a piece of culture will disappear again. "
A fitting similarity: Artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mannings DNA
In the middle of the room of the Fridman Gallery in New York there are many faces to be seen - white, black and brown, which are almost imperceptible - hanging from the ceiling on cables.
The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-Tupfern and haircuts, sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent the excerpts from Fort Leavenworth prison, where the former Intelligence Analyst served a 35-year sentence after making secret diplomatic reports on the WikiLeaks website public.
The new exhibition, which was opened on 2 August, is called A Becoming Resemblance (A Beoming Resemblance).
She is the product of two years correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline united her expertise in technology, computer science, and art, and Manning, a transwoman and groundbreaking dissident whose conviction was only transformed by Barack Obama.
Dewey-Hagborg has created through the algorithmic analysis of DNA extracted by Manning and from which 30 portraits have been created how someone with these genomics data might look like a sharp interpretation of the terminology, even some intellectual commentary.
Manning, born as Bradley Edward, who has spoken openly about female identification since her puberty, was sentenced in 2013 for 20 charges, including six breaches of the espionage law, computer fraud and theft.
Through the prison her image was suppressed, so much so that there was only one photograph - a grained black-white Selfie in which Manning was visibly unwell sitting on a driver's seat and a platinblonde parrot.
In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg just came from the great success of her 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'.
In it, the artist produced portraits of strangers from forensic artefacts such as cigarette sleeves and chewing gum by extracting the DNA from the waste to produce an image of what these people might look like.
This was the time when she received an email from a newspaper magazine.
"They conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison, and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," explained Dewey-Hagborg at a press preview of the new exhibition.
And she could not be visited at that time, and she could not be photographed, so you contacted Chelsea and asked them if she wanted to make a DNA portrait.
The artist and her imprisoned Muse became unequal briphew customers, who over two years exchanged several letters.
They even created a comic "Suppressed Images," illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, "which foresaw a future in which President Cheltenham's judgment would be transformed and would be able to see the exhibition in person.
Indeed, the fact that Obama would demand Manning's release in a military prison in Kansas only a few days after the book was published was a welcome kind of happy coincidence.
There is also now something low and heavy at the opening of the exhibition, because Donald Trump is waging a war against informants from the government camp and against Transgender troops to find new, tweetable ways, actually to fix the divisions.
When Dewey-Hagborg was asked about the strange timing of all these things, she said that "things happen for a particular reason."
In an artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery, Manning called for an end to "automatic fragmentation," the basis of which was gender, race, sexuality, and culture, with its overlarge signature (the "i" is attached).
On the opposite wall, her mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousandth of Cs and Gs and As, is written in pencil.
Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show how surprisingly similar, at least in biological terms, we are all by including the 200 letters (or nucleotides according to the artist's sophisticated scientific lexicon).
"What people will hopefully take away from it is that our genome does not care about who we are and how openly genetic data is for an interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video work is.
"DNA data can tell so many different stories, so that is 30 of these stories."
The last piece in the exhibition, which is kept in a separate room, is a page from the comic novel mentioned above.
She shows Manning how she appears in her hand from the United States "disciplinary barracks like King-Kong with a free phone.
"When they cold your speech, they won," they say.
"So never stop talking."
"It came directly from a letter she wrote to me," said the artist who greets from Philadelphia.
"I still get goose goose when I talk about it."
Manning has not seen the exhibition personally - as anticipated in the comic book - but if she should do it, then she will be greeted in the middle of the room by the masks, by her own protestors.
This was also purposeful, as everything in the exhibition, up to the size (5 "2, man's statue), in which their genetic haplotic groups were written with pencil.
"In the past I had them on the wall, but I wanted them to feel like a crowd," said Dewey-Hagborg of the portraits.
"I wanted it to feel like a mass movement formed with Chelsea, like the movement that was also behind her liberation."
Professor of Northwestern University and an employee of Oxford University for killing
A nationwide crowd hunt is underway for a professor at Northwestern University and an Oxford University employee who is being sought as suspects after a man was stabbed with deadly injuries in a luxurious Chicago apartment.
On Monday, arrest warrants for murder were issued for Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) for their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau Cook, as shown.
The documents say that Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after several stitches.
A Community alert system published by the Chicago Police Authority states that the body was discovered on 27 July.
Officials received a call, arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body.
Cornell-Duranleau was still declared dead at the scene, and detectives investigate the bull as murder, while the police actively look for the two suspects, officials said.
Lathem has been an extraordinary professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, Vice-President for University Relations, said in an e-mail statement that Lathem had now been left out and had been excluded from entering the campus of Northwestern University.
"This is now a criminal case under investigation by the competent authorities, and Northwestern University is cooperating in this investigation," said Cubbage.
Warren is Senior Treasury Assistant at Oxford University.
A speaker from the University and Somerville College said in an e-mail statement that "we are in contact with the UK police and ready to help the US investigation authorities in every possible way."
The statement added that Warren's colleagues were shocked and want him to stand up.
Chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Authority, Anthony Guglielmi, said he urged suspects to face up to the authorities.
"The police have an idea of their whereabouts, and our efforts to locate them are intensifying," said Guglielmi.
Guglielmi said that local, regional and national authorities are helping to find the suspects.
Guglielmi said that the police received a call from the manager of the Grand Plaza building, who had just received an enigmatic tip saying that something had happened in flat 1008.
The police described the scene as very cruel.
Guglielmi said that it was unclear whether the incident took place on 27 July.
It was confirmed by security cameras that Lathem and Warren were in the building.
"We believe that Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," said Guglielmi.
The management team of Grand Plaza published a statement to the residents: "The police is currently working on the timeline and the background of the victim and explores a variety of motives, including a possible domestic incident."
"We will conclude the WADA Roadmap in the near future" - Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mutko
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said that it will not be long before the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) are implemented for the restoration of Russia's Anti-Doping Agency (Rusada).
"At a certain stage of fulfilling the criteria of the Roadmap, Rusada has been given the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD (UK Anti-Doping).
The WADA roadmap has been updated in this respect, "stated Mutko on Thursday.
The PM commented on the second part of WADA's compliance roadmap, which describes the criteria for the re-establishment of Rusada and was recently published on the organisation's website.
According to Mutko, it does not contain anything that might give cause for concern to Russia.
"Everything has been announced, everything is being implemented.
And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA in the near future, "he added.
One of the criteria set out in the list, however, is that the Russian anti-doping authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the WADA's investigation by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren on alleged state-sponsored doping in Russian sport.
With regard to the matter, Mutko said: "We are conducting the investigation because our anti-doping system has admitted a mistake.
All measures have been implemented.
But there were no government programmes and we will not admit anything that does not exist. "
Mutkos's words were in agreement with those of Vitaly Smirnov, head of the independent Russian Anti-Doping Commission.
Talking to the Russian sales office rsport at the beginning of the day, Smirnov admitted problems of the past in Russian anti-doping organizations, but added: "We have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations.
No one intends to accept this report unconditionally, "added Smirnov.
In November 2015, following the doping scandal, Rusada was excluded from the conduct of doping controls in Russia by WADA.
However, it has been allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK anti-doping (UKAD).
Following a visit to Moscow in July by the head office of the organisation, WADA Director General Olivier Niggli said that Rusada is "moving in the right direction" to
Aldi does not sell eggs for the time being.
This was shared by the groups of companies.
It was a purely precautionary measure that no further health impairment could be assumed, as stated in the communication.
From now on, only eggs are likely to be delivered to Aldi, which has been shown to have been tested negatively on fipronilhalUNK anti-lamination products.
Aldi's aim is to provide clarity and transparency to its customers.
The start-ups that will help your company not to become the next resort.
Amy errett wanted to measure the luck of your e-commerce start-up with your employees, but the surveys did not work.
Responses were often vague, unhelpful, or, worse, fraudulent.
And even if you promised anonymity, some workers did not trust the process.
"There was simply never consistency and objectivity," said Errett, who runs the 75-person San Francisco e-Commerce Hair Care Society Madison Reed.
It has called people from outside for help.
A new breed of Human Resources Start-ups is growing up to help companies find out how their employees feel.
By creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee involvement, it enables companies to conduct surveys, address specific groups and demographic groups, allow employees to provide anonymity and complaint hotlines directly to executives, and in some cases whistleblowers.
"You now have tools such as Strava and Fitbit to track your health, but where is the Fitbit for your company?" Said Jim Barnett, co-founder and Chief Executive of Redwood City Start-up Glint.
He said that she gained a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with Glint.
In addition to snap surveys and surveys by certain teams, it offers a heat card of the company that shows at a glance which units have most complaints and which executives have low approval results - so that you can emulate.
Companies come to realize that they must remain at the forefront of the workplace culture, so that you do not become the next Uber involved in scandals since a former employee describes a blog post that has been a nuisance environment.
For start-ups like Glint, this desire for an overview is a lucrative business opportunity.
Global governance, regulation, and compliance could have more than $118.7 billion worth in 2020, according to the financial website Let's Talk Payments.
Denver, Colorado, Start-up Convercent, which helps companies prevent and recognize bad behavior, saw an increasing interest and activity earlier this year in the midst of the Uber case discredited.
Convercent has nearly 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
About has recently registered as a client.
Like Glint, Convercent lets companies send customized "pulse" surveys, collect confidential responses in real time, and view the heat maps of their problem areas.
It also provides an anonymous SMS hotline that allows employees to report bad behavior.
And when the Chief Executive Officer is involved, complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board.
"The court of public opinion recorded the regulators," said Patrick Quinlan, founder and managing director of Convercent.
If a company is found that treats its employees badly or behaves unethically, it can experience costly consequences through consumer boycott, worker turnover and lawsuits, Quinlan said.
Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and more than 500 locations, has deployed Convercent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of politics and procedures and have a simple way to reach their headquarters.
In the past, when an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a telephone number or e-mail for the company's central office, file a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously.
It was often intimidation and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesdays General Counsel, who said there was no good way to follow the complaints of staff.
Now that the company uses Convercent, problems previously hidden by executives sitting in offices in cities or states - such as discrimination, harassment or unfair practice - can be identified and addressed more quickly.
"I can get closer to this holistic, 360-degree view into the experience of employment," said Vitrano, who runs the risk management group of Ruby Tuesday.
"And we protect our shareholders from employment disputes."
Companies began to take ethics, values, and employee engagement more seriously in 2002, after the accounting firm Arthur Andersen collapsed due to ethical violations by the Enron scandal, Quinlan said.
But it took the "social media to get to their right," that companies recognized that they could not prevent their dirty laundry from going online.
"Before using technology to monitor ethics, people used hope as a strategy," he said.
Both Glint and Convercent offer your software as a service and charge companies with recurring fees for using their products.
It is a business model and an opportunity that finds the agreement of venture capital investors who have supported both start-ups.
Convercent received $10 million in funding in February from companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, raising the total capital to $47 million.
Glistening secured $10 million in November from Bessemer Venture Partners and brought its total funding to $60 million.
These investments are hardly surprising, given the interconnected nature of companies, culture, and venture capital.
There is a growing complex of research that shows that today's employees expect more from their jobs than they have done so far.
In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are only stakes.
The employees want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you are giving your time to a company with a positive mission.
"If people are glad to be in a company that belongs to their voices, and that the work you do is worthwhile, lint, they feel more committed to making this company a success," said Nina McConverits Global Experience.
Investors get returns when their portfolio companies run well, and companies run well when employees engage and are engaged.
If the third party analytics tools promise to increase the commitment and use of the employees, it is no wonder that you will find support.
The data on employee engagement according to the experts of the workplace culture is important.
But the data is useless if the managers of a company do not take action.
In fact, if a company asks staff for your feedback, it can have an expectation that change is on the way.
And if change does not come quickly enough, or not at all, it can breed disappointments and demotivate employees.
"If you ask for 4,000 suggestions, you must be ready to have 4,000 talks," said Russell Raath, President of Consulting at the Business Management Company Kotter International, who has seen companies relying too much on collecting data.
"Because if you do not follow employees will ask themselves," Do you really hear me?
Do you take care of this?
And who do you not care about it, why should I? "
Madison Reed, who is now conducting monthly employee surveys, was able to take action on the same day when a problem is reported about Glint, he said.
And after collecting feedback from frustrated employees, she was able to reorganize several teams within the company and add a communication training to address the problems through the speed of decision making and the quality of communication.
At Ruby Tuesday, the company is increasingly gaining new insights into its employees, and it hopes that in the long term, this will lead to a better binding of workers in an industry known for high turnover.
"If you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency, you will lose people," said Vitrano.
"And if you lose people, you also lose customers.
And if you lose customers, then you will lose companies.
The NCAA eliminates two-day practices and makes a long day for Bruins
It starts at 11 pm, when a lot of UCLA footballers talk on one side of the team's new training fields on campus.
Some have pulled out their tricoons and show their backs full of sweat from the first day of the training camp.
For a good part of the team these days are a lunch break.
After the three-hour exercise, players enrolled in the summer courses will return to their final examinations before returning to the Wasserman Football Center at 6: 30 the next morning.
"This is a real treadmill for the guys the next three days," Bruins coach Jim Mora said shortly before Monday became Tuesday.
The NCAA eliminates two-day exercises to ease the load of players, and has actually extended their days - at least until the final on Friday.
Therefore, the UCLA's first three courses should start at 19: 15 to meet the already packed schedule of the players.
The compromise away from the two days is more than a day when the Bruins moved the beginning of the camp almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Moras conducted six exercises in Westwood.
They will perform 18 exercises during August, 20 before the formal preparations for their start against Texas A & M in September.
Mora said that he supported the rule change of the NCAA, even if they add another point to the multiple routes of the players.
"We place this enormous burden on them three or four days, and it is very challenging," Mora said.
"And they simply pushed it through, they continued to crack, they are great people.
I think as soon as we come to Saturday and we have more time, it will really be great. "
The UCLA will end its practices once the camp is finished, which, given the clear visibility of its fields, will not light its use behind an adjacent car park and the adjacent Luskin Center, a superior-class hotel that has already been thrown a footballs.
Bruins players are expected to occupy the hotel this weekend, but Mora admitted that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season.
"We will use our security," said Mora.
"This is a real problem and it is not far-fetched to think that people rent a room there and then prepare themselves to perform an exercise.
If you have the video and of an exercise, it is a pretty good business.
But we have security forces there, and we have security forces in car park 8.
We will do the best with what we have.
I am not, therefore, very concerned about this
We have a plan. "
Facebook wants to step up factual review in the fight against fake news
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with false messages to third party verifiers and then display their results under the original post, said the world's largest online social network on Thursday, it is one of its efforts to fight fake news.
In an opinion on its website, the company said that it would start using updated machine learning methods to identify possible misreporting and to send it to facten examiners, who might be the result of the factual
Facebook has been criticized as one of the main distribution points for so-called fake news, many of which believe that they have also influenced the US presidential election in 2016.
The problem has also become a major political issue in Europe, with French voters flooded with false stories in the run-up to the May presidential election, and Germany is supporting a plan that seeks to punish social media networks there if it does not.
On Thursday, Facebook said in a separate statement in German that a test of the new facts will be launched in the USA, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
"In addition to recognizing what stories are being challenged by fact-verifiers of third parties, people want more context to make informed choices about what they read and share," said Sara Su, Product Manager for Facebook News.
She added that Facebook will continue to test its feature on the "related article" and work on other changes to its news feed to reduce false messages.
Creating a comic novel: A Castle in the History of England
In his recent past, the little Scotney Castle was seen in a squeeze music video and was a loophole for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970 "s and 1980" s.
But Scotney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history from his cosy seat in the Bewl River Valley in Kent and has now become an inspiration for a graphical novel by Jamie Rhodes, a mophaarigen Yorkshireman.
"I find it so nice to look at the handwriting of someone who has been dead for 300 years," he says wistfully.
"What a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hands."
A Castle in England 'spans the period from the Middle Ages to Edward and documents the families who lived in Scotney.
It is not the first book of Rhodes based on an archive: In 2014 he wrote 'Dead Men Without s Teeth and Other Stories', a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project he found emotionally.
"I only reacted to the permanent print on the side of a letter written by a double agent in the 1700's who worked for the UNK iner," he says.
"This is his permanent impression!
And letters always smell for smoke, because at that time a fire was lit because of light.
For someone who lives 300 years later, the smell has an effect as if he were there.
Ach, I love archives! "
For someone who is so beaten with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived in a castle for almost four months ("To be honest, I have a little overvalued my welcome!"
Rhodes spent his days exploring the Victorian "new" castle, watching the archives, and studying the many treasures and curiosities of the castle, such as the painted hydesheads on the walls, and the bottles.
He wandered through the grounds and ruins of the old castle and talked with landscape paths, gardeners and sometimes also with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book.
Then, at night he drank "Whiskey and began to write."
The intimate history of Scotney is relatively unknown, as the National Trust only gained full access in 2006, when the last Erbin, Elizabeth Hussey, died.
When Rhodes arrived a decade later, employees just started to look at the archive he described as "hundreds of years in which aristocrats said" Oh, put it on the attic. "
Diaries, letters from English Empire, maps that show who owned what: "One might think that land conflicts would be boring," says Rhodes, "but there was a birch fighting for the two families.
Guys, let everything go! "
Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a base for discovering English history on a wider basis, including 'The labourer', which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle in 1381 in order to emerge.
"There is a record of a revolt that occurred in the castle in 1380, in this book entitled 'Knightly UNK es of Kent and Sussex'," says Rhodes.
"The farm uprising started in this area and I thought an uprising was a good start.
Perhaps the two are interconnected? "
Other stories are deeply rooted in the history of the castle - such as' The Priest ', which tells the story of the Jesuit pater, which the Darrell family hid for seven years during the English Reformation.
Or 'The Smupper', where the smugglers Arthur Darrell from the 18th century is depicted, who staged his own funeral by filling a coffin with stones (a discovery that was made years later).
The Darrells are Rhodes's favorite family of Scotney: "The gentlemen seemed to be pretty crooks, repeatedly making debts and spending money on things they could not afford.
Other generations of Darrell men solved their debt crises by married rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of good-looking boys, with a talent to promote the inside. "
After finishing his work at the castle, Rhodes is searching for other unique writing experiences.
He spent a two-week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about EläUNK mäki, the site of an early 20th century sanatorium, which has since been claimed back by nature.
But Scotney has a special place for him.
"I was sad to go again," he says.
It was like: "Ah, now I have to deal with my damned life again."
Campaign launched: Over 300-year-old St. Mary's Chapel in Rhöndorf covers
On Friday, the town of Bad Honnef launched its campaign for the introduction of a new roof brand (Thursday's round show) with the unveiling of the 301-year-old St. Mary's Chapel in Rhöndorf.
Until Thursday Mayor Otto Neuhoff and his marketing team around Nelson Artz want to keep the logo and slogan secret.
At the end of August there will be a party on the island of Grafenwerth as the highlight of the campaign.
"Too good for us.
Or?, "ask the makers of the action since yesterday on the posters at the Rhöndorfer Chapel.
"We don't really think (of course!)," write them on their website, which was opened yesterday.
"But we use this measure to attract your attention.
And to make it clear that some things are better than they seem.
In fact, we firmly believe that we, as the Bad Honnefer, are well aware of the beauty and attractiveness of our city. "
The action is about more than "just" one logo and one slogan, it goes on.
"We need to make a stand-alone promise, one that gives the city a unique unique selling feature."
After all, it is in competition with other municipalities.
The city of Bad Honnef can cost a middle five-digit amount of its new roof brand and campaign.
Military reforms in Turkey - Erdogan's fear of the army
Every year in early August, the Supreme Military Council (YAS) advises on retiring and promotions in the officer corps in Ankara.
That is also the case this week.
At first glance, a normal process.
But nothing is routine in the Turkish armed forces one year after the coup attempt.
The meeting was no longer held in the building of the General Staff, as was the case in the past, but in the Prime Minister's office.
Under the chairmanship of the Heads of State and Government, the five Deputy Prime Ministers and the Ministers for Defence, Home Affairs, Justice and Foreign Affairs also participated in the discussions.
As a result, civilians in YAS were in the majority.
The government is tightening up in the military.
The Chief of Staff, Hulusi Akar, remains in office, but the commanders of the Army, the Air Force and the Navy have been removed.
Since the failed coup, head of state Erdogan has fired 169 of the 326 generals and exiles.
More than 10,000 soldiers have been removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of alleged ties to the movement of the exiled preacher Fethullah Gülen, whom Erdogan sees as the leader of the coup.
486 people, who are supposed to have been directly involved in the coup attempt, have been negotiated in Ankara since this week.
Even the day after the coup, Erdogan had described the coup attempt as a "gift of God," giving him the opportunity to "clean the armed forces completely."
But is Erdogan really in control of the army?
At the end of February, the newspaper "Hürriyet" published an article entitled "UNK im Military Headquarters."
At the General Staff, there are concerns about the increasing "Islamisation" of the army, which is manifested, among other things, in the lifting of the ban on the headscarf for soldiers, wrote the newspaper.
In any case, the police and security forces continue to do so.
In mid-July, Erdogan fired another 7395 civil servants by decree, including 2303 policemen and 546 soldiers.
It seemed that Erdogan tamed the military.
The generals used to be the real masters of the country.
Three times, they played their role as guardians of the secular state order.
After his election in 2002, Erdogan pushed the military's power back step by step, not least on the basis of the European Union's reform objectives.
Former officers say Erdogan is deliberately driving an Islamisation of the armed forces.
In the magazine "Vocal Europe," a non-named officer who sought asylum after the attempted coup for fear of persecution abroad warned that in a few years the Turkish army would be "full of extremists and Salafists."
If that is the case, such a development could not leave NATO cold.
In any case, after the cleansing, there are doubts in the Alliance about the Turkish army's commitment.
The management structures and operational capabilities are "weakened," say NATO diplomats.
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
There will be a new US immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card, said President Donald Trump, quoted by the media.
It provides for the reduction of legal immigrants to 50,000 per year, stricter rules for obtaining visas for a temporary work permit and restrictions on family-oriented visas.
The new rules are proposed by the Republicans and supported by the President.
The draft law is to be discussed in the two chambers of Congress.
"This law will reduce poverty, raise wages, and save billions of dollars for taxpayers, and will do so by changing the way citizens from other countries are spending green cards."
The law will prevent chain migration and replace the current system.
This new application procedure will benefit candidates who speak English, who have the financial resources to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy, "said Trump, quoted by the American media.
Ministry to clean up track for racetrack shuttle
Over the past few months, there have been many disputes about the future of the racing caravel - now it is about to happen very quickly.
Before the end of the year, it is planned to build on the rough route on which the tourist railway runs.
In order to ensure the long-term future of the racing slope, works on the track are expected to start this year, according to the Ministry of Transport.
"With the decision to continue ordering and renovating the Ilmenau racetrack, the country is committed to this important link for tourism," declared Transport State Secretary Klaus Sühl on Friday in Erfurt.
He estimated the cost of repairing the track to around EUR 2.5 million.
Of this amount, the country accounts for 75%.
The contract on the basis of which the shuttle will continue to be ordered by the country is currently being finalised, Sühl explained.
The Ministry and the Südthüringen Railway as operators already agree on the technical details.
"This means the road map, the vehicles used and the quality standards negotiated," said Sühl.
The planned contract between the Ministry and the railway company will be concluded for a period of eleven years.
This was intended to be the regular order of the RennUNK shuttle on December 2017.
The RennUNK-Shuttle is a train service between the railway stations Ilmenau and RennUNK, which is especially popular among tourists.
In recent months, a pilot operation has tested whether the track is used by a sufficient number of people to order it again in a regular manner in the future.
The route is also very poor in parts.
The rise of sex robots is real, and we should worry about it.
Just when you thought that it could not become even more crazy in 2017, a new report on technological developments in the field of sex robots comes.
Yes, indeed.
Sex robots are a big thing at the moment.
Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years.
According to Noel Sharkey, emeritus professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at Sheffield University and cofounder of FRR, we must begin to take their rise seriously.
Customers can choose the robot's eye color, the shape of the chest warms, and the type of nails.
"People are making fun of them, but companies are delivering a lot of them, and we will see them much more often," said Mr Sharkey when he published his new report.
Modern sex pups have evolved from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with deliberately human reactions, achieved by artificial intelligence.
The user can also "customize" his robot according to his beliefs, choosing everything from the robot's eye color to the shape of the nipples to the type or color of his fingernails.
But it will be even more worrying, because many robots have the "personalities" that would make a Stepford woman look progressive.
Modern sex pups have developed into robots with a silicone skin.
The RealBotix robot, for example, allows its users to adapt their robots to the characteristics they find appealing, such as shyness.
And then there is the Roxxxy Gold sex robot, developed by True Companion, with pre-programmed personalities like "Frigid Farrah," which gives the impression of shyness and "Wild Wendy."
"Roxxxy Gold has a personality that is adapted to your personality as well as possible," warms the website of True Companion.
So she likes what you like, and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc.
In the course of the day, she also has her moods - just like real people!
She can be tired, fixated on conversation or she can be "in mood"!
There are many worrying aspects of this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace true human relationships - but the submissive female characteristics that allusions to rape when one takes a step towards Frigid (this is called.
On his website True Companion Roxxxy compared with a vibrator, but for men.
"If women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can men not have Roxxxy?" Says the website.
However, these sex robots are not just a fetish or just another sex toy.
Their emergence and their increasing sophistication point to something darker and deeper in our culture, a retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with submission as an optional addition.
Most men will, of course, not hold sex robots, and while the FRR notes its growing popularity, they remain on the fringes of consumer culture for the time being.
But what leaks out of the peripheral areas can be very instructive in terms of the spirit of the time we live in.
And many people are not strange or offensive until the free market gives them permission to do so.
There is a certain overlap that these highly developed sex robots are appearing at a time when women's rights are under threat worldwide, when there is a president in the White House who has boasted of sexually attacking women.
The most detergent aspect of the TV series' The Handmaid Method s Tale '(' The Report of the Magd ') are not the graphic images, the winding body and the broken eyes, but how realistic this vision works.
The Republic of Gilead is a leap, but at the moment it does not feel like a great leap.
The aim behind these sex robots is to make a physical similarity to actual women as realistic as possible from a technical point of view (albeit with pornstar proportions).
Their builders want them to feel human, to imitate the movement of a real body.
But, when it comes to their "personalities," the robots are not real women.
You cannot separate yourself from your companion or just go away.
They have no mediation or background history, nothing that indicates independence or anything that could disturb the imagination of total submission.
In other words, they are bewildered slaves.
Or, to put it in the 2017 speech: Maids
Trump's great achievement?
He makes Mitt Romney the epitome of common sense
It has become a truism of the Trump era that the political divisions that polarized the US electorate have also divided small-scale families.
Around Christmas and UNK UNK fest, newspapers in the US gave advice on how to deal with Trump's chosen relatives "horror.
We are all supposed to make our filter bubbles burst.
Less attention has been paid to Trump's power to bring families together.
I mention this because my cousin, a left-wing poet who lives in Chicago and has long worked with the Republicans in our family, visited me this week in New York.
She reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.
With Trump in the White House, everyone she knows, including the Republican kinship with whom she had fought for decades for politics, is suddenly and quite strange on the same side.
That is certainly a good thing about dining table, but it strikes me in another context that it also entails considerable risks.
Trump has strengthened the left, but his presidency's output has the strength to push us all to the right.
When we talk about "normalization" and Trump, we refer to the great possibility that his kittens will one day stop us.
But there is an even more terrifying long-term scenario in which Trump "normalizes" right-wing Republicans, "who suddenly appear to be the epitome of rationality relative to his standards.
I find myself affected today by an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's original comic version of the spine - the dog on the roof, which is 14% income tax (but at least we knew how his tax return looked like the two criminal).
If Trump goes, the Republican's next candidate must be only mentally healthy to qualify as immeasurable improvement.
When my cousin was in town, we brought our children to the carousel in Central Park, the biggest carousel in the New York Park Department, and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don't.
The horses are enormous, the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are crispy, and the animals rotate around to look beyond their own shoulders - extremely dark music and the climing.
So many clichés disappoint a city: The views of high buildings become old, the skylines become too familiar to offer much excitement, and the reality of the city does not live up to the dream.
Thirty-five years later, and I am still not quite across the day when I discovered that Swiss Cottage is indeed not a Swiss cottage - the theme pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage does not count in the north - but a big
However, the Central Park carousel is still a strange magical experience, as two two two-year-old, one 11-year old and two women in the 40-year-old can go to it and all have a great time.
If I could have assessed the carousel, I would have given him the full score, but fortunately no one asked for it.
On the other hand, this week in a department store, I was forced to evaluate my "experience" with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could move my credit card.
In the cafe on the corner of my street, it is the same, plus the option to compare the rating with a 15% tip - this to buy something about the counter.
This not only slows down what should be a neutral exchange, but also puts pressure on the server to introduce personality into a situation in which no one is required.
The poor woman at the department store was inexcusable while I was tired of having to offer her my five-star credit card.
Oscar Pistorius transferred from prison to hospital with chest pain
Pistorius has, for the second time, left the prison for a hospital visit.
Last year, he was taken to hospital because of the treatment of cuts on his wrist, which, according to the prison authorities, he suffered after a fall in his cell.
Pistorius was convicted of murder following an appeal by the prosecutors against a first dead pack.
He killed Steenkamp in the early hours of Valentine's Day 2013 by shooting them several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pretoria.
Pistorius claimed that he thought his girlfriend was a nightly intruder who hid in the cabin.
The prosecutors have announced their intention this time to appeal against the six-year prison sentence of Pistorius, from which they say that it is too lenient.
The National Public Prosecutor said that it would appeal to the South African Supreme Court and the appeal could be heard this year.
Pistorius runs the risk that his sentence will be increased to 15 years if the prosecutors are successful.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
As Bauer Arnold finds a strange egg
As the last of the Blumberger schools, the four-school pupils from FUNK and Epfenhofen were laid off for their holidays and for secondary schools.
Three of the AbUNK UNK will go to high school in the future, four to the secondary school.
School manager Angelika Sitte welcomed the parents and representatives of the public at the UNK haus Biesental in Epfenhofen on Tuesday evening.
As a symbol of the school leaving, the 29 students of the four classes, led by Sophia Schumacher and Regine Meder, chose a young eagle growing up in the chicken farm but then released into freedom.
In addition, the mUNK Schar performed a musical entitled "Der Adler im UNK hof."
Bauer Arnold found a strange egg and let it breed from his chickens.
Instead of a chicken bag, a small eagle came out.
But the hope of making him a chicken was shattered, the eagle spread out his wings on a high mountain and escaped.
After that the classes three and four showed a chicken dance in the enema of Yvonne Frank.
The hens danced with the young gockles that wore cylinders to the bet.
The eagle stands for integration, said schoolleader Angelika Sitte.
The young animal is different from the other kittens (chicks) but belongs to it.
But he will never be like a chicken.
His provision is to be free.
She wished every four pupils to feel at his new school.
Thanks were given to the former head of the school, Michael Müller, who repeatedly jumps in to teaching passports, and the parents' representatives.
The kitchen season is now over, according to school teacher Sophia Schumacher.
After two years of teaching, they are very reluctant to leave their students, because it was a really great time.
In the end, they were able to rely on the four-graders.
At the end all students gave a song of summer time and holiday time.
It was a great pleasure for children.
Eight first grade pupils have already been registered for the new school year.
Two Bulgarians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
Two Bulgarians were arrested for illegal campings in Greece, informed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, quoted by television.
On the morning of 1 August, a group of illegally camp people was arrested in Sithonia by the police, including the two Bulgarians.
On the same day, they were released, while an investigation is under way.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported to bTV that the Bulgarians were later released.
The Greek authorities have tightened up control of the free campground and impose substantial fines on anyone found to stay in a place that is not intended for this purpose.
The checks will continue throughout the season.
The Ministry said that the Court could impose a fine.
Software update for diesel vehicles: What stakeholders need to know now
How exactly does the software update take place?
Do diesel drivers have to take part in the campaign?
The most important questions and answers in the overview.
At the diesel summit, BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW Group offered software updates for a total of approximately 5.3 million cars.
They are intended to improve the exhaust performance of cars of the emission classes Euro 5 and, in part, Euro 6.
Euro-4 diesel or worse diesel are excluded from this.
Anja Smetanin of ACE Auto Club Europe estimates:
Is the new action mandatory?
No, the software updates negotiated are voluntary.
"The mandatory updates previously apply only to the vehicles that have cheating software," says Anja Smetanin.
The Federal Office of the German Federal Republic (KBA) has ordered their retrofitting.
How and when will customers be informed about updates?
Manufacturers have announced rapid implementation in the coming months, but have not yet given a precise date.
Daimler has announced that it will write to all interested parties.
If an inspection is due in any case, it will be done within the scope of the inspection.
How long will the overall upgrading take?
"Hard to say," says Smetanin.
This depends on the commitment of the manufacturers and on political pressure.
"Because we have seen that car manufacturers are not acting voluntarily on the environment."
How long should the update take?
The retrofitting itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop.
It may be more time-consuming to get a date.
What do motorists who do not drive cars from BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW Group do?
The ACE advises you to wait.
According to Smetanin, foreign producers would probably follow suit.
Is there a risk of a massive fall in the price of Euro 4 cars?
The ACE fears this.
But it is precisely in the regions where driving bans are at risk.
In rural areas, there has been no loss of value for older diesel.
The ACE advises to wait for a sale.
Ll Cool J wins Kennedy Center Award
The Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most glamorous events in Washington.
President Trump's first award ceremony promises to be political.
One of the winners does not want to come - out of protest.
Ll Cool J (49) is the first rapper to receive one of the prestigious Kennedy Center awards.
As the cultural direction announced on Thursday, this year also includes singer Gloria Estefan (59), Lionel Richie (68) and the choreographer Carmen de Lavallade (86) and the TV producer Norman LeUNK.
The awards will be presented at the beginning of December.
Traditionally, US President Donald Trump will host a reception and attend the ceremony with his wife Melania.
The winner Lear, who was announced with progressive TV series, has therefore already announced that he will not participate in the gala.
He said to the New York Times: "This presidency has chosen to neglect the arts and human rights completely - even to deprive them of the means - and that is a burden on me."
59-year-old Estefan stressed that she would use the conversation with Trump to make her point of view clear.
The Kennedy Center, named after former President John F. Kennedy, is the largest cultural institution in the US capital.
Former winners include Meryl Streep, Aretha Franklin, Robert De Niro, George Lucas, Tom Hanks and Sting.
We make the city alive.
Roland Wacker, Haslach's urban builder, is retiring next year.
The post has already been advertised, but suitable candidates are scarce.
For 31 years, Wacker Stadtbaumeister has been a city builder.
And the work still gives him great fun, as he mediates in the press conversation.
He reports on varied but demanding tasks waiting for his successor.
At the same time, he is surprised that no application has yet met the requirements profile.
The city is looking for an architect or civil engineer at the earliest possible time.
For example, with due regard for the regular notice periods, there is still enough time to get in.
Since Haslach functions as a sub-legal authority for the administration of the administration, the applicant must present the corresponding qualifications.
The city wants to keep this function in any case.
If it were no longer able to fill it, citizens would have to travel to Offenburg for advice.
But bringing the city closer to its citizens is important, says Wacker, who reports on a good working climate and good mood between the public and the public.
In more than 30 years in office, some of the significant projects that Wacker is proud to see back on have been collected.
"We make the city worth living," he is sure about the building office and its staff.
But in the future too, varied projects are on the agenda: The transformation of the former Hukla area and the Niederhofenparkplatz, for example, is underway.
The cinema bridge between Bollenbach and Steinach is being renewed, the stadium reconstruction is still a topic.
The latter alone will cost around EUR 1.5 million, "if we do it right," Wacker estimates.
"All in all, there are great tasks waiting for my successor.
The work here is fun. "
There is plenty of room for a city builder in design.
With Haslachs's own farm and fermentation shop, it is possible to react flexibly to many things.
"You can move a lot," said Wacker, and the design of green areas is often praised by citizens and visitors.
Since the old town is listed as an ensemble, it is important to "have an eye on what fits in," when new buildings are approved, the outgoing city builder emphasizes.
In any case, the city builder has a high responsibility.
He is a builder, "in the end everything is going over my table."
He can count on long-standing employees in the field of supervision and coordination: Markus Neumaier (Hochbau) has been in the process for the past ten years, Manfred Schöner (UNK bau) has been working for 15 years.
Also, Wacker wants his successor to stay long, "We're looking for someone who really wants to identify and stay with the spot."
This is because continuity is important not only for a good working climate, but also for the further development of the city.
Anyone who wants to bury Roland Wacker should have completed a degree in engineering or Bachelor's degree in architecture, according to the city of Haslach, and have a good knowledge of planning and construction.
The town building office is subject to civil engineering, construction management, property management, municipal farm with building yard and town gardeners, as well as sub-civil building authority including monument protection.
Bicycle thrown on lines: Southern railway line blocked
According to the police, the previously unknown perpetrators had thrown the blue bicycle from the train track in the area of Leobener Straße (B116) onto the lines.
They were so badly damaged that the approaching freight train had to be stopped.
The investigators are based on two male perpetrators and have been looking for them since the night hours.
A rosy scooter and a bicycle driver had been observed near the scene of the crime.
"This goes far beyond a coup d'état," said ÖBB spokesman Christoph Posch on the APA.
The perpetrator or the perpetrator would have put himself at great risk and also threatened train traffic.
In addition to the damage to the Lok and the plant, as well as the delay and the cost of rail replacement traffic, railway customers may also be liable to the perpetrators.
On the whole, the speaker said that a "substantial" sum was to be expected.
The damage was fixed again on Friday afternoon and rail traffic on the southern railway line could be carried out without any obstacles.
Almost ten passenger trains were out of service on Friday morning, two of which concerned long-distance transport.
Freight trains were not cancelled, but they were delayed.
According to ÖBB spokesman Christoph Posch, about 200 metres of overhead lines had to be replaced.
Insulators and masts were also damaged.
Red meat, dairy products and chocolate could help IBD (inflammatory diseases) to be used in the market.
Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.
But a new study claims exactly the opposite: A diet rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products could be the symptoms of patients with inflammatory intestinal cylinders.
The incurable state, which affects about 1.3 million people in the United States and 300,000 in the United Kingdom, causes gastries and vesicles, recurrent or bloody diarrhea, weight loss, and extreme fatigue.
Whereas those affected will usually be advised to avoid meat and dairy products in order to tip their symptoms, researchers at Washington University found that the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins helps to develop immune cells.
The chief researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells patrol the intestine in order to ensure that harmful microbes hiding in food do not enter the body.
Cells capable of triggering inflammation are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues.
If the balance tends too far towards inflammation, this may result in inflammatory disease.
Experiments have shown that a kind of tolerance-promoting immune cell is present in mice that carry a particular bacterium in their receptacles.
And the bacterium needs Tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the cell appearance.
Professor Colonna said: "We have a link between a bacterium species - Lactobacillus repteri - which is a normal part of the intestinal microbiom, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.
The more Tryptophan the mice had in their food, the more they had from these immune cells. "
He suggested that the combination of L. UNK teri and a diet tolerant of Tryptophan promotes less inflammatory Darmmilieus, if the same system also hits humans.
The postdoctoral student Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan studied a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when she found that a group of study mice had such cells, but another group of the same tribe was separate.
She suspected that the difference had to do with the mice "Darmmikrobiomes - the community of bacteria, viruses, and fungi that usually live in the gastrointestinal tract.
The mice 'DNA-sequenced DNA DNA and six bacterial species were found, which were present in the mice with the immune cells, but without them were missing from the mice.
Mice were raised in a sterile environment, so that they lacked an Darmmikrobiom and did not develop this type of immune cells, and they were born the L. UNK teri and the immune cells.
In order to understand how the bacteria had an impact on the immune system, researchers L. UNK teri grew in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of liquid - without bacteria - to immature immune cells isolated by the mice.
The immune cells became tolerant cells.
When the active component was purified from the liquid, it proved to be a by-product of tryptophan metabolism known as Indol 3 lactic acid.
If researchers double the number of tryptophan in mice "feed, the number of such cells increased by about 50%, but if the tryptophan values were halved, the number of cells fell by half.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that humans have the same tolerant cells as mice, and that most of us protect L. UNK teri in our gastrointestinal tract.
It is not known whether Tryptophan by-products from L. UNK teri develop cells in humans as in mice, but defects in genes related to Tryptophan have been found in people with inflammatory inflammatory disease.
She said: "The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote, because these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the ms.
Potentially high tryptophanvalues in the presence of L. UNK teri can lead to an expansion of this population. "
Jose Mourinho believes that Manchester United has committed Nemanja Matic to a "genius."
At Manchester United signed a "genius" with Nemanja Matic, Jose Mourinho believes, after the midfield player made his debut against Sampdoria on Wednesday evening.
The 40 million pound of Chelsea signature began with a 2: 1 victory in Dublin, the last pre-season game before the UEFA Super Cup against Real Madrid starts on Tuesday, and impressed in the keeper's role as Paul.
Matic, however, was excluded from the preparation-Asia tour of the Blues and managed only 45 minutes what Mourinho admitted that he had to improve before the Premier League season began.
"He needs time, but his experience, intelligence, a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks soccer," said Mourinho.
"We will help him to be ready sooner than later."
In addition to Matic, Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku also started in the Aviva stadium when Mourinho formed his start-XI for the start of the season.
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho wanted another three new commitments, but insisted that the club had already done a "fantastic job" to meet three of its four priority new commitments.
"Three out of four to get, thank you to the club," he added.
"I will be happier if they get four out of four for me, but they have taken a great deal of trouble.
Boeing "paints" Dreamliner in the sky
The US aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the silhouette of a Dreamliner in the sky.
The pilots flew from Seattle to Washington in the US state, but the drawing began in Marquette in US state Michigan and moved in the form of a Dreamliner over the USA, which is several thousand kilometers.
The action lasted 18 hours and one minute.
On the radar screens was the shape of a Dreamliner.
The whole thing was a endurance test for new engines.
Boeing had previously made such advertising.
The number "787" and the Boeing logo were painted in the sky.
New downfall for Martin Schulz - Hannover, we have a problem
How the wind turns out: When Sigmar Gabriel was still the Social Democratic leader, before elections, social-democratic prime ministers always looked to Berlin with a degree of concern.
Just not a bonfire from the party's central office, just no headwind from the federation - that was the main wish of the campaign fighters.
This has changed radically since Martin Schulz led the party.
Since then, the members of the Willy Brandt-Haus have been watching with growing horror the events in the provincial capital of the SPD.
What Schulz got from there since the beginning of the year would not even be described in the approach with headwinds.
They were low-cost.
One by one.
After the surprising end of the red-green majority in Lower Saxony, the CDU sees a general signal against coalitions of the Social Democrats and the Greens.
"This shows once again: Red-green simply cannot reliably govern," said CDU Secretary-General Peter Tauber of the editorial network Germany (RND).
The surprising outturn of a Green MEP has plunged the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) into a severe crisis.
Five months before the country's election, his red-green coalition lost its one-vote majority to the opposition from the CDU and the FDP.
The Green Federal Chief Executive Michael UNK ner has asked Elke TUNK to give back his mandate to the secessionist Dutch Green MEP.
The transfer to the CDU means a clear distortion of the electorate's will.
Elke TUNK must immediately return her mandate, "said the German Federal Executive and campaign leader of the Greens to the editorial network Germany (RND).
"This must not be true," a SPD campaign sighs when on Friday morning the new message of hatred reaches the party's central office.
Stephan Weil, Lower Saxony's Social Democratic Party (SPD) prime minister, is elected to the CDU without a government majority after the transfer of the Green MEP Elke TUNK.
It is the preliminary culmination of a whole series of large and small crises in the SPD regional associations.
And nobody knows what will happen next.
The plight began with the unexpected clear defeat in the Saarland elections in March.
A blue eye, no more, the comrades at the time calmed down.
After the regional elections in Schleswig-Holstein and North Rhine-Westphalia everything will be different.
That then became the case - and things got much worse.
The defeat in Kiel brought the Social Democratic Party to the hive, the Düsseldorf bust flattened the party.
The comrades racked up with difficulty in the weeks after.
Then, when they had just had fresh courage, the G-20 summit in Hamburg came.
And with him came the next low.
Mayor Olaf Scholz, the last strong SPD governor, lost his nibus this weekend because he sat in the ElbphilUNK while his city burned.
And because, in crisis communication, he subsequently miscalculated everything that can be done wrong.
Since then, Scholz has been fighting for his political survival.
Now also Stephan Weil.
The Prime Minister of Lower Saxony has been criticised for a long time because of the Volkswagen exhaust gases affair and his role on the Supervisory Board.
Miese survey figures were added.
Despite this, or perhaps precisely because of this, Weil has been increasingly trying to focus on the Federal Government in recent weeks.
The ambition of the former mayor of Hannover to expand his power in Berlin was not concealed by comrades in the vicinity of Martin Schulz.
They allowed him to do so because they promised Weil to stabilize the party.
Now the exact opposite could happen.
In fact, Weil is not to blame for the party-internal dispute between the Greens in Lower Saxony.
And Schulz certainly not.
For the time being, the comrades are trying to keep their own ranks closed.
Their anger is directed at the Greens, and especially at the dissenters, TUNK.
"It is intolerable and anti-democratic, as Mrs TUNK puts her own career interests before the interests of all the others," says Matthias Miersch, head of the party left in the German Social Democratic Parliament's editorial network.
Mrs TUNK has not been elected to Parliament on the basis of her person as a direct candidate, but on the basis of the list of Greens in Lower Saxony, according to the Dutch MEP.
The logical consequence would be for them to give back their mandate.
Thomas Oppermann, head of the SPD-Bundestag, lamented an "undemocratic maneuver."
"The electorate's vow four years ago was clear: The people made Stephan Weil Prime Minister," says Oppermann, who leads the Lower Saxony Social Democratic Party as the top candidate in the parliamentary election, the RND.
"Now a future CDU member's personal career distorts the election result," Oppermann continued.
He asked for information about the background.
I would like to know whether there has been more or whether there have been more far-reaching promises from the CDU Lower Saxony.
Aid for the centre of the city III
Anyone who wants to clean up his house, which has been run over the years, will soon be able to get support from the country.
Mayor Albert Schindler and three representatives of STEG urban development informed in UNK gen on Wednesday.
At the start of the information event, Schindler once again gave an overview of what has happened so far.
Since 1991 there have been clean areas in sensitive areas.
At that time, in the rehabilitation area I between 1991 and 2004, the Land of Baden-Württemberg took over two thirds of the funding.
In the redevelopment area II from 2005 to 2016, the grant still stood at 60%.
As far as Schindler is concerned, the renovation work so far is a "success project" - it is important, after all, to promote interior development and not only to open up new areas of construction.
On 4 April, information was received from the Regional Bureau of Karlsruhe that there will be a remediation area III.
EUR 833 333 of which EUR 500 000 would come from the country and the rest would be sensitive to the municipality.
What is the development of a clean-up area?
One would, he continued, investigate where the "really old" houses are.
But it is also important to assess whether there is any interest in the planned area.
If necessary, the territorial limits could also be shifted again.
STEG represented Martin Keller, Gaby Pietzschmann and Sarah Gotzel on Wednesday evening.
Keller presented the contents of the federal-Länder programme "Social City," in which the remediation would then be carried out.
The programme focuses on the revitalization of inner cities, the improvement of living and working conditions and the maintenance and expansion of infrastructure.
The measures would be implemented by means of object-related measures, that is to say per piece of land.
The renovation area would then be finally laid down as a statute.
The allocation period for the funding will continue to run from 1 January 2017 until 30 April 2026.
However, by September of this year, the inventory would be carried out to fill out a questionnaire to the people involved in the remediation area.
As far as possible, the decision on the articles of association is to be taken in November or December with a view to starting the renovation work next year.
Pietzschmann then explained that each municipality had to carry out these preliminary investigations.
The aim is to assess the problems of urban planning and to decide when it will be rehabilitated and to what extent.
A clean-up note will then be entered in the land register for the respective plot.
Pietzschmann himself will come back to sensitivities and get a picture of the situation, she promised.
Gotzel stressed that a key success factor for the project was the participation of stakeholders.
There will therefore be questionnaires which will be sent to the citizens in the coming weeks and can be completed by the end of the summer holidays.
The yellow questionnaire is the "building and land sheet," which deals, among other things, with the building condition and the renovation plans.
In the grey questionnaire, the "household and apartment sheet," information can be provided on the size, division and inhabitants of a living room.
The blue "operating sheet" must only be filled in if business premises are operated in the building.
However, it should be noted that Gotzel pointed out that a completed questionnaire was not simultaneously an application for funding.
In addition, new construction measures are not eligible.
Schindler also stressed that the distribution of the funds works according to the "Greyhound" principle - first come, first served.
You cannot "reserve" funding for later on.
Finally, photos of the "UNK II" project were shown in order to make a remediation "tasty" to those present.
British inventors set themselves a microchip to come into their homes and cars with a handmotion.
A British inventor is the first in the country to have a microchip so that he can open his door, enter his office, and even start his car with a handmotion.
Steven Northam, 33, had implanted the tiny chip between thumb and index finger and now offers the service to companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology by his company BioTeq.
He joined Dr. Geoff Watson, an advisory anaesthesisten in the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester, Hants, to ensure that the implant process is carried out according to medical standards.
The technology resembles a cat and dog implanted microchip and takes only 30 seconds.
Mr Northam's company would also like to change locks on houses and cars in such a way that they are compatible with the chip, all for a surcharge of £300 per castle.
The married father of one has now installed technology at home as well as at his BMW Z4, which begins when his hand is at the wheel.
The White House's advertising costs cost thousands of taxpayers
The White House's decision to fly a naval helicopter to the South Lawn for an event that highlights American manufacturing last month costs taxpayers up to $24,000, according to the military's accounts, which were left to the TIME magazine.
The green-white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One, when the president is on board, was the heart of the event on July 17 in the White House with American building programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice-President Mike Pence, and senior White House officials made a tour of products from all 50 states.
The helicopter, manufactured in Connecticut, was issued next to a Maine yacht, a Wisconsin firecar and a Mississippi forklift truck.
The military office of the White House demanded the presence of the helicopter in a fragmentary order or Frago, barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn, according to the records of the Marine Helicopter Squadron One.
"I just wanted you to be aware of this, because it is such an unusual event with high visibility," wrote the commander of the HMX-1 on the eve of the event to his commander, the deputy naval commander for aviation.
The news showed that the helicopter arrived at the South Lawn at 3 p.m. on 17 July at 7 a.m. for the event, leaving the lawn between 18: 00 and 21: 00 this evening.
The note adds that if the departure from the White House was to be delayed, a second team would be needed for the return flight due to the limitation of the hours of service.
The original flight crew was at the helicopter during the event, while the security personnel of the unit remained on the ground during the time.
It was not clear from the TIME records that a second flight crew was eventually required.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using state property for political purposes.
Records indicate that HMX-1 asked if the event could violate the rule.
"One question we asked was whether it was an infringement of the hatch act and we were informed that this was not the case," the commander wrote.
"Sounds as if you are closed," the Deputy Commander replied.
The "Made in America" event was designated by the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act.
But official events also have political overtones.
At the event, the President gave impetus to the reform of the health reform that was underway in the Senate, and he suggested efforts to contain government regulations.
The use of the aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One for politically beneficial purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.
Presidents are obliged to use them for travel.
But requesting your use only for a photo-OP is unusual.
Trump conducted an investigation in February, when the presidential aircraft provided taxi services against the background of his first campaign rallye in Melbourne, Florida, and his Twitter account is full of news about the president's use.
"The White House is enthusiastic about the show" Made In America "- which shows products from all 50 states produced by American workers using American materials," said the White House's deputy press secretary, Lindsay Walters.
HMX-1 crews often perform training flights in the Washington and South Lawn areas to degrade the US president in the White House with precise penalty rates.
When Trump was at the G-20 summit in Germany in early July, HMX-1 conducted 58 exercises in the White House.
The flight for the "Made in America" event counted in the training needs of flight crew for the month, a civil servant said.
Helicopter units also flew 11 hours this day for "Non-Presidency Support Missions."
The White House said that taxpayers took the burden on none of the other props presented at the event.
One speaker from Sikorsky said that the company was not involved in issuing the helicopter on the South Lawn.
HMX-1 does not have any budget records for the presidential flights, and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event.
However, according to the US Department of Defense's Stundentarifen for the financial year 2017, the DoD refund rate for the VH-3D is $24.380 per flight hour.
The unit records the flight time of the aircraft more than 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Facility in Quantico, Virginia.
The White House argues that the actual costs of running the helicopter are far below this rate.
"Fixing the cost to taxpayers on the basis of the estimates for the refund rates is highly misleading," said Walters.
"These estimates include staff, maintenance and many other hidden costs included in the annual budget."
According to a 2015 RAND study, the reimbursement rates for DoD do not include personnel costs but take into account the cost of fuel, maintenance and conclusion of the contract.
At that time, Sean Spicer, the former White House press officer, defended the use of the helicopter for the event.
"The idea is to present this week things that are made in America," said Spicer.
"And I know that Sikorsky and Connecticut are very proud that they contribute to our national security, and I expect hundreds, if not thousands, of people to depend on it.
And I think, like most Americans, we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked tirelessly.
It is, of course, appropriate to highlight this. "
It was not clear whether Trump interacted with the helicopter when he entered his tour of the South Lawn for the event, but he sat in the driver's seat of a fire-fighter car.
In the White House, Trump addressed Sikorsky's representatives and joked with the media about his own fleet of corporate products.
"I know Sikorsky very well," the President said, "I have three of them."

The TC UNK-Weiss Neuss starts tomorrow at 11 am in Kiel at the table endUNK suchsdorfer SV.
Despite five matches, the top runner of the second tennis league still has a sense of reality.
Team chief Marius Zay has respect for the opponent.
"This is a compact team that always plays in a fairly similar formation.
Especially on the back positions I find the team very good. "
In particular, the imports from the far north are responsible for class and stability at the Suchsdorfer SV.
"Their Danes and Finns can even point to the Davis Cup.
And they are also strong in double, "says Zay with views of Harri Heliovaara (Finland), Andre Göransson (Sweden), SUNK and Esben OUNK, Martin Pedersen (Denmark).
"As always, this will be difficult for us.
You also need a good dose of happiness. "

However, he should be present in Kiel as well as Botic Van de ZandUNK p, Niels Lootsma (both Netherlands) and the Belgians Julien Cagnina.
After his two victories last Sunday against the club at Alster, Máté Valkusz could re-join the team.
If it is not enough for the 18-year-old Hungarian, who was still the number one junior world ranking in January 2016, someone from the Marius Zay coaching team is filling the cader.
How America can damage OMV
Donald Trump was not really happy when he signed the law to tighten sanctions against Russia on Wednesday evening.
"In his rush to enact the law," Congress has packaged a few "unconstitutional regulations," he said.
The response from Moscow, too, was as sharp as expected, and even Brussels was ashamed of the US push.
After all, the proposal provides for punishing European companies that help Russians to build gas pipelines into the EU.
Investors from the local OMV, who together with other European companies co-finance the construction of the Russian Nord Stream 2 Baltic gas pipeline, have been similarly worried since then.
The threatening backdrop is enormous.
However, it is too early to assess the consequences, according to the oil company's official statement.
Indeed, Donald Trump himself would have to bring the sanctions to life by means of an executive order.
He has twelve weapons at his disposal.
"The press" has looked at which the Group could defend itself and which could really hurt it.
Narcos UNK 3 Trailer: Without Pablo Escobar, the Cali Cartel will be put at the centre of the Netflix series.
Despite the second season of Narcos, unveiled by Pablo Escobars Killer, the series of Netflix is far from over.
The seasons three and four have already been confirmed by streaming service, the first received their first trailer and showed the latest bad guys of the show.
With the third season, the DEA has focused its attention on the richest organization of drug trafficking in the world: The Cali cartel.
Led by four powerful individuals, they operate "like a Fortune 500 company" only with more government bribes and violent actions.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) is the leader of the cartel, Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) is her head, Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) located in Rapacchio the Mexican connection, and ChSEQUENCE_END
In the newly released trailer, Pedro Pascal returns as Javier Peña, the type that invites Colombian and American law enforcement agencies to support the war on drugs.
Other new actors include Matias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishe and Arturo Castro.
The third season of Narcos will start on 1 September.
Role backwards: The city supplies 46 kitchen aids
The city organizes the Kita lunch table again.
With regular contact points for the children and an assignment to the team.
The clock is rotated back in the urban crèches.
On 1 September, the city of Krefeld takes over food supply in the urban children's day facilities (Kitas) again in its own hands.
For Sonja Pommeranz, Deputy Head of the Department of Youth Assistance, this is good news: "We have all been very pleased."
Cooking is also out of the house: A caterer takes over this task and supplies fresh, chilled dishes.
The town operates 46 day-care centres in the Krefeld area, in 44 children get a warm meal at lunchtime.
In the past year, 2800 children each sat at the tables, and demand is growing steadily.
"Meanwhile, not only children who are cared for 45 hours a week are eating at Kita at noon," explains Pommeranz.
"The offer also applies in 35-hour care if children stay until 2 pm."
46 part-time employees have kitchen services starting on 1 September: They warm up the food supplied, supplement it with salad, raw food and fruit, portionate the meal individually, give out the food, clean the kitchen.
"The employees are assigned to a Kita," says Pommeranz.
The size - there are two-group as well as seven-group institutions - determines the range of hours.
"The kitchen helpers are now firmly part of the Kita team," says Pommeranz satisfied.
"In this way, they are much more integrated and it is easier for the authorities to implement educational concepts."
That is also what it is all about: Healthy eating and cooking lessons.
"The children should help prepare food."
The direct connection of the kitchen power to the team makes sense.
Also for children.
"They have a known force in Kita, a person who is familiar to them, and not constantly changing people."
This continuity is important for children.
The cleaning of the Kita rooms - which has also been the task of the kitchen staff - will in future be done by special cleaning staff.
This variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - has in addition to improving the quality of kitchen performance the charm that it has proven to be the most economical press agency in comparison with the cost of ownership and outsourcing of the city.
And that, even though 46 part-time workers are rehired.
"But these hours do not matter so much for around 750 people in the educational sector," says Sonja Pommeranz.
Afghan democracy depends on the political role of women, says the UN
Elections can only be representative if all members of society, including women, play a role, said the head of the UN mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday.
Nicholas Haysom, President-in-Office of the United Nations Mission, said that hundreds of women will stand in the provincial Council elections, with three women standing for the role of Vice-President and more than 30% of newly registered voters.
"The role of women cannot be overestimated," he said in a statement on Wednesday.
Elections can only be truly representative and credible if women participate fully and are involved in all parts of the election process.
Afghan elections to the provincial council and presidential elections will take place on 5 April.
The Taliban have published threats against an election process that coincides with the transition from international hostilities to an advisory role.
This year, for the first time, the elections will pass power peacefully from a democratically elected government to the next.
Haysom said that a strong role for women will reinforce Afghanistan's democratic success.
The Afghan Independent Electoral Commission reports that 1.2 million women are registered among a total of 3.6 million voters.
Walk to the TV jubilee
On the occasion of its 110 years of existence, the TV Kaiseringen invites you to a small walk with coffee and cake.
The hike starts on Sunday, July 9, at 13: 00 in Frohnstetten at the water reservoir in the American road.
From there it goes back to the airport, to the Natter and via the Waldhof to the water reservoir.
The walk lasts about one and a half hours.
After that, in Kaiseringen, in the school house, you will find coffee, cakes, cold drinks, string sausages and cheese-making.
If you need a car from Kaiseringen to Frohnstetten, you will find a meeting point in Kaiseringen at the school.
Men try to bait 13-year-old girls
Two young men aged 19 and 23 should have tried on Thursday to deprive a 13-year-old girl.
According to information from the police, the men spoke to the 13-year-old who stayed with friends on the Kolpingstraße at about 2.55 p.m. because they wanted to use the girl's mobile phone.
The 13-year-old rejected the request and went on with their friends.
Then one of the perpetrators tried to grab the phone and the necklace of the girl, but this failed.
The duo escaped without prey.
The two young men were later arrested by the police.
The investigation is under way.
GMB's concern about investments at McVitie factory in Glasgow
A trade union would like to verify with managers of McVitie, a biscuit maker, that it has a long-term obligation to produce at its factory in Glasgow.
GMB Scotland said that the company had remained silent about the future of anti-rabies investments.
More than 500 employees work in the factory, which produces biscuits alongside other Hobnobs and Rich Tea biscuits.
McVities's owner, Pladis, said that he has invested more than £5 million in recent years.
He added that if their activities were to change, employees and trade union representatives would be "first experienced."
In a letter to the company's subsidiary management, GMB Scotland McVitie Serbia asked it "to raise concerns that financing for the modernisation of production lines would not be pushed forward."
GMB Senior Organisator Drew Duffy, said: "The fact that we cannot obtain clarity from the General Site Manager about the business needs and investment plans for the future of UNK cross affects our members deeply.
Generations of families have worked here and the workforce is heavily concentrated on the local community and the Greater Glasgow area, an important pillar for decent employment in an area with high unemployment and social deprivation.
Thus, from the perspective of jobs, wages, and prosperity, and against the backdrop of Brexit, rising living costs, and chronic output decline, the eastern end of Glasgow urgently needs a thriving production presence at McVibeans. "
One spokeswoman from Pladis said: "Only yesterday, GMB Scotland sent a letter to the UNK cross department manager, and the company will respond directly to it, as we appreciate the continued commitment of employees and trade union representatives.
Two months ago, we had a regular meeting with employees and GMB representatives on UNK cross, where some issues were discussed openly.
We discussed with our employees that, like all companies operating in an extremely competitive and uncertain business climate, we are constantly reviewing our business - and this applies to all our businesses and locations - in order to remain competitive.
She added: "In recent years, we have invested more than £5 million in our anti-rabies location, particularly in production lines and operational improvements.
We fully recognise the heritage of UNK cross as a production facility and, if our operations change at the site, the employees and their trade union representatives will be the first to learn about it. "
Did the PSG Barcelona warn Neymar three years ago?
The side of La League may regret their interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain will continue its persecution of Neymar after making an offer of £189 million to trigger its release clause, but did they warn Barcelona three years ago of the world order invasion?
The sensational approach has fueled the transfer window in the summer, because the Ligue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than double the previous mark, with Paul Pogba Manchester returning to £89 million last season.
Neymar will become the most expensive player in the world and the highest paid professional athlete in the world, and PSG will offer wages of more than GBP 500,000 a week.
Barcelona is furious at the way Neymar forced his way out, although a source near the Catalan board insists that the club has always done its best to get him out of Santos since 2013.
But was the world of football warned three years ago by the PSG president of this prospect?
When Manchester City expressed interest in the signing of Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi warned every club that wanted to have one of the best players signed by PSG.
"I'm not worried because they know that when they touch one of our players, then we will stand in opposition to them, we will contact their players," said Al-Khelaifi.
"We respect all the clubs.
But if they try to sign one of our players, this will have consequences. "
Barcelona seems to have crossed this line, with the Spanish club expressing interest in the PSG midfield player Marco Verratti at the beginning of this summer.
PSG made it clear that they would not allow the International from Italy to leave under any circumstances, and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of its offers for Neymar.
Scooters thrown and damaged
On the night of Friday on Saturday, an unknown perpetrator deliberately threw off a scooter placed in KönigsUNK Straße in front of the estate number 30 and thus caused material damage of more than 200 euros to the disguise of the vehicle.
Police Schramberg, phone 07422 / 27 01-0, asks for information.
The police are looking for witnesses to an accident on the B 215 between Stolzenau and Leese.
As a car came up to him on his lane, the driver of a VW Touran had to evade and touted the control plan.
On Thursday evening, the 34-year-old from Rehburg-Loccum with his VW was on the B 215 from Stolzenau towards Leese.
In the area of Stolzenau, a car came to him on his lane, so he had to move to the right.
The tour driver toured the main planks.
Damage to property was caused by the car.
The driver of the next car, a Mercedes Benz, had overtaken a lorry and continued its journey without taking care of the road accident.
It may be good, according to the accident-stricken person, that the driver of the Mercef accident did not even notice the accident.
The police are now asking witnesses of the incident as well as the driver of the caused vehicle to contact the Commission at Stolzenau on tel. 05761 / 92060.
Interview: "Domspatzen report relieves Pope brother Georg Ratzinger"
The ReUNK burger Domspatzen report on abuses relieves Pope brother Georg Ratzinger.
This means author and historian Michael Hesemann.
The final report on the abuse scandal at the ReUNK burger Domspatzen continues to provide discussion.
Christian Weisnder, spokesman of the Reformed Movement "We are Church," declared after publication to the German Press Agency that he expects the Bishop of ReUNK burger UNK and today Gerhard Cardinal Ludwig Müller as well as the Cathedral Master Georg Ratzinger.
It would be of great benefit to the image of the Catholic Church if Müller and Ratzinger were to express their deep regret at their own omissions or their misperceptions of what was going on at the time.
The Vatican Chancellor, Osservatore Romano, criticised the use of "double standards" in the reporting of violence in the domes.
With regard to the attacks in Regensburg, no one doubts that they are "shameful and shameful acts" that must be punished and prevented in the future; but the "degree of media manipulation," according to the author Lucetta Scaraffia.
"The habit of calling the Catholic Church a source of all evils is already part of everyday life and prepares public opinion to consider it normal," writes Scaraffia.
Princess Gloria von Thurn and UNK also said in an interview with the Bavarian Radio: "You are happy to go to the church and this is a found fresco."
She also pointed out that in her youth, "blows were a very normal educational tool" to deal with cheeky children, as I was. "
It would be unfair to apply today's standards to previous decades, because the world has changed.
In connection with the reports of abuses, Pope brother Georg Ratzinger often appeared.
The author and historian Michael Hesemann, who wrote with Ratzinger the book "My brother of the Pope" (translated into 12 languages), is quite wrong.
"I have to protect Georg Ratzinger," says Hesemann, "because all this had nothing to do with him," he assesses the results of the final report.
What exactly does the 440-page report presented by the lawyer Ulrich Weber, appointed by the UNK um Regensburg with the Enlightenment, state?
A total of 547 ReUNK burger Domspatzen were sexually abused between 1945 and the early 1990s "with high plausibility" victims of attacks, 67 Domspatzen.
The final report refers to Georg Ratzinger, who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994: "In summary, therefore, it can be said that the master master of Domkapellinger R. used forms of physical and psychological violence in many cases.
It was precisely in the case of high emotionality that the punishment for the pupils could also be more severe.
Nevertheless, unlike many other accused people, many victims have appreciated R. 's general humanity, and therefore in many cases even have positive memories with him, despite violence. "
In the interview Hesemann explains why in his opinion the final report on the abuse scandal at the ReUNK burger Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger was relieved.
Mr Hesemann, the 440-page report on the "incidents of the exercise of violence against protected persons at the ReUNK burger Domspatzen" gives a contradictory picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger.
On the one hand, many students highlight their "humanity."
On the other hand, he also appears as a UNK eriker and perfectionist, who often became more tangible when a dome phrase did not bring music to the top.
How do you, as his biographer, view this final report?
Michael Hesemann: If you take the trouble and read all 440 pages of a report from the front to the back, you have to ask yourself why the name Georg Ratzinger actually appears in it.
He has just eight pages dedicated to him and is clearly acquitted of any suspicion of complicity or complicity in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.
The violence at the pre-school also occurred outside its sphere of influence.
At best, he could be accused of being too late or of not taking any initial suggestions seriously enough.
The DomspatzengyUNK sium, on which he worked, was perceived by virtually all those questioned as "redemption," "heaven" and "better world."
For example, the vast majority of his students Georg Ratzinger has an excellent record, describing him as "warm-hearted," "popular," "sincere," "competent" and "understanding," as a very good teacher.
Only a minority complains about his perfectionism and his high emotionality, which has sometimes led to outbreaks of rage.
He himself admitted years ago that he could not only crack with chairs and throw the keyrings on the floor, but also put the ear-cheeks on the hair or ears, and he deeply regretted and deplored himself for this.
In order to save his honour, however, it must be said that such educational methods were widely used in the time in question, the 1960 "s and the 1970" s, both for parents and for teachers.
Do you also know such breeding methods?
Of course, I think all of us who were born before 1968.
I, too, experienced this in a secular school, a state high school.
Compared to what this report is about, namely the appalling sexual abuse and the preschool violence, these are, of course, small-scale.
One wonders whether it has more to do with his reputation and his role as brother of Benedict XVI, that many media have just fallen on him.
Many of those who have never understood him are still working diligently on the Bavarian Pope.
The truth, however, is that the report relieves Georg Ratzinger of all kinds!
A great deal has been reported in the media in connection with the report on abuse in the ReUNK burger Domspatzen.
Is Georg Ratzinger also accused of any involvement or complicity in sexual abuse in the final report?
Michael Hesemann: Quite clearly no.
None of the 67 victims of sexual assault claim to have entrusted themselves to the master of the cathedral.
Not even the parents were inaugurated.
"I never dared to talk to my father or mother about it," said one of the stakeholders representing the others, "I was very embarrassed."
The real problem in raising awareness of sexual abuse was, and still is, that most victims are silent.
If they did not even trust parents and siblings, then certainly not a choir leader, who would have been a professional colleague of the perpetrators.
How do the Domspatzen students assess Ratzinger's role in cases of abuse?
As Michael Hesemann put it: "Concerning sexual abuse... I see no case... in which he (Georg Ratzinger) of all people could have had timely knowledge and stopped the perpetrator.
I think it... also really absurd to assume that it is he... boys have opened up more urgently, more clearly or more, than to their parents, boarding schools, confidence teachers, etc.
That you talk to him about sex... - unthinkable. "
For example, the report comes to the very clear conclusion that "the fact that pupils and / or their surroundings were entrusted to him in advance could not be confirmed in the course of the investigation."
As far as sexual abuse is concerned, Georg Ratzinger is therefore exempt from any complicity.
Nor can he be accused of not having prevented him or brought him to the polls.
There is therefore no reason to associate his good name with these vile crimes, as unfortunately happened in some cases.
In the media there was much to read about "UNK texzessen" at the ReUNK burger Domspatzen.
The former cathedral master Georg Ratzinger is accused in the report "UNK UNK."
Does he have to live with this accusation?
Michael Hesemann: This is the big problem that in the reporting everything was mixed and mixed up into a huge melange of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere in the middle, Georg Ratzinger.
However, this is precisely what is in turn an abuse of the report.
There is a clear separation between the pre-school and the high school of the Domspatzen, between sexual abuse and violence and, let us say, other accusations.
In addition, the report deals with incidents from the period since 1945, that is to say also from four decades when Georg Ratzinger was not the leader of the Domspatzen choir.
The whole terrible test pedagogy, the cases in which boys of sadistic teachers were actually harassed and maltreated and suffered terribly, all of which occurred at the pre-school in Etterzhausen and Pielenhausen.
However, Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do with them, because he only got the boys to face when they were already at the DomspatzengyUNK sium.
On that, as most witnesses emphasize, the topic "pre-school" was taboo.
One was only happy to escape her and enjoyed so much better treatment and for many even "paradise" conditions.
What was different on the DomspatzengyUNK sium?
Michael Hesemann: There was already discipline, but no sadistic violence.
This also applies to Georg Ratzinger, who concludes that "many victims have appreciated R. 's general humanity and that in many cases, despite violence, they even associate positive memories with him."
At most, there is still the accusation that we have looked away.
But, despite all the efforts made, the report could only define two periods during which it was reported about pre-school conditions.
The first time in 1970 / 71, when he just started to establish himself and did not want to hear anything about what happened at a school in which he was not active and responsible (according to the witness), and then again in 1993.
Did Georg Ratzinger consistently hide his ears before the conditions?
Michael Hesemann: No, because back in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the DomspatzengyUNK ums, which the report even reproduces.
In his report, he pointed out to him that "caning continues to be practised in the pre-school."
Even in view of the risk of negative press releases, he recommended urgent intervention.
This was, of course, at a time when there was legal clarity when caning sentences had long been banned in Bavaria as well.
Before that, they took place in a legal grey area, as everyone knows.
It was also difficult for him to assess where the people concerned were perhaps exaggerated or dramatic and where the permitted limit had really been exceeded.
Nor can we say that he has always looked the other way.
That is simply not true.
Only in 1980 was caning officially abolished in schools in Bavaria.
Princess Gloria of Thurn and UNK claimed that it was unfair to apply today's educational standards to those days.
How do you see this?
Michael Hesemann: We historians talk about the "trap of anachronism," that is, the danger of judging the past according to today's moral standards.
The princess is right.
But this does not, of course, apply to sexual abuse, which was always abhorrent and not to what was committed at pre-school against innocent children's parlours, which goes far beyond the practice at the time.
That is all very terrible and I am glad that it is finally being dealt with.
At the same time, however, I must protect Georg Ratzinger, because all this had nothing to do with him.
His means of disciplining and punishing, that is to say, earrings and pulling on the hair and ears, were widespread in the 1970 "s.
When physical punishment was then banned, he also strictly adhered to it.
What image of his ReUNK burger Zeit did Georg Ratzinger give in the conversations with you for the book "My Brother of the Pope"?
Did the subject of caning also come up for discussion?
Michael Hesemann: Well, the book deals with the life of his brother Joseph, Pope Benedict XVI, from his perspective, the Domspatzen played only a minor role.
Nevertheless, I do not deny that he had a strict regiment there.
But this must also be said: Without this perfectionism, without calling for unconditional discipline, it would hardly have been possible for him to transform the previously nationally known ReUNK burger DomUNK UNK in 1987 into an institution of world-class.
With biscuits and candies alone, you don't make recalcitrant boys big singers and you are faced with every success, no matter where you are, but always discipline, passion and self-wining.
What kind of man did you see Georg Ratzinger talking about her book?
Michael Hesemann: By working on the book and beyond, I got to know Georg Ratzinger very well and always as a wonderful, humorous, baseless, deeply believers and heart-good person, he could not imagine.
I regularly get to know how many former Domspatzen still today, 23 years after his establishment, keep in touch with him regularly, visit him, read him out - he is almost blind - and treat him as a member of her family.
So those who still do not forgive him for being strict with them are clearly in a minority.
Most of the Domspatzen are grateful to him today for enriching their lives and bringing the world of music to them.
And that he was always a good, paternal teacher - a strict father, sure, that may be - but also a amiable respecter to whom she still looks today and even devalues.
And please, again, let me make it quite clear that all that is being accused of them are educational methods that were on the agenda at the time.
We can be pleased that we have long since overcome this period.
But it is highly unjust to make a man, just because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother, a media scapegoat.
The bad intentions behind this are all too obvious.
Because the report that has just been published does away with it.
Now the decency would finally make a 93-year-old man, who has earned a great deal of merit and would not have known the ReUNK burger Domspatzen outside Bavaria and perhaps Germany.
