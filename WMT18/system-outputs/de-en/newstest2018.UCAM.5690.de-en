Munich 1856: Four maps that change your view of the city
A false institution where young people are supposed to meet today.
A crypt chapel where the S-Bahn tunnel is now being dug.
Small gardeners manage the former land of farmers.
The oldest official map of Munich promotes exciting stories.
It's annoying when maps aren't up to date.
Everyone knows this, who had to get upset because the car navigation system showed a green meadow instead of a bypass.
The historical maps of the digital Bayern-Atlas, an offer of the Geoportal Bavaria of the state government, are far from current - but for this very reason very revealing.
Especially if you compare them with current online cards.
Then it becomes clear how cities and municipalities in the distribution area of Munich's Mercury have changed since the 19th century.
The digital Bavaria Atlas is a patchwork that is not immediately recognizable as such.
More detailed maps, so-called Urpositionsblätter (Urpositionsblätter), have been incorporated into the large overview map for cities and municipalities.
According to the Bavarian Survey Administration, these were created between 1810 and 1864 and originate from the first survey of Bavaria.
Your client: Napoleon.
The French army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria.
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied land and commissioned a topographical recording of Bavaria - for military purposes, of course.
Even though the French troops finally withdrew with the peace of Lunéville of 9 February 1801, it was today's neighbours who created the idea of a comprehensive map of Bavaria.
Elector Max IV. Joseph drove the project further, founded the "Topographical Bureau" - and thus the Bavarian surveying administration.
The Urpositionsblatt for Munich dates from 1856 and, like all others, can be found on the website of the Bayerische Landesbibliothek.
The comparison between the former and the present is most impressive in the example of the state capital.
The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.
An example of this is Untersendling, which still appears relatively isolated in the map of 1856.
Sendling was incorporated as a district of Munich 21 years after the map was drawn up, i.e. in 1877.
Today Untersendling is located in the middle of the city.
The houses of Untersendling are concentrated around 1856 along today's Plinganserstraße, which was not named until 1878 after Georg Sebastian Plinganser, a leader of the uprising of the Bavarian peasants against Austria in 1705.
Where the Westpark is today, one sees nothing but fields - at first glance: When zooming in, a smaller map appears with dozens of lines and numbers: Handwritten numbered plots of land from the so-called "original recording," from which the property tax was derived.
Small plots no longer occupy farmers there today - but small gardeners of the "Land in Sun" plant.
A large green area is emerging north of Untersendling.
The Theresienwiese, the site of the Oktoberfest since 1810, was actually still a meadow in the 19th century - and not a concrete desert.
On the other side of the Isar, the historical map gives a glimpse into the history of psychiatric medicine.
In the Urpositionsblatt one reads not only the street name "am Gasteig" or "Auf der Lüften" - but also in large letters "Irren Anstalt" in the area of today's district Au-Haidhausen.
Yes, people with delusions were once locked up here on Auerfeldstraße.
In 1858 / 59 the Münchner Kreis-Irrenanstalt "Auf der Auer Lüften" was founded there.
From 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden headed the institution - the psychiatrist brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II.
"He was progressive for his time and ended, for example, the chains of the so-called erroneous.
He has also banned staff from using violence against the inmates,"says Hermann Wilhelm, head of the Haidhausen Museum, who has been involved with the institution for an exhibition.
There was room for 280 patients at first, later expanded to 500 places.
At some point, this capacity was no longer enough - the reason for the construction of the Kreisirrenanstalt in Haar in 1905.
The Isar-Amper-Klinikum München-Ost, one of the largest psychiatrists in Germany, has been located there since 2006.
On the grounds of the former Auer Anstalt, young people now meet in the Salesianum in Munich.
The Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and converted it into a youth home with training facilities.
To the west lies the football pitch of the TSV Munich East, east residential buildings from the 1980s.
In 2015, the children's house "Casa Don Bosco" was built - in architectural reference to the original building of the Irrenanstalt, which had been destroyed in bombings during the Second World War.
The Marienplatz was recorded as "Main Square" around 1856, the Kaufinger Street was called "Kaufinger Gasse."
The Second World War also brought about a decisive change in the heart of Munich.
The Allied bombs tore many holes into the city centre in December 1944.
A large one remained to this day - at the Marienhof.
The English Institute, small business houses and a medieval crypt chapel once stood at the Marienhof, where these days the preparatory work and on April 5, 2017 the groundbreaking ceremony for the second S-Bahn main line takes place.
With the slider you can compare the old Munich map with the aerial view of today - and fill the hole at the Marienhof.
Civil rights group releases travel warning for Missouri
The National Association for the Advancement of Colors has issued a warning for people of color traveling to Missouri because of the state's discriminatory policies and racist attacks.
"The NAACP Travel Advisory for the state of Missouri, which is scheduled to take effect by August 28, 2017, urges African-American travelers, visitors and Missourians to pay special attention when traveling around the state and exercise extreme caution, as a number of questionable, race-based incidents have recently occurred throughout the state and are noted here," the group's statement reads.
A recently passed Missouri law making it harder for people to win discrimination lawsuits, as well as the state's law enforcement agencies disproportionately targeting minorities, prompted the group to issue the travel warning, the NAACP said.
"They have civil rights violations that happen to people.
They are stopped because of their skin color, they are beaten up or killed,"Missouri NAACP President Rod Chapel told the Kansas City Star.
"We hear complaints at such a frequency that we haven't heard before."
It is the first such warning the Organization has issued for a state in the US.
The group cited incidents such as racist offenses against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died in questionable circumstances earlier in the year after he ran out of gasoline while traveling across the state and was taken into custody by Missouri police without being accused of a crime.
The council also points to a recent report by the Missouri Attorney General's Office showing that black motorists in the state are 75 percent more likely to be stopped than whites.
"The recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families, friends and staff about what could happen in Missouri," Chapel said.
"People need to be ready, whether it's bringing bail money or letting the relatives know they're travelling around the state."
Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest figures from the FBI's hate crime reporting program, which ranked the state 16th in the country in terms of the number of such violations.
The travel warning is also a response to a new Missouri law that would make it harder to sue a company for housing or employment discrimination.
Previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) had issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after states passed immigration laws requiring local law enforcement to arrest people for immigration violations, which the ACLU says will contribute to further racial profiling.
Travel warnings are usually issued by the State Department for other countries, but lately, advocacy groups have used the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the US.
Grazing fence project is elementary
The Fischerbacher Weidezaun project is a successful project and will continue next year.
CDU Bundestag members Peter Weiß and Kordula Kovac took a picture on the ground.
Representatives of the Fischerbach CDU local association met with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two deputies at the Schwendemann family's legal cemetery.
Markus Schwendemann first gave insights into his farm, in which he farms 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, supplies 40 dairy cows and as many young animals, and houses holiday guests in five apartments.
The "Black Forest milk" is for him the alternative marketing route for the milk of his cows, according to Schwendemann.
On the table of the holiday guests comes exclusively regional.
Since he is also BLHV chairman of Fischerbach, he described the grazing fence project as "elementary important."
I cannot make a profit on such steep areas.
The grassland area provides a lot of work, many things have to be processed with the motor sense.
"We are struggling here with the conditions and with the topography," Schwendemann stressed.
In 2003 he took over the parental farm and managed it without chemical plant protection and fertilizer, even if he did not run a organic farm.
For mayor Thomas Schneider, it was clear: "The commune has recognized the importance of the grazing fence project and is pleased with the Leader funding."
At a cost of between EUR 3000 and EUR 4000 per hectare, farmers would have to be supported.
It is hoped that the reforestation of the areas could be dragged out for quite a while.
"The greatest treasure we have is the people working in agriculture and worrying about how to get their farm on," the mayor insisted.
Farmers often face criticism for the promotion
A total of 25 parcels of eleven participants were fenced in 2013 via the fence promotion.
The disclosure area is thus 40 hectares, which are not allowed to be reforested until at least 2023.
Of the total cost of 71 500 euros, half was funded through Leader, with a quarter carried by the municipality of Fischerbach.
This left farmers with €12,610, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometres of pasture fence.
"The big advantage is the longevity of the fences," Schwendemann explained.
Kordula Kovac stressed: "You are doing a really good job, without farmers and rural women it is not possible."
For Peter Weiß, too, it was clear: "Best food is produced here."
The Landscape Management Directive (LPR) of Baden-Württemberg enables the state to promote pasture fences.
The aim is to keep the Black Forest open.
A prerequisite is the presence of a funding backdrop designated by the LPR.
In addition, the area to be fenced must not be traceable (inclination above 35 percent) and must therefore be threatened by afforestation.
The application of eight participants with 24 plots looking to build just under 16 kilometres of fence is currently under way for the Fischerbach Weidezaunprojekt 2018.
The disclosure area is 35 hectares and the calculated cost is more than EUR 112 000.
Is nothing sacred anymore?
Now the Trump White House Takes the Statue of Liberty
The surest sign of regime change is when they start attacking the statues.
The Americans appreciate this as much as any other - hence the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein in Firdos Square in Baghdad in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologues of the Trump regime, certainly knew what he was doing when he took a symbolic axe to the Statue of Liberty in a heated dispute with CNN's Jim Acosta over the president's proposals to drastically restrict legal immigration.
To remain fair, Miller did not attack the statue itself.
A horde of boat owners and Liberty imitators would have lynched him if he had done it.
But he attacked their importance, and in particular the importance attributed to it when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus was added to its base in 1903, 17 years after the monument was completed.
When Miller lambasted Acosta: "I don't want to go into a complete thing about history here, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the world.
The poem you're referring to, which was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty. "
Miller is factually correct, but as he put it himself, it's not really about history.
It's about the contemporary resonance of the stirring words of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state invites not just any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "Your tired, your poor, / your beleaguered masses yearning to breathe freely, / the wretched waste of your rich coasts."
There was never a time when the "miserable waste" was better seen on our screens.
Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people are not welcome in Trump's US.
This conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural dispute: It is, in fact, a conflict over the importance of America.
Lazarus - and her friends, who campaigned to place her words at the base after her death - knew very well that they were performing a highly political act.
The sculpture was intended to show the connections between French and American republicanism by depicting the female embodiment of freedom in a worn-out classic pictorial representation.
Lazarus changed this meaning: In her poem, the female figure is no longer abstract - she has been given a voice.
And she gives herself a very different name: Mother of exiles.
The poem's connection with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American nativism.
And just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, people from the right wing wanted to change this back for a long time.
The great scream Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty was not inviting anyone, but rather an early neoconservative bringing the American flame to the overnight world: "Lady Liberty is going ahead.
It is meant to carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
The torch is not meant to light the way into the United States. "
Quite unusually, Limbaugh has come across something here.
The importance of the statue is entirely a question of the point of view of perception.
The great imaginative act of Lazarus was to see it the way it was seen by the exhausted, miserable but hopeful people after long and often terrible journeys on the decks of ships.
It is literally about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives.
Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome they need to hear.
And that, of course, is not the perspective that Miller and Trump would ever want to acknowledge.
Their torch is not meant to illuminate the way, but to ignite the hatred that is their only source of power.
World Cup 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish members of Great Britain team
Eilidh Doyle recalls a time when only two Scots were part of the Great Britain team
UK athletics performance director Neil Black says the 16-strong Scottish contingent in the World Cup squad "will make a massive contribution to the team."
A record number of Scottish athletes have been selected for London 2017, which kicks off on Friday.
Black believes that "something special is developing in Scotland" and UK athletics needs to learn something from it.
"We welcome it, and we try to understand it, and we will continue it until we find out," Black said.
"I'm talking to people at the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they've done.
The Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done.
British athletics: It has something to do with what they have done.
And also with the type on the street corner.
Whatever the combination of circumstances, it's absolutely brilliant. "
Several of the Scottish athletes are medal contenders, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will compete against Sir Mo Farah at the 5,000m track, while Eilidh Doyle has been voted team captain by the team.
"Eilidh is quite humble.
Her captain's speech was unbelievable,"Black says.
"A number of athletes, whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train, went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated.
The passion and real feeling that Eilidh brought in quite naturally was great. "
The Commonwealth silver medallist, who will compete in the 400m hurdles at her fifth World Championships, says it is "unbelievable" that 16 Scots are in the British squad.
Scotland's best total of athletes at the World Cup so far was seven, achieved in 1983 and 2015.
Middle-distance runner Muir leads the way, setting five British and two European records last year.
She will take part in the 1,500m and 5,000m runs.
Chris O'Hare, who runs 1,500m, is another Scot to watch after a great season that included winning the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games.
Doyle remembers her first world championships when the only other Scot in the team was Lee McConnell.
The team captain says she is "enormously proud" of the fact that many of her compatriots are not only part of the team, but in some cases will also be involved in the medals and the finals.
"The special thing about being a team captain is that she was elected by the other members of the team, so it was a huge honour anyway, but knowing that my teammates voted for me and elected me makes it something very special for me," she added.
"Obviously I'm very proud of all the Scots who are part of the team.
It just shows how far we have come.
And they're here as established athletes, athletes who want to step up to podiums.
As for my speech as captain?
Yeah, I think she went well.
I just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home World Cup.
So it's really important to put on that home support and benefit from us being back at the Olympic Stadium.
I get a second chance to go out there and compete and it's just going to be such a great atmosphere out there. "
Blocking critics via Facebook: Don't run for public office if you can't tolerate voter heating
The father of our country knew something about bad press.
Americans loved George Washington, but it didn't take long for newspapers to beat him because of everything from domestic politics to his political principles.
He chimed at the criticism, sure.
But he has not silenced his critics.
Because in 1783, Washington said,"freedom of speech can be taken away - and, stupid and dumb, we are led to slaughter like the sheep."
That brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan, who needs to work to be more like Washington.
Hogan's staff have blocked and deleted the posts of at least 450 people who have voiced their opinions on his official Facebook page.
And the American Civil Liberties Union sued him for that earlier this week.
The governor's staff dismissed the lawsuit as frivolous, and the online comment was full of a backlash with "Na, and?."
"It's just Facebook," a lot of people said.
But it's important.
And it's especially important when it's a guy like Hogan.
This is a Republican governor in an overwhelmingly Democratic state that is astonishingly popular.
He has the second-highest approval rating of the nation's 50 governors.
Hogan is not a reactionary heathead.
He has shown a firm hand in running his state and strict adherence to principles.
He was also very adept at using Facebook as a primary means to connect with his constituents and playfully debuting his hairless head after chemotherapy on his page.
So blocking people coming to the governor's side - which is a public forum called official and by staff paid with public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan's spokeswoman Amelia Chasse defended the governor's actions, arguing that blocking the comments was nothing more than a moderation.
But it's too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hateful people swinging the whip online.
The post spoke to some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.
And these are just real people talking to their elected leaders: A teacher, an entrepreneur and a pastor, not trolls.
They all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not profane.
The pastor cited the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogan's Catholic faith.
Attorney Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., was not hateful, but she asked about hate crimes.
"I politely commented that I was disappointed that there was no response to hate crimes and other recent news," she wrote in the comments section of the news outlet "The Post."
"I also don't appreciate this idea, if a number of people take a stand on the same issue, then they are more likely to be disregarded by some as a so-called collective effort and not recognised as a large group of affected citizens."
What the governor's aides described as a "concentrated spam attack," others would likely call "advocacy."
The Facebook era makes it easy to tailor a message by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment.
It is much cleaner than in previous times, if the same had been done, that staff were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical editorials, or to arrest and silence protesters.
But that is exactly what is happening digitally.
Hogan is not the first public official to be criticized for bashing Facebook and other social media.
President Trump is being sued by Twitter users who have been blocked from his Twitter feed.
One of the first milestones on the issue fell last week in Virginia.
The chairman of the Loudoun County Board of Supervisors violated the First Amendment, according to U.S. District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when she banned a voter from her Facebook page.
And in Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit from the ACLU because of his use of Facebook and Twitter.
It shouldn't be that hard.
At the time of Washington, the time of the affordable Porto had a similar effect to the Internet.
The number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letter writers chimed in on his leadership.
And even then, Washington had anonymous trolls.
The people who used pseudonyms like "Juricola," "Valerius," "Belisarius" and "Portius" all wrote letters to newspapers slamming Washington's decisions.
Petitions that criticized his position on Amity's contract, trade and shipping with Britain overwhelmed his office, according to the historical documents collected by the George Washington Project's online papers.
But he has not silenced them.
Freedom of speech, difference of opinion and discourse are part of the foundation of our nation.
And true leadership means accepting that.
Ronan Rafferty hopes for home comforts at Renaissance Club
Former European No 1 Ronan Rafferty will be hoping for home comforts over the next three days as the Renaissance Club in East Lothian hosts the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open.
Northern, who led next door at Archerfield Links to the final round last year before losing to Paul Eales, is linked to the new venue and acts as a tournament ambassador on behalf of the club's founder and CEO Jerry Sarvadi.
"I've seen the Renaissance club built, and we see it reaching its fame with this event," Rafferty said.
"The players will see this course from his best side, he's in a great state.
Jerry did a great job when he set this place.
He is a keen supporter of this game and is proud of his performance here.
This is a great showcase for this course."
Englishman Eales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time, despite winning in both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour in his 32-year career.
"That feels really special," said the Southport-based player.
"I haven't been able to defend the Extremadura Open as it was taken out of the programme the year after I won it.
Coming back to this part of the world is magical.
It is a wonderful place to play golf.
The memories from last year come back, and it was something special for me and my wife Sharon to win here last year.
It was a really special time and one we'll always cherish. "
Gary Orr, who joined the European Senior Tour after his 50th birthday earlier this year, returns to action on home soil.
This event will be his first Scottish appearance since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
"It always means a little bit more when you play at home," said Orr, the man from Helensburgh.
"You want to do well, but you also feel that extra pressure.
I really enjoyed playing again, and I played some solid golf.
I'm happy with how it went so far. "
With the trio on the field are former Masters winner Ian Woosnam and senior major champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are among the six Scots on the field, while the others are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
Admission is free, the car park costs £5 per car with one occupant and £10 per car with two or more occupants.
All proceeds will go to Prostate Cancer UK.
Fewer lung cancer deaths from passive smoking
In the past two decades, fewer and fewer people have died from lung cancer due to passive smoking.
Scientists from the University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) come to this conclusion in a study.
"According to our estimates, 167 lung cancer deaths per year are due to passive smoking," said study lead author Heiko Becher.
As a comparison, he drew up his own study on the subject from 1994.
At that time, there were still 400 lung cancer deaths due to passive smoking per year in Germany.
The new investigation is published in the "International Journal of Public Health."
Home connections prove very complex
Construction work on villinger Straße is in full swing and "is reasonably in time," according to the head of the construction yard, Fred Heinze.
In the area of house connections, the situation is more complicated than suspected, as there is much hiding underground, which is not noted in the plans.
Traffic, which repeatedly hinders construction work, is a major problem for the construction company Stumpp.
"The ignorance of motorists in front of red traffic lights and shut-off grids is already enormous," reports Heinze.
The road was closed and only the regular buses were allowed to pass through.
Angelo Caruso, Marvin Kostorz and Tim Kostorz of the Stumpp company have been busy working on the bridge for weeks.
"The hot days were quite exhausting.
But luckily we were supplied with cool mineral water by our friend Fritz Matt,"says Marvin Kostorz.
Poverty and death in Indonesia's Goldland
When Bardina Degei cooks dinner, she doesn't use a cooker.
She even rarely uses a pot.
At her wooden house in Enarotali, the capital of the Paniai Regency in the restive Indonesian province of Papua, the housewife usually places a sweet potato - locally referred to as "nota" - directly in the fireplace.
After half an hour, the charred tuber is removed and swallowed with eager, unwashed hands.
Degei sits on the clay floor - she has no furniture - where she also does her daily work, such as washing clothes with murky water from the nearby swamp.
A bucket in a roofless room serves as a latrine.
As the youngest of her husband's four wives, no fields were assigned to her.
Polygamy is common here.
Of course, working late can be dangerous: Most village men are unemployed, and many drink heavily, and there are the soldiers here.
"No one dares to walk around in the village after 5pm," she says.
It is a rare glimpse into daily life in the highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony taken in 1969 after a disputed referendum in Indonesia, when only 1,026 elders were due to vote through a public hand-raising in front of the occupying forces.
An existing movement that rallied for independence against Dutch rule quickly turned against the Jakarta government, which maintains control of the region and excludes foreign journalists or legal observers from doing so.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua, with the independent part of Papua New Guinea encompassing the eastern part of the island.
The trip includes a 90-minute flight from the provincial capital of Jayapura to Nabire and then a morning 5-hour drive by car.
There is no public transport.
The city of about 19,000 people consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences and corrugated iron roofs turned into various yellow-brown tones by rust.
Very few Indonesians have made their journey here, let alone journalists and virtually no foreigners.
Before Christian missionaries arrived, Mee Pago Papuans worshipped a god named Uga Tamee.
There were other changes, too.
"We weren't used to wearing these clothes," says Degei, hinting at her vibrant, hand-woven turban, dark shirt and bright skirt.
"We used to have only leaves on our bodies."
Papua is Indonesia's poorest province, where 28% of people live below the poverty line and have some of the worst child mortality and literacy rates in Asia.
But it's also Indonesia's gold country.
The largest and most profitable gold mine in the world, Grasberg, owned by the Freeport McMoRan of Phoenix, is just 60 miles from Paniai, a highland province the size of New Jersey with 153,000 residents.
In 2015 alone, Freeport shed $3.1 billion worth of gold and copper.
In addition, Papua has timber resources worth an estimated $US78 billion.
These riches, however, are a source of misery for the Papua, who ensure Indonesia's powerful military maintains a suffocating presence.
A 2005 investigation in the New York Times reported that Freeport paid local military personnel and units nearly $20 million between 1998 and 2004, including up to $150,000 to a single officer.
Papuan demands for greater autonomy threaten these golden goose and are treated mercilessly.
According to activists, more than 500,000 Papua have been killed and thousands have been raped, tortured and imprisoned by the Indonesian military since 1969.
Mass killings in Papua's tribal highlands in the 1970s became genocide, according to the Asia Human Rights Commission.
In the region alone, Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful protesters last year.
"We will lose everything," says a 2016 report by the Archdiocese of Brisbane, which includes reports of atrocities the previous year, such as unlawful executions and torture - rape and electric strikes are particularly popular, according to another report - and the brutal crackdown on peaceful demonstrations.
"It's difficult to count the number of victims as incidents happen every week," says Andreas HarAmend, Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch.
The screws have intensified as Papua's resources bring an influx of settlers from other parts of Indonesia.
The population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83% Christian, but the demographic is changing as Muslim economic migrants come from the populous islands of Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Javanese warung canteens sell fried chicken and gado-gado, a mixed vegetable served with peanut sauce.
Local people are struggling to keep up here.
"The migrants have started selling chicken and vegetables in the traditional market cheaper than the local Papua," explains Abeth You, a 24-year-old Paniai local who moved to the provincial capital of Jayapura for work.
"It's cost the native Papua - the mom mom [the women] of Papua - their market."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, popularly known as Jokowi, promised during his 2014 election campaign to address the inequalities and rights violations in Papua.
The former carpenter secured 27 of Papua's total 29 districts - including Paniai - on the way to the presidential palace in Jakarta.
But little has changed in Papua, and today the locals feel cheated.
"Our hearts are broken because we voted for Jokowi in 2014, with the expectation that he will fulfill our hopes that justice will be restored," You says.
In fact, Paniai suffered a nadir just two months after Jokowi's inauguration in October.
On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children were outside singing Christmas carols in front of a campfire in Enarotali when two Indonesian soldiers broke through the darkness on a motorcycle.
The terrified children told them to turn on their headlights.
One of the soldiers took offense at her tone and later came back with four soldiers, according to local pastor Yavedt Tebai.
The soldiers, who had been drinking, chased and beat the group with their rifle butts, victims and witnesses said.
Then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children.
One child, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was so badly beaten that he fell into a coma.
A few hours later, the building of the nearby government commission was set on fire and things escalated the next day.
About 1,000 young Papua men, women and children gathered on a football pitch outside the local police station and the military command center to demand justice.
They wore ceremonial hunting bows and performed the Waita dance - running in circles and mimicking a bird song - by Papua's Mee Pago tribe.
Some protesters began hurling stones at police and military posts.
As the mood heated up, the soldiers were sent a command on an internal radio: "If the masses resist more than three times, they shoot them dead," an official document seen by TIME, which has not been released to local media, says.
Yeremias Kayame, 56, the head of the Kego Koto district of Enarotali, saw the looming danger and called for calm and urged the crowd to return home.
No one was in the mood to listen.
"When I turned around, I was suddenly shot in my left wrist," he told TIME on the porch of his brightly painted wooden house.
Kayame still doesn't know who fired, but says the bullet came from the ranks of soldiers gathered here.
"It was crowded, a lot of shots were fired," he adds.
Local man Alfius Youw was hit three times, according to his cousin, who witnessed the shootings.
"I ran to him and examined his body to make sure he was," Yohanes, who, like many Indonesians, bears only one name, told TIME in a sombre mood.
"I saw that he was dead... I kissed him."
Papua Police Chief Inspector Yotje Mende told reporters that his officers only wanted to "secure" her station because she was being attacked.
"We have to defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us," Papua police spokesman Commissioner Pudjo Sulistiyo said in 2015.
"It's about life and death."
Five young protesters were killed and many more injured, according to Human Rights Watch.
News of the killings only came 'filtered' to Jakarta the following day.
For three weeks, Jokowi gave an impassioned speech in Jayapura expressing sympathies for the families of the victims and vowing to address the historic grievances in Papua.
"I want this case to be resolved immediately, so it won't happen in the future," he said.
Security Minister Wiranto said in October 2016 that he was setting up an out-of-court mechanism to resolve historic human rights violations.
But the excuses began almost immediately.
"Most of the injuries occurred a long time ago.
Some were in the 90s and early 2000s.
The point is that we are committed to addressing these breaches, but there are processes that need to go through,"he said.
Then Wiranto made a retreat when he spoke to TIME in Jakarta on June 5 and said he had no plans to set up a complaint mechanism in Papua.
Instead,"everything is regulated by law," he said.
Wiranto, whom the UN has charged with "crimes against humanity" that claimed more than 1,000 deaths in East Timor's bloody 1999 independence vote, said 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua had already been settled, including the Paniai incident.
Families of the Paniai victims took such claims with grim incredulity.
"I've been interviewed four times in the last three years, but there has been no progress whatsoever," says Yohanes.
"I'm tired."
He says that years later, he still lives in fear.
"I'm scared," he says.
"I'm scared to be arrested by the military, scared to be shot."
His brother Yacobus reiterated the view that people in Paniai are afraid to discuss the incident.
He says he was beaten by the military after he helped bury four of the victims.
"After I buried the bodies, the military searched for me," he says.
The shootings have not stopped.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police shot at villagers in Paniai's Deiyai neighborhood.
One person died and 17 others were injured, including children, during a confrontation between villagers and the manager of a construction company that refused to take an unconscious man to hospital.
The man, 24-year-old Ravianus Douw, who drowned while fishing in a nearby river, died on the way to hospital.
Excited villagers protested outside the company's location office.
Police said the villagers threw stones at officers who responded by firing warning shots.
But locals say the mobile brigade (Indonesian paramilitary police) began shooting at the crowd, killing one.
"We were so panicked, we are afraid that there will be revenge," says 29-year-old Dominggu Badii, who lives near the hospital and witnessed the injured being quickly hospitalized here, according to TIME.
"I've been hiding in my house for two days."
The Deiyai Parliament has called for the officers involved to be held accountable and for the police's mobile brigade to be withdrawn from the area.
Paniai has always been a source of unrest for the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development strengthens the discontent of tribesmen Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal, who live in the leafy highlands of Papua.
Many joined the "Free Papua Movement" (OPM), the rebel army that claims to defend the rights of Papua by inciting sporadic attacks and kidnappings of Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the top OPM leaders are from Paniai, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
In response, thousands of people have been arrested and arbitrarily taken into custody in Paniai in recent years, on the pretext of "securing national sovereignty."
Some never show up again.
Among the people in Papua, Paniai is known as "a tragic, forgotten place."
Poverty strengthens discontent.
The bit of rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive for locals.
Bread is just as out of reach.
People here grow everything they eat: Especially nota and fruit and leafy vegetables.
Agriculture is the task of women, who can each process four or five fields of sweet potato.
They keep most of the harvest for the family, while the rest is sold in the local market.
Ten pieces of Nota cost just 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Over time, economic inequalities have grown between native Papua and the new migrants, who have arrived in greater numbers since the opening of new air routes to Nabire Airport.
The few jobs there are in the region usually go to the better-educated and wealthier migrants.
Papua rarely have the capital or the necessary skills to run their own businesses competitively.
"The young people are not interested in staying in the village... because there are no jobs or money here," says John Gobai, the chairman of the tribal council of Paniai.
Isolation keeps the eyes of the world away from Papua.
In addition, restrictions on reporting by international media remain tense.
Earlier in the year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were deported from Papua for lack of coordination with related institutions, despite being given rare permission to film.
According to Phelim Kine, the deputy Asia director of Human Rights Watch, the promises of Jokowi's campaign to lift restrictions on reporting to promote transparency and development have not been realized.
"There are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to report from Indonesia's restive easternmost provinces of Papua and West Papua: Visa denial and a blacklist," he said in a statement.
Lack of press scrutiny means that international pressure on the Indonesian government remains largely confined to Papua's immediate neighbors.
In March, six Pacific states - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the "various and widespread violations" in Papua, including the Paniai shooting.
The same countries have historically supported the OPM.
Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesman Arrmanatha Nasir dismissed the group's allegations, telling journalists in Jakarta: "There is still a democratic system in place in Indonesia and there is free media, so it is difficult to cover up the evidence of human rights cases."
Local people want more foreign governments to take note.
When an official delegation from the Netherlands, led by human rights ambassador Kees Van Baar, visited Jayapura on May 4, locals broke their silence and beleaguered him "We want freedom," according to a source who also attended the meeting but wants to remain anonymous.
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019, but the Papua say they are unlikely to vote for Jokowi again.
"Jokowi is a person who has good intentions, but he is surrounded by the people who are involved in the Paniai shooting," says Gobai, the chairman of the tribal council.
He wants Jokowi to know that, apart from living under the constant threat of a predatory military, the Paniai people are in poor education and health services.
Gobai says that the Paniai people, like other Papua people, see their vote for Jokowi as a "debt" that he must repay.
"They don't need money, they just want justice," he says.
Despite the threats and intimidation, families of the Paniai gunshot victims carried out one last symbolic act of defiance: The body of a victim was buried on a site just opposite the police and military station.
They know they may never get justice, but at least they don't let those responsible forget their crimes.
"A member of our family was killed," says Yacobus with his head lowered.
"What else can we do?"
Fire captures Dubai's' Torch 'skyscraper for second time
A fire found its perimeter in one of the world's tallest residential towers in Dubai on Friday, forcing hundreds of residents to flee the 337-metre, 79-storey building.
It is the second fire to sweep through the high-rise building in just two years, which happens to be called the Torch Tower (torch tower).
The building was evacuated, no injuries were reported, and there was no direct word on the cause of the flame.
"We slept and we got up at the fire alarm and people shouting.
We ran down the stairs and it took about 10 minutes to get down from the 50th floor,"one resident, who gave his name as George, told Reuters.
Dubai's civil protection authorities said fire fighting units extinguished the fire about 4 a.m. local time (00am GMT) and cooled the building.
The government said it was working to provide shelter for those affected.
The incident can revive questions about the safety of materials used in outdoor areas of high-rise buildings around the world.
An investigation by the management of the Torch building after its fire in 2015 found that most of the damage came from the cladding, the exterior cladding for decoration or insulation.
In Britain, police said they believe the system of plates for insulation and cladding at London's Grenfell Tower in June may have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire in which about 80 people died.
No Davis Cup reform: Continue best-of-five
The president of the International Tennis Federation (ITF) has fallen through with his big Davis Cup coup at the General Assembly.
At the meeting in Ho Chi Minh City, the revolutionary proposal for this sport to play Davis Cup singles on just two sets of wins was thinly unsupported by the required two-thirds majority.
The five-set classics, which are often very long, but also highly valued for this reason, are thus retained in the traditional competition.
63.54 percent of member countries voted for the reform, so the goal of ITF President David Haggerty was narrowly missed.
"We respect this decision, but are disappointed that our member nations have not adopted the entire Davis Cup and Fed Cup reform package.
We need a change to secure the long-term future of these iconic and historic competitions,"Haggerty said.
We will continue to work to improve the applications.
After many appeals, the proposal to hold the final in a neutral place had not even come to the vote.
New from 2018 are only comparatively minor details: So the finalists in the Davis Cup and Fed Cup will have the host right in the first round the following year in the future.
To reduce costs for organisers, requirements in terms of training pitches and so on will be facilitated and players will have to make fewer official media appointments before the Davis Cup.
More than 1 in 5 US travellers bring banned items to plane, survey finds
A survey of airline passengers found that more than 20 percent deliberately or unconsciously smuggled prohibited items past U.S. Transportation Security Administration checkpoints, including at least 6 percent who boarded the plane while accidentally carrying prohibited knives or other items with blades.
Less than 1 per cent claimed they had belatedly discovered they had mistakenly travelled with firearms, ammunition or explosives.
The survey of more than 1,000 people - conducted by a jet charter service, Stratos Jet Charters Inc. - also found that younger travelers were more likely to flout the rules.
Of the respondents who admitted that they knowingly tried to fly with something that was banned by the TSA, 19.7 percent were millennials, compared with less than 15 percent who were members of Generation X.
The most common items deliberately hauled past TSA agents were food and liquids.
More than 3 per cent admitted knowingly carrying items with blades through security control, while 2.2 per cent of female respondents and 3.7 per cent of male respondents also confirmed that they had deliberately put banned drugs on the plane.
The company said it had interviewed travellers across the country to find out how many had accidentally brought contraband through airport security and how many had done it deliberately.
It's no surprise that the people most likely to carry contraband - knowingly or unwittingly - through security were the ones who fly the most frequently.
However, the company points out that the TSA guidelines are somewhat complicated and confusing.
People are often unsure what liquids they are allowed to take with them or how much of it.
So it's no surprise that the largest amount of items seized by the TSA are prohibited liquids.
For a time, people thought the TSA could view books as contraband.
Liquids are allowed on domestic flights, but not on international flights.
Elon Musk doesn't care: Tens of thousands of Tesla customers cancel order
Elektro-Tausendsassa Elon Musk likes to indicate with the huge number of pre-orders for his new Tesla "Model 3."
He has so far denied that some of the customers have already withdrawn their non-binding reservation.
In addition to the ever-triumphant numbers on sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets, Tesla chief executive Elon Musk revealed a different, less glossy figure for the first time when announcing the latest quarterly balance sheet: That of cancellations on the new mass-market Model 3.
Musk had frequently advertised in recent months with the more than 500,000 pre-orders for the new car, whose delivery is just beginning.
Now Musk admits: Of the total of 518,000 pre-orders, 63,000 have already been withdrawn.
Critics had repeatedly pointed out that these were merely non-binding reservations.
If cancelled, Tesla will pay back the €1000 (US $1000 in the US and £1000 in the UK) "reservation deposit" in full.
Currently, 455,000 such non-binding reservations would be available, Musk acknowledged in a conference call with analysts.
However, the Tesla boss does not believe that cancelling around twelve per cent of all orders so far could become a problem.
His argument: The challenge with the ambitious growth targets is not on demand, but on the production side.
Last year, Tesla delivered 84,000 vehicles.
In 2018 - all models taken together - it is projected to be 500,000, in 2020 a million.
The demand for this is obviously there.
According to Musk, 1800 reservations are currently added per day.
Anyone ordering a "Model 3" today won't be allowed to expect delivery until the second half of 2018 at the earliest - if Tesla manages to drive its brand new, never-before-tested production lines with maximum utilization without major interruptions.
Many experts doubt that this is possible.
But if there are major delays, then the non-binding nature of reservations could become a problem for Tesla.
Because then the company can't stop dissatisfied customers from running away in droves.
EPA chief Pruitt withdraws over delaying Obama-era rules to reduce emissions
A day after he was sued by 15 states, Scott Pruitt, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, took back his earlier decision to delay the implementation of Obama-era rules to reduce emissions of smog-causing air pollutants.
Pruitt presented the change as his agency proved more responsive to the needs of state environmental agencies than previous administrations.
He did not mention the lawsuit that had been brought against his previous post in a federal appeals court.
It is about a deadline that expired on October 1 for states to meet 2015 standards for ground-level ozone.
Pruitt announced in June that he will delay compliance by a year to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid "interfering in local decisions or hindering economic growth."
Pruitt, who was an Oklahoma prosecutor before his appointment by President Donald Trump, has long been a reliable opponent of tougher environmental regulations.
Since arriving in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly moved to block or delay regulations that the chemical industry and fossil fuel industry oppose.
Wednesday's sudden reversal is the latest legal setback for Pruitt's regulatory rollback agenda.
Last month, a federal appeals court in Washington ruled that the EPA administrator overstepped his authority as he sought to delay the implementation of an Obama administration rule that required oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leaks.
In an opinion piece released Wednesday night, Pruitt suggested that his U-turn on ozone standards quite simply reinforces the EPA's willingness to cooperate with the states through the complex process of meeting the new standards on time.
"Under previous administrations, the EPA has often failed to meet deadlines for implementation and then waited to be charged by activist groups and others, and in an agreement to set the deadline for implementation," said Pruitt, who sued the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job.
"We don't believe in regulation through court proceedings, and we take deadlines seriously.
We also take the law and the authority it gives us seriously. "
Still, the EPA's opinion said Pruitt will eventually use his "power to delay and all other legally available powers" to ensure that the regulations are "based on sound policy and the best information available."
Congressional Republicans are pushing for a broader rewrite of ozone rules.
A bill approved last month is expected to delay implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years.
The measure has not yet been put to a vote in the Senate.
New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who led the coalition of states that had sued the EPA this week, said the group planned to maintain legal pressure.
"The EPA's reversal - according to our lawsuits - is an important win for the health and safety of these 6.7 million New Yorkers and the more than 115 million Americans directly affected by the smog pouring into their communities," Schneiderman said.
New York joined California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington and the District of Columbia in the case.
Soil ozone is created when pollutants from cars, power plants, oil refineries, chemical plants and other sources in the atmosphere react to sunlight.
The resulting smog can cause serious breathing problems in sensitive groups of people, and contribute to thousands of premature deaths each year.
Public health officials and environmentalists cheered on Pruitt's surprise change of tack.
"It's disturbing how much pressure it takes to get this reasonable move from the person responsible for protecting the air we inhale," said Lori Ann Burd of the Center for Biological Diversity.
"We must continue to fight the Trump administration's ideological crusade to align ourselves with polluters and their special interests."
Tumlingen celebrates 750 years of St. Hilarius Church
750 years of St. Hilarius Church: On the occasion of the anniversary of the mountain church, a serenade is invited to the old cemetery area in Tumlingen on Sunday, July 16, at 4.30pm.
Whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village, the historic St. Hilarius complex is a popular place to stay.
Visitors to the sixth charity serenade can be enchanted by this powerful place.
The rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the site have made Tumlingen's friends and patrons their concern.
Walter Martini emphasizes: "It is a unique village gem."
In 1267 the St. Hilarius Chapel was mentioned for the first time in the Württemberg document book: Count Hermann von Sulz sold "the mountain with the parish church in Tumlingen with the Vogtei" to Magister Eberhard von Horb and to his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver.
According to the wording of the document, in addition to the former parish church, there was also a stately court on Tumlinger Berg, to which the church or the patronage law belonged and not vice versa.
So there were also people living there.
As the description of the Oberamt Freudenstadt from 1858 shows, beside the Unterdorf and the Oberdorf, which are still visible today in the townscape of Tumlingen, the "mountain" was the third, the stately settlement core of the village.
Old maps from around 1600 underpin these historical facts.
The patronage law arose from the early medieval own church law.
A lord who built, equipped and occupied a church with a parish priest remained the owner of this church and could also inherit this own church.
Associated with this was the right to appoint a pastor or to propose a new pastor to the bishop.
There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower.
The larger of the two crumbled on Christmas 1673.
The newly purchased bell first sounded in 1692, but had to be delivered later in the Second World War in 1942.
In the 30-year war (1616 to 1648) the window panes were smashed in and the bell ropes were stolen.
The roof was leaking.
In 1796, French troops encamped near the church.
They broke out the pulpit and church chairs and used them as firewood.
Remnants of the church threatened to collapse in 1809.
Until 1869, the Tumlinger Hilarius cemetery also served as the last resting place for the dead from Hörschweiler.
In 1823 the cemetery was extended and the Hilarius church was demolished.
Only the church tower was left standing.
On New Year's Eve 1834, a storm split the church tower and half collapsed.
To prevent an accident, the tower was canceled.
Only the still existing tower dwarf remained as a witness to the 750-year-old church history.
Today, Horst Kallenberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem of the "Schaffigen pensioners" as successor of Dieter Dockhorn maintain the Hilarius plant.
On Sunday, July 16, the friends and supporters of Tumlingen invite you to the sixth serenade in the old cemetery to the St. Hilarius Chapel.
It is designed by the combo of the Kepler-Gymnasium Freudenstadt and with contributions by Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis.
Local leader Hartmut Romann speaks the final word.
The program starts at 4:30 p.m.
Admission is from 3.30pm.
At the end of the serenade, a drink takes place in front of the cemetery.
"Enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with the wide view over meadows towards the forest," the organisers highlight the fantastic view.
The serenade takes place only in dry weather.
The organizers hope for many supporters to preserve the historic St. Hilarius facility, which is important for Tumlingen and Hörschweiler.
Friends and supporters of Tumlingen feel particularly committed to home care, as Serenade organizer Walter Martini affirms.
Association wants approval of wind turbines tested
"Boisheim defends itself" sees no legal requirement for the construction and has therefore appealed to the county council.
The association "Boisheim wehr sich" (Boisheim defends itself) has asked Councillor Andreas Coenen (CDU) to withdraw his approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Boisheimer Nette.
It was unlawful.
The association argues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 no wind turbines could have been approved at all in the Boisheimer Nette, as at the time in Viersen only a wind power concentration zone existed at the city border with Schwalmtal.
Within this concentration zone, the construction and operation of wind turbines are generally possible, but at the same time the concentration zone excludes the use of wind energy for the rest of the city.
Such zones are intended to prevent the landscape from being "spared."
A few days earlier, the city of Viersen had decided on a second wind power concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette by changing the land use plan - but the district government of Düsseldorf had not approved it because of a form error.
"Due to the lack of a planning requirement, the approval decision issued is still unlawful and therefore also to be withdrawn," said Christoph Erkens, Chairman of "Boisheim is resisting."
Current state of affairs: The city council again decided the wind concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette before the summer recess; a permit from the district government is still pending.
Erkens: "At this point, the granting of a permit for the construction of wind turbines is excluded under planning law."
The circle confirms the receipt of the call.
"The corresponding letters have been received with Viersen County since last week," a spokesman explained.
The circle takes them as an opportunity to re-examine the matter.
However, they are not expected to cause the proceedings to be stopped.
With regard to ongoing proceedings at the Administrative Court, the district on Thursday did not want to comment on the substance of the association's argument "Boisheim defends itself."
NEW Re, a subsidiary of NEW, plans to build four wind turbines, each 200 metres high, on an area on the Boisheimer Nette.
Already last year, the company, in which the city of Viersen is indirectly involved, had entered into lease agreements with the owner of the roughly 65-acre site.
The four wind turbines are designed to meet the electricity needs of around 11,400 households - equivalent to around a fifth of the electricity needs of all four households.
NEW Re intends to invest around 20 million euros.
Last summer, Viersen's city council gave the green light to the purchase of three wind turbines at the Linnich wind farm near Aachen, as well as a stake in a wind turbine in Übach-Palenberg in Heinsberg County.
Car and tractor crash: Woman dies in horrific accident
A horrific road accident happened on Friday morning about 10am on the L 333 between Niederwallmenach and Bogel (Rhein-Lahn-Kreis).
A woman was fatally injured in the process.
Two other people were slightly injured.
The state road remained closed for hours.
According to police, a 17-year-old young woman from Bornich was driving the L 333 in the direction of Bogel with her car as part of the accompanied driving with her 53-year-old mother as an escort.
City and traders plan 'home shopping' weekend
Bad Langensalzaer and people from the region are expected to rediscover the shopping opportunities in the city centre in September.
The trade association and the city administration want to use the weekend on 8 and 9 September to entice residents to go shopping in the city centre.
As the chairman of the trade association, Christian König, announced, the "home-shopping" weekend is intended to sensitize customers to what offers their own city offers away from the usual supermarket goods.
A market with regional suppliers is therefore planned, similar to the weekly market.
In addition, domestic companies are to present themselves with their apprenticeships.
In addition, downtown shops are expected to invite "midnight shopping."
The action is not only aimed at residents of the city and the surrounding region.
In preparation are commercials on the radio, an internet video and printed bags pointing to the action weekend, according to Christian König.
The city administration and the trade association cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry.
This is another stage of the project "Attractive downtown."
These include new offers such as the first "Active Day" at the Fountain Festival, including Sunday open for sale, talks with all traders and hosts to encourage them to actively participate.
Attractive offers on Saturday and the waiver of parking charges on that day are also part of the concept.
In addition, customer potential is to be redeveloped or re-developed.
These include spa guests and tourists.
But many locals would also have lost sight of downtown when shopping.
In the end, everyone would have to help revitalize downtown - right down to landlords, businesses across the city and clubs.
It was necessary to overcome the lethargy with a network that had partly spread, King had said in the spring.
Birgit Streich, head of the IHK Center in Mühlhausen, announced that five Thuringian cities are participating for the first time in the third "home-shopping" day nationwide.
In addition to Bad Langensalza, these are Weimar, Sömmerda, Heiligenstadt and Bleicherode.
The day should "promote the appreciation of local trade and highlight its importance for the common good of our cities," according to Streich.
The action led by the IHK and with many partners also makes it clear that every citizen with his purchasing behaviour can influence his or her own direct environment.
Two dead and several injured after explosion at US school
During construction work, a gas explosion occurred in the school building.
New more people were injured.
Two people have been killed and nine others injured in a gas explosion in the US city of Minneapolis, some of them seriously.
According to the fire department, an injured person was still in critical condition on Wednesday (local time).
One person died when part of a school building collapsed in the blaze.
One initially missing was also later recovered dead.
The dead were employees of the school.
As the cause of the accident, authorities suspected work on a gas pipeline.
At the holiday season, few people were staying in the Minnehaha Academy building.
Trump pressured Mexico over border wall payment after leaked transcripts of phone calls
Transcripts of phone calls between US President Donald Trump and leaders of Mexico and Australia have been published by The Washington Post.
On January 27, Trump called in a phone call with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto to stop saying publicly that he would not pay for a planned border wall.
The US president lambasted him for publicly denouncing the wall, reportedly saying to him: "You can't say that to the press."
Trump launched his presidential campaign with a promise to build a wall on the southern border of the US, vowing to make Mexico pay for the project.
Transcripts of his first call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull were also released, revealing a tense exchange.
Mr. Trump told Mr. Turnbull that a trade for the U.S. to take on refugees who emigrated to Australia was "ridiculous," "mies" and "stupid," and that insisting on the trade brokered by the Obama administration would make him look like a "Depp" after he proposed a ban on resettling refugees to the U.S.
Mr. Trump ended the call after telling Mr. Turnbull,"This is the most unpleasant call for the whole day."
Moore's Ford massacre: Activists reignite racist lynching act as call for justice
A 1948 Ford Mercury drove through a group of spectators in rural Monroe, Georgia, and rumbled toward the Ford Bridge of Moore.
Before the car, which had four black passengers and a white driver, was able to reach the bridge, a group of white men with guns stepped out to block its path.
The leader of the mob - a middle-aged man in a pinstripe suit - took a long train at his cigar and glanced through the windscreen checking.
Indoors, the inmates hovered in fear.
"We want this n ---- r Roger!" The man roared.
"Get him out of the car!"
Screams tore the silence as a young black man was dragged from the front passenger seat.
Luckily, this horrific scene, played on July 22, is just a re-enactment.
But then when a noose is thrown around the neck of "Roger," almost everyone in the audience blew out very real sighs.
Since 2005, civil rights activists have been coming back to Moore's Ford Bridge to mimic the night two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom, as well as George and Mae Murray Dorsey - were lynched by the Ku Klux Klan in 1946.
No one has ever been charged with the murders.
"It's really unfathomable that in all these years, not a single person has been arrested - even though we see them in our communities, even though we know who they are," said Tyrone Brooks, who helps organize the reshuffle.
"It's a stain of dirt on a story, but it's a burden on our souls."
Brooks is a 71-year-old former Georgia state congressman and a lifelong civil rights activist.
For him, the rematch serves as a dramatic call to action and represents an annual reminder to the Monroe community that an injustice has never been corrected.
"We want law enforcement, we want the termination, we want healing, we want reconciliation, but first we need to get justice," he said.
"We can't get to healing and reconciliation until we get justice."
A forensic medic lays a bed cloth over the body of one of the victims of the Moore-Ford lynching on July 27, 1946.
More than 50 men from Monroe and surrounding counties were suspected in the lynching process, according to FBI files obtained by NBC News.
But none has ever been charged.
Although the suspects have remained at large for decades, civil rights activists say the dual motivation for the Lynch actions has always been known across the city: Politics and sex.
In April 1946, a Supreme Court decision allowed black citizens in Georgia to cast their ballots for the first time in the summer primary campaign.
Around the same time as the election, according to the FBI, black farm keeper Roger Malcom stabbed a white landowner, Barnett Hester, during a fight - allegedly because of a woman.
Brooks said the rumor in the city had been that Hester had slept with Malcom's wife, Dorothy, and that the baby she was carrying was not from her husband.
On July 25, 1946, Loy Harrison, a prominent white landowner, paid $600 to free Malcom from prison, according to the FBI.
He was escorted to prison by Dorothy and her cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey.
But then, as they moved away from the prison and approached Moore's Ford Bridge, a lynch mob surrounded the car.
"As it turns out, it was Harrison who prepared and ordered the killings," concludes an FBI report.
"It's also obvious that there was a plot between state and local law enforcement that was not only involved in the killings, removed evidence and covered up the identity of witnesses."
Brooks puts it even more succinctly.
"It was a suffrage massacre," he said.
"They were all killed to send a message to black people in this community:" If you register and if you vote, that's what's going to happen to you here."
For nearly a decade, Cassandra Greene has presided over the annual re-enactment of the Moore Ford Bridge Lynch murders.
Their portrayal is vivid, poignant and grounded in a kind of deep racism that many would like to believe no longer exists in America.
It's hard to watch, and even harder to look the other way, but Greene said that's the point.
"We don't want to talk about the lynching, because we are then confronted with its ugliness in all of us," she said.
"But I can't build a relationship with you if you don't want to listen to me or you don't want to hear what I've been through."
Rehearsals for this year's production began in June, and on the first day, nearly 30 actors - a dozen whites and the rest black - crowded into a room and listened as Greene launched a well-rehearsed overview of the play.
Wade Marbaugh is Greene's co-director here.
He has played the role of chief clan member for years, but he said the role will never get any easier.
"I feel dirty because I'm not like that," Marbaugh said.
"But I think it's very important to keep this story alive because we don't want to go back to these times."
On the other side of the room, actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, who play Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester, rehearsed their lines.
The play begins with Malcom shouting at Hester and berating him, angry that he has slept with his wife Dorothy.
"I said, n --- er, disappear from my property!"
Rascona reciprocates the fire.
There's a break.
And then everyone (at least all black actors) erupts into laughter.
Greene laughs the loudest.
"What?!" Rascona asked.
He is alarmed and confused.
Was I too tough?
"No," Greene said, still giggling.
"I just don't think white people said' n --- er 'at the time."
"Yet," quipped one of the other black performers.
"You've just got to hit the hard' R. '."
And that's exactly where the energy in the room shifts, a sense of comradeship replaces the discomfort.
Everyone is busy getting this right, not only because of the game, but also because of the memory of the four people killed.
The scene starts again.
This time, when Rascona says the N-word, he says it sharply and emphatically.
Absolutely no one laughs.
This repetition ends violently and quickly.
There are screams, shots and then silence.
A woman, dressed in a mourning dress, stands over the corpses of the actors and performs Billie Holidays mourning "Strange Fruit" eulogy.
Her voice breaks at every second word.
About a hundred yards behind, a group of about four dozen spectators wipes sweat and tears from their eyes.
The audience is almost evenly divided between black and white.
A couple have arrived from Ithaca, New York, to see the performance, many just coming down the street.
They have all experienced Georgia's oppressive moisture for nearly eight hours when Brooks takes them on a pilgrimage to the burial sites of the Malcoms and Dorseys.
To this point, the killings have remained an anecdote, but now, standing on the same land where the Lynch killings took place, the air feels spooky.
When the final notes of the song end, Greene invites the crowd to get closer and inspect the corpses.
Children squat at their heads, register the fake blood and the silent bodies and whisper to each other.
"They're not really dead," a little boy mumbles as if he wants to remember.
After a few minutes, Greene thanks the crowd - and suddenly it's over.
The actors throw away the lynch rope and wipe away their tears.
Bradshaw hugs Marbaugh, the man in the suit who played the clan member.
Nick Rascona hugs two of his fellow players and then collapses crying in their arms, the emotional burden of the performance finally breaking through at him.
"It's okay," whispers one of the women.
"We know that's not in your heart.
You've done that for a reason. "
Later, the audience sits down with the actors for dinner.
At one table, a white couple from Atlanta chat excitedly about the rematch with a black couple they've just met.
Denise Duplinski struggled to find words about what feeling the performance left behind.
"It's hard to hear these horrible words and actions... coming from people who look like you yourself and who do that because they look like you," she said.
"What this really does with me makes me believe that the lynching is still going on," she added,"today that's just called the police shooting."
In the same room, Tyrone Brooks holds court at his table, he eats and recalls civil rights.
He said he had already started planning the performance next year.
"The imitation is inspiring in a way, because it describes the horror of what we have endured, but it is also a moment of learning," he said.
"It's like, if we don't learn anything from it, then it can happen again.
Anyone who doesn't study their own history, anyone who doesn't know their own history, is doomed to repeat it. "
"Götterdämmerung" reconciled the Wagnerians in Bayreuth
Also in the fourth part of Richard Wagner's monumental work, director Frank Castorf relies on a colorful frivolous staging in front of a gigantic, six-storey backdrop.
The revolving stage (designed by Aleksandar Denic) shows either a shabby street corner with wall rest and Dönerbude in Berlin, a "Plaste and Elaste" logo from GDR times or the New York Stock Exchange.
Before that, an open Mercedes vintage car, in which the Rhine daughters pose as rocker girls, or alternatively an Isetta, parks.
Stacked oil barrels are reminiscent of Castorf's leitmotif - money, power and greed - which runs through his "ring" staging.
The three Rhine daughters - sung by Stephanie Houtzeel, Wiebke Lehmkuhl and Alexandra Steiner - harmonize beautifully as they did in the "Rheingold."
Kess seduce her Siegfried (Stefan Vinke), dragging a corpse into the trunk in Hollywood fashion and giving the Krawallo clique.
Stephen Milling sings the gloriously nasty Hagen that surrounds the aura of a heavyweight boxer.
Brutal the scene as he slams Siegfried.
Later Gunther (Markus Eiche) has to believe in it.
The audience thanks the ensemble with strong applause.
Foster, Milling, Vinke and conductor Janowski, who humbly bows his hands to the Merkel rod, are celebrated stormy.
There is huge applause for the festival orchestra showing up on stage for the first time - given the big heat again in empty casual attire.
The performance of Frank Castorf and his directing team had been eagerly awaited.
If he still had to endure a glowing pipe concert in 2013, there were big cheers five years later, in which the isolated "Buh" calls went down.
Festival boss Katharina Wagner is likely to have been delighted.
"You realize that the audience has grown together with the" ring "in a way," she had said shortly before the dpa's performance.
The audience not only made a form of peace with Castorf, but also developed an understanding of his point of view.
I draw a positive conclusion.
Max Menge works as a volunteer
They work in several places in their volunteer year.
Where everywhere?
Crowd: Usually in Steinfurt in the furniture exchange, once a week I help out here in Greven in the furniture bridge.
And I've also worked at the school in open all-day.
What are your experiences with this?
Crowd: It's a beautiful, broad spectrum that I see here.
I have to do with different people, with young people, with refugees, with young adults.
They are now 26 years, so a late-career volunteer.
How come that?
Crowd: I graduated from high school.
And then a civil engineering degree, let's say, successfully aborted.
I realized for myself that it is the wrong thing for me and I want to do something different, work with people.
And then I wondered what are you doing.
Make a social year, there's a glimpse, there you can see how it really is on the ground, in the focal point maybe as well.
And was it?
Crowd: I've collected great impressions.
I will start my studies in the social sector in the winter semester.
I will study dual, probably do social worker training at the Herne Youth Office and study in Hamm at the University of Applied Sciences.
Isn't it a bit unusual to have several different locations during volunteering?
Crowd: Yes, it's very variable.
It probably always comes down to where you do your FSJ.
You can do it from retirement home to youth work - in all sorts of facets of social work.
With me it was very varied.
I was also partly in the OGS, so in the afternoon care.
For me, that was just the right thing that irritated me.
I could see my own strengths and see how it really plays out.
Unlike in civil engineering studies?
Quantity: Of course, this is not about calculating statistics.
You always have other people in front of you, who each have a very different story behind them.
Whether a refugee, whether a youngster who has been taken out of the family - you always have to go into it individually.
Very interesting.
And you had no fear of touch?
Crowd: I'm not the type for that.
It's an area that gives you a lot.
A lot of love, a lot of kindness.
There are also sometimes negative moments, but so is life.
Pearson cuts another 3,000 jobs and cuts dividend to revive business
British education group Pearson said on Friday it will cut another 3,000 jobs and cut its interim dividend by 72 per cent as another restructuring programme is launched to overcome the pressures facing the company.
The job cuts, which Director General John Fallon mostly announced for the end of 2018 and early 2019, comes on top of its previous restructuring, which has already seen 4,000 jobs lost.
Pearson announced in a third cost-cutting programme in May a plan to cut costs by a further 300 million pounds ($394 million) to revive a business hit by the rapid move to digital learning.
The company, which sold its stake in Penguin Random House to partner Bertelsmann last month, said the outlook for the financial year was unchanged after it posted a 1 per cent increase to £2.05 billion in the first half of the year.
Kabul convoy attack: NATO soldier killed in suicide attack
A suicide bomber has attacked a military convoy in the Afghan capital Kabul, killing a Nato soldier and injuring several others, officials say.
Five soldiers and an interpreter were injured, a statement from Nato said.
Unconfirmed local reports said three civilians also died in the incident in the Qarabagh district.
The bombing is the latest act of violence to hit Afghanistan this month - more than 30 people were killed at a mosque in Herat on Tuesday.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
A statement from Nato said Thursday night's explosion happened when a joint patrol with the Afghan army was attacked by a "person-carried improvised explosive device."
The statement says all of the injured are in stable condition and are being treated at the US military hospital at Bagram airfield.
Correspondents say the growing strength of the Taliban and the group, known as the so-called Islamic State (IS) in Qarabagh, is a major concern for NATO troops in nearby Bagram.
According to the United Nations, there were at least 1,662 civilian deaths in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, about 20% of them in the capital.
In late July, a suicide car bomb killed at least 30 people in a mainly Shiite district of Kabul.
The Taliban said they had carried out that attack.
On May 31, a huge bombing in the center of the city killed more than 150 people with the country's deadliest militant attack since U.S.-led forces ousted the Taliban from power in 2001.
The violence underscores the precarious security situation in Afghanistan as US President Donald Trump weighs increasing the number of US troops supporting the military and police in the country.
Correspondents say the suicide bombings in Kabul in recent weeks have also caused a crisis of public confidence in the government, its policies and, in particular, in the reputation of President Ashraf Ghani.
EPA reverses decision to delay smog rule after lawsuits
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has overturned a decision to delay regulation of the Obama administration requiring states to curb smog-causing emissions, a day after 15 states sued the agency over the move.
The EPA announced late on Wednesday the decision to advance so-called "2015 ozone regulations" and said it showed the agency's commitment to work with states.
"We believe in dialogue with and that we respond to our state partners," EPA chief Scott Pruitt said in a statement.
Pruitt had announced in June the EPA's intention to delay ozone regulations - in which pollutant emissions are to be measured in part of the country to determine where cuts must be made to meet stricter air quality standards - by a year until October 2018.
A group of 15 largely Democratic states, along with the district of Colombia, filed suit on Tuesday, saying that the effort was illegal.
President Donald Trump's administration has sought to roll back a wide range of environmental requirements imposed by former President Barack Obama as part of a broader agenda designed to boost economic growth, according to Trump.
However, the effort has triggered the setback from Democrats and conservation groups, who worry about the impact of greater emissions on public health.
The EPA's website says that inhaling air that contains ozone "can reduce lung function and amplify respiratory symptoms" such as asthma.
Local council wants community space
In the end, the decision was clear: With two votes against, the local council of Fluorn-Winzel decides to set up a community space in the future senior living facility.
Before the discussion, there is an important piece of information: The purchase contract for the missing piece of land has been signed, reports Mayor Bernhard Tjaden.
Although it will still take until the area previously belonging to the congregation is in the congregation's possession, there is now no obstacle to planning for the project to be stemmed by a private investor.
There is a discussion on a Community area.
One of the two investors still in the boat has offered to meet the community.
On the ground floor, he would provide a living space - around 55 square feet - and an adjacent terrace with as much as 70 square feet of space for a special price.
The administration and the majority of the local council intend to provide such a common space not as a meeting place only for the residents of senior-appropriate housing, but openly into the community.
As an example, the word "knitting café" made the rounds.
The decision, which was pre-decided by the allocation of funds for the current budget last autumn, will be sweetened by funding opportunities.
The construction is located in the redevelopment area.
Setting up a community space would be eligible, Tjaden reported, at 60 percent of 30 percent.
The proposal for a decision, in order to signal to the investor that they do not want to throw a stick between their legs in this regard, provides for the finding that both the saddle roof - which is similar to the surrounding construction - and the console roof - which reduces the height of the saddle and makes the construction more economical - would be possible.
Needless, not only Wilfried Sohmer thinks, is this addition.
If it helps: Unanimously, he passes the panel.
The common room is not so easy.
Daniela Ruf points to the many own buildings you don't quite get on with, for that you're now leaning out of the window at the communal space, she says: "I'm struggling with it."
Yvonne Staiger is absolutely in favour of community space - but absolutely against communal participation.
It sees behind it a covert subsidy to already wealthy or even foreign investors.
That is not the case, because the acquisition of the area does not give a grant, but gives a real, if in doubt marketable value, the counter-argument is.
Staiger's motion to split the proposed decision accordingly finds three advocates.
Thus, with two votes against the original programme, which Stefan Haller summarizes as follows: "If we take the decision in this way, we will take a giant step towards closing a huge gap in our infrastructure."
Collision with car: Cyclist is hurled on road
While crossing the road, an 82-year-old cyclist was trapped by a car and seriously injured in Garath on Wednesday.
According to police, the 82-year-old Langenfelder had been riding his bike on the bike path of the Schwarzer Weg road coming from the direction of Hilden at 12.20pm.
The senior wanted to cross the carriageway at the height of the Am Buchholzer Busch road.
A female passenger car driver travelling in the same direction gave him priority.
When the Langenfelder drove onto the road, however, he apparently did not pay attention to oncoming traffic.
He collided with a car steering a 66-year-old Hildenerin.
The man was hurled into the street.
He suffered serious injuries and was taken to a hospital with a retouching van.
FC Bayern Munich must forgo David Alaba and Thiago in the Supercup against Borussia Dortmund
The Supercup takes place without him: David Alaba has to let the game suck up against Dortmund.
With staffing concerns, FC Bayern travel to Dortmund for the first mandatory game of the new season.
Seven pros are missing the title defender in the Supercup against the Cup winner.
Staff worries at German soccer record champion Bayern Munich are growing ahead of Saturday's Supercup (8.30pm / ZDF and Eurosport) at cup winner Borussia Dortmund.
Trainer Carlo Ancelotti must also give up on David Alaba in the duel with BVB.
That was confirmed by the Italian on Friday.
Munich's Manuel Neuer, James, Thiago, Jerome Boateng, Arjen Robben and Juan Bernat are also missing.
For the five defeats in the past six Test matches, Ancelotti has blamed the physical condition and lack of balance in his team's game.
"We know we are not in the best physical condition," Ancelotti said, adding: "The most important point is the balance in the team.
That wasn't good last. "
But the 58-year-old believes in a performance boost in the first official mandatory game of the season.
"Football is also tactics, strategy, personality and motivation.
I have great confidence that my team is showing those qualities.
The team is ready.
We want to play smart,"said Ancelotti, who expects a" difficult, intense game."
The duel of the two German soccer heavyweights captivates the fans.
The match is sold out with 81,360 spectators, the German Football League (DFL) announced on Friday.
Wandering in the resin from star to star
In the resin, the first "Star Path" is to be created nationwide.
This is planned by the association Sternwarte Sankt Andreasberg.
There is a planetary path in Göttingen - since 2003.
A "star path" would meet the information needs of many resin visitors, it said.
It combines nature, science, movement and athletic performance.
The members want to set up panels along the planned route and inform them about stars and constellations.
In a first phase until 2018, the association plans "well-attainable installations at five to six locations" in the upper resin.
St. Andreasberg, Braunlage, Hohegeiß and Sieber would be eligible.
The information on the boards will be supplemented via the Internet.
This is why good mobile network reception plays a role in the selection of locations.
Accessibility was also a criterion.
Later the star path Zug is to be extended by train.
"On the star path, viewers learn a lot of things worth knowing about, for example, the physics of the individual stars," the association explained.
They also learned why stars have different colors or why one star shines more strongly than another, even though it lies much further away.
It is also taught which constellation a selected star is in and when it is best to see it.
The association has been operating the highest observatory in northern Germany in the mountain town of St. Andreasberg since 2014.
The site in the middle of the Harz National Park is one of the six darkest regions in Germany, according to the Federal Office for Nature Conservation.
From there, the Milky Way and even the Andromeda galaxy can be seen clearly with the naked eye.
Since 2003, on the initiative of the funding association Planetarium Göttingen, there has been something similar to the planned Starwerg - the Planetary Path.
Starting in front of Gebhard's hotel in the Goetheallee, which forms the interior of our solar system, the planetary path with its steles leads up to the Hainberg and the observatory - as well as an "extraterrestrial" location in Diemarden (municipality of Equals) with the planet Sedna.
The steles with the individual planets - including the Pluto degraded to the dwarf planet at the end point - are positioned exactly at the distance and scale of one to two billion.
The earth thus shrinks to a sphere of 6.5 millimeters in diameter, while the sun, standing exactly 75 meters away, measures 70 centimeters.
The total distance of the planetary path is a good four kilometers.
While the light from sun to Pluto takes about eight hours, pedestrians need a good hour to get to the stele with Pluto.
So pedestrians are faster than the light in space.
The march to the next fixture star, however, would still take half a year.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for the first time, discuss a possible showdown
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who were due to be on a collision course to stage the most exciting boxing match in the near future under 147 pounds, met for the first time on Thursday.
They were in separate rooms at ESPN offices in Los Angeles until Garcia, the unbeaten World Boxing Council lightweight champion, walked down the hallway to greet Lomachenko, the World Boxing Organization super-featherweight champion.
After Garcia's victory by unanimous decision over former four-division world champion Adrien Broner on Showtime on Saturday, both fighters are members of the top five pound-for pound list.
Garcia stretched out his right hand and said,"How are you going, champion?
I wish you good luck. "
Lomachenko defends his belt against Miguel Marriaga on Saturday night at 7 p.m. on ESPN.
As the pair posed for photos, Lomachenko manager Egis Klimas noted that a possible showdown between the fighters would be the "perfect order of magnitude."
"I'm a former featherweight," Garcia recalled.
"I went up for Broner [to 140 pounds], but I'm not that big.
I'm small for 140.
I want to get down to lightweight.
And he needs to move on lightweights [135 pounds] and then we fight.
That's what the fans demand.
Let's give them that. "
Lomachenko agreed.
"Boxing needs this fight."
Klimas asked if it should be on pay-per-view, part of a strategy Lomachenko will have to fight with a 135-pound debut this year to agree a date with Garcia next summer (37-0, 30 knockouts) who also has interest in fighting the winner of Jorge Linares-Luke Campbell after their lightweight title fight at the Forum on September 23.
"This fight could be in pay-per-view mode because all the fans have asked for it," Garcia said, later expressing himself openly to fight at the network, which offers the best financial package.
We are the best.
No other names can generate this kind of attention.
Whenever they're ready...""
Garcia said he appreciates Lomachenko as "a tremendous fighter," and he will possibly take part in his Saturday fight.
But Lomachenko stopped at the lavish praise for Garcia, saying that he thinks the three-match champion from Riverside look "very slow, sorry Mikey... you wanted the co-off after all."
Garcia said the focus was to show hitting strength, then boxing.
Both said they could feel the momentum building up for their own fight.
"This is the fight that needs to be carried out.
No other fight creates so much attention and enthusiasm.
I'm more than happy to work on it,"Garcia said.
Lomachenko said: "I've been waiting for the top fighters, and that's Mikey.
It's going to be a great fight. "
Four injured after tyre burst
Four people were partially seriously injured in an accident on the A7 on Thursday afternoon.
According to initial information, the driver of an Opel Zafira lost control of his vehicle about 4.30pm shortly before the market wide junction, presumably after a tyre burst.
The car slammed to the right into the embankment, where it overturned and then remained lying on the roof in the green strip.
The four occupants - two adults and two children - were partly seriously injured in the accident.
The A7 was closed to the north for about an hour during the emergency service's initial supply of the injured, after which traffic on the left lane could be passed by the accident site.
Fortunas Hoffmann: "Triple chain works better"
Andre Hoffmann hopes the optimisation of the defensive formation in Aue brings points after the 2-2 win at the start of the season against Braunschweig.
Andre Hoffmann was satisfied with the first game of the season, with the result, too, had it not been for the two goals in the 2-2 against Braunschweig.
"Those were two opponent goals too much and we have to pay even better attention in Aue," says the Fortuna Düsseldorf defensive player.
In the Ore Mountains, the triple chain is also to be further optimized.
And a goal after a free-kick the fortunes don't want to catch any more.
"For the future, it's going to be the case that no one is putting themselves on the line alongside Michael (Rensing) anymore."
Hoffmann is convinced that even after the experience in the preparation, his team can cope better with the three-chain than with the four-chain.
"I still don't know how we're going to act in Aue," says his coach Friedhelm Funkel, but Hoffmann is sure of his cause,"because we have players who can build up well right now in the triple chain on the half positions in Kaan Ayhan and Niko Gießelmann," Hoffmann said.
"Prerequisite, though, is that we harmonize even better and we don't afford as many playoff errors in the build-up."
Of course, Hoffmann is also heading to Aue to win the game.
"But whether you can talk about a failed start after a draw doesn't know.
The performance could well be okay,"said Hoffmann.
"However, if we can get away with four points on Sunday and focus on the cup, we'll certainly be able to talk about a proper start to the season."
His coach didn't want to know about that.
"I don't judge the start to the season until after six to eight days of play," said Friedhelm Funkel, who doesn't want to speak of an advantage over Aue just because the Saxons' game in Heidenheim had to be canceled prematurely because of a storm.
"Now they can virtually start the season with a home game," said Funkel and Hoffmann believes the players from Aue might even be a little fresher as they wouldn't have a heavy and complete game like Fortuna against a rising favourite in the bones.
"But they don't know as 100 per cent where they currently stand," says the Fortuna interior defender.
Although the guests from the Rhineland will go into the encounter at the finally (almost) finished stadium of Aue as a slight favourite on Sunday.
"That we sweep them away just because we are entitled to get under the first six is nonsense," says Funkel, whose record in just one defeat against Aue from nine games is thoroughly positive.
"There is no team in the 2nd Bundesliga that you have to beat in the first place," explains Fortuna's head coach.
"To make such a statement would be arrogant and arrogant."
And so Funkel definitely doesn't want to experience his players on Sunday.
New results of Swedish asylum age assessment tests published
The latest results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden, which underwent a new method of medical assessment of their age, show that more than 80 percent of those tested are older than 18, but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results.
The Swedish Agency for Forensic Medicine (Rättsmedicinalverket) started carrying out the tests last year.
They are to make age assessment more accurate during the asylum process after the Swedish Migration Agency (Migrationsverket) was criticised for errors in assessing the correct age of some refugees who were underage.
To date, Migrationsverket has sent 6,880 cases to be tested and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now released the results of a total of 2,481 tests from the period from mid-March to July 31, 2017.
Eighty percent (2002) were assessed as 18 or older, while in another 25 cases the Forensic Medicine Agency assessed that the person was "possibly 18 years or older."
In 432 cases, the conclusion was that the person "may be under 18 years old."
The tests will only be carried out in cases where the age of the person is questioned.
According to Johan Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency, the results have been consistent over the past few months.
"We don't see much difference in the statistics of the past few months, the numbers are pretty constant," he told the magazine The Local.
The high proportion of cases where the person was judged to be over the age of 18 does not necessarily mean that the asylum seeker lied about his age.
In May, the agency released the results of 581 tests and said there were 442 cases that "suggest that the person examined was 18 years or older."
When the Svenska Dagbladet newspaper examined the 581 published results, it found that in 243 of those cases, the person had openly said that she was turning 18 this year.
The method of medical age assessment, which involves X-rays of wisdom teeth and MRI recordings of knee joints, which are then analysed by dentists and radiologists, has also been criticised in some areas.
One skeptic is the endocrinologist Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute, whose work includes assessing the biological maturity of people to see if they went through puberty sooner or later than usual.
"I had reason to think about it, and I don't think the type of measurement should be used.
Judging biological age in this way is very uncertain.
If we can't say it for sure, we shouldn't pretend we could,"he told the Metro newspaper.
However, Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency defended the accuracy of the tests: "In general, you can say that the risk of misjudging a child as an adult is low.
The biggest risk is if the person is just under 18, in this case this is about 10 per cent. "
Full in the plan
Work on the three bridges of Landstraße 108 between Lauterbach and Schramberg is progressing well.
On Wednesday, a seven-tonne piece of concrete was installed at the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lauterbach.
"We're very good at the time, it's going super," says Reinhold Leicht, construction manager at the Department of Road and Transport at the regional office of Freiburg.
In April, work began at the same time on all three bridges between Schramberg and Lauterbach in need of refurbishment.
Construction is scheduled for October and Leicht is sure the timetable will be met.
The first bridge, coming from Schramberg, leads over the Trombach.
It is a vaulted arch bridge made of concrete clad in red coloured sandstone and has a total length of 4.80 metres.
It was built in 1900.
Like the other two bridges, it is now in the years.
In order to ensure stability and road safety, the three buildings are now being thoroughly renovated.
The other two bridges lead over the Lauterbach.
They are made of red coloured sandstone.
Both were built in 1939 and are twelve, respectively 10.60 meters long.
The bridge at the entrance of Lauterbach has now received a 1.30-metre wide and seven-tonne so-called bridge cap on the north side on Wednesday morning.
This is a border fastening, which is also used as an operating route.
A 2.20-metre-wide bridge cap is due to be deployed on the southern part of the bridge on Friday.
Then the pedestrian path should run.
The special thing is that these are finished parts, a patent of the Schramberger company Dizwo.
The other two bridges are already fitted with the patented bridge caps.
The laying of lines through the building in Lauterbach required a special sensitivity.
Because there is also a fiber optic cable, to which many companies are connected.
The residents were informed about the project in advance of the work.
In addition, fish and crabs had to be fished first.
For the bridges between the Bauhof building and the collecting pond in the direction of Schramberg, the traffic is regulated single-lane by a traffic light.
The road in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotels "Tannenhof" and "Sieben Linden" is fully closed for the construction work on the bridge at the entrance to Lauterbach.
The total cost of the three bridge renovations is EUR 700 000.
The whole thing is financed by the country.
AfD in Gerolstein: Colorful protest at German potato salad
It is not so common for parties to pull together, but when it comes to the Alternative for Germany (AfD), it comes together, which is otherwise difficult to reconcile.
The parties (CDU, SPD, Greens, FDP, FWG, Left) represented in Vulkaneifel County Day belong to a broad alliance that peacefully flags that day because the AfD in the Gerolstein town hall invites Rondell to the "big campaign launch," according to the poster.
And brings familiar names to the launch - such as Alice Weidel, who along with Alexander Gauland forms the top duo for the federal election on September 24, and Deputy Federal Chairman Beatrix von Storch.
But those who are on the scene hours before the event begins don't want to listen to the AfD people, they want to demonstrate.
The motto "The Eifel remains colorful."
Originally, the city picnic was planned under the slogan "All at a table" on the fountain square, but is now taking place in the parking lot below the Rondell - and thus right in front of the eyes of those coming to the AfD event in the town hall.
A colorful picture.
And what Christa Karoli, chairwoman of the Forum One World and one of the authoritative organisers, is really pleased with: "Great how many people have come together here."
There's music and plenty of food, including a "primordial German potato salad that the AfD could easily eat," says the woman who brought him along.
Police have ordered many officials to Gerolstein, showing presence especially at the station, which is just yards away from the venues.
How did the AfD actually get on Gerolstein?
Mario Hompes of the AfD Vulkaneifel reports that he has sought such an event and won the award.
The 45-year-old from Gönnersdorf had initially asked in Daun, but received a cancellation there because there were not enough parking spaces because of the already built Laurentiuskirmes.
So now the Rondell, Hompes is pleased that "we can have such a beautiful event here."
Looking ahead to the event on the Rondell forecourt, he says: "This is people's good right, main thing, it remains peaceful."
That's what it does: Around 8 p.m., a band provides entertainment on the Rondellvorplatz, in the Stadthalle various speakers, including the Rhineland-Palatinate AfD chairman Uwe Junge.
In the room are about 200 listeners waiting for the front-runner for the federal election, Alice Weidel, and Deputy Federal Chairman Beatrix von Storch to deliver their speeches.
The police presence is unchanged, but so far officials have had a quiet evening.
The AfD event lasts a little more than an hour, the guests on the forecourt have a longer breath, but also there is scheduled to clean up shortly after 9pm.
The police can step down - no special occurrences.
Trombone hits trumpet
A rehearsal with the Wolfsburg trombonist Frederic Belli will take place in the series of Haslacher monastery concerts tomorrow, Sunday, at 20 o'clock in the monastery church.
Together with the Bulgarian trumpeter Miroslav Petkov he gives a concert under the motto "Black Sea meets Black Forest," or even "Balkan folklore" meets a classical German education with roots in brass music.
Both soloists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and hold solo positions in top European orchestras.
Petkov is a solo trumpeter with the renowned Concertgebouw Orchestra Amsterdam and Frederic Belli is a solo trombonist of the SWR Symphony Orchestra.
Both combine the desire not only to push the boundaries on their instruments, but also to merge the boundaries of the different genres.
This is how Johann Sebastian Bach sounds with the two as if in a new guise, Daniel Schnyder's "world music" combines with Bulgarian folklore, and in the piece "Exchange Suite" by the jazz chop-winner Nils Wogram, classical, jazz and free playing blend into a fascinating overall work of art.
This centerpiece of the program was only premiered this spring with huge success in Freiburg.
The renowned composer Nils Wogram wrote it especially for the two musicians and even more: The Haslacher Klosterkirche with its special acoustics is consciously included in the concert.
Kristen Stewart talks about her bisexuality
"Some people love grilled cheese and will eat it until the end of their lives.
But I want to try everything,"Kristen Stewart candidly tweeted about her bisexuality.
"Once I bite into grilled cheese, I think,' Oh that was cool, what's next? '."
Arguably the Hollywood star's best-known relationship was with her "Twilight" colleague Robert Pattinson, who ended up bitterly apart.
Despite all this, the brunette performer assures "Harper's Bazaar" magazine: "I was seriously in love with everyone I dated.
Or do you think I would have played it? "
After their separation, Kristen admitted she was bisexual: 'I've always lived dualism and seriously believed in it.
So it has never confused or hindered me.
I just never liked not being taken seriously. "
She suffered particularly from this, according to "Bang Showbiz" but in school time, when she preferred to dress like a Bub: "Not all girls are typical girls.
That really hurt me a lot.
When I was eleven, the kids told me I would look like a Bub.
I felt really attacked, scared and ashamed.
Now I look back and think to myself, 'Girl, be proud of you!'. "
She doesn't like explaining her love life to the public in particular: 'People expect you to relate in a certain way and that annoys me.
And maybe some call me ungrateful, but I don't like having to justify myself in front of the whole public. "
West Virginia governor announces he's changing party
. The Democratic governor of West Virginia, Jim Justice, announced Thursday night at a rally with President Trump that he will change the party.
Whether you like it or not, the Democrats have moved away from me,"Governor Justice said.
"Today I'll tell you with a lot of prayers and a lot of thought... today I'll tell you as a resident of West Virginia, I can't help you anymore if I'm a Democratic governor."
The rally erupted in jubilation.
"Tomorrow I will change my registration to the Republicans," Justice added.
"As a coach, I'd say it's time to play a different game."
Mr. Trump previously promised a big announcement at the West Virginia rally.
Mr. Trump won West Virginia by 42 points, and Justice did not approve Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.
Justice, who is the only billionaire in the state, according to Forbes, was elected in 2016.
Forbes notes that he owns coal mines in five states, and inherited a coal business from his father.
It is worth roughly $1.59 billion.
Meanwhile, the Republican National Committee issued a statement Thursday night saying,"Governor Justice's change of party is another blow to a Democratic Party that would prevent us rather than work to make our country great again."
"With only 15 governorships and control of the fewest legislative bodies in history, Governor Justice's announcement is only the last rejection of a party that is leaderless from top to bottom and unable to find a positive, unifying message," RNC Chairman Ronna McDaniel said in a statement to CBS News.
Coe praises' honest 'Russian apology for doping scandal
World athletics chief executive Sebastian Coe on Thursday praised what he described as an apparent apology from Russia to a doping scandal, but he reiterated it was not the moment for the country to be welcomed back into the sport.
Russia's athletics chief Dmitry Shylakhtin said during the IAAF Congress on the eve of the World Athletics Championships that his country's relegation from the sport was correct and that he was determined to fight doping.
He said he was sorry for "all the athletes who were snapped away with gold and silver medals at competitions."
Despite his comments, the IAAF Congress voted to uphold the ban, which was imposed in November 2015 after a report by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) found evidence of state-sponsored doping in Russia.
"I thought it was a very open response today, a very honest presentation," IAAF President Coe told reporters.
"The entire council and Congress have been pleased that the Russian Federation has recognised within itself that it has experienced some pretty hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the federation is reshaped."
Coe said he was also "pleased" that Russia accepted the criteria for its reintroduction.
"I think it was a very constructive day, and I think that progress has been made, but Congress supports the task force's recommendations that this is not the moment to reinstate Russia," Coe said.
"We've got to do everything we can over the next few months to normalise this situation.
The guiding principle has always been that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the tainted system,"he added
Nineteen Russian athletes will compete as neutral players at the World Athletics Championships, which begin in London on Friday, according to the strict IAAF criteria.
The head of the IAAF task force, Rune Andersen, said on Monday that Russia had yet to meet some of the criteria for reinstatement.
Drug tests were still inadequate and banned trainers were still operating freely, he told reporters in London after a lecture at the IAAF Council.
Act of mourning for soldiers who crashed in Mali
At a funeral ceremony in Fritzlar, northern Hesse, around 1000 people thought of the two soldiers who died in a helicopter crash in Mali.
The ceremony took place in the cathedral city on Thursday under high security precautions.
On the still unexplained cause of the crash, Defense Minister Ursula von der Leyen (CDU) said nothing.
However, she described the two deceased pilots as "masters of their profession."
"We bow to this highest sacrifice they have made on behalf of the Federal Republic of Germany," she explained.
The 33-year-old Major and the 47-year-old chief of staff from North Hesse had died in West African Mali a week ago on Wednesday.
Their coffins were transferred to Germany and taken to the Fritzlarer Dom Sankt Peter on Thursday accompanied by a death guard from the Bundeswehr.
At noon, at first, only the relatives in the church said goodbye.
Afterwards the funeral ceremony began in the circle of the family, closest friends, representatives of the Bundeswehr and politics.
Among them were Hesse's Prime Minister Volker Bouffier (CDU) and the Inspector General of the Bundeswehr Volker Wieker.
Mourners laid down roses, the loved ones stood arm in arm by the coffins.
In front of the church, Fritzlarer and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on a canvas.
Defence Minister von der Leyen described the soldiers who died as "highly decorated" and deployed.
The chief of staff was one of the first six trained Tiger pilots of his regiment and helped set up the flight operation of the Tiger combat helicopter in Fritzlar.
Volker Bauersachs, commander of the regiment, which includes the soldiers, also declared: "If this crew could not avert the crash, then none would have been able to."
Minister von der Leyen did not show any doubts about the UN mission in Mali: The deployment was dangerous.
But he is also of high importance "to a country from which we are separated only by two states," she said.
After the funeral, the coffins were brought out of the cathedral.
When and where they are buried, the Bundeswehr did not provide any information.
Prince Henrik doesn't want a grave next to his wife
The husband of the Danish Queen Margrethe (77), Prince Henrik (83), does not want to be buried next to his wife after his death.
The royal shared that on Thursday.
Traditionally, the Danish royal couple are buried in the cathedral church of Roskilde.
The sculptor Bjørn Nørgaard already made a sarcophagus for the two.
The Queen agreed with her husband's decision, the memo went on to say.
Where Prince Henrik will be buried is still unclear.
However, he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland.
Prince Henrik had never made a secret of the fact that he was not happy with his title.
After his wife Margrethe ascended the throne in 1972, he would have liked to have become king.
He retired in 2016, also releasing the title of "Prince's Supper."
As Henrik did not get the title and function he wanted in Denmark, he did not see himself as equal to his wife - even after death, explained Lene Balleby, the chief spokeswoman for the Danish royal house.
Where the 83-year-old's final resting place will ultimately be is still unclear.
However, he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland, but in Denmark.
He likes the country he has worked for over the last 50 years.
The native Henri de Laborde de Monpezat, son of a French aristocratic family, had met Margrethe in London in 1965.
On the Thames, he worked in the French Embassy.
During his later wife the expressions of sympathy of the people always flew, Prince Henrik had a heavy stand with the Danes in his nearly 50-year reign.
In an autobiography, Henrik said of the first few years in Denmark: "A few months after my arrival, everything I did was criticized.
My Danish was wavering, I preferred wine instead of beer, silk stockings instead of knitting socks, Citroën instead of Volvo, tennis instead of football.
Even for the Gauloises I smoked instead of Virginia tobacco and who in this country had a reputation for being the brand of socially critical intellectuals, I could not hope for leniency.
I was different.
I seemed to be happy with that position and not ashamed of myself.
These were two mistakes at once! "
Prime Minister Weil wants swift re-election
CDU and FDP ahead of possible majority in Lower Saxony
Lower Saxony's Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) is in favour of a speedy re-election of the Landtag after losing the red-green government majority, but he does not want to resign.
Weil on Friday advocated the dissolution of parliament.
Previously, the surprise exit of a Greens MP from her state parliamentary group in Lower Saxony had plunged the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) into a serious crisis.
Five months before the official date of the state election, the red-green coalition in Hanover lost its narrow one-vote majority in parliament to the opposition from the CDU and FDP.
The previous Greens MP Elke Twesten justified her move with the non-nomination for the 2018 election in her constituency in Rotenburg (Wümme).
"I see my political future in the CDU," she declared in Hanover on Friday.
CDU group leader Björn Thümler wants to recommend to his group to include them.
That would give the CDU and FDP a combined 69 seats in the Lower Saxony Landtag, SPD and Greens 68.
So far, the relationship has been reversed.
The new Landtag will be elected regularly on 14 January next year.
Thümler said the red-green state government must now decide whether it could continue to govern in this situation without a majority.
However, Stephan Weil considers it essential that the Landtag decides on its self-dissolution as quickly as possible.
The CDU group is expected to decide on how to proceed on Tuesday.
The state constitution also provides for the possibility of the Landtag stripping the prime minister of confidence and electing a successor.
"Our constitution offers several options.
These opportunities need to be examined legally neatly,"Thümler said.
"You'll calmly discuss all the issues if they are legally properly considered."
Thümler called TWest's move "a little odd, after all."
The politician herself stressed: "I'm not a traitor.
I feel very good. "
She described herself as a supporter of black-green.
The Greens called on the breakaway MP to return her state parliament mandate.
"We assume, of course, that she will return her state parliament mandate, which she received via the Green Land List, with immediate effect," state chairmen Meta Janssen-Kucz and Stefan Körner told reporters.
Greens leader Anja Piel said: "We are extremely sorry for Elke Twesten's decision."
She had deliberately chosen not to hold a debate in the group.
"Even against the background that there were no substantive differences, we can't fathom this move."
SPD chancellor candidate Martin Schulz condemns the move of Lower Saxony Greens MP Elke Twesten to the CDU as a betrayal.
"The behaviour of former Greens MPs in Lower Saxony is not only a betrayal of voters, but also a betrayal of red-green," the federal head of the Social Democrats wrote on Facebook on Friday.
He supported the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) to have the Landtag quickly re-elected.
West's exit costs red-green in Lower Saxony the majority.
The politician,"in her wounded vanity and frustration, put her personal interests before the good of the country," criticized SPD Secretary General Hubertus Heil.
"It's a scandal that the CDU in Lower Saxony is taking part in this dirty intrigue game and trying to make political capital out of it."
Lower Saxony's CDU group leader Björn Thümler wants to recommend that his deputies include Elke Twesten in the CDU.
The SPD group leader in the Bundestag, Thomas Oppermann, accused Twesten of using personal career memory to falsify the outcome of the 2013 state election.
The CDU was the strongest force before the SPD at the time, but the SPD and the Greens had a very thin majority of one vote in the Landtag.
Agriculture Minister in interview - How do we protect ourselves from poison eggs, Mr Schmidt?
Germany discusses contaminated eggs
How could the scandal happen?
How can consumers protect themselves.
Minister of Agriculture Christian Schmidt (CSU) speaks and answers in an interview with the editorial network Germany (RND).
Mr Schmidt, how can consumers protect themselves from poisoned eggs?
I can only encourage all consumers to take a close look at the eggs in your fridge and check the stamp.
On the consumer protection portal www.Lebensmittelwarnung.de, the federal states provide the latest information on the affected egg batches.
Affected eggs should be destroyed or returned.
Even if, according to everything we currently know, a health hazard is practically excluded.
Is Aldi now taking on the best possible crisis response - all the eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the enlightener is not really being played by the Federal Agriculture Minister?
Food monitoring is the responsibility of the federal states.
Nevertheless, my house has opened immediately and has been in close contact with the authorities of the countries since Germany became aware of the concern.
All information and risk assessment are available to consumers.
Retailers, as well as manufacturers, must ensure that the products sold are marketable and harmless to health.
If eggs exceed the maximum residue content of 0.005mg / kg, they are not transportable.
Uncontaminated eggs, however, can be sold and consumed.
This time, businesses are not to blame.
Are production companies and consumers in the same boat?
According to current knowledge, the production plants are not directly to blame.
Rather, they face economic damage as a result of alleged illegal practices by service companies.
As always, there are too few controllers in the event of an emergency.
Is there only a lack of staff or coherent competence?
It was precisely the official controls that revealed the process.
But the truth is that food fraud and criminal energy can never be 100 per cent ruled out.
It is precisely for this reason that a consistent investigation of such events and the handover to prosecutors in cases where crimes can be committed are of crucial importance.
I have already made it clear on several occasions that I expect the responsible authorities to provide complete information.
Is regular alarm about food scandals really necessary?
Consumers have the right to receive only safe and marketable food.
When an unauthorised insecticide is used in the food industry, consumers are rightly outraged.
The adulterated means have put manufacturers, traders and consumers in a situation that is absolutely not necessary.
In principle, it must be clear that the unlawful use of the insecticide fipronil in the keeping of food-producing animals is unacceptable and must be stopped immediately.
This must be done consistently and with high pressure at all levels.
I expect all the competent authorities to clarify the facts quickly and completely.
How football's financial rules affect Neymar's move to Paris
The rules, which aim to prevent unfettered spending by European football clubs, will not disrupt Neymar's world-record transfer from Spain's Barcelona to France's Paris-Saint Germain.
Any consequences will still come for Paris Saint-Germain from UEFA, because the senior organisation that oversees the European game has the power to ban teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament.
Financial Fair Play rules, launched by UEFA in 2011, mean PSG will eventually have to prove that the transfer of Neymar was funded without major losses.
Barcelona have paid 222 million euros ($262 million) to buy the Brazilian out of his contract, and Neymar will receive a salary that will be several tens of millions of dollars a year.
Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymar's move to France.
PSG can certainly make the money loose for Neymar to sign and take him to a galaxy of other stars, given the team's funding from the energy-rich ruling family of Qatar.
Clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money on acquiring players but have to counteract with legitimate sources of revenue that allow them the break-even point in their football-related business.
FFP was conceived by Michel Platini after his election as UEFA president in 2007.
The former French player believed clubs who had taken on huge debts in their pursuit of success were effectively cheating and risked ruining themselves if banks or owners withdrew their support.
In 2011, FFP shifted from focusing on the clubs' debt to monitoring their losses.
The change meant that the business model that Roman Abramovich originally used at Chelsea in 2003 - bought a club with potential and then invested heavily to improve the squad and build a global brand - should become a tougher affair.
Clubs can take losses of 30 million euros during the current three-year FFP investment period, which runs until 2018.
And although Platini fell into disgrace from the presidency in 2015, his UEFA successor Aleksander Ceferin remains committed to deterring from excessive spending.
"Certainly FFP is not dead and we will certainly strengthen the rules for the future," Andrea Traverso, who is in charge of FFP at UEFA, told The Associated Press last week.
Although PSG paid Neymar's buy-out clause in a lump sum, it can distribute the amount for accounting over the duration of his contract.
Neymar has signed a five-year contract so the transfer fee for the next five years of €44.4 million can be reported in the annual accounts.
The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 hit PSG with the heaviest sanctions, along with Abu Dhabi, which is owned by Manchester City.
PSG received a fine of 60 million euros (then $82 million), which was later reduced to 20 million euros - and it was ordered that team members remain limited to 21 players for the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 season instead of the otherwise normal 25 players.
UEFA is looking for clubs that could try to outwit their financial oversight by inflating their revenue through companies linked to a club's owners.
While a Qatari company could sponsor PSG if the value of the sponsorship were to exceed standard market rates, UEFA would not let this be considered a legitimate income.
That is exactly what happened in 2014, when UEFA decided that the value of PSA sponsorship was inflated by the Qatar Tourism Authority.
It has been reported that part of PSG's payments to Neymar could come via payments from the organising committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.
But PSG and Qatar in 2022 have denied that Neymar will become World Cup ambassador and such a maneuver could be easy for UEFA regulators to find out.
The sanctions against PSG so far mean UEFA will be even more attentive to heeding any attempt to circumvent the rules.
UEFA had no preliminary talks with PSG over Neymar's transfer, the people familiar with the situation said on Thursday.
They spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to discuss the PSG situation.
The latest published reports show that PSG made a profit of more than 10 million euros in 2015 / 16 with sales of 542.4 million euros.
The accounts for the last financial year have yet to be released.
PSG expect Neymar's arrival to be a boon for sponsorship deals, merchandising and jersey sales.
The club expects sales to rise by at least 30 per cent after signing.
The Spanish league was clearly irritated to see one of the best football players go, and it tried to prevent Neymar's departure by claiming that PSG would hurt the FFP.
"It is a clear case of" financial doping "with the club and the state," La Liga president Javier Tebas told Spanish newspaper AS, referring to Qatar's eventual ownership of PSG.
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, whose club is owned by an American sports tycoon, shares La Liga's reservations about a state funding a club.
"It is the consequence of ownership and that has completely changed the whole landscape of football over the last 15 years," Wenger said on Thursday.
"As soon as a country owns an association, everything is possible.
It's going to be very difficult to respect financial fair play because you can go different ways or have different interests when a country has such a big player to represent a country. "
Swiss is looking for a new chocolate supplier
In recent years, Chocolat Frey has made board chocolate for the Swiss.
Now the sweet collaboration faces a possible end: The airline is rewriting the order.
Swiss spokeswoman Meike Fuhlrott, at the request of the sda news agency, confirmed a corresponding report by the newspaper "Northwest Switzerland" on Friday.
According to current planning, the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018.
The products would be inspected every two to three years and subjected to quality control.
"We are very pleased with current supplier Chocolat Frey," the spokeswoman said.
Around 17 million small red-white-wrapped shock boards weighing 14 grams distribute the flight attendants to passengers each year before landing.
Swiss did not want to provide any information about the costs.
Industry insiders estimate the order volume according to "Northwest Switzerland" at 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the Migros subsidiary achieves an annual turnover of around one billion Swiss francs.
But more important is the advertising effect: For a chocolate manufacturer, it is a prestigious order.
Swiss does not want to reveal how many applicants there are in the new call for tenders.
However, only Swiss manufacturers are eligible.
According to the newspaper report, Chocolat Frey wants to seek a renewal of the contract beyond the spring of 2018.
For sda, the largest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not available for comment.
Swiss has been distributing chocolate plates on board its flights since 2006.
Before the Swiss signed a contract with the Migros subsidiary, Barry Callebaut had supplied the chocolate tablets in collaboration with Hug.
The opportunity to place the logo was introduced by Swiss two and a half years ago with the launch of the collaboration with Chocolat Frey.
The airline works with different Swiss chocolate producers.
On long-haul flights, First Class customers are pampered with treats from Confiserie Sprüngli, in Business Class niche passengers Schoggi from Lindt and in Economy Class Schoggi from Chocolat Frey.
Swiss Schoggi from Chocolat Frey also distributes on the short haul, both in Business and Economy Class.
Athletics - Discus Olympic champion Robert Harting reaches World Cup finals
The three-time world champion is vying for a medal in the final on Saturday.
His brother Christoph, the 2016 Olympic champion, had failed in the national World Cup qualifier and could only watch the discus competition from the grandstand.
Also with the first try, Polish title defender Piotr Malachowski, who threw 65.13 yards wide, qualified for the final fight.
Nostalgia goes into the niche in "Wet Hot American Summer" and "Comrade Detective"
This repetition of the story is simultaneously nostalgic for the glory days of the characters of the 80s, for the 90s grunge era (when the pre-thinkers David Wain and Michael Showalter shot the sketch comedy "The State" for MTV), and for themselves - that is, for 2001, before their stars, such as Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd, went to bigger things.
As a cultural artifact, it is equally a parody and an embodiment of our Facebook-enabled era of permanent memories.
But as a franchise, it feels like time is running out.
"First Day of Camp" worked surprisingly well, not just because of its absurd humor (it included an original story for a talking can of vegetables spoken by H. Jon Benjamin).
By stiffening to the core of the gag - middle-aged actors playing horny kids growing up - they still managed the impossibility of winning back the last part of the joke.
"Ten Years Later," with its adults now playing adults, is less emotionally rooted and its parody goes more along the watering can principle, including a riff on the Stalker films of the 90s like "The Hand That Rocks the Cradle" ("The Hand That Rocks the Cradle").
At one point, a character rumbles through an Apple Powerbook, some inline skates and "a number of other things from 1991."
Many of the central stories are the same.
The amiable Coop (Mr. Showalter), now a novelist, still hasn't forgotten Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) still hasn't lost his virginity.
And there's another crazy-vicious plot that includes Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter), now backed by George H. W. Bush (a well-done impression of Michael Ian Black).
As always, the excursions are the best part of the franchise.
It's especially fun to see the eternally young Mr. Rudd showing off Matt Dillon's underlip beard of "Singles," whose former big-man-on-camp Andy now feels like an old knacker.
It's the moments of random madness that could fuel this franchise like a kind of repetitive "Seven Up!" Series until he reaches what I take as his logical conclusion: "Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later," whose final scene will show the gang how they will attend the film premiere of "Wet Hot American Summer."
"Comrade Detective" on Amazon, meanwhile, recalls a different kind of nostalgia: The Cold War revival of "The Americans," the movie "Atomic Blonde," and even "Glow" with its east-versus-west wrestling iconography.
Created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka, the comedy starring Rhys Thomas as director claims to be a found TV series: A 1980s Romanian drama starring the two policemen as friends, two officers from Bucharest fighting for truth, atheism and the path of Marxism-Leninism.
The lead roles - a hard-nosed Gregor and an idealistic Iosef - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu ulici, whose dialogues are dubbed in English by Channing Tatum (also an executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
It's an ingenious idea.
But it's not much more than an idea.
There are some nice gags to watch (the police spend the time watching chess on TV, as Americans might do with football).
And the list of famous speakers - including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny - makes for a decent game of 'Find the Voice Out'.
But "comrade Detective" is so committed to the veracity of a desperate propaganda drama - a killer wearing a Reagan mask is included - that it often plays like a single one.
With six long episodes, it drags on, and the comedy is not fast or frequent enough.
"Comrade Detective," edited to a lesser length, might better deliver his agitprop satire, as Gregor and Iosef keep visiting the American Embassy, whose lobby is always occupied by two fat men devouring a bunch of hamburgers.
The message for the imagined communist audience is that Western culture can make everything the fodder for a gelage.
The fictional Romanian creators were not wrong: We even do it with our own recent history and with theirs.
Blow to drug mafia in the country
Police have managed a blow to the Italian mafia in Baden-Württemberg.
On Wednesday morning, numerous objects were searched in the Black Forest Baar district, in Rottweil, Konstanz, Esslingen and Stuttgart, the prosecutor's office told Konstanz on Friday.
15 defendants, aged between 25 and 77, have been arrested and arrest warrants have already been issued against them.
Officials also secured larger quantities of marijuana and cocaine, firearms and several hundred thousand euros.
Two people have been arrested in simultaneous raids in Italy.
German arrest warrants were issued against the two suspects Italians.
The two are therefore presumably extradited to Germany.
Italian and Bavarian investigators were involved in the action.
In total, more than 300 police officers were on duty.
The members of the Mafia are accused of organised drug crime, serious violence, attempted murder and robbery and extortion.
Since the summer of 2016, the Prosecutor's Office has been investigating Konstanz against organised drug trafficking in southern Germany.
There was a lively exchange between the prosecutors in Konstanz and Palermo and the investigators of the Kripo Rottweil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily.
As a result, the large-scale operation on Wednesday morning was also accompanied by four officials from Palermo.
The investigations targeted mainly Italian nationals with close links to the Italian mafia.
An incident on May 27 in Hüfingen, in which several shots were fired into an eatery early in the morning, is also likely to go into the gang's account.
Weise laments big gaps in foreigners' register
"Data from citizens who should not show up": According to a report, the foreigners register in Germany has significant shortcomings.
This leads to some serious misdecisions in asylum procedures.
According to a media report, the Federal Government's refugee management officer, Frank-Jürgen Weise, drew attention to large gaps in the Aliens Central Register.
Deficiencies in the data registered there could lead to "partly serious misdecisions" in asylum procedures and deportations, Weise warned in an analysis available to the "Süddeutsche Zeitung."
According to the data, the register covers ten million people with foreign nationality, including some 5.7 million from non-EU countries.
The data is therefore managed by about 600 foreign authorities in Germany.
Because the data had not been sufficiently maintained, the data quality had not been good in parts so far.
In individual cases, data from 1921 had been found "by people who are no longer alive, or by citizens who have become German citizens and should no longer appear in the register."
"Faulty data input can significantly slow return processes," the report continued.
The statistics on people who have to leave also cover EU citizens who do not have to leave at all.
Such false assignments, however,"led to a distorted debate about how to deal with expatriates," according to the analysis.
Meanwhile, the federal government has apparently begun sending refugee families with under 16-year-old children back to Italy when they entered from there.
This is clear from an internal paper of the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF), reports the "Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung."
According to the paper, the BAMF has been carrying out such procedures "concerning families with children - with the exception of infants and toddlers - to Italy again since 1 June 2017."
That was virtually impossible since the end of 2014, the newspaper said, citing the difficult situation on the ground.
Under the Dublin agreement, refugees are in charge of the EU state they first reach.
If a migrant travels to another EU country, that state can send him back to the country of entry.
For the reasons, the Office now writes: "In the meantime, the absorption capacity for families with underage children in Italy has substantially increased."
Italy has given guarantees for the reception and accommodation of families.
Even the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) considers these commitments to be sufficient.
Other EU states would also send refugees back there under the Dublin agreement.
Ulla Jelpke, spokeswoman for the Left Group in the Bundestag, criticized this decision: "Families with children are threatening inhumane reception conditions and a threat to the welfare of the child because of the shortcomings in the Italian asylum system."
Second best result achieved
A total of 220 litres of blood from people living in Oberreichenbach has already been provided by the blood donation service for other people.
At least of the 12 citizens who were awarded on Friday.
First of all Jürgen Greule, who with his now 100 donations now shared 50 litres of blood.
Traditionally, in the meeting of the local council, the congregation pays tribute to the multiple willingness to donate blood.
"It is brilliant how our body is designed for this and we pay respect to the donors who provide their blood to strangers, even more disinterested," underlined Mayor Karlheinz Kistner.
"A single blood donation helps several people," explained the head of the German Red Cross (DRC), Holger Maisenbacher, because the canned goods are broken down into their components.
Three people could benefit from a blood donation.
At the same time, Maisenbacher reported on the actions that will be carried out in the spring in Oberreichenbach.
"This year we achieved the second best result with 114 donors," the DRK county preparedness chief said.
Obviously, the change to the theatre a few years ago led to higher numbers of participants.
Even before that, Thomas Bockstadt, Susanne Reichle, Sandra Schöck, Thomas Reichle and Meta Umbeer were among the multiple donors and were awarded for 50 blood donations each.
Half as many recorded Herbert Mair and Dorothee Riexinger, while Tamara Pfrommer, Petra Schleeh, Stefanie Stoll and Uwe Vetter shed 500 milliliters of their lifeblood ten times each.
The Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged after weak economic growth and weakening inflation dampened speculation of a rise.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain "sluggish" as it kept interest rates on family incomes in the midst of intensifying pressure.
Policymakers on the Bank's Monetary Committee (MPC) voted 6 to 2 to keep interest rates at 0.25%, with fewer members seeking a rise this month as weak economic growth has weakened support for an increase.
In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7% and for 2018 to 1.6% and warned that the squeeze on household incomes would continue, with inflation expected to rise to just under 3% in the autumn.
But she signalled that interest rate hikes would become necessary over the next few years to rein in Brexit-fuelled inflation and she said borrowing costs may have to rise more than expected in financial markets.
Members also voted to withdraw part of the mammoth stimulus package issued a year ago after Brexit.
It will call for time for the funding plan to provide cheaper funding for banks from next February, although it has been said it is now expected to provide £15 billion more under this scheme - at £115 billion sterling.
Minutes after the decision on the interest rate, the Bank said: "In the MPC's central forecast, gross domestic product (GDP) remains weak in the short term as the squeeze on household real incomes continues to weigh on consumption."
On interest rates, she reiterated that "some tightening of monetary policy" would be needed to cool inflation and a "slightly larger" scale than markets expect.
Markets are currently forecasting the first rise in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020.
However, the Bank stressed that increases would be "gradual" and "limited."
The Bank's downwardly revised growth forecasts for this year and next are up from the 1.9% and 1.7% forecast in May.
It has maintained its growth forecast to 1.8% in 2018.
The pound fell against the dollar and the euro after that news.
The pound fell 0.5% to $1.31 and fell 0.4% to €1.11.
The decision to make no change comes after recent disappointing growth figures dampened rising expectations of a rate hike and GDP rose to 0.3% in the second quarter from 0.2% in the previous three months.
Growth is expected to be 0.3% in the third quarter, although it is expected to recover slightly towards the end of the year, according to the bank.
The latest inflation report offered little enthusiasm for households hit by rising inflation and minor pay rises, as the tightening gets worse first before it will then improve.
It added that monetary policy cannot "prevent" the slump in income over the next few years, but it added that wages will recover "significantly" at the end of its three-year forecast.
The economy is also boosted by rising demand for British goods, due to the weak pound, which will offset some of lower consumer spending.
The decision comes a year after interest rates were cut to 0.25% last August after the shocking EU vote that caused the pound to fall.
The Bank estimates that it will likely take four years for this to fully reach prices and the economy.
Before the Bank's latest ruling on interest rates, the call for a rate hike had risen as inflation ratcheted up pressure on hard-pressed households, with three policymakers calling for a rise to 0.5% in July.
Inflation fell to 2.6% last month from 2.9% in June, although the bank said this was expected and it will rebound in the coming months.
The bank said the overshoot relative to its 2% target was "entirely" attributable to the weak pound.
Andrew Montlake, director at Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: "Given the recent decline in swap rates, the mortgage market is likely to become more competitive again as lenders are clamouring for deals and looking to end the year in a positive way.
The market looks particularly good for those where existing deals expire and take out the new mortgages, and many with fee-free options and low rates are becoming increasingly popular. "
NHS (The National Health Service) to prescribe controversial HIV drug 10,000 people
Patients will have access to "transformative" HIV prevention treatment from September after a fight in the High Court against funding for the drug in the NHS.
NHS England announced that pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) taken before intercourse, which can reduce the risk of infection in high-risk patients by around 86 per cent, is now being delivered by the health service via an initial three-year study for an estimated 10,000 people.
He agreed to fund the process after the Court of Appeal upheld a High Court ruling last year that the NHS had the power to pay for the PrEP despite the claim that local authorities should fund it.
The move announced on Thursday was hailed as an "important new intervention" by NHS England chief executive Simon Stevens, while the National Aids Trust (NAT) described it as a "pivotal moment."
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to allow people to sign up, and more clinics will follow in October before it will be rolled out across England in April 2018.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a consequence of HIV preparations taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
Studies have shown that PrEP significantly reduces HIV transmission in people at risk of infection.
Taking prep before intercourse means there are just enough drugs in a person's body to prevent HIV infection.
Such medications can be taken every day or so two hours before sexual intercourse.
Those eligible for treatment include gay or bisexual men, transgender people and those with HIV-positive partners who have not been successfully treated.
Clinics identify suitable participants who agree with the study, including men, women, transgenders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by antiretroviral treatment.
People who live in England and are registered with a family doctor can also sign up for possible participation in their local participating sex clinic.
The scheme will be £10 million and NHS England signed a contract to supply the drugs this week after an international competitive procurement.
The study aims to assess the full potential of PrEP by collecting clinical evidence on how it is targeted, absorbed and implemented on a large scale.
Stevens said: "This major new intervention should complement and overtake the far-reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV.
It is another milestone in the more than three decades of sustained progress in tackling one of humanity's greatest health challenges."
Deborah Gold, chief executive at NAT (National Aids Trust), said: "This is a pivotal moment in the fight against HIV.
Prep, when targeted at needy and vulnerable people, offers the opportunity to change the English HIV epidemic.
From September, people at high risk of HIV will have access to this NHS-funded trial in England to develop a new tool that is truly individually controlled and not subject to negotiation with a partner, leading to the improvement of many, many lives.
We warmly welcome this announcement."
Ian Green, chief executive of the Terrence Higgins Trust, said: "The priority must now be that the study is carried out quickly across the country and that no one who has a risk for HIV is left behind.
Now that PrEP test medicine has been procured, we're on track to protect more than 10,000 HIV-infected people. "
Sharon Hodgson, shadow health minister, said: "The start of the PrEP process is welcome and overdue after months of delays and hesitant implementation by the government.
The evidence shows how transformative this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transmission of this life-changing infection.
This attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the benefits of PrEP.
It is now important that this study is carried out as quickly as possible across the country to protect people infected with HIV and that it will help us move one step closer to ending the spread of HIV in society. "
Living the big life: Mezzanine and clever designer tricks have transformed this small Earls Court apartment into a lavish home
Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, downsized from a large house in Knightsbridge to an Earls Court apartment in 2014.
It sits on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it's proof of the new design that Joanne hasn't packed and sold her bags.
"Before that, I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much bigger room," says Joanne.
"I was looking for something that was comparable to my price.
I was shown this flat in Earls Court, and it had the same high ceilings.
I've fallen in love with her and made an offer that day. "
Since the first visit, the 1,000-square-foot apartment has been completely overhauled.
Originally a one-bedroom property with a nested layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - Joanne wanted to add storage space and a mezzanine to make the most of the generous ceiling height.
"I wanted high ceilings, big windows, a lot of light.
That was my requirement,"she says.
To that end, she hired architecture and design studio Duck & Shed from Notting Hill's Erfan Azadi to use the 12.5-foot-high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development, but also a place to live for Joanne.
The ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms on top of each other, so the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine where you could stand.
Erfan had to think creatively to solve the default.
"The steelworks are quite complicated," he explains.
"We had to arrange the rooms in such a way that they were stacked on top of each other without us having to bend over.
It wasn't just about building a simple platform, but putting the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function up or down. "
This arrangement allowed Erfan to place two rooms in full height on top of each other - with plenty of added drama.
For the mezzanine, a classic copper light window from Retrouvius looks down over the glamorous living area.
Mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program.
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theater, space and light.
At both ends, a short corridor is mirrored to make it look longer.
In the kitchen, the mirroring feels like a window into another room.
At the entrance, mirrored units provide space for all Joanne's cutlery and glasses.
By perceiving a more glamorous space, the beauty of the living room can shut down the kitchen if it is not used.
Collapsible kitchens are nothing new.
What's special about this one is that it's a garage door.
"A little bit of engineering went in there," explains Erfan of the steel-reinforced, veneered MDF door.
"It's counterweight, so when you push the door up, it glides very easily."
Thanks to the clever use of space and storage space, Joanne was able to gain an extra 16 sq m, an extra bedroom and an improved layout.
"At the end of the day, you're going to sell the floor space - or how your property is valued," says Erfan.
"In a rudimentary form, a real estate agent will step in and do a calculation based on the floor size."
Here they have managed to enlarge the floor space while using high-quality materials that give the space its luxurious advantage.
"The materials are the things that touch you and therefore help to create an emotional bond in a home," says Erfan.
"You don't fall in love with the electric sockets in the walls.
These are important, but they don't play with your heart. "
It shows that with good design and increased square metres, an apartment can transform from something standard into something quite amazing.
In fact, like Joanne, you might choose not to leave this one.
Brothers fight over $500 million real estate empire
Two brothers are in a dispute over one of Victoria's largest real estate empires, worth more than $500 million, four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty.
The former director of the 'Carlton Football Club' and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a villa in Toorak, just three doors away from his younger brother Paul, who has taken him to the Supreme Court to have their property and business assets divided.
Paul had wanted to retire from the family business since 2014, but a sharp row over the separation is taking place in the Supreme Court.
Along with their mother Anna, the brothers own 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars, accumulated since the family bought a business in Smith Street, Collingwood, in 1973.
There, the family founded Westco Jeans and grew into a chain of 160 retail stores.
It was sold in 1999 for $85 million.
That money has been invested in real estate, and De Lutis' portfolio now includes offices in the city centre, the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento, the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller, as well as shopping centres in the suburb.
Under an agreement with her late father, Colin - described by Paul as "the main operator and the dominant personality" in the De Lutis family - owns about two-thirds of the company's assets and Paul about a third.
A court filing says this means Colin owns property worth $316 million and Paul worth $176 million.
The division of property and cash has proved a problem point for Paul.
"The divisions proposed by Colin have left him with what I thought were the best objects," he wrote in an initial affidavit in 2015.
Last Friday, the first Supreme Court hearing was held after several failed mediations.
The brothers are now also fighting for control of the existing business - of which Colin, as Paul claims, has ruled him out.
Colin argues this is not true, but accuses Paul of incompetently managing some possessions.
In an early affidavit filed by Colin, he says he hopes to settle the dispute.
"My Italian heritage dictates that the family is the most important priority," he wrote.
Costs are rising in the case, with hundreds of pages of affidavits, emails and reports from companies, including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and with leading lawyers, including Allan Myers, QC, and law firms held by both sides.
Ms De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who ran milk bars and delicatessen shops from the late 1950s and bought a shop in Brunswick in the early 1970s.
They used security to buy the Collingwood property where Colin opened the family's first jeans store.
Colin says he started Westco there when he was "in my last years of high school, when Paul was still a young child (about 10 years old)."
Anna De Lutis says she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to pass on their property amicably to their sons.
"Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to end up in court," she wrote.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis business group, with Colin claiming that Mark was paid $10 million and Luke $26 million when he left the company.
Both Luke and Mark, Paul says,"have become embittered about the terms of their financial separation."
Colin has held back a lot despite being a former AFL board member and being the TV star's best friend, according to a 2015 biography by Eddie McGuire.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers for comment.
Only Colin replied by text message to say "I really can't say much" because the case is before the courts.
"It is very, very sad that my brother Paul has decided to sue me and drag our family name through the courts," he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote in a letter to the court that he had tried to meet his brother's demands.
"Our father would not have wanted Paul and I to end up in our current dispute," he said, adding that he was "still hoping for a solution."
On Friday, that hope seemed to be over.
"Our matter will be resolved by the courts in the near future," Colin wrote.
Trump's new chief of staff plans to curtail the president's media abstinence.
Others have tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.
If so, he will be the first.
Politico reports that the new White House chief of staff plans to restrict the flow of information to President Trump - including news media reports - in the hope of keeping the boss on a more even course.
Here's a piece by reporter Josh Dawsey:
"When John F. Kelly, the new White House chief of staff, met with senior executives on his first day at work, he posed a major problem in President Donald Trump's White House that he wants to fix: Bad information that gets into the president's hands.
Kelly told staff that information should flow about him - whether on paper or in briefings - because the president would make better decisions if he received good information. "
Kelly's diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to tame Trump by overseeing his media diet.
President Trump's relationship with television goes back decades - and now that he's in the White House, his television advertising is still going strong.
"If candidate Trump was upset because of unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he received fair reporting from outlets to convince," former campaign adviser Sam Nunberg told Politico in February.
Politico's Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that "the key to keeping Trump's Twitter habit under control, according to six former campaign officials, is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady burst of praise."
Okay.
But the idea that Trump's Twitter habit was ever "under control" is ridiculous.
Perhaps these campaign officials know something we don't know to others - that Trump's tweets would have contained even more ignition without their interventions.
We will probably never learn anything about the tweets that Trump didn't send.
If his staff managed to keep trouble away from him a few times, then their efforts paid off.
But no one has consistently been able to prevent Trump from causing controversy.
Part of the problem is that people in a White House made up of competing parties keep trying to advance their own agenda by presenting Trump with material that may be promoting their views of the world.
Politico - entirely preoccupied with this story - reported in May on the advisers' penchant for providing dubious information to the president for strategic reasons.
This was an example described by reporter Shane Goldmacher:
"Current and former Trump officials say that Trump can respond like a volcano to negative press clippings, especially those with damaging leaks, and that he's bracing himself to find out where these come from.
That's exactly what happened at the end of February, when someone maliciously gave the president a printed copy of an article by GotNews.com, the website of internet provocateur Charles C. Johnson, who accused Deputy Chief of Staff Katie Walsh of being "the source behind a bunch of leaks" at the White House.
Although Johnson has been permanently banned from Twitter for harassment or that he has offered no concrete evidence or that he has made false allegations in the past and revoked them.
Trump read the article and began questioning staff about Walsh. "
Goldmacher added that then-Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and White House Secretary Rob Porter "tried to implement a system to manage and document the paperwork that Trump receives."
How did that work out?
Kelly tries to do the same three months later.
Perhaps he will prove himself to be a more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his advisers are still seeking influence.
These immutable factors make Kelly's mission very difficult.
Most wanted criminals get mail from Europol
Since the address is unknown, the help of the population is requested and hoped for.
Police across Europe are sending out (virtual) postcards to dangerous criminals on the run this summer.
Since the addresses of the wanted serious criminals are not known by nature, clues from the population are hoped for and requested.
Europol on Friday reported the action, which follows the winter's "EU Most Wanted" advent calendar.
Experience has shown that many refugees are hiding at holiday destinations, Europol said.
21 postcards have been compiled for wanted criminals from 21 EU countries.
Since 2016 there has been the website www.eumostwanted, more than 2.5 million times this has been viewed.
36 of those searched online have been arrested so far, at least 11 of them on the basis of notices following publication on the website.
Travellers negotiate a ditch and return to 'millionaire row"
Some of the West Midlands' wealthiest homeowners are back on war footing with some determined travellers who have negotiated a community-drawn ditch to reclaim a field in front of their mansions.
Travellers have parked their 20 caravans in a field outside an affluent Solihull street called the "millionaire row."
They have brought horses, babies and an army of vans after they were only thrown out in May, but without having been deterred by a ditch excavated by the council to prevent their incursions.
The tactful group found a gap in the defences and pushed their vehicles through a section that remained unobstructed to find a way.
Angry residents have berated Solihull council, which said it was "useless to deal with the problem."
An anonymous resident said: 'They moved there on Monday night after being sent on by Bentley Heath where they threw stones at passersby.
The Council must be forced into action by shame, because it was useless in dealing with the problem.
The travellers were there in May, were moved on and are now back.
More arrived last night, probably more today. "
She added: "Birmingham Council knows how to deal with this by holding long instruction sessions to protect their parks.
I live on Streetsbrook Road and I'm not happy to continue to pay my community tax if the council can't even stop that. "
One resident, who did not want to be named, said: 'It's ridiculous, we've only just seen the last round of these travellers just to be plundered by another round.
The numbers have increased this time and you've even seen a horse in the park area. "
A Solihull Council spokeswoman said: "We are aware of an unauthorised camp on the land beyond Streetsbrook Road and are working with Solihulls Police, taking the necessary legal action to allow them to move on as soon as possible.
To support our collection of evidence, it is very important that as many local residents as possible report anti-social or criminal behaviour to the police by calling 101.
This helps create a picture of the situation where the court will have to consider when we present our case. "
From Birkenhof becomes Waldhotel Luise
From the former Hotel Birkenhof becomes the Waldhotel Luise.
The house at the gates of Freudenstadts is currently being renovated and is due to reopen on March 1 next year.
This is good news for the city.
With the closure of the Hotel Birkenhof by the then Ambiente Betriebsgesellschaft mbH on 13 April 2014, around 30,000 overnight stays per year were lost at the time, as well as income from the visitor's tax.
In the fall of 2014, in the face of dramatically rising numbers of refugees coming to the county, the hotel building was offered to the county council office as collection accommodation, prompting controversial discussions.
The city prevented the accommodation of asylum seekers by drawing up a development plan to secure the area as a hotel location.
The decision was not without controversy in the local council at the time.
But above all Freudenstadt's mayor Julian Osswald defended the hotel location and spoke already then of serious interested parties in the house.
He should be right.
The group Luisenhotels with managing director Birgit Scherer, based in Bad Bergzabern, has acquired the former Hotel Birkenhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to turn it back into a three-star plus category house under the name Waldhotel Luise.
The group has four houses with the Freudenstadt object.
Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Herrenalb.
They are called Hotel Luise, Luisenpark, Parkhotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise.
At the former Hotel Birkenhof, construction waste containers have been standing in front of the entrance for a long time, and when you enter the house, it becomes clear what extensive renovations are being carried out.
The floors were ripped out, blankets partly dismantled, old bathtubs removed from the rooms.
The entire hotel building is a single construction site.
There is still a lot of work to be done by March.
"It's actually a beautiful hotel," says Thomas Scherer in conversation with our newspaper.
Everything is to be renewed in the Black Forest style.
The rooms will be equipped with large walk-in showers, the entrance area will be redesigned, new windows will be installed.
Everything should later become "pretty close to the citizen," as Thomas Scherer puts it.
"We want to make a piece of jewelry out of it."
Facilities include a swimming pool, spa and a meeting room.
One does not want to position oneself at the high level of hotels in Lauterbad, but already at an upscale downtown level, emphasizes Scherer.
The Waldhotel Luise with its approximately 60 rooms wants to set itself up wide, explains Scherer.
Both individual holidaymakers, groups or business people should feel comfortable in the hotel.
He has already held talks with OB Julian Osswald and tourism director Michael Krause, according to Scherer.
The ideas of the city are identical with those of the hotel group.
"We're on the same line."
Asked about the level of investment, Thomas Scherer does not want to be specific.
Just under a million euros, he reckons.
The outdoor installations are also brought to the front man, which is already clearly visible.
In a courtyard there is a large terrace, which will be accessible from the restaurant, which is open to the public.
Thomas Scherer is optimistic: "Freudenstadt is a good market."
Russia affair: Us special investigator sets up Grand Jury
In the Russia affair involving US President Donald Trump, special investigator Robert Mueller is said to have set up a so-called grand jury, according to a report.
The panel had begun work in recent weeks, the "Wall Street Journal" wrote, citing people familiar with the matter.
The newspaper assessed the move as a sign that Mueller had expanded and intensified his investigation.
The broadcaster CNN reported there were already initial subpoenas from the panel in connection with a meeting between Trump's eldest son and a Russian lawyer.
U.S. intelligence agencies have long accused the Kremlin of purposefully interfering in the 2016 presidential campaign.
Mueller is investigating whether there was collusion between Trump's campaign team and Moscow in the process.
The focus of the investigation is said to be several men who acted as advisers to the Republican in the campaign.
Mueller also reportedly took more and more of Trump's private and business environment under scrutiny.
The "Washington Post" wrote several weeks ago that the special investigator had personally put Trump at the center and was investigating the allegation of whether the president may have obstructed justice as the affair unfolded.
The main task of Grand Jurys is to examine existing evidence in possible crime cases and decide whether to bring charges.
Grand juries are therefore also called chambers of indictment.
For the most part, they are turned on when it comes to larger and controversial cases.
The procedure is always behind closed doors.
The panel can also be called in by the Public Prosecutor's Office to invite people to be interrogated under oath.
Subpoenas have already been issued that revolve around the encounter between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer, according to broadcaster CNN.
People involved in the meeting had been asked to testify, the report said.
They should also provide documents.
In addition to Trump Jr., Trump's adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner, as well as his then-campaign chief Paul Manafort, were also present at the conversation.
Legal experts said Thursday evening on US television that the deployment showed that Mueller did not allow himself to be intimidated in his work and that, if necessary, he wanted to act quickly.
But it did not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury would be called in at the end to decide whether to bring an indictment.
Still, the establishment of the panel is the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new cause for concern for President Trump.
Amid the new revelations, the president used a speech in West Virginia on Thursday night to portray the Russia affair as a campaign by his political opponents.
"The Russia story is a total fabrication," Trump said.
The issue gives Democrats a way to "feel good because they have nothing else they can talk about."
His special counsel, Ty Cobb, said in a statement that he knew nothing of the establishment of a grand jury.
However, he emphasized that he also usually works in secret.
The White House is in favor of any action that accelerated the special investigator's work in a "fair" way.
Former FBI chief James Comey has said three times that no investigation is under way against the president.
There was no reason to assume that anything had changed, the statement continued.
Mueller, though, had only been deployed after Trump fired Comey.
Allegations against Trump that he wanted to obstruct justice had been raised because of that ejection.
Comey testified before a Senate committee in June that Trump had asked him to halt the investigation into then-national security adviser Michael Flynn.
The president is under a lot of pressure because of the investigation.
After portraying US media, the White House gathered material against the special investigator and his associates.
That sparked speculation about whether Trump wanted to fire Mueller.
Unlike an independent special congressional investigator, such as in the Watergate affair involving the later resigned President Richard Nixon, Mueller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired by the Justice Department at the president's urging.
However, several senators from both parties want to prevent such a move.
Two groups of Republican and Democratic senators on Thursday unveiled bills under which the special investigator could no longer be so easily dismissed.
Antarctica: Gigantic iceberg drives in Antarctica
In West Antarctica, a gigantic iceberg of almost seven times the size of Berlin has detached from the ice shelf.
The Bremerhavener Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research announced this on Wednesday.
The colossus, weighing more than a trillion tonnes and 5800 square kilometres, is now heading north and will probably take two or three years to melt.
With a length of 175 kilometres and a width of up to 50 kilometres, it is one of the largest ice giants that researchers have registered in the past three decades.
A danger to people does not come from him.
The extent to which climate change played a role in the iceberg's demolition is unclear, according to researchers.
Overall, however, there has been a series of unusual collapses of ice shelves in the region for around 30 years, the US Research Center for Snow and Ice (NSIDC) writes in a factual background.
According to many researchers, this could be related to global warming.
The now aborted colossus was previously a part of the Larsen C ice shelf.
Ice shelf floats on the sea and is fed by large glaciers.
It grows further and further into the sea and breaks down regularly.
The Larsen C ice shelf is located south of South America almost at the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula.
North of this ice shelf, the balance of growth and breakdown was disrupted a few years ago.
A complete ice shelf had disintegrated there, writes AWI researcher Daniela Jansen.
There is some evidence that the Larsen C ice shelf is also in danger, because the front edge has never retreated as far as it is at present.
In addition, the ice sheet is under tension and can disintegrate if a piece breaks off at a key point.
Melting ice cream and iceberg doesn't raise sea levels as they swim on the water, displacing ice as much water as it yields after melting itself.
However, the loss of the ice shelf causes the glaciers to flow directly into the sea and drain much faster than before.
That could potentially raise sea levels, but only to a small extent, writes the British Antarctic Observation Research Project (Midas).
The Larsen C ice shelf is the fourth largest ice shelf in Antarctica, with nearly 50,000 square kilometres, according to AWI data.
At the transition from the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick, at the front edge to the free ocean about 200 meters.
There it breaks down regularly.
"While it is a natural occurrence and we are not aware of any direct link to climate change, the ice sheet is now coming into a more vulnerable position," said Martin O'Leary of Britain's Swansea University.
"This is the furthest retreat since records began," he, too, confirmed.
Among scientists, it is controversial whether the Larsen C shelf ice will now grow again or decline in the long term and possibly collapse, his colleague Adrian Luckman said, adding: "Our models say it will be less stable."
But this development will take decades.
Even if these researchers do not attribute the demolition of this gigantic iceberg to climate change, many ice shelves in the Antarctic Peninsula have disintegrated in recent decades.
This long tip of Antarctica stretches toward South America.
According to data from the British Antarctic Survey research programme, the Antarctic Peninsula's ice surface has declined by 28,000 square kilometres since the 1950s.
The increase in temperature had contributed to the decline.
The Antarctic Peninsula has warmed by around three degrees over the past 50 years, making it one of the areas where the temperature is rising at the fastest rate.
CDU wants house tariff on staff
Because it is becoming increasingly difficult to fill vacancies, the CDU is calling for retiring from the employers' association to become more attractive.
Just before the summer recess, County Day waved through 41 new posts in the administration.
More than 1100 employees and officials work for the district administration in Mettmann.
Now another 17 apprentices have completed their first day of work.
The apprenticeships at the circle are apparently very much sought after.
Around 620 applications were registered for the places to be awarded this year.
However, the circle still lacks staff to cope with the increased demands and tasks.
Currently, there are still 50 unfilled vacancies in Mettmann County.
Among other things, doctors and engineers as well as forces of general administration are being sought.
The CDU, together with the FDP and the UWG, now wants to take the initiative in the District Day and address the shortage of skilled workers in the administration.
The administration is to "develop a concept for recruitment and personnel development" at the request of the parties.
The aim is not only to meet short-term needs of skilled workers, but to counteract the shortages of applicants in the future, it says.
The overall concept should be oriented inwards and outwards, show concrete measures for beginners and include a training offensive, demand the CDU, FDP and UWG.
That sounds like a good approach.
Because the circle has to do with personnel problems that you didn't know before.
Other cities advertise good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions.
There is talk of a genuine "competition of public employers."
In addition, there is a high number of employees who retire from the service due to illness or age.
It is high time for action, therefore, so that more jobs do not remain unfilled.
But Klaus-Dieter Völker, leader of the CDU group, goes beyond the joint motion with his party.
He caused a lousy surprise in the District Day recently when he publicly questioned the staffing cost cap and stunned the other parties.
Völker wants all options for leaving the local employers' association to be reviewed.
"If we do not reach a satisfactory solution here in the short term, the district administration should seek a house tariff with the trade unions - perhaps also in cooperation with the county towns," Völker said.
In doing so, the CDU is trying to pay employees and officials better than the Public Service Tariff Regulation actually provides for.
Salaries are currently exactly prescribed, increases or more money only exist if you move to a higher level that is oriented towards professional years.
But the tasks of the circle have grown more and more in recent years.
Only a few weeks ago, new rooms had to be set up where employees would take care of the provisions of the new Prostitute Protection Act.
Not least because of the rising number of asylum seekers, county councillor Thomas Hendele and county director Martin Richter have a problem: They have too few staff.
Italy tightens tone on NGO migrant rescue boats
Italy has warned NGOs using rescue boats for migrants in the Mediterranean that they must not continue to do so unless they abide by new rules for their operations.
"If NGOs don't sign a new code of conduct, it's difficult to see how they can continue to work," Interior Minister Marco Minniti said in an interview with Turin daily La Stampa.
Minniti's warning came a day after Italian authorities seized a boat belonging to the German aid organization 'Jugend Rettet' because its team had effectively cooperated with traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration.
The charity, which has only been in operation for a year, declined to comment on detailed allegations made by Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.
"For us, saving human life is and remains our top priority, so we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment," the organization said in a statement on social media.
"We can't assess all the allegations currently being made until we have gathered all the information and can assess the situation."
Italian authorities had been monitoring the boat from 'Youth Rettet', the Iuventa, since October.
It is suspected that his crew will board inflatable migrants, delivered to them directly by traffickers, and that the smugglers can depart so the ships can be used again.
At least one such gathering reportedly took place just 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast, according to the prosecutor's file, the contents of which were published by Italian media.
The crew is suspected of flouting the authority of the Italian Coast Guard, which oversees rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not for any other motives.
Under the code of conduct, boats such as the Iuventa must, above all, have an Italian police officer on board to monitor their activities.
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have so far agreed to abide by the code: Save the Children, Moas from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain.
The latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be seen as unnecessary but acceptable as they would not involve "significant changes or obstructions" to their bailouts.
Among those who refuse to sign is the Nobel Prize-winning organization Doctors Without Borders (MSF).
Minniti meanwhile said that the number of migrants arriving in Italy after the rescue efforts had fallen sharply in recent weeks, suggesting that efforts to strengthen the Libyan coastguard and work with local mayors had come to fruition.
"In the last few days we have started to see light at the end of the tunnel," the minister said.
He announced plans for further talks with Libyan mayors this month on economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving these countries in the hope of being able to reach Europe.
Climbs and Trials
Nine Weilermer bikers, the "Berlin outpost" and two guest drivers met in Wachenheim in the North Palatinate to enjoy four days of trials and sights.
Three friendly guides were available for this purpose.
The accommodation in the Wachenheimer Valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours.
The castle and wine festival of Wachenheim was a welcome extra.
The first tour led in hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Michael Chapel above Deidesheim.
It was followed by vantage points, partly on towers, from which one could look far over the Palatinate Forest and the upstream plains.
In between there were always longer climbs, for which long trials rewarded.
On the second day we went to Bad Dürkheim to the Saline and the Volksfest Wurstmarkt.
Again, vantage point lined up at vantage point, connected by "fleeting" trials and moderate climbs.
On the last two days many meters of altitude were announced again.
Caves, rocks, towers, castles, ruins and resting huts brought welcome breaks.
In Bad Dürkheim, the bikers breathed healing brine in the open-air inhalatory.
Neustadt was also controlled.
After 173 kilometres and almost 4500 metres of altitude, the group had come to know the Palatinate Forest at its best - sporty and cultural.
Console instead of lawn - Bundesliga gears up for e-sports
Are the sports stars sitting in front of computer consoles in the future instead of sweating their way across the stadium turf in the wind and weather?
The fact is: E-sports has long since become a serious industry, a lucrative business - big stars, millions of fans and huge tournaments with high gages included.
The first Bundesliga clubs to become increasingly involved in this area have also recognised this.
The VfL Wolfsburg made the start in 2015, later followed by FC Schalke 04 and most recently VfB Stuttgart, which founded an e-sports department in mid-July and contracted two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17.
"We hope this will inspire completely new young target groups for the VfB," says CEO Jochen Röttgermann.
He is sure that "there are still quite a few clubs on this train."
Next weekend, the FIFA World Cup in London organises the first "Interactive Club World Cup" in which the gamers of different clubs compete against each other.
In addition to Schalke and Wolfsburg, Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain or PSV Eindhoven, for example, have qualified.
Robin Dutt also sees great potential in e-sports.
The ex-coach of Bayer Leverkusen and Werder Bremen, meanwhile, is advising an agency for virtual football players.
"Real football has to deal with the 14 to 30-year-olds in particular, that the young people are still going to the stadium in the future," says the 52-year-old.
And: The clubs tried to conquer all sorts of markets, especially the Asian ones.
With prominent e-athletes under contract, you could be present in these markets online far more often than just sending the Bundesliga team to Asia once a year.
What exactly is it all about?
In e-sports, computer games such as "League Of Legends," "Dota 2," "Counterstrike" or the football simulation FIFA are fought at the competition level.
As in normal sport, leagues have long since been established in which the professionals compete against each other.
And at the 2022 Asian Games, e-sports is already part of the official program.
But is it a proper sport at all?
For many, the idea certainly needs getting used to.
Ingo Froböse, too, has long grappled with the question.
For the professor at the German Sports University in Cologne, e-sports is a sport because it is competitive and shows many biological and physical reactions that can also be found in classical sports - for example, increased heart rates, stress reactions, hormonal changes.
It also needed cognitive skills, a technical and tactical understanding and rapid responsiveness.
Professional gamers should not only train at the console but also their bodies and pay attention to the diet.
"The fitter player is a good player."
But Froböse also sees problems: "Doping is becoming more and more of an issue."
Controls were difficult to implement in online games, and the scene lacked the structures of classical sport.
On a positive note, the scientist highlights the high integrative effect of e-sports.
The players are travelling internationally, this is like a big global family, there are no intercultural barriers there.
A study by business consultancy Deloitte and the Federal Association of Interactive Entertainment Software (Biu) predicts rapid growth in e-sports.
In 2016, 50 million euros had been implemented in Germany, mainly through advertising, sponsorship and major tournaments.
In three years, sales are projected to be 130 million.
Against the almost 2.4 billion euros of the Football League, that is little.
However, e-sports are "no longer far from the other established sports such as handball, basketball or ice hockey," the Deloitte consultants write.
Internationally, many countries have already moved on.
Major markets are Asia and the US, where ex-basketball player Shaquille O'Neal and baseball star Alex Rodriguez are joining US team NRG eSports.
Hollywood actor Ashton Kutcher invests in eSport betting provider Unikrn
Europe is also doing a lot.
At a Norwegian school, e-sports had been introduced as a teaching subject, Froböse says.
In the Netherlands and France, first-league football clubs are now required to set up an e-sports department, according to Dutt.
"In European comparison, Germany is lagging behind," explains VfB board member Röttgermann.
Just falling into nostalgia, and glorifying the old days, is no longer enough today.
The aim is to preserve the tradition of the association, but at the same time to align the company with the modern market.
"We live in a digitized world," says Dutt, too.
"There you can't hold on to the fact that only with football everything stays the way it always was."
Poison eggs ade - The egg alternatives to cooking and baking
Almost all federal states have now been affected by the poison-laden eggs scandal.
Aldi Süd and Aldi Nord have responded by removing all eggs from sale across Germany.
Only eggs that have been shown to contain no fipronil are to be taken to the shelves.
Michelle Carter convicted over texts urging Conrad Roy to commit suicide
A woman from Massachusetts has been sentenced to two and a half years for encouraging her boyfriend to commit suicide through texts and calls.
Michelle Carter, now 20, will spend 15 months of her sentencing behind bars and five years have been suspended on probation.
Carter was convicted in June of negligent homicide of Conrad Roy, who took his own life on July 13, 2014.
Speaking at the hearing on Thursday, Roy's father said: 'My family is uncomforted.
My son was my best friend. "
Carter was allowed to remain free pending the appeal.
She had faced a maximum sentence of 20 years, but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy were suffering from a mental illness.
Dressed in red trousers and a cream blouse, Carter stood there with tears in her eyes, with folded hands and downward facing eyes as she was sentenced.
"Her actions have killed Conrad Roy," the prosecutor told the court.
"She ended his life to make her own better.
She has not taken any responsibility,"she said.
"She hasn't shown any remorse."
But Carter's attorney said it was a "terrible circumstance that she totally regrets."
However, Judge Lawrence Moniz said he had not found out that her "age or maturity, or even her mental illness, has a significant impact on her actions."
A prosecutor read a statement from Roy's mother, Lynn Roy, saying that there is "not a day when I do not mourn the loss of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and how I deal with everything. I try to be there for his sisters, despite all my pain that we will carry with us for eternity,"it says.
Roy's sister, Camdyn Roy, testified that she was "haunted" by the realisation that she would never attend her brother's wedding or be an aunt to his children.
"No longer having this only person I've been with every day since I was born is a pain I will always keep with me for the rest of my life," she said.
The case appears to set a legal precedent, as there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to ask another to commit suicide.
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead from carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle in 2014.
The case drew national attention after Carter's text messages revealed that she had encouraged him to end his life.
"Hang up, spring from a building, stab yourself, I don't know, there are many ways," she said in several messages she had sent in the two weeks before his death while he was on holiday with his family.
In the moments before his suicide, she wrote: "You have to do it, Conrad" and "All you have to do is turn on the generator and you'll be free and happy."
Judge Moniz said that Carter sought attention from the death of Roy and ordered that she should benefit from the case through any press.
The case has divided legal opinion.
Among the few who defended Carter was Amanda Knox, who was convicted of murdering her British roommate in Italy in 2007 before she was acquitted two years ago.
Ms. Knox, 30 years old, posted a comment in the Los Angeles Times: "Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help, not prison."
Joshua kimmich: Learning from FC Bayern's new mini-lame
That Joshua kimmich was allowed to run up as captain in the Audi Cup is no coincidence.
FC Bayern are confident of a big season for the Confed Cup winner - extra motivation doesn't hurt there.
Something was different there on his seat in the cabin, that saw Joshua kimmich immediately, even if the extra garment was very, very small.
But as far and wide on the second day of the Audi Cup, of course, no Philipp Lahm and no Manuel Neuer could be seen, he made up his arm with the bandage assigned to him.
"The coach hasn't announced it," the Confed Cup winner recounted afterwards, after his first deployment as Bayern captain.
Well, the score could have been better than the 0-2 against SSC Naples.
But the sign from the coach could also interpret kimmich that way.
Not the eight-year-old Arturo Vidal had been chosen as the game leader in the C-Eleven, made up of youth players, debutants and professionals just out of holiday, but he.
Sugar is best distributed to those whom you trust a lot, whom you want to keep on a whim.
So anyone who has been chosen to take on the legacy of Lahm can only use a little extra motivation well.
Kimmich confirmed: "This is what you want as a player: To take responsibility."
On Wednesday, the 22-year-old flitted across the field as a mini lame.
Right back, this is now his position, the white bandage on the arm did the rest.
And at all in this starting formation kimmich looked like the one who can best take the helm.
He gave instructions, tried to direct the unheralded force.
He had the look for the whole thing, while many others were busy with themselves.
Vidal to overplay his lack of fitness (hardly worked); Renato Sanches to follow up on the achievements of the Asia trip (only partially worked out); and Sebastian Rudy and Niklas Süle to not stand out negatively in their first appearance in the Bayern jersey.
That worked very well.
Süle ran up alongside kimmich, Rudy in front of the defence, both acting sovereign.
The well-known Napoli storm was often difficult, and Süle also tried a few times in the build-up to the game.
While his colleague Rudy admitted the result was "not as we hoped it would be."
But he, too, showed a tidy performance on debut.
Game shift, tempo change: "For this style I was fetched too."
How unusual this Bayern world is for the newcomers was seen after the game.
Rudy, for example, did not give one or two in the catacombs, but determined six or seven interviews.
Kimmich said goodbye after a few crisp statements in the back of his new fellow players.
There he heard an interesting sentence from Süle: "What's going on here, I've already noticed.
At Bayern you've just got to win every game. "
After all, he no longer has to teach the new.
Alaba motivates ÖFB ladies
David Alaba believes in the success of our ÖFB ladies
Austria's most famous footballer took to Twitter shortly before the game and wished the ÖFB ladies well.
The Bavarian Legionnaire is almost a club colleague of ÖFB captain Schnaderbeck and fights with our lads.
The tweet from the Austrian footballer of the year and Champions League winner should be a special splash of motivation.
Our ladies might well need the famous Bayern Dusel.
Company satisfied with Rhineland-Palatinate minister: Economy praises Wissing's pace
It was often irreconcilable, the relationship between the country and the regional economy, when Eveline Lemke (Greens) was still Minister of Economic Affairs of Rhineland-Palatinate.
This is evident after more than a year in which the new economy minister, Volker Wissing (FDP), is in office.
Chambers and companies from the region speak of a change in economic policy at T V request - and at the same time rebuke the old minister.
Frank natus, chairman of the Association of Trier Companies (VTU), says: "Wissing picks up on the wishes of the economy, which Lemke has all blocked."
The biggest turnaround sees natus in infrastructure policy: The gap on Highway 1 between Kelberg and Adenau is now at the top of the country's list of priorities.
Later this year, the ministry hopes for a plan finding process, with construction law due to stand by 2021.
The western bypass of Trier, which is in the urgent need of the federal transport infrastructure plan, also plays a role in the country's plans.
The aim is to get the line up and running in December 2020, says ministry spokeswoman Cornelia Holtmann.
Natus sees it as a signpost to prop up regional but internationally competing companies.
The Chamber of Commerce and Industry (IHK) Trier is seeking a Rhineland-Palatinate label for wine, as suggested by Wissing, in order to increase sales in supermarkets and halt the trend of German wine exports, which have been declining for the past decade.
In addition, Wissing has an open ear for people who want to start their own company, praises the IHK.
The Trier Chamber of Crafts sees the new Masters bonus as an additional incentive for young apprentices, says managing director Matthias Schwalbach.
It provides for a premium of 1000 euros for the master's examination and 2500 euros if graduates become self-employed within ten years of the master's training.
The homework list for the country, however, remains long.
According to Jan Glockauer, Chief Executive Officer of the Trier Chamber of Commerce, the country lacks the necessary personnel for the planned road construction.
Out of 56 new engineers Wissing plans to hire at the state company Mobility, only 29 positions have been filled so far.
The IHK is calling for more contracts to be awarded to external offices.
CDU Group vice-president Christian Baldauf points to calculations by the Court of Auditors that the country is investing more than 20 million euros less in maintaining country roads in 2017 and 2018 than proposed.
Frank natus also expects a concept of the country to address the shortage of skilled workers in the region.
It is also sobering to note the broadband expansion in the country so far.
In 2016, regional companies had rated network supply at just the 3.4 mark in an IHK survey.
They complained about faltering internet connections and breakdowns.
Ex-Minister of Economy Eveline Lemke is currently out of politics and still sits on the supervisory board of the wind power company Pro Wind.
The Green Group left Lemke in April to become president of a private college in Karlsruhe - where she already cleared the field again after four months because of disagreements.
Audi to transform 850,000 diesel cars - automakers face backlash
A day before Audi's announcement, BMW said it would offer to update the software in more than 350,000 vehicles.
The BMW chairman said the company believes "there are smarter options than driving restrictions," referring to European cities - including Munich, where BMW is based - to ban or restrict diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions.
None of the companies described the ventures as a recall.
European carmakers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with rules on carbon dioxide emissions.
But the nitrogen oxides that diesel engines emit are considered carcinogens and can cause asthma.
The cost for carmakers to install plants to neutralize the exhaust fumes emitted by diesel cars is also increasing, making it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also charged with groping the powerful car companies and ignoring signs of the problem.
The companies are trying to avoid the mistakes of Volkswagen, which used so-called shutdown devices that could regulate emissions to comply with regulations when a car was tested but scaled back in normal driving conditions.
Several Volkswagen employees have been charged in the United States, while others are under investigation on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former head of thermodynamics in the engine development of Audi was arrested in Germany.
The former manager, Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio, is Italian and is therefore not protected from extradition and could face trial in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi was involved in German criminal investigations at Volkswagen after authorities accused Audi of installing a system to circumvent emissions regulations in Europe, and a request focused on the United States was expanded.
The inclusion of Audi in the investigation could weigh heavily on Volkswagen: The luxury carmaker contributes disproportionately to Volkswagen's profit.
That message got the raft on the Isar on Saturday
The city wants to protect the Isar.
So that the Isar visitors also join in, tomorrow Saturday a raft will travel through Munich, which has a special message.
Whoever moves to the Isar again on Saturday will see a big raft between Flaucher and Reichenbach Bridge.
And this is not a common raft, with Isar tourists.
But the building council wants to clarify.
On the raft you can see a large infotransparent.
It shows a mountain of rubbish.
The prelude to a public relations campaign to appeal to Isar visitors.
The motto "True Love is..." is intended to sharpen the understanding of the Isar as a protected wild river.
Already last summer the raft drove over the Isar and again this year there are further actions and measures to achieve a considerate and environmentally conscious behaviour.
Mordillos Knollennasen and the laugh against the suffering
Mordillo was at times one of the most published cartoon draughtsmen, the tubular noses of his characters are his trademark.
Even at 85, the Argentine is still drawing and working on a film.
His message: Laugh,"because there is too much suffering in the world."
Guillermo Mordillo was born on 4 August 1932 as the son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires.
In his early years as an artist, among other things, he sneaked through as a draughtsman for congratulatory cards - which frustrated him.
"The happiest day in my professional life was the day when lost into my job," he once said.
After stops in Lima, New York and Paris, he made his breakthrough in the late 60s: With the release of his cartoons in "Paris Match" and then also in "Stern" and other leading magazines around the world.
Even in China, Mordillo found plenty of fans.
Time and again, the artist was inspired by cities.
Large, roundish Mordillo figures tumble in drawings with the Leaning Tower of Pisa, Big Ben in London and Red Square in Moscow.
In the early morning, according to his own account, he still sits at the drawing table today, working almost ten hours a day.
About calendars, puzzles, books for adults and children, T-shirts, plush toys and watches, his droll figures continue to find much spread worldwide.
For six years he has also been working on a cartoon and a TV series with his characters.
The main person in the film "Crazy Island" is a giraffe - Mordillos's most popular animal in his drawings - who has a thousand-footer as a counterpart.
His characters speak for the first time in the 3D film, which is due to hit the cinema screen in 2019.
"I don't know exactly what they're going to say, it's weird for me," says Mordillo.
The screenplay is not written by him.
That's why he's more likely to bet on the TV series, which, like his original drawings, is wordlessly produced.
Lavender from Provence threatened by climate change
He has become a symbol of Provence in southern France, but there is a warning that he is threatened by climate change.
The lavender is declining because of drought-reminiscent conditions and disease-carrying insects, causing major headaches for scientists and farmers trying to find solutions.
Eric Chaisse, an expert at the agricultural research institute CRIEPPAM in Provence, said: "The lavender in Provence is effectively at risk because in previous years the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change, which has brought much less rain in the spring and much more in the autumn.
This has an impact on the lifespan of lavender.
There's also a small cicade, a microbacterium that transmits dwarf cicadas, and in very dry weather there are a lot of them. "
And there is a lot at stake.
Lavender oil not only attracts holidaymakers, it is also in high demand for perfume and cosmetics.
Eric Chaisse said: "Instead of having very long plant ears with a large number of flowers, we have smaller, underdeveloped and either missing or weakened.
So we've got fewer parts with essential oil. "
Solutions being considered include better water distribution and slowing evaporation from the soil, but also spraying the plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and developing varieties that are more resistant to dryness.
The town of Geisa in the Thuringian town of Rhön celebrates its 1200th anniversary this year.
Festive highlight is this Saturday and Sunday with a medieval festival.
Herbs, guilds, dealers, vagants or a country slave camp are to be experienced in the city centre on these days.
The murder of a journalist underscores the growing threat in Mexico
Staff at the weekly Riodoce typically meet on Wednesdays to review their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in Sinaloa state caused by organized crime, corrupt officials and incessant drug wars.
But that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security.
They have been told that it is important to change their routines.
Two senior journalists discuss what feels safer: To take their children with them to the office, who were the target of an attack with grenades in 2009, or to leave them at home.
Security experts have written three words on a blackboard at the front of the room: Opponents, neutrals, allies.
They ask reporters to suggest names for each column - no proof is needed, perceptions and gut feelings range.
There are drug smugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists suspected of being on the government payroll or the cartels, a catalogue of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous.
There is no respite from the violence, and as bodies pile up across the country, more and more journalists are in attendance: At least 25 since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012. 589 are under federal protection after attacks and threats, and so far this year, there have been at least seven deaths in seven states.
Among the latter is her editor and her inspirer of Riodoce, co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.
"The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his numerous books on drug-related violence.
His absence is deeply felt, although his presence is everywhere - a large photo of Valdez showing his middle finger with the word "Justice" hangs on the facade of the Riodoce building, with two reporters in their thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wearing T-shirts showing his smiling face with glasses or his typical Panama hat.
The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared issues, the trauma, their nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.
Although a special federal prosecutor's office was established in 2010 to handle the cases of journalists, it has opened only two criminal cases, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists.
As with most of the thousands of killings linked to drug trafficking and organised crime each year, the killers are rarely brought to justice by journalists.
At Riodoce, they still insist on treating the violence of Sinaloa, even though they are uncomforting and though the terrain is now even more treacherous.
Without information about the killers, without justice, the meeting to discuss security has little use, says Ibarra.
"It's very stupid to waste my time in this workshop," he says.
"As long as we don't know the why, we distrust everyone."
On the morning of May 15, Valdez left the Riodoce newspaper's office in the state capital of Culiacan.
He only managed to drive a few blocks wide before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men, forced out of his car and shot at him 12 times, presumably because of the name of the newspaper - which translates to "Twelfth River."
The gunman drove away in his car and damaged it nearby.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He left behind a wife and two adult children.
Rumours tend to fly around freely in Culiacan.
But on the subject of Valdez, there is virtually nothing but silence.
Since Guzman's arrest last year and extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa had become one of the bloodiest battlefields in the country, as rival factions here struggle to fill the vacuum.
It doesn't matter that in Sinaloa every day someone or several people are shot in the street, or that the cemetery is full of ornate, two-storey mausoleums for drug kings that are larger than many homes for the living.
Forget for a minute that there is a state of "calm" when only a cartel has control of the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trade routes to the United States.
Still, and despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, is heartbroken with the guilt that he could not protect his friend.
He believes two misunderstandings contributed to the murder.
First, in February, there was the publication of an interview with Damaso Lopez, a leader of one of the rival antitrust factions in the war with Guzman's sons.
This release may have angered the sons, suspected gang members bought up every copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to newspaper kiosks.
The second mistake was not to force Valdez to leave the country for his own safety after the seizure of another newspaper that had published the same story.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is seen as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists.
He had survived for so long that his friends and colleagues assumed he would always be there.
He was an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003 when he teamed up with five colleagues to set up Riodoce and sold $50 holdings.
In Sinaloa,"it was impossible to engage in journalism without encountering the drug problem," Bojorquez said.
Over time, the newspaper earned a reputation for brave and honest reporting, and sales and advertising increased.
Reporters loved being able to publish hard-hitting investigations without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else dared to treat.
Eight years after the founding of Riodoce, she received the prestigious "Maria Moors Cabot Prize" for her reporting in Latin America.
That same year, Valdez won the 'International Press Freedom Award' from the Committee to Protect Journalists for his courage in pursuing Mexican drug history, wherever it led.
He volunteered that he was scared.
"I want to live on," he said at the time of the CPJ award.
Drug trafficking in Sinaloa "is a way of life," he said last October in an interview with Rompeviento-TV.
"You've got to take on the job that falls to you as a journalist - either that or you're playing the dumb.
I don't want to be asked,"What did you do in the face of so many deaths... why didn't you say what was going on?"
The Riodoce team is missing Valdez, the joker who could curse like a dockworker, the friend who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.
They trusted his routine.
He would always wear his hat.
He would always go to El Guayabo, the bar across the street from the office, and always sit there at the same table.
Now they ask: Was his love of routine his undoing?
His death has also forced them to question their own assumptions about how best to do their job and stay alive in the process.
"They don't like it when you engage with their wives, their children, their clean shops, their secret runways" to move drugs.
"These things were not allowed," Bojorquez said.
The result is, even in the best of times, a high degree of self-censorship and self-preservation.
Trust his own instincts.
If it smells wrong, stay away from it.
The trouble is, said the editor of the Riodoce Andres Villarreal, that "smell a sense that can be deceived... and then the thing happened with Javier."
The old rules, as he and others say, no longer apply in Sinaloa - just as they do in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states where a toxic mix of lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home.
The landscape is constantly changing.
No cell phones were suddenly allowed in the room where Riodoce staff met for security training, days earlier it was revealed that spyware sold exclusively to governments was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.
Outside, two police officers sought shelter from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shade of a tree.
They were tasked by the state government to protect Riodoce's offices in a four-storey building in a middle-class neighborhood of Culiacan.
Half in jest, some of the reporters wondered if those officers were among the 50 percent of police officers the governor himself described as untrustworthy.
It's been months since the reporters went to the mountain landscape, where the drug gangs are under de facto control.
For this week's edition, Riodoce has looked at three main stories.
There was the murder of the brother of former well-known boxer Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.
They also had an exposé on government spending that focused on the governor's hometown.
And there was a group that carried out a kidnapping at one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the prosecutor's office.
There was no official word on who was kidnapped or how it happened, so caution was needed when it came time to write what everyone in the city knows: That the restaurant is a favorite place of drug traffickers and authorities.
A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician belonging to the ruling Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), which dominated all political levels for almost the entire century.
Several PRI governors have recently been accused of high-profile cases of corruption.
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents at that eatery, including one in which a son of "El Chapo" Guzman escaped a military raid.
Just a few months earlier, readers would have viewed Valdez's column as the best-informed source about the kidnapping.
"Before, we would have known what happened," said Villarreal, 46, nicknamed "El Flaco" because of his slender body stature.
"Now all channels of communication with our sources have broken down."
Valdez's office has been rededicated to the storage room for signs and stickers protesting the killings of journalists because staff have become something they themselves would never have expected: Activists on behalf of the press.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez grabbed a few signs and went to the prosecutor's office the next morning for a demonstration because of another journalist.
Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez was killed, in the western state of Michoacan.
A burned body has been discovered and officials say, based on DNA tests, that it is his.
Across the country, journalists have become louder by writing down "SOS Press" on sidewalks and buildings in organized protests.
That day, the director Bojorquez is away in Washington and there trying to gather international support for the judiciary in the Valdez case.
In a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa the day after Valdez's assassination, Ramirez accused authorities of spying on journalists and having them killed because they told the truth.
She has since asked that she be reassigned by the government because she is concerned that her anger has hurt her objectivity.
Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were "surrounded" by organized crime, government officials involved in it and an indifferent society.
In his last book,"Narco-Journalism," he wrote that reporters are killed not only by drug gangs, but also on the orders of politicians and security forces stuck under a blanket with organized crime.
The media watchdog group "articulo 19" assigned more than half of the attacks on journalists to the police and officials last year.
"In Mexico, you die because they want you to keep your mouth shut," Ramirez said.
Obviously, the killings have a deterrent effect.
No one forgets the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago.
Her body was found along with a note allegedly signed by the Zetas cartel: "Here I am because of my reports."
A computer keyboard and headphones lay next to her severed head.
Some branches have chosen to close, such as the El Norte newspaper in the northern border state of Chihuahua after the murder of correspondent Miroslava Breach in March.
Others carry on, as El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did after the assassination of its director in 2004.
In 2010, the Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed the drug cartels with an editorial on the front page with the headline "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists have fled their home states or even the country.
It's a painful decision.
It's hard to find work in exile, and they're still watching the streets and looking for danger.
And sometimes they are hunted, as is apparently the case with photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered in 2015 along with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after fleeing Veracruz.
For those who stay behind and continue the work, it's a daily dance with high-risk choices.
Ibarra, who once wanted to be a poet, admits the drug trade frightens him.
"Mexico is going to hell, and that's why I became a reporter," he said.
At midnight last Friday, when the last edition had already finished, Riodoce's editors sat on the pavement outside the office and drank beer when at once all their phones started buzzing.
A series of shootings involving gang rivals and security forces near the seaside resort of Mazatlan had left 19 confirmed dead.
The war escalated further, as promised by a number of cartel embassies in the region.
From the brick edge, they posted the news on Riodoce's website via mobile phone.
The front page had to be changed the next day.
Sirens howled up nearby - another shooting in the area.
Bojorquez took a look at the police officers who were holding vigil to see if they were in readiness.
If they were scared at all, they didn't show it.
Under the enormous portrait of the newspaper's fallen founder, whose middle finger was visible to all of Sinaloa, Riodoce's staff followed his footsteps.
"How can you even think of closing," Bojorquez said,"when on the same day that Javier was murdered, the intern asked me to send her to the streets for reporting."
Dinosaur used camouflage to dodge its enemies
At first glance, it looks like a statue, albeit a terrifying one.
Now researchers have found that the initial findings of a Canadian miner's incredible rhino have been so well preserved that experts have described it as "the Mona Lisa of dinosaurs."
It was so well preserved that they could even find that his scaly skin was of reddish brown - and they said it had had something of a "troubled past."
The report in the journal "Current Biology" called it "the best preserved armoured dinosaur ever found, and one of the best dinosaur specimens in the world."
The fossil is a newly discovered type of nodosaur that lived in the middle of the Cretaceous period between 110 million and 112 million years ago.
Its incredibly well-preserved condition has stunned researchers who describe it as "truly remarkable."
According to reports in National Geographic, the armored herbivore is the best preserved fossil of its kind.
It was found by Shawn Funk when he dug at the Suncor Millenium mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011.
He came across something that seemed out of place from the surrounding rock, and decided to look more closely.
The fossil he discovered was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.
They spent the next six years exposing the wild animal within the 2,500-pound (1,100kg) clump of earth.
After all this hard work, the finished result is now ready to be unveiled.
"If you just blink a little with your eyes, you could almost believe that it has slept," said lead author Caleb Brown, a scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature can be seen.
"It will go down in science history as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaur specimens - the Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs."
Researchers have found that although this herbivore is covered with an armor and resembles a changing tank, it was likely threatened by flesh-eating dinosaurs.
The heavily armored dinosaur used a red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and used a shielding technique known as counter-shading, which is also used by many modern animals.
This would have allowed it to blend better into its surroundings and dodge its enemies, experts say, suggesting it was threatened by larger dinosaurs.
The 110-million-year-old creature from the family of nodosaurs first made headlines in May and is now on display at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.
Researchers have now studied the wild animal and named it Borealopelta markmitchelli after museum technician Mark Mitchell, one of a team that has spent more than 7,000 hours carefully uncovering it.
The astonishing preservation of the specimen allowed Dr Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and shape of scales and armour across his body.
They discovered the countershading, a common defense method in the animal kingdom, meaning the creature's top was darker than its bottom.
Although the countershading is common, the results are surprising, as the size of Borealopelta far exceeds that of the animals living today.
It suggests that the dinosaur was hunted by enough pressure from flesh-eating dinosaurs that evolution favoured the concealment of confrontation as a means of survival.
But most contemporary animals that use the countershade - think deer, zebras or belt animals - are much smaller and more vulnerable than prey, signaling that this nodosaur has been subjected to a real struggle for survival.
"Strong predator behavior on a massive, heavily armored dinosaur shows just how dangerous the dinosaur predators of the Cretaceous period must have been," Brown said.
The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the dinosaur's skin was reddish brown.
Scientists continue to examine the animal for clues about its life, including its preserved intestinal content, to find out what it has eaten as its last meal.
They believe that when the dinosaur died, it got into a river and was driven out into the sea, where it sank on its back to the bottom of the sea.
At the time, Alberta was as warm as South Florida today, and rivers and oceans probably spread much further inland than they are today.
"This nodosaur is really remarkable because it is completely covered with preserved scaly skin, but is also preserved in three dimensions and retains the original shape of the animal," Brown said.
"The result is that the animal looks almost the same today as it did in the early Cretaceous period.
You don't need to use much imagination to reconstruct it, so if you're just shivering a little with your eyes, you could almost believe he's asleep. "
The Cretaceous period was a time when giant theropods, carnivorous dinosaurs that stood on two legs, roamed the earth.
Although the king of them, the Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions of years after Borealopelta, the armoured dinosaur was hunted by some of its fearsome ancestors.
This includes the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38-foot (11.5m) long, six-tonne monster.
The scientists, whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology, believe Borealopelta sank in the sea after death and was mummified in the mud.
The creature was found by Shawn Funk when he dug at the Suncor Millenium mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011.
According to the museum, it is the best preserved armoured dinosaur in the world, including skin and armour, and is complete from the snout to the hip.
The creatures were on average about 18 feet (5 meters) long and have weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).
It contained two 20-inch-long spikes that protruded from his shoulders.
The researchers believe the armored herbivore was swamped through western Canada until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea.
But the dinosaur's underwater burial preserved its armour in exquisite detail.
The fossilized remains of this particular specimen are so well preserved that the skin remains still cover bumpy armoured plates along the dinosaur
As Michael Greshko has written for National Geographic, such a level of conservation is as' rare as a win in the Lotto.
The more I look at it, the more confusing it becomes.
Fossilized remnants of the skin still cover the bumpy armoured panels that carry the animal's skull.
His right front foot is at his side, his five fingers are spread upwards.
I can count the scales on his sole '.
In the thunderstorm: Mass carambolage on A8: Many injured
Violent accident on Thursday night on the A8: Just under 30 vehicles are involved in a mass carambolage.
There are numerous injured, mile-long traffic jams - and gaffers.
About 20 people were injured in a mass carambolage on the Stuttgart-Munich motorway (A8) late Thursday afternoon.
According to the police, about 5 p.m. between the Adelzhausen and Odelzhausen (Aichach-Friedberg County) junctions, nearly 30 vehicles, including probably trucks, had crashed into each other during a thunderstorm.
The exact number of people injured was not disclosed at first.
They were light to medium-serious injuries, a police spokesman said.
A large number of rescue vehicles were at the scene of the accident.
The A8 was completely closed in the direction of Munich.
In the direction of Munich, a backlog of about ten kilometres was formed.
As an AZ reporter reports, massive obstruction also occurred on the oncoming carriageway - caused by numerous gaffers.
The fire brigade noted the hallmarks of vehicle drivers, who now face sensitive penalties.
Shortly after 18:45, a second accident occurred on the A8, this time between Augsburg and Dasing.
There was a collision between a car transporter and a passenger car.
A rescue helicopter was on its way to the accident site.
Deutsche Bahn: Group tests' comfort check-in "
It is a moment that almost everyone has experienced before: One sits on the train and sleeps unsuspecting.
Or one is immersed in his work and just has an ingenious thought.
And then: Pufff.
If the conductor comes and awakens you gently or tears the passenger out of the workflow in the middle of the workflow.
Ticket control.
But the times of interruptions are soon over.
Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the careless ticket control.
You simply confirm by mobile phone that you have taken your seat and devalue the ticket.
A test operation is currently running on two routes.
"If the offer arrives, we will expand it.
It is then expected to be available on many more long-distance routes in Germany early next year,"a rail spokesman said.
"Comfort check-in" is what the train calls the ticket devaluation without a conductor.
In order to be able to use them, however, some requirements have to be met: You need a smartphone or a tablet.
And you have to have booked an online ticket - which is already what most passengers do.
You also have to have bought it through the train's app, the DB Navigator, which is the most convenient way of booking tickets anyway.
And finally, you need a seat reservation.
Because the "Comfort Check-in" works like this: You get on the train, call up your ticket under "My Tickets."
The test customers will then see a button for electronic devaluation.
Train attendants get a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is on the train and has taken the booked seat Y.
When the train attendant arrives at seat Y at ticket control, he knows that there is a passenger sitting there with an already devalued online ticket.
So you can continue to sleep, continue to work, keep silent.
The "check-in" has two advantages: One for the customer, one for the train - which in turn should benefit the passengers.
"If you want to travel relaxed without ticket control by our train attendants, simply check in at the DB Navigator yourself.
This allows passengers to make their travel time on the train more personal,"says Michael Peterson, DB Fernverkehr's marketing board.
Second plus: "And our employees have more time than they do today to respond to individual customer needs."
Those who often train know that, in addition to delays and missed trains, ticket checks are among the biggest annoyances.
Because often you yourself, but in any case one of the fellow passengers does not have all the documents you need for the devaluation of online tickets.
Either the credit card or identity card is missing or otherwise a document to show.
The result is endless discussions between train attendants and passengers, leading to bad mood in the compartment or metropolitan area and delays in checking their own ticket, and ultimately taking the conductor's time to take care of other concerns.
Only a small number of test customers can still use the new service.
And only on the connections ICE 915 Dortmund-Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart-Essen.
Further train numbers on the same route have not yet been unlocked.
How an activist came to learn the answer to the question,"Whose Streets?"
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shaken to her core.
Just a day after she arrived in New York City, the St. Louis native sat on the bed of an Airbnb apartment she rented and scrolled through Facebook on her phone.
She stumbled across a post from someone from high school.
"The police have just killed an 18-year-old child, and it is still lying in the street," it said.
Confused, as no one else had posted the information on her feed, she shut down Facebook and opened Twitter.
A user with the handle @ TheePharoah was constantly retweeted on her timeline.
The rapper from the St. Louis area was in the process of tweeting live the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Mo.
He posted a picture of Brown's lifeless body stretched out in the street and would stay there for four hours.
"This is wild," Ferrell thought to himself.
But death was nothing new to her and her community.
She put down her mobile phone to return to tweets about people on Canfield Drive later in the evening.
There were photos of the police tape and people shouting, and of a man who claimed to be Brown's father carrying a sign reading: 'Ferguson's police just killed my unarmed son!"
She watched a live feed with a police officer standing in front of a group of protesters with a barking dog.
In another video, she said, another police officer unsecured his rifle and shouted: "I'm going to kill you... animals all."
"This is not common," Ferrell recalled her statement.
"That's not the kind of murder we've become accustomed to and that we can call typical."
In that moment, I felt chills.
I was angry and crying. "
She booked a return flight and went home the next day.
After landing at 11pm, she picked up her 6-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided the two would head to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened in the following three years with Ferrell and Ferguson is the subject of a new documentary,"Whose Streets?," in cinemas from 11.
It is a story of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and resilience that exists from the point of view of the people who live in the community and have filled the streets to demand answers.
As Ferrell headed to Ferguson with her daughter, who wore a floral dress and matching crown, the two discussed a conversation they had countless times before this morning "about the black experience and the black condition."
"You remember how I taught you, when black people have to fight for what they believe in?" She recalled what she said.
"We're going to Ferguson now because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and that wasn't right.
I couldn't take them,"Ferrell said later.
"What happened today is a culmination of... what happened in the past.
She needs to know it and see it and be raised in it.
It needs to be well developed, know not only activism and organization, but also the different layers of the black experience and the black constitution, and what we need to do to become free to liberate ourselves.
Even though I'm lucky enough to give her an experience where she doesn't personally experience blatant racism, she's no different to the next black women's child.
I feel like I'm doing her a disservice to keep her away from it. "
The first station, when they arrived in Ferguson, was on South Florissant Road, a location opposite the Police Department that became a camp area as activists waited for Officer Darren Wilson's possible non-indictment.
There, Ferrell and her daughter connected with a local business owner who was making lunch.
They prepared bags and helped pass them on to protesters.
Slowly, a new kind of activism for Ferrell began to take shape.
"My activism totally changed after August 9," she said, noting that as a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, she was president of the Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on eating justice and health inequalities in black communities.
"I've had no experience in organising.
It's all come. "
Weeks later, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, one of the film's co-directors, during an evening demonstration.
Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar just wanted to "document" what happened.
One question came to Ferrell's mind: "Do you want to document or are you trying to find a story that you can exploit?"
That skepticism was fuelled by countless cases of people, often whites - in a community that benefited from their pain and resilience.
As Folayan explained in a recent interview: "We had heard that people who were born and raised in Ferguson didn't center their voices and we wanted to do it differently."
Folayan had already worked with then-co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the field known for his activism around death row inmates.
His involvement brought Ferrell closer to the project, along with six other locals, the team of "Whose Streets?" Followed in the years after Brown's shooting.
"This documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks to us. We talk," Davis said.
"That was the main thing for me, how these people are portrayed, because that's how I'm going to be portrayed."
The goal was not to focus on Ferrell's experience - to show that the movement is "not a Messiah leader, but a community that comes together," Folayan said - she proved to be the film's most outspoken participant.
As a result, documents from "Whose Streets?" Show surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrell's life, how she falls in love and marries her wife.
"I felt like I was naked," Ferrell said, laughing when she first saw the finished product.
"But I understood that there needs to be some vulnerability in this work and in the humanization of black people."
In addition, Ferrell's story repeats the role of black gay women in the broader Black Lives Matter movement.
Two of the movement's three founders, who coined the film "BlacklivesMatter" on social media after the killing of black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012, identify as gay.
"Black, gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement as a whole," Ferrell said,"and therefore we are constantly fighting on different fronts.
Black, gay women have to bear the brunt of everything. "
Folayan agreed to note that "the movement is really held upright by black women and a lot of black women."
However, she insists that "this is not an affirmative type of action," with Ferrell chosen as the heart of the film because of her identity.
"She was the person who stirred up that energy," she said.
"It's no coincidence, even though she was at the forefront because there's so much at stake in a life at these crossings as a black, gay woman.
You can feel their energy through the screen. "
Meanwhile, the news cameras in Ferguson have long since disappeared, but the racial links between the community and the police continue to exist.
Ferrell is on probation for 2 ½ years for blocking a highway at a demonstration.
She describes the sociopolitical atmosphere of the area she calls her home: "A mess."
Yet she clings to a chant and she's been committed to that memory ever since she took to the streets in Ferguson three years ago.
"It's our duty to fight for our freedom.
It is our duty to win.
We have to love and support each other.
We've got nothing to lose - except our chains. "
From "dream" to "megalomania": TV readers discuss bit gallery
The bit gallery moves people, although it is far from built.
But the idea of a shopping mall at the southern end of the pedestrian precinct has been dividing the population into advocates and opponents since the first presentation in 2009.
The subject hardly leaves one cold.
The topic is also discussed on our Facebook page "Volksfreund Bitburg."
While some say to the Bit-Galerie: "That would be a dream" (Anja Becker) or "That would be really great" (Nicole Schausten), comes from the other side: "Don't need a man" (Siggi Betzen) or quite simply: "Megalomania!" (Lars Scholz).
While advocates rely on a gallery to draw more customers to the city, which also benefits the rest of the shops, opponents fear the pedestrian will then bleed out.
Add to this: The gallery is planned exactly on the site where the Farmers Market Hall stands, where 13 direct marketers offer their products.
This will end with the start of construction work.
The gallery makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - towards Beda Square with the possibility to sit outside.
Simone Zimmer: "We have been shopping almost weekly in the Farmers Market Hall for many years.
Mainly our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of the country women again and again very gladly.
We also discovered the butchery for ourselves.
We would like to see a chance to maintain this offer even during and especially after the construction of the gallery.
In other cities, too, there is.
Especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting."
Gerd Densing: "Whether direct marketers settle in a market hall in the gallery comes down to the amount of rent.
But this should not be very low in the new project."
Eva Kilic: "Why shopping palaces in Bitburg?
Whether it's clothing, shoes, drugstores or supermarkets: I find that superfluous.
There is already enough of that in our city.
You can see how many shops are empty here - some for months and years.
However, since there is not even a proper weekly market here, it is all the more important that at least the market hall is preserved.
After all, the product offered there is fresh, is mostly offered directly by the producer and is also inexpensive.
As you can see, shops in a shopping centre are only rented by larger firms, because the rents there are often unsustainable for a retailer.
What a pity, there are almost no more specialty shops and what is left of them will probably disappear."
Wolf Fandel: "A shopping mall with a market hall doesn't fit together for me.
And the gallery doesn't fit Bitburg.
Above all: Where should the farmers market hall go during the construction period?
The old Edeka would be the solution - even in the long run, if the bit gallery actually comes at some point.
Or does the ghost bit gallery manage to drive all the shops out of Bitburg before?""
George Marquet: "This is just not going to work.
And a shopping center that stands empty, no one needs either.
I think it would have been better to promote a proper farmers' market instead of this gallery.
But there is no place for a farmers market hall thanks to the insanely many - I think - senseless construction projects in Bitburg.
If the farmers "market hall is broken, a piece of culture will disappear again."
A fitting resemblance: Artist creates portraits with Chelsea Manning's DNA
In the middle of the room at the Fridman Gallery in New York, there are many faces - white, black and brown, almost imperceptibly alike - hanging on cables from the ceiling.
The 30 portraits were created by artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from cheek-toppers and haircuts sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent the excerpts from Fort Leavenworth prison, where the former intelligence analyst was serving a 35-year sentence after she made public classified diplomatic messages on the website WikiLeaks.
The new exhibition, which opened on August 2, is called A Becoming resemblance (A fitting resemblance).
She is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline united her expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a trans woman and landmark dissident whose conviction was commuted by Barack Obama when he had just three days left in his post.
Dewey-Hagborg has created a sharp, if somewhat intellectual, commentary not only on the malleability of DNA data - the many ways it can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also on identity through the algorithmic analysis of DNA extracted by Manning, from which 30 portraits were created of what someone might look like with these genomic data.
Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward but has already spoken openly about identifying as a woman since her puberty, was convicted of 20 charges in 2013, including six violations of the Espionage Act, computer fraud and theft.
Through the prison, her image was suppressed, so much so that there was only one photo - a grainy, black-and-white selfie in which Manning sits visibly unwell in a driver's seat wearing a platinum blonde wig - that she was associated with.
In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg just came away from the huge success of her 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'.
In it, the artist produced portraits of strangers from forensic artifacts such as cigarette butts and chewing gum by extracting the DNA from the waste to create a picture of what these people might look like.
That was when she received an email from a newspaper magazine.
"They did an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison, and they wanted some kind of portrait to accompany this article," Dewey-Hagborg explained at a press preview of the new exhibition.
And she couldn't be visited at the time and she couldn't be photographed, so you made contact with Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to do a DNA portrait.
The artist and her imprisoned muse became unequal briefs who exchanged several letters over the course of two years.
They even created a comic "suppressed Images," illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, that foresaw a future in which the president would transform Chelsea's judgment and she would be able to see the exhibition in person.
That Obama would actually call for Manning's release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas, just days after the book was published, was a welcome kind of happy coming together.
There is also something deep and strong now at the opening of the exhibition, as Donald Trump is waging a war against whistleblowers from the government camp and against transgender troops to find new, tweetable ways to further inflame the rigid divisions he was supposed to fix.
When Dewey-Hagborg was asked about the strange timing of all these things, she said that "things happen for a certain reason."
In an artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery, Manning, with her oversized signature underneath (the "i" in her family name is emblazoned with a heart), called for an end to "automatic fragmentation, the basis of which has been gender, race, sexuality and culture."
On the opposite wall is her mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousand-footer of Cs and Gs and As, written in pencil.
Dewey-Hagborg hoped, by including the 200 letters (or nucleotides according to the artist's sophisticated scientific lexicon), to show how strikingly similar, at least in biological terms, we all are.
"What people will hopefully take away from this is that our genome doesn't care about who we are and how open genetic data is to an interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose 2007 video work, Spurious Memories, is also on view.
"DNA data can tell so many different stories, so that's 30 of those stories."
The last piece in the exhibition, kept in a room of its own, is a page from the aforementioned comic novella.
She shows Manning showing up with a hands-free phone in hand from the United States disciplinary barracks like King-Kong.
"If they cold your speech, then they won," it read.
"So never keep your mouth shut."
"It came straight from a letter she wrote to me," said the artist, who greets from Philadelphia.
"I still get goosebumps when I talk about it."
Manning has not yet seen the exhibition in person - as presciently anticipated in the comic book - but if she should, then she will be greeted in the middle of the room by the masks, by her own genomic simulacres that rally together like hordes of protesters.
That was also purposeful, like everything in the exhibition, down to size (5 "2, Manning's stature), where her genetic haplogroups were written with pencil.
"In the past, I had them on the wall, but I wanted them to feel like a crowd," Dewey-Hagborg said of the portraits.
"I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea, like the movement that was also behind their liberation."
Northwestern University professor and an Oxford University employee wanted for killing
A nationwide manhunt is underway for a Northwestern University professor and an Oxford University employee who are being sought as suspects after a man was stabbed with fatal injuries in a luxury Chicago apartment.
On Monday, arrest warrants were issued for Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) for murder for their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, Cook County District Court records show.
The documents say Cornell-Duranleau, 26, passed away after several stitches.
A community alert system released by the Chicago Police Department says the corpse was discovered on July 27.
Officials received a call, arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with multiple injuries to his body.
Cornell-Duranleau was still pronounced dead at the scene of what happened, and detectives are investigating the stitches as a homicide while police are actively searching for the two suspects, officials said.
Lathem has been an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, the vice president for university relations, said in an emailed statement that Lathem had now been placed on leave and barred from entering the Northwestern University campus.
"This is now a criminal matter that is being investigated by the relevant authorities, and Northwestern University is cooperating in this investigation," Cubbage said.
Warren is a senior Treasury assistant at the University of Oxford.
A spokesman for the university and Somerville College said in an emailed statement that "we are in contact with the police in the UK and ready to assist the US investigative authorities in any way we can."
The statement added that Warren's colleagues were shocked and want him to stand up.
Chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Department, Anthony Guglielmi, said he strongly urges the suspects to stand up to authorities.
"The police have an idea of their whereabouts, and our efforts to locate them are intensifying," Guglielmi said.
Guglielmi said local, regional and national authorities are helping to find the suspects.
Guglielmi said police received a call from the building manager of the Grand Plaza building, who had just received an enigmatic tip saying something had happened in apartment 1008.
Police described the scene as very cruel.
Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the incident had also taken place on July 27.
It was confirmed by security cameras that Lathem and Warren were in the building.
"We believe that Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," Guglielmi said.
Grand Plaza's management team released a statement to residents: "Police are currently working on the timeline and background of the victim and are exploring a variety of motives, including a possible domestic incident."
"We will complete the WADA roadmap in the near future" - Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mutko
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said it will not be long before the remaining World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) criteria for the restoration of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RusADA) are implemented.
"At a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the roadmap, RusADA has been given the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD (UK Anti-Doping).
The WADA roadmap has been updated in this regard,"Mutko explained on Thursday.
The PM commented on the second part of WADA's roadmap to comply with the code, which describes the criteria for RusADA's reinstatement and was recently published on the organisation's website.
According to Mutko, it contains nothing that could cause concern for Russia.
"Everything has been announced, everything is being implemented.
And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA in the near future,"he added.
However, one of the criteria mentioned in the list notes that Russian anti-doping authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the WADA-approved investigation by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren into alleged state-sponsored doping in Russian sport.
Speaking about the matter, Mutko said: "We are conducting the investigation as our anti-doping system has admitted a mistake.
All measures have been implemented.
But there were no government programs, and we're not going to admit something that doesn't exist. "
Mutko's words were consistent with those of Vitaly Smirnov, the head of Russia's independent anti-doping commission.
Speaking to Russian outlet RSport earlier in the day, Smirnov admitted problems of the past in Russian anti-doping organisations, but then added: "We have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations.
No one plans to accept this report unconditionally,"Smirnov added.
RusADA was barred from conducting doping checks in Russia in November 2015 in the wake of the doping scandal by WADA.
However, it has been allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and UK Anti-Doping (UKAD).
After a visit to the organization's headquarters in Moscow in July, WADA Director General Olivier Niggli declared that RusADA was "moving in the right direction" to be reinstated.
Aldi no longer sells eggs for now
The business groups shared that.
It was a purely precautionary measure that no further health impairment could be assumed, the communication said.
As of now, only eggs are likely to be delivered to Aldi, which have been shown to have been tested negatively for fipronil-containing anti-lice.
Aldi wanted to create clarity and transparency for its customers.
The start-ups that will help your company not become the next Uber
Amy Errett wanted to measure happiness among your employees at your e-commerce start-up, but the polls didn't work.
Answers were often vague, unhelpful or - even worse - fraudulent.
And even if you promised anonymity, some workers didn't trust the process.
"There was just never consistency and objectivity," said Errett, who runs the 75-person San Francisco e-commerce Hair Care company Madison Reed.
She has called people from the outside for help.
A new breed of human resources start-ups is growing to help companies figure out how their employees feel.
By creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement, it allows companies to conduct surveys, address special groups and demographic groups, provide anonymity and complaint hotlines to employees, and in some cases allow whistleblowers to bypass the C-Suite executives and contact the board directly.
"You now have tools like strava and Fitbit for tracking their health, but where is the Fitbit for your company?" Said Jim Barnett, co-founder and chief executive of Redwood City start-up Glint, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement.
Errett said that she gained a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with Glint.
In addition to the snap polls and polls from certain teams, it offers a heat map of the company that shows at a glance which units have the most complaints and which executives have low approval scores - so you can drill down on why.
Companies come to realize that at the forefront of workplace culture must remain so that you don't become the next Uber to be embroiled in scandal since a former employee published a blog post describing an environment of harassment in which those who have spoken have been punished.
For start-ups like Glint, this desire for an overview is a lucrative business opportunity.
The global governance, regulation and compliance industry could own more than $118.7 billion in value in 2020, according to financial technology website Let's Talk Payments.
Denver, Colorado, start-up Convercent, which helps companies prevent and detect bad behavior, saw a surge in interest and activity earlier this year amid the Uber case in disrepair.
Convergence has nearly 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber recently signed up as a client.
Like Glint, Convercent lets companies send bespoke "pulse" surveys, collect confidential answers in real time, and view the heat maps of your problem areas.
It also offers an anonymous SMS hotline that allows employees to report bad behavior.
And if the chief executive is involved, complaints go directly to the supervisory board.
"The court of public opinion has captured the regulators," said Patrick Quinlan, the founder and chief executive of Convercent.
If a company is found to be treating its employees poorly or behaving unethically, it can experience costly consequences from consumer boycott, employee fluctuation and lawsuits, Quinlan said.
Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 locations, has deployed Convercent for more than a year to ensure employees are aware of policies and procedures and have an easy way to reach their corporate headquarters.
Earlier, if an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a phone number or email for the company headquarters, file a formal complaint and hope that he or she was taken seriously.
It was often an intimidation and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesdays General Counsel, who said there was no good way to track the complaints from employees.
Now that the company is using Convercent, problems previously hidden by executives who sat in offices in cities or states - such as discrimination, harassment or unfair internships - can be identified and addressed more quickly.
"I can get closer to this holistic, 360-degree view into the experience of employment," said Vitrano, who heads Ruby Tuesday's Risk Management Group.
"And we're protecting our shareholders from employment litigation."
Companies began to take ethics, values and employee engagement more seriously in 2002 after accounting firm Arthur Andersen collapsed over ethics violations caused by the Enron scandal, Quinlan said.
But it took the "social media to get to their right" that companies realized you couldn't prevent their dirty laundry from going online.
"Before using technology to monitor ethics, people used hope as a strategy," he said.
Both Glint and Convercent offer your software as a service, and charge companies recurring fees for using their products.
It's a business model and an opportunity that has the approval of venture capital investors, who have supported both start-ups.
Convergence received $10 million in funding in February from firms such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, bringing the total capital to $47 million.
Glitzern secured $10 million in November from Bessemer Venture Partners, bringing its total funding to $60 million.
These investments come as little surprise, given the interconnected nature of business, culture and venture capital.
There is a growing complex of research that shows that today's employees expect more from their jobs than before.
In competitive markets like Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are just stakes.
Employees want to feel that you are accepted and valued and that you are giving your time to a company with a positive mission.
"If people are happy to be in a company, feel that their voices belong, and that the work you do is worth it, then they feel more committed to making this company successful," said Nina McQueen, vice president of Global Benefits and Employee Experience at LinkedIn, which uses both Convercent and Glint.
Investors achieve returns when their portfolio companies are doing well. Companies are doing well when employees are engaged and engaged.
If third-party analytics tools promise to increase employee engagement and engagement, it's no wonder you'll find support.
The data on employee engagement according to the experts of workplace culture important.
But the data is useless if a company's administrators don't take action.
In fact, when a company asks employees for your feedback, it may have an expectation that change is on the way.
And if change doesn't come fast enough, or not at all, it can breed disappointments and demotivate employees.
"If you're asking for 4,000 suggestions, you have to be willing to have 4,000 conversations," said Russell Raath, president of consulting at business management firm Kotter International, which has seen companies that have relied too much on collecting data.
"Because if you don't follow employees will ask themselves," Have you really heard me?
Do you care?
And who you don't care about, why should I? "
Madison Reed, who now conducts monthly employee surveys, was able to take action on the same day when a problem is reported about Glint, according to Errett.
And after collecting feedback from frustrated employees, through the speed of decision-making and the quality of communication, she was able to reorganize several teams within the company and add a communications training to address the issues.
At Ruby Tuesday, the company keeps getting new insights about employees, and it hopes that in the long run, this will lead to better retention of workers in an industry known for high sales.
"If you're not committed to creating a culture of transparency, you're going to lose people," Vitrano said.
"And if you lose people, you lose customers too.
And if you lose customers, then you're going to lose businesses.
The NCAA eliminates the two-day practices and makes a long day for the Bruins
It's heading to 11 p.m. as a crowd of UCLA football players entertain themselves on one side of the team's new practice fields on campus.
Some have pulled out their jersey tops and show their backs full of sweat from the first day of training camp.
For a good part of the team, these idle minutes represent a lunch break.
Players enrolled for the summer classes will return to their final exams after the three-hour exercise before returning to the Wasserman Football Center at 6:30 a.m. the next morning.
"This is a real treadmill for the guys the next three days," Bruins coach Jim Mora said shortly before Monday turned into Tuesday.
The NCAA eliminates two-day exercises to ease the burden of players, and it has actually extended its days - at least until Friday's finals.
That's why UCLA's first three workouts should start at 7:15 p.m. to accommodate the players' already-packed schedules.
The compromise away from the two days is more than a day when the Bruins postponed the start of camp almost a week after last season and did practical exercises during summer school for the first time during Mora's six seasons at Westwood.
They are scheduled to hold 18 practice sessions over the course of August, with 20 before the start of formal game preparations for their opener against Texas A & M in September.
Mora said he supports the NCAA's rule change, even if it adds another point to the players' busy routes.
"We put this enormous strain on it three or four days, and it's very challenging," Mora said.
"And they've just pushed it through, they continue to place themselves, they're great people.
I think once we get to Saturday and we have more time, it's going to be really great. "
UCLA will end its practices once the camp is finished, which will be no easy task given the clear sightlines of its fields from an adjacent parking lot and the adjacent Luskin Center, an upper-class hotel that has already been dogged with footballs clearing a protective net behind a goalpost.
Bruins players are expected to occupy the hotel starting this weekend, but Mora acknowledged there could be a problem once those rooms are vacant during the season.
"We will use our security," Mora said.
"That's a real problem, and it's not far-fetched to think that people rent a room there and then tune in there to record an exercise.
If you have the video tape of an exercise, it's a pretty good deal.
But we have security forces there, and we have security forces in parking lot 8.
We will do the best with what we have.
I am not too worried about this.
We've got a plan. "
Facebook wants to intensify fact-checking in fight against fake news
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with fake news to third-party fact-checkers and then display their results under the original post, the world's largest online social network said on Thursday, saying it is one of its efforts to combat so-called fake news.
The company said in a statement on its website that it will begin using updated machine learning methods to detect possible false messages and send them to fact-checkers who will potentially display fact-checking results from the original article.
Facebook has been criticized as one of the main distribution points for so-called fake news, which many believe also influenced the 2016 U.S. presidential election.
The problem has also become a major political issue in Europe, with French voters flooded with false stories in the run-up to May's presidential election, and Germany supports a plan to punish social media networks if they fail to quickly eliminate hateful postings as they did before elections there in September.
On Thursday, Facebook said in a separate statement in German that a test of the new facts review was being launched in the US, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
"In addition to realizing what stories are being challenged by third-party fact-checkers, people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share," said Sara Su, product manager for Facebook news in a blog.
She added that Facebook will continue to test its feature on the "related article" and is working on other changes to its news feed to reduce fake news.
Creating a comic novel: A castle in the history of England
In its more recent past, little Scotney Castle was featured in a squeeze music video and was a loophole for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970s and 1980s.
But Scotney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history from his cozy seat in the Bewl River Valley in Kent, and has now become the inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes, a mop-haired Yorkshireman with a penchant for historical documents.
"I find it so nice to look at the handwriting of someone who has been dead for 300 years," he says wistfully.
"What a personal relationship to hold this letter in my hand."
"A Castle in England' spans the period from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward, documenting the families who lived in Scotney, each story illustrated by another emerging British artist - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
It is not the first book by Rhodes to be based on an archive: He wrote 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories' in 2014, a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project he found unexpectedly emotional.
"I just reacted to the thumb print on the side of a letter like that written by a double agent in the 1700s who worked for the Jacobins," he says.
"That's his thumb print!
And letters always smell of smoke, because at that time a fire was lit because of the light.
For someone who lives 300 years later, the smell has an effect as if he himself were in it, too.
Oh, I love archives! "
For someone so smitten with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and Arts Council England and lived in a castle for nearly four months ("To be honest: I overstated my welcome a little bit") this all seems too nice to be true.
Rhodes spent his days exploring the Victorian "new" castle, sifting through the archives and studying the castle's many treasures and curiosities, such as the mounted hyenas heads on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the ditch.
He wandered through the grounds and ruins of the old castle and spoke to landscape painters, gardeners and sometimes the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book.
Then, at night, he drank "whiskey and started to write."
Scotney's intimate story is relatively unknown, as the National Trust did not get full access until 2006, when the last heiress, Elizabeth Hussey, died.
When Rhodes arrived a decade later, employees only just started taking care of the archive, which he described as "hundreds of years in which aristocrats said" Oh, throw it to the attic."
Diaries, letters from the time of the English Empire, maps depicting who owned what: "You might think that land conflicts would be boring," says Rhodes,"but there was a birch there that two families fought for.
Guys, let everything go his way! "
Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to delve into English history on a broader basis, including 'The Labourer', which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 1381.
"There is a record of a riot that occurred at the castle in 1380, in this book titled 'Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex'," says Rhodes.
"The peasant uprising started in this area and I thought an uprising was a good start.
Maybe the two are connected? "
Other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - such as' The Priest ', which tells the story of the Jesuit patron, whom the Darrell family hid for seven years during the English Reformation.
Or 'The smuggler', which depicts 18th-century smuggler Arthur Darrell staging his own funeral by filling a coffin with stones (a discovery made only years later when his coffin was excavated).
The Darrells are Rhodes' favourite family of Scotney: "The Lords seemed to be quite crooks, keep getting into debt and spending money on things they couldn't afford.
Other generations of Darrell men solved their debt crises by marrying rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of good-looking guys, with a talent to advertise heirlooms. "
After the end of his assignment at the castle, Rhodes is on the lookout for other unique writing experiences
He has endured a two-week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about Elämänmäki, the site of an early 20th century sanatorium that has since been reclaimed by nature.
But Scotney has a special place for him.
"I was sad to go again," he says.
It was like,"Ah, now I have to deal with the damn life again."
Campaign launched: Over 300-year-old Mary's Chapel shrouded in Rhöndorf
On Friday, the city of Bad Honnef launched its campaign to introduce a new umbrella brand (Rundschau from Thursday) by covering the 301-year-old Marienkapelle chapel in Rhöndorf.
Until Thursday, Mayor Otto Neuhoff and his marketing team around Nelson Artz want to keep the logo and slogan secret.
At the end of August, as the highlight of the campaign, there is to be a festival on the island of Grafenwerth.
"Too beautiful for us.
Or?,"the makers of the action have been asking since yesterday on the posters at the Rhöndorfer Chapel.
"We don't really think so (of course!)," they write on their website unlocked yesterday.
"But we're using this measure to get your attention.
And to make it clear that some things are better than it seems.
Basically, we firmly believe that, as Bad Honnefer citizens, we are well aware of the beauty and attractiveness of our city."
The action is about more than "just" a logo and a slogan, it goes on.
"There's a need to formulate a single promise, one that gives the city a distinctive unique selling point."
After all, it is in competition with other municipalities.
The city of Bad Honnef can cost a medium five-digit amount of its new umbrella brand and the campaign.
Military reforms in Turkey - Erdogan's fear of army
Every year in early August, in Ankara, the Supreme Military Council (Yas) advises on retirements and promotions in the officer corps.
So, too, this week.
At first glance, a normal process.
But nothing is routine with Turkish forces a year after the coup attempt.
The meeting was no longer held in the building of the General Staff, as it used to be, but in the prime minister's seat of office.
The five Deputy Prime Ministers and the Ministers for Defence, Home Affairs, Justice and Foreign Affairs also took part in the discussions, chaired by the Prime Minister.
With that, the civilians in the Yas were in overdrive.
The government is pulling the reins in the military.
Chief of Staff Hulusi Akar remains in office, but the commanders of the Army, Air Force and Navy have been ousted.
Since the failed coup, leader Erdogan has fired 169 of the 326 generals and admirals.
More than 10,000 soldiers have been removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of alleged links to the movement of exiled preacher Fethullah Gülen, whom Erdogan sees as the wiretap of the coup attempt.
486 people believed to have been directly involved in the coup attempt have been under negotiation in Ankara since this week.
Even the day after the coup, Erdogan had called the coup attempt a "godsend," as it gave him the opportunity to "completely purify" the armed forces.
But does Erdogan really have a grip on the army?
In late February, the newspaper "Hürriyet" published an article headlined "unease in military headquarters."
There are concerns in the General Staff about an increasing "Islamisation" of the army, which manifests itself, among other things, in the lifting of the headscarf ban on female soldiers, the newspaper wrote.
In any case, the large-scale clean-up of the army and the security forces continues.
In mid-July, Erdogan had another 7395 state troopers fired by decree, including 2303 police officers and 546 soldiers.
In doing so, it seemed that Erdogan had tamed the military.
The generals used to be considered the actual lords of the country.
Three times they putted, citing their role as guardians of the secular state order.
After his election victory in 2002, Erdogan pushed back the power of the military step by step, not least citing European Union reform targets.
Former officers say Erdogan is deliberately pushing ahead with an Islamization of the armed forces.
Writing in Vocal Europe magazine, an unnamed officer who sought asylum after the coup attempt for fear of persecution abroad warned that the Turkish army will be "full of extremists and Salafists" in a few years.
If true, such a development could not leave NATO cold.
In any case, after the purges, there are doubts in the alliance about the readiness of the Turkish army.
Leadership structures and operational capabilities are "weakened," Nato diplomats say.
Washington changes green card rules
There will be a new U.S. immigration plan to change the rules of the green card, President Donald Trump said, quoted by the media.
It envisions lowering legal immigrants to 50,000 a year, tougher rules on obtaining visas for temporary work permits and restrictions on family-oriented visas.
The new rules are proposed by Republicans and backed by the president.
The bill is scheduled to be debated in the two chambers of Congress.
"This bill will reduce poverty, increase wages and save billions of dollars for taxpayers and will do so by the US changing the way green cards are issued to citizens from other countries."
The law will prevent chain migration and replace the current system.
This new application procedure will benefit candidates who speak English, who have the financial resources to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy,"Trump said, quoted by American media.
Ministry wants to refurbish track for racetrack shuttle
Again and again in the past months the future of the Rennsteishuttles had been discussed - now it should go very fast.
Before the end of the year, the ramshackle track on which the tourist railway runs is to be built.
Construction work on the track is expected to begin later this year to secure the future of the racetrack shutter in the long term, according to the Department for Transport.
"With the decision to continue to order and renovate the Ilmenau-Rennsteig route, the country is committed to this link, which is particularly important for tourism," said Transport State Secretary Klaus Sühl in Erfurt on Friday.
He put the cost of repairing the line at about 2.5 million euros.
Of that total, the country takes over 75 percent.
The contract, on the basis of which the shuttle will continue to be ordered by the country in the future, is currently being finalised, said Sühl.
The Ministry and the Southern Thuringia Railway as operators are already agreed on the technical details.
"With that, the roadmap, the vehicles used and the quality standards are negotiated," Sühl said.
The planned contract between the ministry and the railway company will be concluded for a period of eleven years.
As a result, the Rennsteig shuttle should be ordered on a regular basis on December 2017.
The Rennsteig Shuttle is a popular rail link between the Ilmenau and Rennsteig stations, especially for tourists.
In recent months, a pilot operation had tested whether the route would be used by a sufficient number of people to re-order it regularly in the future.
The route is also very dilapidated in parts.
The rise of sex robots is real, and we should be worried
Just when you thought it couldn't get even crazier in 2017, comes a new report on the technological developments in the field of sex robots.
Yes, actually.
Sex robots are a big deal right now.
Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years.
According to Noel Sharkey, emeritus professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of the FRR, we need to start taking their rise seriously.
Customers can choose the robot's eye colour, its shape of the nipple and the type of fingernail.
"People make fun of them, but the companies deliver a lot of them, and we're going to get to see them a lot more often," Mr Sharkey said at the release of his new report.
Modern sex dolls have evolved from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with deliberately human reactions achieved by artificial intelligence.
The user can also "customize" his robot according to his beliefs, choosing everything from the robot's eye color to the shape of the nipples to the type or color of his fingernails.
But it becomes even more troubling as many robots own the "personalities" that would make a Stepford woman look progressive.
Modern sex dolls have evolved into robots with a silicone skin.
The RealBotix robot, for example, allows its users to adapt their robots to the properties they find appealing, such as shyness.
And then there are the Roxxxy Gold sex robots developed by True Companion with pre-programmed personalities such as "frigid Farrah," which gives the impression of shyness and "Wild Wendy" with an "adventurous" personality.
"Roxxxy Gold has a personality that is as adapted to your personality as possible," swarms True Companion's website.
So she likes what you like, and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc.
She also has her moods over the course of the day - quite like real people!
She can be tired, fixated on conversation or she can be "in a mood"!"
There are many disturbing aspects to this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the submissive female traits, the allusions to rape when you approach a step on frigid (read here: Reluctant) Farrah, worry one the most.
On its website, True Companion compared Roxxxy to a vibrator, but for men.
"If women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can't men have a Roxxxy?" The website states.
However, these sex robots are not just a fetish or just another sex toy.
Their emergence and increasing sophistication point to something darker and deeper in our culture, a retreat from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with subjugation as an optional encore.
Most men, of course, won't hold sex robots, and while the FRR notes their rising popularity, they still remain on the fringes of consumer culture for the time being.
But what leaks from the fringes can be very instructive in terms of the spirit of the time we live in.
And many people are not weird or offensive until the free market gives them permission to do so.
There is some overlap, after all, that these sophisticated sex robots are emerging at a time when women's rights are under threat around the world, when there is a president in the White House who has boasted of sexually assaulting women.
The most deterrent aspect of the TV series' The handmaid's Tale '(' The report of the maid ') is not the graphic images, the entangled bodies and the outcast eyes, but how realistic this vision works.
The Republic of Gilead is a leap, but at the moment this doesn't feel like a big leap.
The aim behind these sex robots is to make a physical resemblance to actual women as realistic as technically possible (albeit with porn star proportions).
Their builders want them to feel human, to mimic the movement of a real body.
But, to the point, when it comes to their "personalities," the robots don't represent real women.
They can't separate from their companion or just walk away.
They have no mediation or a backstory, nothing that suggests independence or anything that could disrupt the imagination of total subjugation.
In other words, they are pleasing slaves.
Or to put it in the way of 2017: Service girls
Trump's great achievement?
He makes Mitt Romney the epitome of common sense
It has become a truism of the Trump era that the political divisions that have polarized the US electorate have also divided small-format families.
Around Christmas and Thanksgiving, there were newspapers in the US offering advice on how to deal with the horror of Trump-voting relatives.
We are all reportedly making an effort to make our filter bubbles burst.
Less noticed is the power of Trump to bring families together.
I mention this because my cousin, a left-leaning poet who lives in Chicago and has long been involved with Republicans in our family, visited me in New York this week.
She reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.
With Trump in the White House, everyone she knows, including the Republican kinship she had fought with for decades over politics, is suddenly and quite peculiar on the same page.
This is certainly a good thing around the dining table, but it strikes me in another context that this also carries significant risks.
The left has been strengthened by Trump, but the disfiguring effect of his presidency has the strength to push us all to the right.
When we talk about "normalization" and Trump, we refer to the gruesome possibility that one day his kittens will no longer repel us.
There is, however, an even more terrifying long-term scenario in which Trump "normalizes" right-wing Republicans who suddenly appear to be the epitome of reasonableness compared to his standards.
I find myself infested these days by an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's hilarious version of the madman - the dog on the car roof, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew what his tax return looked like) - both of which, compared to Trump, do in fact strike one as a very mild offence.
If Trump goes, the next Republican nominee just needs to be mentally healthy to qualify as an immeasurable improvement.
When my cousin was in town, we took our children to the carousel in Central Park, the largest of the carousels in the New York park department, and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don't need caffeine.
The horses are enormously large, the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are crisp and the animals twist to look over their own shoulders full of fear - extremely sinister and the climactic music conveys this in an odd way.
So many clichés of a city disappoint: The views of tall buildings grow old, the skylines become too familiar to offer much excitement, and the reality of the city doesn't live up to the dream.
Thirty-five years later, and I'm still not quite over the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is in fact not a Swiss cottage - the themed pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage doesn't count - but a large roundabout in north London.
The Central Park carousel is still a strangely magical experience, however, as here two two-year-olds, an 11-year-old and two women in their 40s can go on it and all have a great time.
If I could have assessed the carousel, I would have given him the full score, but luckily no one asked about it.
On the other hand, in a department store this week, I was forced to rate my "experience" of transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could pull through my credit card.
In the coffee shop on the corner of my street, it's the same, plus the option to match the valuation with a 15% tip - this to buy something over the shop table.
This not only leads to a slowdown in what should actually be a neutral exchange, but also puts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where none is required.
The poor woman in the department store stood excusingly grinning while I tired of the experience of handing her my five-star credit card.
Oscar Pistorius moved from prison to hospital with chest pain
Pistorius has left prison for the second time for a hospital visit.
Last year he was taken to hospital for treatment of cuts to his wrists, which he said he suffered after a fall in his cell, according to prison authorities.
Pistorius was convicted of murder after an appeal by prosecutors against an initial manslaughter conviction.
He killed Steenkamp in the early hours of Valentine's Day 2013 by shooting her at her several times through a door of the toilet cubicle at his home in Pretoria.
Pistorius claimed that he thought his girlfriend was a nightly intruder hiding in the cabin.
Prosecutors have announced their intention to appeal this time against the six-year sentence of Pistorius, which they say is too lenient.
The National Law Enforcement Agency said it would appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa and the appeal could be heard this year.
Pistorius runs the risk of his sentence being increased to 15 years if prosecutors are successful.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
When farmer Arnold finds an odd egg
As the last of the Blumberg schools, the fourth-graders from Fützen and Epfenhofen were released into the holidays and into the secondary schools.
Three of the dismissal students will go to grammar school in the future, four to secondary school.
School principal Angelika Sitte welcomed the parents and representatives of the public at the Bürgerhaus Biesental in Epfenhofen on Tuesday evening.
As a symbol of the school dismissal, the 29 pupils of the four classes, led by Sophia Schumacher and Regine Meder, chose a young eagle who grows up in the chicken farm but is then released to freedom after all.
The lively crowd performed a musical called "Der Adler im Hühnerhof" (The Eagle in the Hühnerhof).
Farmer Arnold found a strange egg, and had it hatched by his chickens.
Instead of a chicken chicken, a little eagle came out.
But the hope of making a chicken out of him shattered, with the eagle spreading its wings on a high mountain and disappearing.
After that, classes three and four showed a chicken dance in Yvonne Frank's enrolment.
The hens danced with the young goggles, who wore cylinders to make the bet.
The eagle stands for integration, said school principal Angelika Sitte.
The kitten is different from the other kittens (chicks), but belongs to it.
But he will never be like a chicken.
His determination is to be free.
She wished every fourth-grader that he felt accepted in his new school.
It followed thanks to colleagues, former school principal Michael Müller, who repeatedly jumps in on classroom shortages, and the parents' representatives.
The chick season is now over, explained class teacher Sophia Schumacher.
She was very reluctant to dismiss her students after two years of teaching, because it was a really great time.
Finally, she was able to rely on the fourth-graders.
At the end all students sounded a song of summer time and holiday time.
Great joy broke out among the children.
Eight first-graders have already registered for the new school year.
Two Bulgarians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
Two Bulgarians have been detained for illegal campings in Greece, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced, quoted by television.
On the morning of August 1, police arrested a group of illegally camping people in Sithonia, including the two Bulgarians.
On the same day they were released while an investigation is ongoing.
The foreign ministry told bTV that the Bulgarians were later released.
Greek authorities have tightened control over free camping and are imposing substantial fines on anyone found to stay in a place not intended for that purpose.
Checks will continue throughout the season.
The ministry said the court can impose a fine.
Software update for diesel vehicles: What those affected need to know now
How exactly does the software update take place?
Do diesel drivers need to get involved in the action?
The most important questions and answers at a glance.
At the diesel summit, BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW Group offered software updates for a total of around 5.3 million cars.
They are intended to improve the exhaust behaviour of cars in the Euro 5 and partly Euro 6 emission classes.
Euro 4 diesel or worse are excluded.
Anja Smetanin from the ACE Auto Club Europe gives assessments:
Is the new action mandatory?
No, the negotiated software updates are voluntary.
"The mandatory updates previously only apply to the vehicles that have Schummelsoftware," says Anja Smetanin.
The German Federal Motor Transport Agency (KBA) has ordered their retrofitting.
How and from when will customers be informed about updates?
Manufacturers have announced a speedy implementation in the next few months, but have yet to give an exact date.
Daimler has told to write to anyone affected.
If an inspection is due anyway, it will be done within its framework.
How long should the overall changeover take?
"Hard to say," says Smetanin.
This depends on the commitment of the manufacturers and on political pressure.
"We have seen that car manufacturers are not acting voluntarily on the issue of the environment."
How long should the update last?
The conversion itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop.
It could be more time-consuming to get an appointment.
What do motorists who don't drive a car from BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW Group do?
The ACE advises to wait and see.
Presumably foreign manufacturers would follow suit, according to Smetanin.
Is there now a threat of a massive drop in the price of Euro 4 cars?
The ACE fears that.
But precisely in the regions where driving bans threaten.
In rural areas, there has been no loss of value for older diesel.
The ACE advises to wait with a sale yet.
Ll Cool J receives Kennedy Center award
The Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most glamorous events in Washington.
The first awards ceremony under President Trump promises to become political.
One of the award winners doesn't want to come - in protest.
Ll Cool J (49) is the first rapper to receive one of the prestigious Kennedy Center's coveted awards.
As the cultural institution announced on Thursday, singer Gloria Estefan (59), Lionel Richie (68), as well as choreographer Carmen de Lavallade (86) and TV producer Norman Lear (95) are also among the honorees this year.
The awards will be handed over in early December.
Traditionally, US President Donald Trump will host a reception and attend the awards ceremony along with his wife Melania.
The award winner Lear, who became known with progressive TV series, therefore already announced that he would refrain from attending the gala.
To the "New York Times," he said: "This presidency has chosen to completely neglect the arts and human rights - even depriving them of the means - and that puts a strain on me."
The 59-year-old Estefan stressed she will use the conversation with Trump to make her view clear.
The Kennedy Center, named after former President John F. Kennedy, is the largest cultural institution in the U.S. capital.
Previous winners include Meryl Streep, Aretha Franklin, Robert De Niro, George Lucas, Tom Hanks and Sting.
We make the city livable
Roland Wacker, Haslach's city builder, is retiring next year.
The job is already advertised - but suitable applicants are rare.
Wacker has been a city builder for 31 years.
And the work is still great fun for him, as he conveys in the press briefing.
He reports on varied but also demanding tasks awaiting his successor.
At the same time, he is surprised that so far no application meets the requirements profile.
The city is looking for an architect or civil engineer at the earliest possible time.
Thus, in compliance with the regular notice periods, there should still be enough time for an introduction.
Since Haslach acts as the Lower Building Authority for the administrative community, the applicant must show relevant qualifications.
Because the city definitely wants to keep this function.
If it were no longer able to fill them in, citizens would have to go as far as Offenburg for advice.
But being close to the citizens is important to the city and to it itself, says Wacker, who reports a good operating climate as well as good mood between the authority and citizens.
In more than 30 years in office, some significant projects have accumulated that Wacker looks back on with pride.
"We make the city worth living," he is sure of the building office and its staff.
But also in the future, varied projects are on the agenda: The transformation of the former Hukla area and the Niederhofenparkplatz, for example, have been initiated.
The Kinzigbrücke between Bollenbach and Steinach is being renewed, and the stadium renovation is still an issue.
The latter alone will be worth around 1.5 million euros,"if we get it right," Wacker estimates.
"All in all, great tasks await my successor.
The work here is fun. "
In terms of design, there is a great deal of scope for a city builder.
With Haslach's own farm and nursery, many things can be reacted to quite flexibly.
"You can move a lot," Wacker said, and the design of the green spaces is often praised by citizens and visitors.
As the Old Town is listed as an ensemble, it is important to "have an eye for what fits in" when new buildings are approved, emphasizes the outgoing city builder.
In any case, the city builder bears a high responsibility.
He's a builder,"in the end everything here runs over my table."
He can count on longtime employees for support and coordination: Markus Neumaier (civil engineering) has been there for ten years, Manfred Schöner (civil engineering) has been there for 15 years.
Also, that his successor remains long, Wacker wishes: "We're looking for someone who really identifies with the post and wants to stay."
Because continuity is not only important for a good working climate, but also for the further development of the city.
Anyone wishing to inherit Roland Wacker should, according to the city of Haslach, have completed a degree as a graduate engineer or bachelor with a specialty in architecture and have good expertise in the areas of building regulations and planning law.
The Municipal Building Office is responsible for civil engineering and civil engineering, construction planning, land acquisition matters, management of urban properties, municipal farm with building yard and municipal gardening, as well as the Lower Building Authority including monument protection.
Bike thrown on wires: Southern rail track blocked
According to police, the previously unknown perpetrators had thrown the blue bike from the train track overpass in the area of Leobener Straße (B116) onto the lines.
These were so badly damaged that the approaching freight train had to be stopped.
Investigators are looking for two male perpetrators and have been searching for them since the night hours.
A rose-tinted scooter and a bicycle rider had been observed by witnesses near the scene of the crime.
"This goes far beyond a Lausbubenstreich," ÖBB spokesman Christoph Posch said of the APA.
The perpetrator or the perpetrators would have put themselves in great danger and also put train traffic at risk.
In addition to the damage to the locomotive and the plant, as well as the minutes of delay and the cost of rail replacement transport, the perpetrators could also be met by pennies of rail customers.
Overall, a "significant" sum was expected, the spokesman said.
The damage had been repaired on Friday afternoon, with rail traffic on the Southern Rail line able to be run without any disabilities.
Just under ten passenger trains had fallen out Friday morning, two of which involved long-distance traffic.
Freight trains did not fall out, but they were delayed.
According to ÖBB spokesman Christoph Posch, around 200 metres of overhead lines had to be replaced.
Insulators and masts were also damaged.
Red meat, dairy products and chocolate could help alleviate IBD (inflammatory bowel disease)
Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.
But a new study claims exactly the opposite: A diet rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products could alleviate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel disease.
The incurable condition, which affects around 1.3 million in the US and 300,000 in the UK, causes stomach cramps and flatulence, recurrent or bloody diarrhea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
While those affected are usually advised to shun meat and dairy products to alleviate their symptoms, researchers at Washington University found that the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins helps develop immune cells that promote a tolerant intestine.
The lead researcher, Dr Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells in the intestines patrol to ensure that harmful microbes hiding in the food do not penetrate the body.
Cells capable of triggering inflammation are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues.
If the balance tends too far toward inflammation, it can result in inflammatory bowel disease.
Experiments found that a type of tolerance promoting immune cell occurs in mice that carry a particular bacterium in their intestines.
And the bacterium needs tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells.
Professor Colonna said: 'We have established a link between a type of bacteria - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the intestinal microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.
The more tryptophan the mice had in their food, the more they had of these immune cells. "
He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and a diet rich in tryptophan promotes more tolerant, less inflammatory intestinal milieus, if the same system also works in humans.
Postdoctoral researcher Dr Luisa Cervantes-Barragan examined a type of immune cell that promotes tolerance when she found that a group of study mice had such cells, but another group of the same tribe, but housed separately, did not have this.
She suspected that the difference had to do with the intestinal microbiome of the mice - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi that normally live in the gastrointestinal tract.
The intestines of the mice were DNA sequenced and six species of bacteria were found to be present in the mice with the immune cells, but without them were missing in the mice.
Mice were raised in a sterile environment so they lacked an intestinal microbiome and they did not develop this type of immune cells, and they were given the L. reuteri and the immune cells originated.
To understand how the bacteria impacted the immune system, the researchers let L. reuteri grow in a fluid and then transferred small amounts of the fluid - without the bacteria - to immature immune cells isolated from the mice.
The immune cells developed into the tolerance-promoting cells.
When the active component was purified from the liquid, it turned out to be a byproduct of tryptophan metabolism, known as Indol-3 lactic acid.
If the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the feed of the mice, the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent, but when tryptophan levels were halved, the number of cells fell by half.
Dr Cervantes-Barragan explained that people have the same tolerance-promoting cells as mice, and that most of us protect L. reuteri in our gastrointestinal tracts.
It is not known whether tryptophan byproducts from L. reuteri develop the cells in humans the same way as in mice, but defects in genes related to tryptophan were found in people with inflammatory bowel disease.
She said: 'The development of these cells is probably something we would like to promote as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestines.
Potentially, high tryptophane levels in the presence of L. reuteri can lead to an expansion of this population."
Jose Mourinho believes Manchester United have committed a 'genius' with Nemanja Matic
Manchester United have signed a "genius" with Nemanja Matic, Jose Mourinho believes, after the midfielder made his debut against Sampdoria on Wednesday night.
Chelsea's £40million signing began with a 2-1 win in Dublin, the last pre-season game before the UEFA Super Cup begins against Real Madrid on Tuesday, and impressed in the holding role as the likes of Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira marched on at will.
However, Matic had been ruled out of the Blues' pre-season Asia tour and managed just 45 minutes, which Mourinho admitted he had to improve before the start of the Premier League season.
"He needs time, but his experience, intelligence, a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football," Mourinho said.
"We'll help him be ready sooner rather than later."
In addition to Matic, Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku also started at the Aviva Stadium as Mourinho shaped his starting XI for the start of the season.
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho still wanted three more new commitments, but he insisted the club had already done a "fantastic job" of fulfilling three of his four priority new commitments.
"To get three out of four, for that I thank the club," he added.
"I'll be happier if they get four out of four for me, but they've put in a lot of effort."
Boeing 'paints' Dreamliner into the sky
Us aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the silhouette of a Dreamliner into the sky.
The pilots flew from Seattle in the US state of Washington, but the drawing began in Marquette in US state of Michigan and pulled in the shape of a Dreamliner over the US, which is several thousand kilometers.
The action lasted 18 hours and a minute.
On the radar screens was the shape of a Dreamliner to be.
The whole thing was an endurance test for new engines.
Boeing had previously made such advertising.
So the number "787" and the Boeing logo was painted in the sky.
New low for Martin Schulz - Hanover, we have a problem
How the wind turns: When Sigmar Gabriel was still SPD leader, Social Democratic prime ministers always looked to Berlin with some concern before elections.
Only no disturbances from the party headquarters, only no headwinds from the federal government - that was the most important wish of the election campaigners.
Since Martin Schulz leads the party, that has fundamentally changed.
Since then, staff from the Willy Brandt House have been watching events in the SPD-ruled state capitals with growing horror.
What Schulz got from there since the beginning of the year would not even be described with headwinds in the approach.
It was lows.
One after the other.
The federal CDU sees a general signal against coalitions of the SPD and Greens after the surprise end of the red-green majority in Lower Saxony.
"This shows once again: Red-green simply cannot govern reliably," CDU Secretary General Peter Tauber told the editorial network Germany (RND).
The surprise group exit of a Green MP has plunged the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) into a serious crisis.
Five months before the state election, his red-green coalition lost its one-vote majority to the opposition from the CDU and FDP.
Greens leader Michael Kellner has called on renegade Lower Saxony Greens MP Elke Twesten to return her mandate.
The move to the CDU means a clear falsification of the will of the electorate.
Elke Twesten must immediately return her mandate,"the Greens' federal executive and campaign manager told the editorial network Germany (RND).
"All this must not be true after all," sighs an SPD election campaigner as the new job message reaches party headquarters on Friday morning.
Stephan Weil, SPD prime minister of Lower Saxony, stands without a government majority of his own after Green MP Elke Twesten defected to the CDU.
It is the provisional culmination of a whole series of large and small crises in SPD state federations.
And no one knows what comes next.
The misery began with the unexpectedly emphatic defeat in the Saarland election in March.
A blue eye, no more, comrades calmed down at the time.
After the state elections in Schleswig-Holstein and North Rhine-Westphalia, everything will be different.
It became so - and it all got much worse.
The defeat in Kiel brought the SPD tumbling, the Düsseldorf bust swept the party smoothly.
The comrades laboriously rapped up again in the weeks afterwards.
Then, when they had just plucked up new courage, the G-20 summit came from Hamburg.
And with him came the next low shot.
Mayor Olaf Scholz, the last strong SPD country chief, lost his nimbus that weekend because he was sitting in the Elbphilharmonie while his city burned.
And because in crisis communication after that, he got pretty much everything wrong that you can do wrong.
Since then, Scholz has been fighting for his political survival.
So now also Stephan Weil.
Because of the VW exhaust gas affair and his role on the Supervisory Board, the Prime Minister of Lower Saxony has been under criticism for some time.
Miese poll ratings added.
Nevertheless, or perhaps precisely because of this, Weil has tried more and more in recent weeks to set accents in the covenant.
The former mayor of Hannover's ambition to expand his power in Berlin was not hidden from comrades in the vicinity of Martin Schulz.
They allowed him to be granted, as they promised to stabilize the party from Weil.
Now the exact opposite could happen.
In doing so, Weil is basically not to blame for the party internal strife of the Lower Saxony Greens.
And Schulz certainly not at all.
In the meantime, therefore, the comrades are trying to keep their own ranks closed.
Her anger is directed at the Greens, and here, above all, the breakaway parliamentarian Twesten.
"It is intolerable and damaging to democracy how Ms. Twesten places her own career interests above the interests of everyone else," says Matthias Miersch, head of party leftists in the SPD Bundestag faction, the editorial network Germany (RND).
Ms Twesten was elected to parliament not because of her person as a direct candidate, but via the Land list of the Lower Saxony Greens, the Lower Saxony MP continued.
The logical consequence would be for her to return her mandate.
Thomas Oppermann, head of the SPD's Bundestag faction, laments an "undemocratic maneuver."
"The voter will four years ago was clear: People made Stephan Weil prime minister," Oppermann, who leads the Lower Saxony SPD as the frontrunner in the federal election, tells the RND.
"Now the personal career memory of a future CDU MP is falsifying the election result," Oppermann went on to say.
He called for the backgrounds to be cleared up.
I want to know whether there has been more or whether there have been further commitments from the CDU of Lower Saxony.
Funding for the town centre III
Those who wish to renovate their old house will soon be able to receive support from the country.
Mayor Albert Schindler and three representatives informed Steg Urban Development in Senfingen on Wednesday.
At the beginning of the information event, Schindler gave another look back at what has happened so far.
Since 1991 there have been rehabilitation areas in Senfingen.
At that time, in the rehabilitation area I from 1991 to 2004, the state of Baden-Württemberg took over two thirds of the funding.
In the rehabilitation area II from 2005 to 2016, the grant was still 60 percent.
For Schindler, the previous renovations are a "success project" - after all, it is important to promote internal development, and not only to develop new construction areas.
On 4 April, the President of the Government of Karlsruhe received the information that there will be a rehabilitation area III.
The amount of funding was EUR 833 333, of which EUR 500 000 would come from the country, the rest from the municipality of Senfingen.
How does a redevelopment area develop?
One will, Schindler continued, investigate where the "really old" houses are.
It also plays a role, however, whether there is any interest in the planned area to be rehabilitated.
If necessary, the territorial boundaries could then be shifted again.
The Steg represented Martin Keller, Gaby Pietzschmann and Sarah Gotzel on Wednesday night.
Keller presented the contents of the federal and state program "Social City," in which the renovations would then be carried out.
The core of the programme is the revitalization of inner cities, the improvement of housing and working conditions and the maintenance and expansion of infrastructure.
The measures would be carried out object-related, i.e. per plot.
The redevelopment area would then eventually be established as a statute.
The grant period for the funding has been running until 30 April 2026 since 1 January 2017.
Until September this year, however, the inventory would be carried out, in which those involved in the rehabilitation area would receive a questionnaire to fill in.
In November or December, the statutes should be adopted as far as possible, so that the redevelopment can begin next year.
Pietzschmann subsequently explained that each commune had to carry out the said preliminary investigations.
It is a question of assessing urban problems and deciding when to remediate and to what extent.
A renovation note will then be entered in the land register for the respective property.
Pietzschmann, she promised, would come to his senses again and get a picture of the situation.
Gotzel stressed that a key success factor for the project was the participation of the participants.
Therefore, there will be questionnaires which will be sent to the citizens in the coming weeks and can be filled in by the end of the summer holidays.
The yellow questionnaire is the "building and land arc," which deals, among other things, with the structural condition and the renovation intentions.
In the grey questionnaire, the "household and housing arc," information on the size, division and residents of a living space can be provided.
The blue "operating sheet" is only to be filled out if business premises are operated in the building.
However, Gotzel pointed out that a completed questionnaire is not at the same time an application for funding.
In addition, new building measures were not eligible.
Schindler also stressed that the distribution of funding works according to the "greyhound principle" - whoever comes first, grinds first.
You can't "reserve" funding for later.
Finally, photos of the project "Ortskern II" were shown in order to make a renovation "tasty."
British inventor sets himself a microchip to get in house and car with a hand movement
A British inventor is the first in the country to be fitted with a microchip so he can open his front door, enter his office and even start his car with a hand movement.
Steven Northam, 33, had the tiny chip implanted between his thumb and forefinger and is now offering the service to businesses and individuals looking to simplify their lives with technology through his company BioTeq.
He has partnered with Dr Geoff Watson, a consultant anaesthesiologist at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester, Hants, to ensure the implant procedure is carried out to medical standard.
The technology resembles a cat and dog implanted microchip and lasts just 30 seconds.
Mr Northam's firm also wants to change the locks on homes and cars so that they are compatible with the chip, all for a surcharge of £300 per lock.
The married father-of-one has now fitted both at home and at his BMW Z4 technology, which starts when his hand is at the wheel.
White House ad costs taxpayer thousands
The White House's decision to fly a Navy helicopter to the South Lawn for an event highlighting American manufacturing last month costs taxpayers up to $24,000, according to the military, which was left to TIME magazine.
The green-and-white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One when the president is on board, was the centerpiece of the July 17 event at the White House with American construction programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and senior White House officials made a tour of products from all 50 states.
The Connecticut-made helicopter was displayed alongside a yacht from Maine, a fire truck from Wisconsin and a forklift truck from Mississippi.
The White House military office demanded the presence of the helicopter in a fragmentary order, or FRAGO, barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn, according to records obtained by the Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for operating the helicopter.
"I just wanted you to be aware of this because it is such an unusual event with high visibility," the commander of HMX-1 wrote to his superior, the deputy naval commander for aviation, on the eve of the event.
The news indicated that the helicopter arrived on the South Lawn for the event at 3pm on July 17 about 7am, and remained until the lawn was cleared between 6pm and 9pm that evening.
The note adds that if the departure from the White House were to be delayed, a second crew would be needed for the return flight due to the restriction on hours of service.
The original flight crew were at the helicopter during the event, while the unit's security personnel remained on the ground with the plane during the time.
It was not clear from the records provided to TIME whether a second flight crew was ultimately required.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using state property for political purposes.
Records indicate that HMX-1 asked if the event could violate the provision.
"One question we asked was whether it was a violation of the Hatch Act and we were informed that this was not the case," the commander wrote.
"Sounds as if you're locked up," the deputy commander replied.
The "Made in America" event was described by the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act.
But official events also have political overtones.
At the event, the president gave a push for health care reform underway in the Senate, and he touted efforts to curb government regulations.
The use of the aircraft, known as Marine One or Air Force One, for politically advantageous purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.
Presidents are required to use them for the trip.
But requesting their use only for a photo-op is unusual.
Trump led an investigation in February when the presidential plane provided taxi services against the backdrop of his first campaign rally in Melbourne, Florida, and his Twitter account is full of messages complaining about his predecessor's use of the presidential plane.
"The White House is excited about the" Made In America "show - which features products from all 50 states made by American workers using American materials," said White House deputy press secretary Lindsay Walters.
HMX-1 crews frequently conduct training flights in the area around Washington and the South Lawn to depose the US president at the White House with precise centimetres.
When Trump was in Germany at the G20 summit in early July, HMX-1 made 58 practice landings at the White House.
The flight for the "Made in America" event counted at the flight crew's training needs for the month, an official said.
Helicopter units flew an additional 11 hours that day for "non-presidential support missions."
The White House said taxpayers were not taking on the burden for any of the other props presented at the event.
A spokesman for Sikorsky said the company had not been involved in exhibiting the helicopter on the South Lawn.
HMX-1 does not maintain budget records for the presidential flights, and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event.
However, according to hourly rates from the US Department of Defense for fiscal year 2017, the DoD reimbursement rate for the VH-3D is $24,380 per flight hour.
Records from the unit record the plane's flight time as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Facility in Quantico in Virginia.
The White House argues that the actual cost of operating the helicopter is well below that rate.
"Setting the cost to taxpayers based on the estimates for reimbursement rates is highly misleading," Walters said.
"These estimates include staff, maintenance and many other hidden costs included in the annual funds."
According to a 2015 RAND study, reimbursement rates for DoD do not include staff costs, but take into account the cost of fuel, maintenance and contracting.
At the time, former White House press secretary Sean Spicer defended the use of the helicopter for the event.
"The idea is to present things this week that are made in America," Spicer said.
"And I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud that they contribute to our national security, and I assume that hundreds, if not thousands, of people depend on it.
And I think like most Americans, we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked tirelessly.
It's obviously appropriate to highlight that. "
It was not clear whether Trump interacted with the helicopter as he entered his tour of the South Lawn for the event, but he sat down in the driver's seat of a fire truck.
At the White House, Trump spoke to representatives of Sikorsky and joked with the media about his own fleet of company products.
"I know Sikorsky very well," the president said,"I have three of them."
TC BW Neuss facing tricky task
Top of the Second Tennis Bundesliga takes on Suchsdorfer SV.
The TC Blue-Weiss Neuss starts tomorrow from 11 o'clock in Kiel at the table race Suchsdorfer SV.
Despite still having a flawless record after five matches, the top scorer of the Second Tennis Bundesliga has retained a sense of reality.
Team captain Marius Zay has respect for the opponent, anyway.
"This is a compact team that always plays in quite similar formation.
Especially on the back positions I find the squad very good. "
Especially imports from the far north ensure class and stability at the Suchsdorfer SV.
"Their Danes and Finns can even point to stakes in the Davis Cup.
And they are also strong in the double,"says Zay, looking at Harri Heliovaara (Finland), Andre Göransson (Sweden), Sören and Esben Olesen, Martin Pedersen as well as Andreas Bjerrehus (all Denmark).
"That's going to be hard for us as always.
You also need a good dose of luck."
The Neuss team for the trip to the far north stands practically.
His debut for blue-and-white could give Maxime Janvier.
If the Frenchman currently active in the Challenger tournament in the Italian Biella does not make it to the Bundesliga match, Zdenek Kolar (Czech Republic), playing at the tournament in the Czech Liberec, will make his first assignment this season.
The previously undefeated Chilean Hans Podlipnik-Castillo was still on the ball yesterday with the Belarusian Andrei Vasilevski at the ATP tournament in Kitzbühel.
But he should be in Kiel as well as Botic Van de Zandschulp, Niels Lootsma (both Netherlands) and the Belgian Julien Cagnina.
Máté Valkusz could also return to the squad after his two victories last Sunday against the club at the Alster.
If it is not enough for the 18-year-old Hungary, who was still number one in the junior world rankings in January 2016, someone from the coaching staff around Marius Zay fills up the squad.
How America can hurt OMV
Really happy Donald Trump didn't look when he put his signature bill Wednesday night to tighten sanctions on Russia.
"In its haste to enact the law," Congress has wrapped up a few "unconstitutional regulations," he etched.
The response from Moscow was as sharp as expected, too, and even Brussels was foaming against the US push.
After all, the draft provides for punishing European companies that help the Russians build gas pipelines into the EU.
Investors in the domestic OMV, which, together with other European companies, is co-financing the construction of the Russian Baltic Sea pipeline Nord Stream 2, have since been alarmed.
The threat backdrop is massive.
Nevertheless, it is too early to estimate the consequences, according to the oil company's official statement.
In fact, Donald Trump himself would still have to bring the sanctions to life by executive order.
Twelve weapons are available to him.
"The press" has looked at which the corporation could fend off and which could really hurt it.
Narco's Season 3 trailer: Without Pablo Escobar, the Cali Cartel will take centre stage in Netflix's hit series
Despite the second season of narcos revealing Pablo Escobar's killer, the Netflix series is far from over.
Seasons three and four have already been confirmed by the streaming service, the first receiving its first trailer and showing off the show's latest villains.
With season three, the DEA has turned its attention to the richest drug trafficking organization in the world: The Cali cartel.
Led by four powerful godfathers, they operate "like a Fortune 500 company" only with more government bribery and violent actions.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) is the leader of the cartel, Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) is her head, Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) commands the Mexican compound, and Chepe Santacruz Londono (Pepe Rapazote) is in New York.
In the newly released trailer, Pedro Pascal returns as Javier Peña, the type who invites American and Colombian law enforcement agencies to support the war on drugs.
Other new actors include Matias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishe and Arturo Castro.
The third season of narcos will begin on September 1.
Role backwards: City hires 46 kitchen aids
The city organizes the Kita lunch table itself.
With fixed contact persons for the children and an assignment to the team.
In the urban nurseries, the clock is turned back.
On 1 September, the city of Krefeld will again take over the food supply in the municipal daycare facilities (Kitas) on its own.
For Sonja Pommeranz, Deputy Head of Youth Aid, this is good news: "We were all very pleased."
Cooked outside the house: A caterer takes on this task and delivers freshly cooked chilled.
The city operates 46 nurseries in the Krefeld area, in 44 the children get a hot meal at lunchtime.
Last year, 2800 children each sat at the tables, and the need is growing steadily.
"Meanwhile, not only children who are cared for 45 hours a week eat lunch at the Kita," explains Pommeranz.
"The offer also applies in 35-hour care if children stay until 2pm."
46 part-time workers have kitchen service from September 1: They heat up the food delivered, add salad, raw food and fruit, portioning the meal individually, handing out the food, clearing, rinsing and cleaning the kitchen.
"The employees are firmly assigned to a kita," says Pommeranz.
The size - there are two-group as well as seven-group facilities - decides the hourly range.
"The kitchen assistants are now firmly part of the Kita team," says Pommeranz satisfied.
"They are much more involved and it is easier for the hospital management to implement pedagogical concepts."
Because that's also what it's all about: Healthy eating and cooking lessons.
"The kids are supposed to help prepare the food."
The direct connection of the kitchen power to the team makes sense.
Also for the children.
"They have a known force in the Kita, a person familiar to them, and not constantly changing people."
This continuity is important for the children.
The cleaning of the kita rooms - previously also the task of the kitchen staff - will in future be carried out by special cleaning staff.
This variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - has, in addition to improving the quality of kitchen performance, the charm that it has turned out to be the most economical for the city in the cost comparison between self-management and outsourcing, according to the press office.
And that's despite 46 part-time workers being rehired.
"But these hours don't really weigh that much at all in the area of education for around 750 people," says Sonja Pommeranz.
Afghan democracy depends on women's political role, UN says
Elections can only be representative if all members of society, including women, play a role, the head of the UN mission in Afghanistan said on Wednesday.
Nicholas Haysom, acting head of the United Nations mission, said hundreds of women will stand in council elections in the provinces, with three women running for the role of vice president and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women.
"The role of women cannot be overestimated," he said in a statement on Wednesday.
Elections can only be truly representative and credible if women participate fully and are involved in all parts of the electoral process.
Afghan elections for the provincial council and presidential elections take place on April 5.
The Taliban have issued threats against an election process that coincide with the transition from international combat operations to an advisory role.
This year, for the first time, the elections will hand over power peacefully from one democratically elected government to the next.
Haysom said a strong role for women will add to Afghanistan's democratic success.
The Afghan Independent Electoral Commission reports that 1.2 million women out of a total of 3.6 million registered voters are registered.

Men try to rob 13-year-old girl
Two young men, aged 19 and 23, allegedly tried to rob a 13-year-old girl on Thursday.
According to police information, the men approached the 13-year-old, who was staying with friends on Kolping Road, about 2.55pm because they wanted to make phone calls with the girl's mobile phone.
However, the 13-year-old declined the request and went on with her friends.
As a result, one of the perpetrators tried to grab the girl's mobile phone and necklace, but this failed.
Without prey, the duo escaped.
The two young men were later able to be detained by police.
The investigation is ongoing.
GMB concern over investment at McVitie factory in Glasgow
A union wants to reassure managers at biscuit maker McVitie about the long-term commitment to production at its plant in Glasgow.
GMB Scotland said the company had remained silent about the future of investment at the Tollcross site.
More than 500 employees work at the plant, which makes Hobnobs and Rich Tea biscuits alongside other products.
McVities owner Pladis said he had invested more than £5million in recent years.
He added that staff and union representatives would be "the first to find out" if their activities changed.
In a letter to the company's branch manager, GMB Scotland urged McVitie's to "raise concerns that funding for the modernisation of production lines will not be pushed forward."
GMB senior organiser Drew Duffy, said: "The fact that we cannot gain clarity from the general site manager about the business needs and investment plans for the future of Tollcross deeply affects our members.
Generations of families have worked here and the workforce is heavily focused on the local community and the Greater Glasgow area, an important pillar of decent employment in an area of high unemployment and social disadvantage.
Therefore, under the perspective of jobs, pay and prosperity, and against the backdrop of Brexit, the rising cost of living and the chronic decline in production, the eastern end of Glasgow urgently needs a thriving production presence at McVitie."
A spokeswoman for Pladis said: "The branch manager at Tollcross only received a letter from GMB Scotland yesterday and the company will respond directly to this as we appreciate the continued engagement with staff and union representatives.
We had a regular meeting with staff and GMB representatives at Tollcross two months ago, where some issues were discussed openly.
We discussed with employees that, like all companies operating in a highly competitive and uncertain economic climate, we continually review our operations - and this applies to all our divisions and locations - to remain competitive.
She added: "In recent years we have invested more than £5 million in our Tollcross site, particularly in production lines and operational improvements.
We fully recognise the legacy of Tollcross as a manufacturing site. Should our operations change at the site, employees and their union representatives will be the first to know."
Did PSG warn Barcelona about Neymar three years ago?
The La Liga side may regret their interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain will not let up in their pursuit of Neymar after making an offer of £189 million to trigger his release clause, but did they warn Barcelona three years ago of the world record attack?
The sensational approach has fuelled the transfer window in the summer, with the Ligue 1 club poised to break the world record by more than double the previous mark, with Paul Pogba returning to Manchester United for £89 million last season.
After finishing, Neymar will become the most expensive player in the world and the highest-paid professional athlete in the world, with PSG offering wages of more than £500,000 a week.
Barcelona are furious at the way Neymar has forced his way out, although a source close to the Catalan board insists the club has always been at their best to look after him since his arrival from Santos in 2013.
But was the football world warned about this prospect by the PSG president three years ago?
When Manchester City expressed interest in signing Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi had a stern warning for any club that wanted to have one of PSG's best players signed.
"I'm not worried because they know that if they touch any of our players, then we will be in opposition to them, we will contact their players," Al-Khelaifi said.
"We respect all the clubs.
But if they try to have one of our players sign with them, that's going to have consequences. "
Barcelona appear to have crossed that line, with the Spanish club expressing interest in PSG midfielder Marco Verratti earlier this summer.
PSG made it clear they would not allow the international from Italy to leave under any circumstances and Barcelona could feel the consequences of that interest by losing one of their price offers for Neymar.
Scooters overturned and damaged
On the night of Friday to Saturday, an unknown offender deliberately flipped a scooter parked in Königsfelder Street outside the Number 30 property, causing more than €200 in property damage to the vehicle's cladding.
Police Schramberg, phone 07422 / 27 01-0, are appealing for clues.
Police are looking for witnesses to an accident on the B 215 between Stolzenau and Leese.
Because a car was coming towards him in his lane, the driver of a VW Touran had to dodge, touching the guardrail in the process.
On Thursday evening, the 34-year-old from Rehburg-Loccum was travelling on the B 215 from Stolzenau in the direction of Leese with his VW about 7.55pm.
In the area of the bypass of Stolzenau, a car came towards him in his lane, so he had to dodge to the right.
The Touran driver touched the control panel.
Material damage was caused to the car.
The driver of the oncoming car, a Mercedes Benz, had overtaken a truck and continued his journey without taking care of the road accident.
It may well be, according to the accident victim, that the Mercedes driver had not even noticed the accident.
Police are now asking witnesses to the incident, as well as the driver of the polluter vehicle, to contact the commissioner's office in Stolzenau on tel. 05761 / 92060.
Interview: "Domspatzen report relieves Pope's brother Georg Ratzinger"
The Regensburg Domspatzen report on the abuse cases relieves Pope brother Georg Ratzinger.
This is what author and historian Michael Hesemann thinks.
The final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen continues to give rise to discussions.
Christian Weisnder, spokesman for the reform movement "We are Church," said after publication to the German Press Agency that he expected an apology from the former Regensburg Bishop and today's Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller, as well as from the Cathedral Chapel Master Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of the emeritus Pope Benedict XVI.
It would serve the prestige of the Catholic Church very much if Müller and Ratzinger expressed their deep regret at their own omissions or their then false assessment of the events.
The Vatican newspaper "Osservatore Romano," on the other hand, criticized the use of "double standards" in the reporting of violence in the cathedral patrons.
Regarding the attacks in Regensburg, no one doubts that they are "disgraceful and shameful acts" that must be punished and prevented in the future; but the "degree of media manipulation," according to the author Lucetta Scaraffia, a historian and member of the Italian national bioethics committee, is striking.
"The habit of referring to the Catholic Church as the source of all evil is already part of everyday experience and prepares public opinion to think that is normal," Scaraffia writes.
Also Princess Gloria von Thurn and Taxis said in the interview with the Bavarian Radio: "You like to go to the church and this is a found food."
She also pointed out that in her youth,"beatings had been a perfectly normal educational means" to cope with cheeky children, like I was one."
They would find it unfair to apply today's standards to previous decades, because the world has changed.
Pope brother Georg Ratzinger also often appeared in connection with the reports of the abuse cases.
Author and historian Michael Hesemann, who wrote the book "My Brother the Pope" with Ratzinger (translated into 12 languages), is quite wrong.
"I have to protect Georg Ratzinger," says Hesemann,"because all this had nothing to do with him," he evaluates the results of the final report.
What exactly is in the 440-page report presented by the lawyer Ulrich Weber, who was commissioned by the Diocese of Regensburg with the Enlightenment?
A total of 547 Regensburger Domspatzen were victims of assault "with high plausibility" between 1945 and the early 1990s, and 67 Domspatzen were sexually abused.
The final report on Georg Ratzinger, who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994, states: "In summary, it can therefore be stated that in many cases forms of physical and psychological violence have been used by Domkapellmeister R.
Especially with high emotionality, the punishment for the students could also be more severe.
Still, unlike numerous other defendants, it is striking that many victims appreciated R."s general humanity and therefore in numerous cases, despite violence, even associate positive memories with him."
In the interview Hesemann explains why in his opinion the final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen relieves Georg Ratzinger.
Mr Hesemann, the 440-page report on the "incidents of violence against protection officers at the Regensburger Domspatzen" gives a contradictory picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger.
For one thing, many students highlight his "humanity."
On the other hand, he also appears as a choleric and perfectionist, who often became palpable when a Domspatz musically brought no top performance.
How do you, as his biographer, view this final report?
Michael Hesemann: If you take the trouble and read the whole 440-page report from front to back, you have to ask yourself why the name Georg Ratzinger appears in it at all.
There are just eight pages devoted to him and he is clearly cleared of any suspicion of complicity or complicity in the horrific cases of sexual abuse.
The violence excesses at preschool also occurred outside its sphere of impact.
At best, he can be accused of learning about it too late or of not taking initial hints seriously enough.
The Domspatzengymnasium, on which he worked, was perceived by virtually all respondents as - so literally - "redemption," "heaven" and "better world."
Thus, the vast majority of his students Georg Ratzinger presents a very excellent testimony, describing him as "warm-hearted," "popular," "sincere," "competent" and "understanding," as an extremely good-natured teacher who regularly supplied the boys with cakes, biscuits and candy and was "always surrounded by grapes from children."
Only a minority complains about his perfectionism and his high emotionality, which also led to outbursts of anger.
He himself admitted years ago, deeply regretted and apologized for not only cracking chairs and throwing the keyring on the floor, but also distributing slaps and pulling overly cheeky boys by the hair or ears.
To save his honour, however, it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the period in question, the 1960s and 1970s, among parents as well as teachers.
Do you still know such breeding methods?
Of course, I think every one of us who was born before 1968.
I, too, have still experienced this in a secular school, a state high school.
Compared with what this report is actually about, namely the appalling sexual abuse and violence at preschool, these are, of course, trivial matters.
One wonders whether it is not more to do with his notoriety and his role as the brother of Benedict XVI that many media just rushed to him.
Many who have never understood him are still working diligently on the Bavarian Pope.
But the truth is: The report relieves Georg Ratzinger in every respect!
A great deal has been reported in the media in connection with the report on the subject of abuse at the Regensburger Domspatzen (Regensburger Domspatzen).
Is Georg Ratzinger also accused in the final report of any involvement or complicity with regard to sexual abuse?
Michael Hesemann: Clearly no.
Not a single one of the 67 victims of sexual assault claims to have entrusted themselves to the cathedral chapel master.
Not even the parents were inaugurated.
"I never dared to talk to my father or my mother about it," said one concerned deputising for the others,"It was all very embarrassing to me, after all."
The real problem with educating sexual abuse was, and still is, that most victims remain silent out of shame.
If they did not even entrust themselves to parents and siblings, then certainly not to a choir leader, who would have been a colleague of the perpetrators in a professional sense.
How do the Domspatzen students rate Ratzinger's role with regard to the abuse cases?
Michael Hesemann: A student interviewed put it this way: "Regarding sexual abuse... I see... no case in which he (Georg Ratzinger) of all people would have had timely findings and could have stopped the respective perpetrator.
I think it is... also really absurd to assume that it is precisely him... boys have opened up more forcefully or more clearly or rather than to their parents, boarding school leaders, trust teachers, etc.
That you talk to him about sex... - unthinkable. "
So the report comes to the very clear conclusion: "That pupils affected and / or their environment were entrusted to him beforehand could not be confirmed as part of the investigation."
As far as sexual abuse is concerned, Georg Ratzinger must therefore be acquitted of any complicity.
Nor can he be accused of failing to prevent or display him.
Therefore, there is also no reason to associate his good name with these sickening crimes, as unfortunately happened in some cases.
In the media there was a lot of "violent excesses" at the Regensburger Domspatzen.
The former cathedral bandmaster Georg Ratzinger is accused in the report "Wegschauen."
Does he have to live with this accusation?
Michael Hesemann: This is the big problem that in the reporting everything was mixed and mixed into a huge melange of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere, right in the middle of it, Georg Ratzinger.
But that, in turn, is an abuse of the report.
There is a clean separation: Between the preschool and the grammar school of the Domspatzen, between sexual abuse and violence and, let us say, other allegations.
In addition, the report deals with incidents from the time since 1945, also from four decades in which Georg Ratzinger was not the choir leader of the Domspatzen.
The whole terrible beating pedagogy, the cases in which boys were literally harassed and maltreated by sadistic teachers and suffered horribly, all took place at the preschool in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where truly scandalous conditions must have prevailed.
But Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do with them, because he only got to see the boys when they were already at the Domspatzengymnasium.
On which, as most witnesses point out, the subject of "preschool" was taboo.
One was just happy to have escaped her and enjoyed so much better treatment and for many even "paradisiacal" conditions.
What was different at the Domspatzengymnasium?
Michael Hesemann: There was discipline, but no sadistic violence.
And this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, in which the report concludes that "many victims appreciated the general humanity of R. and therefore in numerous cases, despite violence, even associate positive memories with him."
At most, the accusation of looking away remains.
But despite all the efforts, the report was only able to define two periods in which it was told of the conditions at preschool.
The first time in 1970 / 71, when he just started to establish himself and did not want to hear about the events at a school where he did not work and was responsible (according to the witness), and then again around 1993.
Did Georg Ratzinger consistently close his ears to the conditions?
Michael Hesemann: No, because already in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Domspatzengymnasium, which the report even reproduces.
In it, he points out to them "that caning continues to be practiced in preschool."
Even in the face of the threat of negative press releases, he recommended urgent intervention.
That was, of course, at a time when there was legal clarity, when caning had long since been banned in Bavaria, too.
Before that, they occurred in a legal grey area, as any of us probably still know.
It was also difficult for him to assess where those affected may have been exaggerated or dramatized and where the permissible limit had really been exceeded.
But you also can't say he always looked away.
That is simply not true.
It was only in 1980 that caning at schools was officially abolished in Bavaria, too.
Princess Gloria of Thurn and Taxis claimed that it was unfair to apply today's educational standards to the time.
How do you see that?
Michael Hesemann: We historians talk about the "pitfall of anachronism," that is, the danger of evaluating the past according to today's moral standards.
The princess is right.
But this, of course, does not apply to sexual abuse, which was abhorrent at all times, nor to what was perpetrated in preschool in terms of inconsistencies and violence against innocent children's souls, which goes far beyond what was then customary.
That's all quite horrible and I'm glad it's finally being worked up.
But at the same time I have to protect Georg Ratzinger, because all this had nothing to do with him.
His means of discipline and punishment, i.e. slapping his ears and pulling his hair and ears, were widespread in the 1970s.
When corporal punishment was then banned, he also strictly adhered to it.
What image of his time in Regensburg has Georg Ratzinger reproduced in the conversations with you for the book "My brother the Pope"?
Did the subject of caning also come up?
Michael Hesemann: Well, the book is about the life of his brother Joseph, Pope Benedict XVI, tells from his perspective that the Domspatzen played only a minor role.
Nevertheless, I do not conceal the fact that he led a strict regiment there.
But this also has to be said: Without this perfectionism, without demanding unconditional discipline, it would hardly have been possible for him to form a world-class institution out of the until then more nationally known Regensburger Domspatzen, true cultural ambassadors of Europe and its musical tradition, which went on tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).
With biscuits and candy alone, you don't turn recalcitrant boys into great singers and face every success, no matter what field, but always discipline, passion and self-overcoming.
What kind of person did you experience Georg Ratzinger talking about her book?
Michael Hesemann: By working on the book and beyond, I really got to know Georg Ratzinger very well and experienced him again and again as a wonderful, humorous, basic kind, deeply believing and heartfelt person, of whom one cannot imagine that he could even do something to a fly.
I regularly get to know how many former Domspatzen still today, 23 years after his retirement, keep regular contact with him, visit him, read to him - he is almost blind - and treat him like a member of their family.
So those who do not forgive him to this day that he was once strict with them are clearly in the minority.
Most of the Domspatzen are grateful to him today for enriching their lives and bringing the world of music to them.
And that he was always a good, fatherly teacher - a strict father, certainly, that may be - but also an adorable respect person, to whom they still look up today and whom they almost worship.
And please, again very clearly: All he is accused of are educational methods that were commonplace at the time.
We can be glad that we have overcome this time long ago.
But it is highly unfair to make a man, just because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother, a media scapegoat.
The evil intention behind it is all too obvious.
Because the report that has just been published relieves it.
Now the decency would command to finally leave in peace a 93-year-old man who has earned great merits and without whom no one outside Bavaria and perhaps even Germany would know the Regensburger Domspatzen.
