Munich 1856: Four cards that change your view of the city
An insane institution where young people are to meet today.
A graft chapel where now is dug for the S-Bahn tunnel.
Small-scale gardeners manage the former reason of farmers.
The oldest official map of Munich promotes exciting stories.
It's annoying when maps aren't up-to-date.
Everyone knows that, because the car-Navi, instead of a bypass, displayed a green meadow.
The historical maps of the digital Bayern Atlas, an offer of the Geoportals Bayern of the State Government, are far from topical - but it is precisely why it is very revealing.
Especially if you compare them with current online cards.
Then it becomes clear how cities and municipalities have changed in the distribution area of the Munich Merkur since the 19th century.
The digital Bayern Atlas is a patchwork that cannot be recognized as such.
In the big overview map, more detailed maps, so-called urposition blades, were incorporated into cities and communities.
This was created according to the Bayerische surveying administration between 1810 and 1864 and the first exhibition of Bavaria.
Your client: Napoleon.
The French army leader occupied Bavaria since spring 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria.
Napoleon wished for an overview of the occupied land and commissioned a topographic recording of Bavaria - of course for military purposes.
Even if the French troops finally withdrew with the peace of Lunéville on February 9, 1801: It was today's neighbours who created the idea of a blanket Bayern map.
Kurfürst Max IV Joseph drove the project further, founded the "topographical Bureau" - and thus the Bavarian surveying administration.
The Urpositionsplatz for Munich dates back to 1856 and is to be found on the website of the Bayerische Landesbibliothek.
The comparison of Early / Today is the most impressive example of the state capital.
The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.
An example of this is undersling, which appears relatively isolated in the map of 1856.
Sendling was captured 21 years after the creation of the map, i.e. 1877, as a Munich district.
Today, Untersendling is located in the middle of the city.
The houses of Untersendlings are concentrated around 1856 along today's Plinganserstraße, named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser in 1878, a leader of the Bavarian farmers' uprising against Austria in 1705.
Where the Westpark is today, there is nothing to be seen as a field - at first glance: In the zoom, a smaller map with dozens of lines and numbers: Handwritten ducts from the so-called "great-recording" from which the basic tax was derived.
Small parcels do not show farmers there today - but small gardeners of the plant "land in sun."
A large green area is characterized north of undersling.
The Theresienwiese, since 1810 the site of the Oktoberfest, was in fact still a meadow in the 19th century - and no concrete desert.
On the other side of the Isar, the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.
In the area of the present district, Au-Haidhausen is not only reading the street name "am Gasteig" or "On the Lüften" - but also in large letters "lunatic Anstalt."
Yes, here at Auerfeldstraße, people were once locked up with delusions.
In 1858 / 59 the Munich Rundanstalt "On the Auer Lüften" was created.
In 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden led the establishment - the psychiatrist brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II.
"He was progressive for his time and finished, for example, the ankle of so-called irons.
He also prohibited the staff from using violence against the inmates, "says Hermann Wilhelm, head of the Museum of Haider, who has been working for an exhibition with the institution.
For 280 patients, there was first place, and later was extended to 500 places.
At some point, this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the County Department in Haar 1905.
Since 2006, the Isar-Amper-Klinikum München-Ost, one of Germany's largest psychiatry, is located.
In the area of the former Auer Anstalt, young people are now meeting in Munich's Salesianum.
The Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and transformed it into a youth home with training facilities.
West lies the football pitch of the TSV München East, east of the residential houses of the 1980s.
In 2015, the children's house "Casa Don Bosco" was built - in architectural reference to the original building of the lunar institution, which had been destroyed in the Second World War in bomb attacks.
In 1856 the Marienplatz was listed as "the main square," the Kaufingerstraße was called "Kaufinger Gasse."
The Second World War also brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich.
The Allies' bombs tore many holes into the city centre in December 1944.
A big thing remained until today - at Marienhof.
The English Institute, small business houses and a medieval chapel from the Middle Ages were once at the Marienhof, where these days the preparatory work and April 5, 2017, will take place for the second S-Bahn regular route.
With the slider, the old Munich card can be compared with the aerial view of today - and filling the hole at the Marienhof.
Civil rights group releases travel warning for Missouri
The National Association to promote ferns has issued a warning for colored people who travel to Missouri because of discriminatory policies and racist attacks from the state.
"The NAACP Travel Advisory for the state of Missouri, which is due to enter into force by August 28, 2017, calls on Afro-American travelers, visitors and Missourian people to devote special attention to traveling through the state and exercise extreme caution as a number of questionable, race-based incidents occur recently throughout the state and will be noted here," the group's opinion said.
A recent Missouri law that makes it harder for people to win discrimination lawsuits, as well as the state's law enforcement agencies, which are disproportionately targeted at minorities, prompted the group to release the travel warning, the NAACP said.
"They have violations of civil rights that happen to people.
They are stopped because of their skin colour, they are beaten or killed, "said the president of the Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, the Kansas City Star.
"We hear complaints in such frequency that we haven't heard yet."
It is the first such warning the organization has issued for a state in the U.S.
The group cited incidents such as racist offences against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died in questionable circumstances earlier this year after he had no more petrol during the trip through the state and was taken into custody by Missouri police without being accused of a crime.
The council also points to a recent report by the Office of the Missouri Attorney General, which shows that black motorists in the state are 75 percent more likely to be stopped as whites.
"The recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families, friends and staff about what could happen in Missouri," Chapel said.
"People need to be ready whether to bring bail or let the relatives know they travel through the state."
Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest figures from the FBI's hate crime report, which rank the state in terms of the number of such injuries to the country's 16th rank.
The travel warning is also a response to a new Missouri law that would make it harder to sue a company for housing or employment discrimination.
Previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after states passed immigration laws requiring local law enforcement agencies to arrest people for immigration violations, which, according to the ACLU, will contribute to further racial profiling.
Travel warnings are usually issued by the State Department for other countries, but lately interest groups have used the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the US.
Weidenfence project is elemental
The Fischerbacher Weidenfence project is a success project and will continue next year.
The CDU members of parliament, Peter White and Kordula Kovac, have given themselves a picture on the ground.
At the Schwendemann family house, representatives of the Fischerbacher CDU local association met with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two Members.
Markus Schwendemann initially provided insights into his operation in which he managed 55 acres of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, supplied 40 dairy cows and as many young animals and housed holiday guests in five apartments.
The "Black Forest milk" is for him the alternative marketing route for the milk of his cows, according to Schwendemann.
On the table of holiday guests comes exclusively regional.
Since he is also BLHV chairman of Fischerbach, he described the grazing project as "fundamental."
I cannot profit from profitable economies on such steep land.
The greenland area provides a lot of work, and many things have to be done with the motor sensor.
"We are struggling here with the conditions and with the topography," Schwendemann pointed out.
In 2003, he took over the parental operations and managed this without chemical plant protection and fertilizer, even if he did not run a bio-operation.
For Mayor Thomas Schneider, it was clear: "The local authority has recognized the importance of the grazing project and is pleased with the lead support."
Farmers should be supported at the cost of EUR 3000 to 4000 per hectare.
It is hoped that the reforestation of the land could be dragged out for a while.
"The greatest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and think about how they continue to bring their operations," the mayor stressed.
Farmers are often in criticism because of promotion
Over the grazing land promotion, a total of 25 parcels of 11 contestants were fenced in in 2013.
The surface area is 40 hectares, which must not be reforested until at least 2023.
Of the total cost of 71 500 euros, half was promoted through Leaders, a quarter carried by the municipality of Fischerbach.
Thus, farmers left 12 610 euros, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometers of pasture.
"The big advantage is the longevity of fences," Schwendemann explained.
Kordula Kovac stressed: "You do a really good job, without farmers and rural women it doesn't."
Also for Peter White was firm: "Here's best food produced."
The Landscape Care Directive (LPR) Baden-Württemberg allows the state promotion of pasture fences.
The aim is to keep the Black Forest open.
The prerequisite is the existence of a support scenery called by the LPR.
In addition, the encrusted area must not be a drag on a drag (over 35%) and must therefore be threatened by reforestation.
For the Fischerbacher Weidefence project in 2018, the application of eight participants with 24 plots, which would like to build just under 16 kilometers of fence, is currently under way.
The open-air space is equivalent to 35 hectares, and the calculated costs are more than EUR 112 000.
Is nothing more sacred?
Now, the White House of trump is taking the Statue of Liberty
The safest sign of a regime change is when they start attacking the statues.
Americans value these as well as anyone else - hence the carefully staged fall of Saddam Hussein on the Firdos Square in Baghdad in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologues of the trump regime, certainly knew what he was doing when he took a symbolic axe in a heated dispute with Jim Acosta of CNN about the president's proposals to drastically restrict legal immigration with the Statue of Liberty.
To remain fair, Miller did not attack the statue itself.
A horde of boat owners and Liberty-imitators would have spotted him if he had done it.
But he attacked their meaning, and in particular the importance attributed to her when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus in 1903, 17 years after completion of the monument, was added to his base.
As Miller Acosta complained: "I don't want to go into a complete thing about history here, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the world.
The poem you refer to, which was later added and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty. "
Miller is factually correct, but as he put it himself, it's not really about history.
It is about the contemporary resonance of Lazarus's shaking words, the only ones in which a state invites not only any old immigrant, but the poorest of the poor: "Your tired, your arms, / your afflicted masses who yearn to breathe freely, / the miserable waste of your rich coasts."
There was never a time when the "miserable waste" was better to see on our screens.
Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people are not welcome in trump's USA.
This conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural battle: It is indeed a conflict over the importance of America.
Lazarus - and her friends who campaigned to place her words at the base after her death - knew very well that she was doing a high-political act.
The sculpture should show the links between French and American Republicanism by portraying the female embodiment of freedom in an worn-out classical pictorial representation.
Lazarus changed that meaning: In her poem, the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice.
And she gives himself a very different name: Mother of the exiles.
Linking the poem with the picture is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American nativism.
And just as Lazarus changed the importance of the statue, people from the right wing wanted to change it for a long time.
The big scream Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of trump, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty was not inviting anyone, but rather an early neoconservative, bringing the American flame to the revamped world: "Lady Liberty is advancing.
It is to carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
The torch is not supposed to light the way to the United States. "
Quite unusually, Limbaugh has come up here on something.
The importance of the statue is entirely a matter of perception of perception.
Lazarus' big imaginative act was to see her as she was seen by the exhausted, miserable but hopeful people after long and often terrible journeys on the decks of ships.
It literally goes to see the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives.
Her statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome they need to hear.
And that, of course, is not the perspective that Miller and trump would ever like to acknowledge.
Their torch is not supposed to illuminate the way but ignite the hatred that is its only source of power.
World Cup 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish members of the UK team
Eilidh Doyle remembers a time when only two Scots were part of the UK team
The performance director of the UK Athletics Association, Neil Black, says the 16-member Scottish contingent in the World Cup will "make a massive contribution to the team."
A record number of Scottish athletes have been selected for London 2017, which kicks off on Friday.
Black believes that "in Scotland something special is developing" and the UK's athletics needs to learn something from it.
"We welcome it and we are trying to understand it and we will continue until we find it out," Black said.
"I talk to people at the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think there is something to do with what they have done.
The Scottish athletes think there is something to do with what they have done.
British athletics: It has something to do with what they have done.
And also with the type on the street corner.
Whatever the combination of the circumstances, it's absolutely brilliant. "
Several of the Scottish athletes are medal contenders, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m track while Eilidh Doyle has been elected team captain by the team.
"Eilidh is pretty modest.
Her captain's speech was incredible, "says Black.
"A number of athletes, no matter whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train, went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated.
The passion and the real feeling that Eilidh did, of course, were great. "
The Commonwealth silver medal winner, who will compete at the 400-m hurdles at her fifth world championships, says it is "unbelievable" that 16 Scots are in the British team.
Scotland's best overall number of athletes at the World Cup was seven, reached in 1983 and 2015.
The medium-haul runner Muir is leading this way and has set five British and two European records last year.
It will take part in the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m runs.
Chris O'Hare, who runs 1,500 m, is another Scot to watch after a great season that included victory at the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games.
Doyle remembers her first world championships when the only other Scot in the team was Lee McConnell.
The team's captain says she is "hugely proud" of the fact that many of her compatriots are not only part of the team but, in some cases, will also be coached at the medals and at the finals.
"The special thing about being team captains is that it was chosen by the other members of the team so it was a great honour anyway, but to know that my teammates voted for me and chose me, it makes it something very special for me," she added.
"Obviously, I'm very proud of all the Scots who belong to the team.
It just shows how far we have come.
And they are here as established athletes, athletes who want to rise to Poden.
As for my speech as a captain?
Yes, I think she went well.
I just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship.
So it's really important to put on this home support and benefit from being back at the Olympic Stadium.
I get a second chance to go out there and compete and it's just going to be such a great atmosphere out there. "
Block critics over Facebook: Bewewb not to be a public office if you can't contract the reheating of voters
The father of our country knew something about bad press.
Americans loved George Washington, but it didn't take long for the newspapers to beat him because of everything, from domestic politics to his political principles.
He laughed at the criticism, sure.
But he did not silence his critics.
Because in 1783, Washington said: "Freedom of speech can be taken away - and, stupid and dumb, we will run like the sheep to slaughter."
That brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan, who has to work to be more like Washington.
Hogan's staff have blocked and deleted the posts of at least 450 people who expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page.
And the American Civil Liberties Union, therefore, sued him earlier this week.
The governor's staff sacked the lawsuit as frivolous, and the online commentary was full of a backlash with "Na, and?."
"It's just Facebook," many people said.
But it's important.
And it's especially important when it's a guy like Hogan.
This is a Republican governor in an overwhelmingly Democratic state that is surprisingly popular.
He has the second highest approval of the nation's 50 governors.
Hogan is not a reactionary heat head.
He has shown a firm hand in guiding his state and strict adherence to the principles.
He was also very adept at using Facebook as a primary means to connect with his constituents and play off his hairy head after chemotherapy on his side.
Hence the blocking of people coming to the side of the governor - which is a public forum known as official and of staff paid with public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan's spokeswoman, Amelia Chasse, defended the governor's actions, arguing that blocking the comments was nothing further than moderation.
But it's too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hate-filled people who swing the whip online.
The Post spoke to some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.
And these are just real people talking to their elected leaders: A teacher, an entrepreneur and a pastor, no trolls.
They all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful rather than profane.
The pastor cited the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogan's Catholic faith.
Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., was not hate-filled, but she asked for hate crimes.
"I commented politely that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other current news," she wrote in the commentary section of the news broadcast "The Post."
"I also do not appreciate this idea when a number of people take a position on the same subject, then they are treated by some more as a so-called collective use and not recognised as a large group of affected citizens."
What the governor's staff described as a "concentrated spam attack" would likely call others "intercession."
The Facebook era makes it easy to tailor a message by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment.
It's much cleaner than in the past, if you had done the same thing that staff were dispatched to collect and burn newspapers with critical editorials or arrest and silence protesters.
But that's exactly what happens just digital.
Hogan is not the first public official to be criticized for assaulting Facebook and other social media.
President trump is being sued by Twitter users who were blocked from his Twitter feed.
One of the first milestones in this issue fell last week in Virginia.
The chairman of the Loudoun County Board of Supervisors violated the First Amendment, according to U.S. District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria when she banned a voter from her Facebook page.
And in Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit from the ACLU because of his use of Facebook and Twitter.
That shouldn't be so hard.
At the time of Washington, the time of affordable Portos had a similar effect as the Internet.
The number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letterwriters struck out his leadership.
And even then, Washington had anonymous trolls.
The people who used pseudonyms such as "YuriCola," "Valerius," "Belisarius" and "Portius," wrote all letters to newspapers that turned down Washington's decisions.
Petitions, which criticized his position on the contract of Amity, trade and shipping with Britain, overwhelmed his office, according to the historical documents collected by the George Washington Project's online Papers.
But he did not silence them.
Freedom of speech, disagreement and discourses are the basis of our nation.
And true leadership means accepting that.
Ronan Rafferty hopes home comforts at Renaissance Club
Former European No. 1 Ronan Rafferty will be hoping for domestic comfort over the next three days as the Renaissance Club in East Lothian hosts the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open.
The Nordire, who led next year in Archerfield links to the final round before losing to Paul Eales, is linked to the new venue and acts as a tournament ambassador on behalf of the club's founder and CEOs Jerry Sarvadi.
"I saw how the Renaissance Club was built, and we see how he achieved his fame with this event," Rafferty said.
"The players will see this course from his best side, he's in a great condition.
Jerry did a terrific job when he established that place.
He's a keen supporter of this game and is proud of his performance here.
This is a great showcase for this course. "
Englishman Eales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time despite winning in his 32-year career at both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour.
"This really feels special," said the player resident in Southport.
"I haven't been able to defend the Extremadura Open since it was taken out of the program in the year after I won it.
Coming back to that part of the world is magical.
It's a wonderful place to play golf.
Last year's memories come back and it was something special for me and my wife, Sharon, to win here last year.
It was a really special time and one we always appreciate. "
Gary Orr, who came to the European Senior Tour after his 50th birthday earlier this year, returns to the action on home soil.
This event will be its first Scottish appearance since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
"It always means a little bit more when you play at home," said Orr, the man from Helensczyk.
"You want to do it well, but you also splash this extra pressure.
I really enjoyed playing again and I played a solid golf.
I'm glad about how it has gone. "
With the trio on the field, former Masters winner Ian Woosnam and senior major champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are among the six Scots on the field, the others are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
Admission is free, the parking lot costs £5 per car with a passenger and £10 per car with two or more inmates.

Fewer lung cancer deaths caused by passive smoking
In the past two decades, fewer and fewer people have died of passive smoking in lung cancer.
To this end, scientists from the University Hospital of Hamburg-Könendorf (UKE) come in a study.
"According to our estimates, 167 lung cancer deaths are due to passive smoking per year," study director Heiko Becher said.
As a comparison, he drew up a separate study on this subject from 1994.
At the time, there were still 400 lung cancer deaths due to passive smoking per year in Germany.
The new investigation is published in the International Journal of Public Health.
House connections prove very complex
The construction works in the Villinger Straße are in full swing and "lie reasonably in time," according to the head of the Bauhof Fred Dezeze.
In the area of house connections, the situation is more complicated than suspected, because there is a lot of hide in the underground, which is not included in the plans.
The traffic, which is constantly hampering construction work, is a major problem for the Stumpp building group.
"The ignorance of motorists in front of red traffic lights and shutters is already huge," he told Heinz.
The road is closed and only the buses are eligible for transit.
Angelo Caruso, Marvin Kostorz and Tim Kostorz from Stumpp have been working on the bridge for weeks.
"The hot days have been quite demanding.
But luckily we were supplied by our friend Fritz Matt with cool mineral water, "Marvin Kostorz told me.
Poverty and Death in Indonesian Goldland
When Bardina Degei cooks dinner, she doesn't use a stove.
It even rarely uses a pot.
In her wooden house in Enarotali, the capital of the Paniai regiment in the troubled Indonesian province of Papua, the housewife normally puts a sweet potatoes - locally known as "novice" - directly into the fireplace.
After half an hour, the colored knolls are taken and devoured with eager, unwashed hands.
Degei sits on the mudbox - she has no furniture - where she also executes her day-to-day work, for example, washing clothes with cloudy water from the nearby swamp.
A bucket in a sprawling room serves as a latrine.
As the youngest of her husband's four wives, her no fields were assigned.
Polygamy is common here.
Of course, it can be dangerous late to work: Most villagers are unemployed, and many drink heavy, and there are soldiers here.
"No one dares to walk around in the village after 5pm," she says.
It is a rare glimpse into daily life in the Highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony that was recorded in 1969 after a disputed referendum in Indonesia, when only 1,026 elders were to vote by a public handset before the occupying forces.
An existing movement for independence against Dutch rule quickly turned against the Jakarta government, which maintains control of the region and excludes foreign journalists or legal observers.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua, with the independent part of Papua New Guinea covering the eastern part of the island.
The trip includes a 90-minute flight from the provincial capital of Jayapura to Nabire and then a morning 5 hour car ride with the rental car.
There is no public transport.
The city, with about 19,000 inhabitants, consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences, and from corrugated metal roofs that have been converted by rust into various yellow-brown tones.
Very few Indonesians have made their journey here, let alone journalists and virtually no foreigners.
Before Christian missionaries arrived, Mee Pago Papuans a god called Uga Tamee.
There were other changes as well.
"We weren't used to wearing that clothes," says Degei and hints at her lively, hand-woven turban, her dark shirt and her bright skirt.
"We used to only have leaves on our bodies."
Papua is Indonesia's poorest province, where 28% of people live below the poverty line and have some of the worst child mortality and literacy rates in Asia.
But it is also Indonesia's Goldland.
The world's largest and most profitable gold mine, Grasberg, owned by the Freeport McMoran from Phoenix, is located just 60 miles from Paniai, a highland province in the size of New Jersey with 153,000 residents.
In 2015 alone, Freeport has mined $3.1 billion in gold and copper.
In addition, Papua has timber resources worth an estimated $78 billion.
These riches, however, are a source of misery for the Papua, which ensure that Indonesia's powerful military maintains a suffocating presence.
A 2005 investigation in the New York Times reported that Freeport paid nearly $20 million to local military personnel and units between 1998 and 2004, including up to $150,000 to a single officer.
Papuanic demands for greater autonomy threaten these golden gans and are being treated mercilessly.
According to activists, more than 500,000 Papua has been killed and thousands have been raped, tortured and imprisoned by the Indonesian military since 1969.
Mass killings in Papua's tribal highlands in the 1970 "s became genocide, according to the Asian Human Rights Commission.
In the region alone, Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful protesters last year.
"We Are All losers" said in a report by the archdiocese of Brisbane from 2016, in which reports of atrocities of the previous year are included, such as unlawful executions and torture - rape and electric strikes are particularly popular after another report - and the brutal crackdown on peaceful demonstrations.
"It's difficult to count the number of victims since every week incidents happen," says Andreas Harsono, Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch.
The screws have stepped up as Papua's resources bring an influx of settlers from other parts of Indonesia.
The population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83% Christian, but demographic changes are changing as Muslim economic migrants come from the populous islands of Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Javanese Warung canteens sell fried chicken and Gado-Gado, a mixed vegetables with peanut sauce.
Local people are fighting to keep up here.
"The migrants have begun selling chickens and vegetables on the traditional market cheaper than local Papua," explains Abeth You, a 24-year-old Paniai native who moved to the provincial capital of Jayapura to work.
"It has cost the native Papua -- the mum-mum [the women] of Papua -- their market."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, in the popular mouth as Jokowi, promised to address the inequalities and the legal violations in Papua during his 2014 campaign.
The former Zimmermann secured 27 of Papua's 29 counties - including Paniai - on the way to the presidential palace in Jakarta.
But little has changed in Papua, and today locals feel betrayed.
"Our hearts are broken because we voted in 2014 for Jokowi, with the expectation that he will meet our hopes that justice will be restored," says You.
In fact, Paniai suffered a low point only two months after Jokowi's inauguration in October.
On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children were out and sang Christmas songs before a campfire in Enarotali when two Indonesian soldiers on a motorcycle broke through the darkness.
The frightened children told them they should turn up their headlights.
One of the soldiers took offense at her tone and later came back with four soldiers, according to local pastor Yavedt Tebai.
The soldiers who had been drinking were jailed and beat the group with their gunmen, victims and witnesses said.
Then one of the soldiers fired into the children's group.
One child, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was beaten so badly that he fell into coma.
A few hours later, the building of the nearby government commission was set on fire and things escalated the next day.
About 1,000 young Papua men, women and children gathered at a football pitch in front of the local police station and the military command center to demand justice.
They wore ceremonial Jagd arches and performed the Waita dance - in the circle running and a birdsong imitating - by Papuas Mee Pago tribe.
Some protesters began slouching stones at police and military posts.
When the mood heated up, the soldiers were sent a command of an internal radio: "If the crowds do more than three times resistance, they shoot them dead," it said in an official document of TIME, which was not released to local media.
Yeremias Kayame, 56, the head of Enarotali's Kego Koto district, saw the looming danger and called for calm and urged the crowd to return home.
Nobody was in the mood to listen.
"When I turned around, I was suddenly shot in my left wrist," he told TIME on the porch of his brightly painted wooden house.
Kayame still doesn't know who fired, but says the bullet came from the ranks of the soldiers gathered here.
"It was crowded, many shots were fired," he adds.
Local man Alfius Youw was hit three times, according to his cousin, who was witness to the shooting.
"I ran toward him and looked at his body to make sure he was it," said Yohanes, who like many Indonesians only bears a name, the TIME in dire mood.
"I saw him dead... I kissed him."
The Papua police chief inspector, Yotje Mende, told reporters that his officers wanted to "secure" their station just because they were being attacked.
"We have to defend ourselves if people threaten to kill us," the spokesman for Papua police, Commissioner Pudjo Sulistiyo, said in 2015.
"It's about life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and many more injured.
News of the killings came only the following day 'filtered' to Jakarta.
Three weeks ago, Jokowi held a passionate speech in Jayapura, in which he expressed sympathy for the families of the victims and vowed to address the historical grievances in Papua.
"I want this case to be resolved immediately so it will no longer happen in the future," he said.
Security Minister Wiranto said in October 2016 that he was setting up an out-of-court mechanism to resolve historic human rights abuses.
But the excuses started almost immediately.
"Most injuries occurred a long time ago.
Some were in the 90-overs and early 2000-era years.
The point is that we have committed ourselves to addressing these violations, but there are processes that need to go through, "he said.
Then, Wiranto made a retreat when he spoke to TIME on 5 June in Jakarta and said he had no plans to set up a complaint mechanism in Papua.
Instead, "everything is regulated by law," he said.
Wiranto, whom the UN has accused of "crimes against humanity," which claimed more than 1,000 deaths in East Timor's bloody independence referendum of 1999, said 11 cases of human rights abuses had already been settled in Papua, including the Paniai incident.
Families of the Paniai victims took such claims with grim disbelief.
"I've been interviewed four times over the last three years, but there was no progress whatsoever," Yohanes says.
"I'm tired."
He says he still lives in fear years later.
"I'm scared," he says.
"I'm afraid of being arrested by the military, scared to be shot."
His brother, Yacobus, reiterated the view that people in Paniai are afraid to discuss the incident.
He says he was beaten by the military after helping to bury four of the victims.
"After I buried the corpses, the military was looking for me," he says.
The shootings haven't stopped.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police shot to villagers in Paniais neighbourhood Deiyai.
During a confrontation between villagers and the manager of a construction company that refused to bring an unconscious man to the hospital, one person and 17 others were injured, including children.
The man, 24-year-old Ravianus Douw, who was drowned when he was fishing in a nearby river, died on the way to the hospital.
Excited villagers protested in front of the company's location office.
Police said the villagers threw stones at officers who responded by firing warning shots.
But locals say the mobile brigade (Indonesian paramilitary police) began shooting at the crowd and killed one.
"We were so panicked, we were scared that there will be revenge," says 29-year-old Dominggu Badii, who lives near the hospital and witnessed how the injured arrived here quickly, according to TIME.
"I was hiding two days in my house."
The Deiyai parliament has called for the officers involved to be held accountable and to withdraw the police's mobile brigade from the area.
Paniai has always been a hotbed for the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development strengthens the dissatisfaction of the tribal members Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal, who live in Papua's green highlands.
Many joined the Free Papua Movement (OPM), the rebel army, which claims to defend Papua's rights by launching sporadic attacks and kidnappings of Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the top OPM leaders come from Paniai, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kosai.
In response, thousands of people have been arrested and arbitrarily detained in Paniai in recent years, under the pretext of "securing national sovereignty."
Some never appear again.
Among the people of Papua, Paniai is known as "a tragic, forgotten place."
Poverty strengthens discontent.
The bit of rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive for locals.
Bread is just as out of reach.
People here are building everything they eat: Especially Nota and fruit and leaf vegetables.
Agriculture is the job of women, who can edit four or five fields of the sweet potatoes.
They retain most of the crop for the family while the rest are sold on the local market.
Ten pieces of Nota cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Over time, economic inequalities between the native Papua and the new migrants have grown since the opening of new flight routes to Nabire Airport in larger numbers.
The few jobs there are in the region usually go to the better-educated and wealthier migrants.
Papua rarely has the capital or the skills needed to compete for its own businesses.
"The young people are not interested in staying in the village... because here there are no jobs or money," says John Gobai, the chairman of Paniai's tribal council.
Isolation keeps the eyes of the world away from Papua.
In addition, restrictions on reporting international media remain tense.
Earlier this year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basile Longchamp were deported for lack of coordination with related institutions from Papua, although they were given the rare permission to film.
According to Phelim Kine, the deputy Asia director of Human Rights Watch, Jokowi's promises to repeal the restrictions on reporting to promote transparency and development have not been realized.
"There are new threats to foreign journalists trying to report from Indonesia's troubled easternmost provinces of Papua and West Papua: Visa refusal and a blacklist," he said in a statement.
Lack of press control means international pressure on the Indonesian government remains largely confined to the immediate neighbours of Papuas.
In March, six Pacific states - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the "various and widespread injuries" in Papua including the Paniai shootings.
The same countries have historically supported the OPM.
Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesman Arrmanatha Nasir dismissed the group's allegations and told journalists in Jakarta: "In Indonesia, there is still a democratic system, and there is free media so it is difficult to cover up the evidence of human rights cases."
Local people want more foreign governments to take note of this.
When an official delegation from the Netherlands, led by human rights ambassador Kees Van Baar, visited Jayapura on May 4, locals broke their silence and pressed him "We want freedom," according to a source who also attended the meeting but wants to remain anonymous.
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019, but Papua says it is unlikely to vote again for Jokowi.
"Jokowi is a man who has good intentions but he is surrounded by the people involved in the Paniai shots," says Gobai, the chairman of the tribal council.
He wants Jokowi to know that the Paniai people, apart from living under the constant threat of a predatory military, are in poor education and health services.
Gobai says that Paniai people, like other Papua, consider their vote for Jokowi as a "fault" he must repay.
"They don't need money, they just want justice," he says.
Despite the threats and intimidation, families of the Paniai shooting victims carried out a last symbolic act of defiance: The body of a victim was buried on a site exactly opposite the police and military station.
They know that they may never have justice, but at least they do not let those responsible forget their crimes.
"A member of our family was killed," Yacobus says with lowered head.
"What else can we do?"
Fire captures the 'Torch' skyscraper from Dubai for second time
A fire took place on Friday at one of the world's tallest residential towers in Dubai, forcing hundreds of residents to flee the 337 meter high, 79-storey building.
It is the second fire that sweeps through the high house in just two years, which is randomly called the Torch Tower (torch tower).
The building was evacuated, injuries were not reported and there was no direct word about the cause of the blaze.
"We slept and we stood up at the fire alarm and when people screamed.
We ran down the stairs, and it took about 10 minutes to get down from the 50th floor, "one resident told his name as George, Reuters.
Dubai's civil protection authorities said the units of fire fighting at 4 a.m. local time (00.00 GMT) extinguished the fire and cooled the building.
The government said it is working on providing shelter for those affected.
The incident may revive questions about the safety of materials used in outdoor areas of high-rise buildings around the world.
An investigation by the management of the TORCH building after its fire in 2015 revealed that most of the damage from the dressing, the outside dressing to decoration or insulation, came.
In Britain, police said they believe the system of plates to isolate and disguise at London's Grenfell tower in June could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire in which about 80 people died.
No Davis Cup reform: Further Best of Five
The president of the International Tennis Federation (ITF) has fallen through with his major Davis Cup coup at the General Assembly.
At the meeting in Ho-Chi Minh City, the revolutionary proposal to play Davis Cup singles only on two winning sets was not supported by the required two-thirds majority.
This is often a very long, but very much appreciated five-set classic.
63.54 percent of member states voted for the reform, the goal of ITF president David Haggerty was therefore narrowly missed.
"We respect that decision, but are disappointed that our member nations have not adopted the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and Fed Cup.
We need a change to secure the long-term future of these iconic and historic contests, "Haggerty said.
We will continue to work to improve the application.
It was not until the vote that, after many objections, the proposal had already been made to carry out the final in a neutral place.
New from 2018 are only comparatively smaller details: So the finalists in the Davis Cup and Fed Cup will have the host right in the following year in the first round.
In order to reduce the costs for the organisers, the requirements in terms of training places, etc., will be made easier and the players will have to take less official media dates before the Davis Cup.
More than 1 out of 5 U.S. travelers bring banned items to the plane, a survey finds
A survey among air passengers found that more than 20 percent deliberately or unconsciously banned items at the control points of the U.S. Transportation Security Administration, including at least 6 percent who entered the plane while accidentally carrying banned knives or other items with blades.
Less than 1 per cent claimed they had discovered late that they had mistakenly traveled with firearms, ammunition or explosives.
The poll at more than 1,000 people - conducted by a jet charter service, the Stratos Jet Charters Inc. - also noted that younger travelers are more likely to disregard the rules.
Of those surveyed, who admitted that they knowingly tried to fly with something that was banned by the TSA, 19.7 per cent were Millennials, compared with less than 15 per cent who were members of Generation X.
The most common items that were deliberately passed to TSA agents were food and liquids.
More than 3 percent admitted knowingly carrying items with blades through security checks, while 2.2 percent of female respondents and 3.7 percent of male respondents also confirmed they had deliberately banned drugs into the plane.
The company said it interviewed travelers across the country to find out how many had inadvertently brought contraband through airport security and how many had done it intentionally.
It is no surprise that the people who are most likely to carry contraband - knowingly or unwittingly - through security, were those most frequently flying.
The company, however, points out that the TSA guidelines are somewhat complicated and confusing.
People are often unsure which fluids they may take with them or how much of it.
So it's no surprise that the largest amount of items seized by the TSA are prohibited liquids.
For a while, people thought TSA could look at books as contraband.
Liquids are allowed on domestic flights, but not on international flights.
Elon Musk doesn't care: Tens of thousands of Tesla customers cancel order
Elektro-thousandssassa Elon Musk is happy to announce the huge number of pre-orders for his new Tesla "Model 3."
So far, he has understated that some of the customers have already withdrawn their non-binding reservation.
In addition to the ever-triumphant numbers of sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets, Tesla's chief executive Elon Musk has betrayed another, less bright figure for the first time in the announcement of the latest quarterly results: The cancellation of the new mass market model 3.
Musk has frequently campaigned with the more than 500,000 pre-orders for the new car in recent months, whose delivery is just beginning.
Now Musk admits: From the total of 518,000 pre-orders, 63,000 have already been withdrawn.
Critics have repeatedly pointed out that it is merely non-binding reservations.
In case of a cancellation, Tesla pays the 1000 euros (in the US $1000 and in the UK 1000 pounds) "reservation number" fully back.
Currently, 455,000 such non-binding reservations are available, Musk acknowledged in a conference call with analysts.
However, the fact that the cancellation of about 12 per cent of all orders could become the problem, however, does not believe the Tesla boss.
His argument: The challenge of ambitious growth targets lies not with demand, but on the production side.
Last year, Tesla delivered 84,000 vehicles.
In 2018, it is to be - all models taken together - 500,000, a million in 2020.
The demand for this is obviously there.
According to Musk, 1800 reservations are currently made per day.
Anyone who orders a "Model 3" today may not expect delivery at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - if Tesla manages to drive its brand-new, never-tested production roads without major disruptions with maximum utilization.
Many experts doubt that this is possible.
But if there are more delays, then the non-binding nature of the reservations could become the problem for Tesla.
For then, the company cannot prevent disaffected customers from running away in droves.
EPA chief Pruitt withdraws because of the addition of the Obama-era rules to reduce emissions
A day after he was sued by 15 states, Scott Pruitt, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, declined his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the Obama-era rules to reduce emissions of smog-causing air pollutants.
Pruitt presented the change as his agency turned to the needs of state environmental authorities more responsive than previous administrations.
He did not mention the lawsuit, which had been filed against his previous spot in a federal appeals court.
It is a deadline of 1 October for states to comply with standards of ground-level ozone in 2015.
Pruitt announced in June that he will delay compliance by a year to give his authority more time to study the plan and avoid "interfering in local decisions or hindering economic growth."
Pruitt, who was president of Oklahoma before his appointment by President Donald trump, has long been a reliable opponent of stricter environmental regulations.
Since arriving in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly rushed to block or delay regulations that oppose the chemical industry and industry of fossil fuels.
Wednesday's sudden reversal is the latest legal setback for the Pruitt's regulatory rollback agenda.
Last month, a federal appeals court in Washington ruled that the EPA administrator exceeded his authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule of the Obama administration requiring oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leaks.
In a statement issued on Wednesday night, Pruitt suggested that his U-turn on ozone standards simply strengthens EPA's willingness to cooperate with the states through the complex process of timely fulfilment of the new standards.
"Under previous administrations, the EPA has often failed to comply with the deadlines for implementation and then waited to be charged by activist groups and others, and in an agreement to set the date for implementation," said Pruitt, who sued the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job.
"We don't believe in regulation through litigation, and we take deadlines seriously.
We also take seriously the law and authority that exists to us. "
Still, the EPA's opinion said that Pruitt eventually will use its "authority to delay and all other legally available powers" to ensure that the regulations are "based on a solid policy and the best available information."
Congressional Republicans are pushing for a broader rewrite of ozone rules.
A bill approved last month is intended to delay implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years.
The measure was not yet put to the vote in the Senate.
The New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who led the coalition of states that sued the EPA this week, said the group intends to maintain legal pressure.
"The reversal of the EPA - according to our complaints - is an important gain for the health and safety of these 6.7 million New Yorkers and the more than 115 million Americans who are directly affected by the smog that flows into their communities," Schneiderman said.
New York joined California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington and the District of Columbia.
Soil ozone occurs when pollutants from cars, power plants, oil refineries, chemical plants and other sources in the atmosphere respond to sunlight.
The resulting smog can cause serious respiratory problems in sensitive groups of people, and contribute to thousands of premature deaths each year.
Public health officials and environmentalists cheered on Pruitt's surprising course change.
"It is troubling how much pressure it takes to take this reasonable step from the person responsible for protecting the air we breathe," said Lori Ann Burd of the Center for Biological Diversity.
"We must continue to fight against the ideological crusade of the trump administration, to deal with polluters and their particular interests."
Tumlingen celebrates 750 years of St. Hilarius Church
750 years of St. Hilarius-Church: On the occasion of the anniversary of the mountain church, the old cemetery area in Tumlingen on Sunday, July 16th, will be invited to a serenade at 4.30pm.
Whether its idyllic location and beautiful view of the village, the historic St. Hilarius plant is a popular place to stay.
Visitors to the sixth Benefiz-Serenade can be enchanted by this powerful place.
The rescue and conservation of the oldest building in the village have made friends and patrons tumbling to their concerns.
Walter Martini stresses: "It's a unique village gem."
In the year 1267, the St. Hilariuskapelle was first mentioned in the official document book: Graf Hermann von Sulz sold "the mountain with the parish church to Tumlingen and the Retitei" to Magister Eberhard of Horb and to his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark Silver.
According to the text of the document, on the Tumlinger Mountain, apart from the former parish church, there was also a stately courtyard, which belonged to the church or the Patronatsrecht, and not the other way round.
So people lived there as well.
As from the description of the Upper office of Freudenstadt of 1858, in addition to the undervillage and the Oberdorf, which are still visible in the village image of Tumlingen, the "mountain" is the third, the village's stately settlers.
Old maps dating back to the year 1600 underpin these historical realities.
The Patronatsrecht was born from the early middle-age self-church right.
A gentleman who built a church and filled with a priest remained the owner of this church and could also inherit this self-church.
This was linked to the right to use a priest or to propose a new pastor to the bishop.
There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower.
The size of the two most precious at Christmas 1673.
The newly acquired bell then sounded for the first time in 1692, but later had to be delivered in the Second World War in 1942.
In the 30 years of war (1616 to 1648) the windows were taken and the bell ropes were stolen.
The roof was leaky.
In 1796, French troops stored near the church.
They broke the canceled and church chairs and used them as firewood.
The remains of the church were threatened in 1809.
Until 1869, the Tumlinger Hilarius cemetery also served as the final resting place for the dead from heartwarming.
In 1823 the cemetery was extended and the Hilariuskirche stopped.
Only the church tower was left.
In the New Year's night in 1834, a storm split the church tower and half crashed.
To prevent an accident, the tower was aborted.
Only the tower dwarf still present today was preserved as a witness to the 750-year-old church history.
Today, Horst Kallenberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem, as a successor to Dieter Dockhorn, care for the Hilarius-plant as a successor to Dieter Dockhorn.
As an organiser, the friends and patrons of Tumlingens on Sunday, July 16th, invite to the sixth serenade to the old cemetery to the St. Hilarius capelle.
It is designed by the Combo of the Kepler-gymnasium Freudenstadt and with contributions from Kurt Kücker and Reinhold Matteis.
Local councilman Hartmut Romann speaks the final word.
The program starts at 4.30pm.
Admission is from 3: 30 p.m.
At the end of the serenade, a retort takes place in front of the graveyard.
"Enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with the wide view over meadows towards the forest," the organisers put out the fantastic view.
The serenade takes place only in dry weather.
The organisers are hoping for many supporters to preserve the historic St. Hilarius plant, which is important for tumbling and heartache.
The friends and patrons of Tumlingens feel particularly committed to home care, as serenade organizer Walter Martini reaffirms.
Club to consider approval of wind turbines
"Boisheim braces" sees no legal requirement for construction and has therefore approached the county council.
The Association of Boisheim has called on Councilman Andreas Coenen (CDU) to withdraw his approval for the establishment of planned wind turbines in the Boisheimer Nette.
It is illegal.
The association argues that at the time of approval on December 30, 2016, no wind turbines could have been approved at the Boisheimer Nette, as at the time in fours, only on the city border with Schwalmtal existed a wind turbine concentration zone.
Within this concentration zone, construction and operation of wind turbines are possible in principle, but at the same time the concentration zone means an exclusion of wind energy usage for the rest of the city.
Such zones are intended to prevent a "sparkle" of the landscape.
The city of Viersen had decided a second wind power concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette a few days earlier by changing the land use plan - but that had not approved the district government of Dusseldorf because of a form defect.
"Due to the lack of planning permission, the granted approval rating is still illegal and therefore also to be withdrawn," said Christoph Erkens, chairman of "Boisheim braces."
Current state of affairs: The city council once again decided the wind concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette prior to the summer recess; a permit from the district government is still pending.
Erkens: "This is where, at this point, the granting of a permit for the establishment of wind turbines is excluded in planning law."
The circle confirms the receipt of the call.
"The corresponding letters have been received at the District of Viersen last week," a spokesman explained.
The circle takes them to the occasion to re-examine the matter.
However, they are not expected to stop the proceedings being stopped.
With a view to ongoing proceedings at the Administrative Court, the county on Thursday did not want to comment on the content of the association's argument "Boisheim wicht."
NEW Re, a subsidiary of NEW, plans to build four per 200 metres of wind turbines on an area at boisheimer Nette.
As early as last year, the company, where the city of Viersen is indirectly involved, closed lease contracts with the owner of the approximately 65 acres of grounds.
With the construction of the four wind turbines, the electricity needs of around 11 400 households can be covered - equivalent to around one-fifth of the electricity needs of all four-seater households.
NEW Re wants to invest around EUR 20 million.
Last summer, Viersen City Council gave the green light to the purchase of three wind turbines at the Linnich wind farm at Aachen, as well as a stake in a wind turbine plant in Übach-Palenberg in the county of Heinsberg.
Car and tractor crash together: Woman dies in terrible accident
A terrible traffic accident occurred on Friday morning at around 10am on the L 333 between Lower Wallmenach and Bogel (Rhein-Lahn County).
A woman was fatally injured.
Two other people were slightly injured.
Landesstraße remained closed for hours.
According to police, a 17-year-old young woman from Bornich, with her passenger car with her 53-year-old mother as a companion, drove the L 333 towards Bogel.
City and traders plan 'home shopping' weekend
Bad Langenssalzaker and people from the region are expected to rediscover shopping opportunities in the city centre in September.
The commercial club and city administration want to use the weekend on September 8 and 9 to lure residents to the shopping mall in downtown.
As the chairman of the business association, Christian King, announced, the "home shopping" weekend is intended to raise customers' awareness of what offers the own city is holding away from the usual supermarket commodity.
A market with regional providers is therefore planned, similar to the weekly market.
In addition, local companies are expected to present themselves with their training places.
In addition, the shops of the city centre are expected to invite to "midnight shopping."
The action is not only aimed at residents of the city and the region.
In preparation are commercials on the radio, an internet video and printed bags that point to the action weekend, according to Christian King.
City administration and commercial association are cooperating with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry.
In this way, the commercial association and the city go into another stage of the project "attractive downtown."
These include new offers such as the first "Active Day" to the Brunnenfest office, including Sunday, talks with all the traders and hosts to encourage them to participate actively.
Also attractive offers for Saturday and the waiver of parking fees that day are part of the concept.
In addition, customer potential is to be re-opened or re-opened.
These include spa guests and tourists.
But many locals also would have lost downtown when shopping out of sight.
In the end, everyone would have to help revive downtown - to landlords, the businesses of the whole city and clubs.
It is true to overcome the lethargy with a network that has spread to some extent, King had said in the spring.
Birgit Stafford, head of the IHK-Center in Millhausen, said that the third "home shopping" day, the first of five Thuringian cities, is participating in the nationwide.
In addition to Bad Langenssalza, this is Weimar, Sömerda, Holy City and Bleicherode.
The day should "promote appreciation of local trade and highlight its importance to the common good of our cities," Stafford said.
The action under the auspices of the IHK and with many partners also makes it clear that any citizen with his purchasing behavior can influence his own direct environment.
Two dead and several injured after blast at U.S. school
During construction work, there was a gas explosion in the school building.
New other people were injured.
In a gas explosion in the U.S. city of Minneapolis, two people have been killed and nine others injured, some of them heavy.
According to the fire department, a wounded person was still in critical condition on Wednesday (local time).
One person died when part of a school building collapsed in the explosion.
An initial missing was later also recovered dead.
The dead were employees of the school.
As a cause of the accident, the authorities suspected work on a gas pipeline.
For the holiday period, few people were staying in the building of the Minnehaha Academy.
Trump put under pressure after leaked transcripts of phone calls from Mexico because of the payment of the border wall
Transcripts of phone calls between U.S. President Donald trump and leaders of Mexico and Australia were published by The Washington Post.
On January 27, trump called in a phone call with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto to stop saying publicly that he would not pay for a planned border wall.
The US president punched him because he publicly denounced the wall, saying he said to him: "You can't tell the press."
Trump launched his presidential campaign with the promise of building a wall on the southern border of the US, and vowed to let Mexico pay for the project.
Transcripts of his first call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull were also released and revealed a tense exchange.
Mr. trump told Mr. Turnbull that a trade for the U.S. refugees who emigrated to Australia was "ridiculous," "Mies" and "stupid" and that the existence on the trade, brokered by the Obama administration, would look like a "Depp" after proposing a ban on the resettlement of refugees to the US.
Mr. trump ended the call after telling Mr. Turnbull, "This is the most unpleasant call for all day."
Moores Ford massacre: Activists conduct racist Lynchact as a call for justice again
A 1948-he Ford Mercury drove through a group of spectators in rural Monroe, Georgia, and rumbled to Moore's Ford Bridge.
Before the car, which had four black passengers and a white driver, could reach the bridge, a group of white men appeared with guns to block his way.
The mob's leader - a middle-aged man in a pinstripe suit - took a long train on his cigar and looked at the windshield.
Inside, the inmates were floating in fear.
"We want this n -- -- r Roger!" Roared the man.
"Hol him out of the car!"
Cries ripped apart the silence when a young black man was dragged from the front-passenger seat.
Fortunately, this terrible scene, played on July 22, is just a sequel.
But when a snout is thrown around the neck of "Roger," almost everyone in the audience encountered very real sighs.
Since 2005, civil rights activists have come back to Moore's Ford Bridge to emulate the night in which two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom as well as George and Mae Murray Dorsey - were gelded by the Ku Klux Klan in 1946.
No one has ever been charged with the murders.
"It's really unconscionable that no single person has been arrested in all these years - although we see them in our communities, although we know who they are," said Tyrone brooks, who helps in organizing the post.
"It's a dirt stain on a story, but it's a burden for our souls."
Brooks is a 71-year-old former congressman of the state of Georgia and a life civil rights activist.
For him, the sequel serves as a dramatic call to action and represents an annual reminder to the Monroe community that an injustice has never been corrected.
"We want law enforcement, we want the end, we want healing, we want reconciliation, but first we have to get justice," he said.
"We cannot get to healing and reconciliation until we get justice."
A forensic officer lays a bedcloth over the corpse of one of the victims of the Moore Ford Lynch on July 27, 1946.
According to FBI files obtained by NBC News, more than 50 men were suspected of Monroe and surrounding counties in the Lynch trial.
But none has ever been charged.
Although the suspects have been at large for decades, civil rights activists say the double motivation for the lynch actions across the city was always known: Politics and sex.
In April 1946, a Supreme Court decision allowed black citizens in Georgia to vote for the first time in the pre-election campaign in the summer.
Roughly at the same time as the election stach, according to the FBI of black farmhouse Roger Malcom, a white landlord, Barnett Hester, settled during a fight - reportedly because of a woman.
Brooks said the rumor in the city was that Hester slept with Malcom's wife Dorothy and that the baby she was wearing was not from her husband.
On July 25, 1946, Loy Harrison, a prominent white landowner, paid $600 to free Malcom from prison, according to the FBI.
He was accompanied by Dorothy and her cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey to jail.
But when they then moved away from jail and approached Moore's Ford Bridge, a lynchmob surrounded the car.
"As it turns out, it was Harrison who prepared and ordered the murders," concludes an FBI report.
"It is also obvious that there was a plot between the state and local law enforcement, which was not only involved in the killings, cleared evidence and covered up the identity of witnesses."
Brooks puts it even more succinctly.
"It was an election-day massacre," he said.
"They were all killed to send a message to black people in this community:" If you register and if you vote, that will happen to you here. "
For nearly a decade, Cassandra Greene has led the annual sequel to the Moore Ford Bridge Lynch murders.
Her portrayal is vivid, seizing and is grounded in a kind of deep racism, many of whom would like to believe he no longer exists in America.
It's hard to watch, and even harder to look away, but Greene said that's the point.
"We don't want to talk about the lynching because then we're going to be confronted with its hemorrhaging in all of us," she said.
"But I can't build a relationship with you if you don't want to listen to me or not want to hear what I've been through."
The samples for this year's production began in June, and on the first day nearly 30 actors - a dozen whites and the rest of blacks - pushed into a room and listened when Greene launched a well-recorded overview of the play.
Wade Marbaugh is here Greenes co-director.
He has played the role of chief clan member for years, but he said the role will never be easier.
"I feel dirty because I'm not like that," Marbaugh said.
"But I think it's very important to get this story alive because we don't want to return at these times."
On the other side of the room, the actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, who play Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester, were rehearsing their lines.
The play begins with Malcom, the Hester, and afflicted him, angry that he slept with his wife Dorothy.
"I said, n -- he, disappearing from my property!"
Rascona relishes the fire.
There's a pause.
And then everyone (at least all black actors) breaks out in laughter.
Greene laughs the loudest.
"What?!" Asked Rascona.
He's alarmed and confused.
Was I too tough?
"No," Greene said, still pounding.
"I just don't think white people at the time 'n -- he' said."
"But," one of the other black performers quipped.
"You just have to hit the hard 'R.'.
And that's exactly where the energy shifts in the room, a sense of companionship replaces the unease.
Everyone is busy getting this right, not just because of the game but also because of the memory of the four people killed.
The scene begins again.
This time, when Rascona says the N-word, he says it sharp and forcefully.
Absolutely nobody laughs.
This repetition ends violent and fast.
There are cries, shots and then silence.
A woman, wearing a funeral dress, stands above the actor's corpses and leads Billie Holiday's grieving eulogy "Strange Fruit."
Her voice breaks in every second word.
About a hundred meters behind it, a group of about four dozen spectators wow sweat and tears from the eyes.
The audience is split almost evenly between black and white.
A couple have travelled from Ithaca, New York, to see the show, many only come down the road.
They have all experienced Georgia's heavy humidity for nearly eight hours when brooks leads them on a pilgrimage to the tombs of the Malcom and Dorseys.
Up to that point, the murders have remained an anecdote, but now, when you stand on the same country where the lynch murders took place, the air feels spooky.
When the last notes of the song sound out, Greene invites the crowd to come closer and inspect the corpse.
Children hop on their heads, register the fake blood and the silent bodies and whisk each other.
"They're not really dead," mutters a little boy as wanting to remember it.
After a few minutes, Greene thanks the crowd - and suddenly it's over.
The actors throw away the Lynch rope and wipe their tears.
Bradshaw hugged Marbaugh, the man in the suit who played the clan member.
Nick Rascona hugs two of his fellow players and then breaks into her arms crying together, the emotional burden of the performance eventually breaks up with him.
"It's okay," one of the women whispers.
"We know that's not in your heart.
You did that for a reason. "
Later, audiences sit down with the actors for dinner.
At a table, a white pair of Atlanta chatted about the sequel with a black couple they just met.
Denise Duplinski struggled to find words about what feeling the performance left behind.
"It's hard to hear these terrible words and deeds... coming from people who look like you yourself and who do that because they look like you," she said.
"What this really does with me allows me to believe that the lynching is still going on," she added, "today that is just called police shooting."
In the same room, Tyrone brooks Hof at his table, he eats and recalls civil rights.
He said he had already started planning the performance next year.
"The sequel is in some ways inspiring, because it describes the horror of what we have endured, but it's also a moment of learning," he said.
"It's so if we don't learn anything from it, it can happen again.
Anyone who doesn't study his own story, who doesn't know his own story, is condemned to repeat it. "
"Gods" reconciled the Wagnerians in Bayreuth
Even in the fourth part of Richard Wagner's monumental work, director Frank Castorf relies on a colorful-frivolous staging in front of gigantic, six-storey scenery.
The spindle (designed by Aleksandar Denic) shows a shabby street corner including Mauerrest and Dönerbudde in Berlin, a "plastic and ice" logo from DDR-era or the New York Stock Exchange.
Before that, an open Mercedes-old-timer, in which the Rheindaughters pose as a rocker girl, or alternatively an Isetta.
Piled oil fades recall Castorf's leitmotif - money, power and greed - which moves through its "ring" staging.
The three Rheindaughters - sung by Stephanie Houtzeel, Wiebke Lehmkuhl and Alexandra Steiner - are in harmony as well as in the "Rheingold" wonderful.
Kess seduce her Siegfried (Stefan Vink), tearing a corpse into the trunk in Hollywood fashion and giving the Kraballo clique.
Stephen Millling sings the wonderfully nasty Hagen that surrounds the aura of a heavyweight boxer.
Brutal the scene when he beats Siegfried.
Later, Gunther (Markus Eichhe) must also believe in.
The audience thanks it to the ensemble with strong applause.
Stormy is celebrated Foster, Millling, Vinke and conductor Janowski, who is modest and hands down the hands of the Merkel-Raute formend.
Great applause is available for the festival orchestra, which is showing up on stage for the first time - given the great heat again in legless leisure clothes.
The appearance of Frank Castorf and his directing team was eagerly awaited.
If he had yet to make a glistening pipe concert in 2013, there were great jubilation five years later in which the sporadic "Buh" calls went under.
Stadtplayhead of Stararina Wagner is likely to be pleased about this.
"You realize that the audience has grown up with the" ring "in a way," she had said just before the dpa's performance.
Not only did the audience make a form of peace with Castorf, but it was also an understanding of its perspective.
I have a positive summary.
Max crowd works as a volunteer
They work in several places in their volunteer year.
Where everywhere?
Crowd: Normally in Steinfurt in the furniture stock exchange, once a week I help in Greven in the furniture bridge.
And I've also been working at the school in the open day.
What are your experiences with it?
Crowd: It's a beautiful, broad spectrum that I see here.
I have to do with different people, with young people, with refugees, with young adults.
They are now 26 years, so a late-term volunteer.
How does that happen?
Crowd: I graduated from high school.
And then a civil engineering study, let's say, successfully halted.
I realised for me that it is the wrong thing for me and I want to do something else, work with people.
And then I asked myself what do you do.
Make a social year, there's a glimpse, since you can see how it is on the ground, in the focal point perhaps, really.
And was it so?
Crowd: I collected great impressions.
I will start my studies in the conservatory in the winter semester.
I will study dual, probably in the Herne Youth Welfare Office, and study in Hamm at the University of applied Sciences.
Is it not unusual to have several different locations during the volunteer service?
Crowd: Yes, it's very variable.
It probably always depends on where you make your FSJ.
You can make it from the age home to youth work - in all sorts of facets of social work.
It was very varied with me.
I was also partly in the OGS, so in afternoon care.
For me, that was exactly what mattered to me.
I could see my own strengths and see how it really runs out.
Unlike in Civil Engineering?
Crowd: Well, here's not about counting statics.
One has another person's head, each of which has a very different story behind him.
Whether a refugee, a young person who has been brought out of the family - you always have to go into it individually.
Very interesting.
And you had no touch of touch?
Crowd: For that I'm not the guy.
It's an area that gives a lot.
A lot of love, a lot of kindness.
There are sometimes negative moments, but so life is just.
Pearson cuts another 3,000 jobs and cuts the dividend to revive business
The British education group Pearson said on Friday it will cut another 3,000 jobs and cut its interim dividend by 72 per cent as another restructuring programme is launched to overcome the pressures faced by the company.
The jobless rate, which director-general John Fallon overwhelmingly announced for the end of 2018 and early 2019, comes in addition to its previous restructuring, where 4,000 jobs have already been lost.
Pearson announced in May in a third cost-cutting program a plan to cut costs by another 300 million pounds ($394 million) to revive a business that was hit by the rapid move to digital learning.
The company, which last month sold its stake in Penguin Random House to partner Bertelsmann, said that the outlook for the fiscal year was unchanged after it posted an increase of 1 per cent to £2.05 billion in the first half of the year.
Convoy attack from Kabul: NATO soldier killed in suicide attack
A suicide bomber attacked a military convoy in the Afghan capital, Kabul, killing a soldier of NATO and injuring several others, officials say.
Five soldiers and an interpreter were injured, a statement by NATO said.
Unconfirmed local reports said three civilians were also killed in the incident in the Qarabagh district.
The bombing is the latest violence that hit Afghanistan this month - Tuesday more than 30 people were killed in a mosque in Herat.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
In an opinion by NATO, it said the explosion on Thursday night was done when a joint patrol with the Afghan army was attacked by a "person carrying improvised explosive device."
The statement says all the injured are in a stable condition and are being treated at the U.S. military hospital at Bagram airfield.
Correspondents say the growing strength of the Taliban and the group known as the so-called Islamic State (IS) in Qarabagh is a major concern for NATO forces in the nearby Bagram.
According to the United Nations, there were at least 1,662 civilian deaths in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, about 20% in the capital.
In late July, a suicide car bomb killed at least 30 people in a mainly Shiite district of Kabul.
The Taliban said they had executed that attack.
On May 31, a huge bombing in the center of the city killed more than 150 people with the country's most deadly militant attack since US-led forces ousted the Taliban from power in 2001.
The violence underscores the precarious security situation in Afghanistan, as U.S. President Donald trump is weighing to increase the number of U.S. troops supporting the military and police in the country.
Correspondents say the suicide bombings in Kabul in recent weeks have also caused a crisis of public confidence in the government, its policies and, in particular, the reputation of President Ashraf Ghani.
EPA returns decision to delay smog rule after complaints
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has lifted a decision to delay regulation of the Obama administration, saying states are required to curb smog-causing emissions, a day after 15 states sued the agency because of the move.
The EPA late on Wednesday announced the decision to advance the so-called "ozone provisions in 2015," and said it showed the agency's commitment to work with states.
"We believe in the dialogue with and that we are responding to our state partners," EPA chief executive Scott Pruitt said in a statement.
Pruitt announced in June the EPA's intention to determine ozone regulations - in which in part of the country's pollutant emissions are to be measured in order to determine where cuts must be made to comply with stricter air quality standards - to delay a year to October 2018.
A group of 15 mostly Democratic states, along with the District of Columbia, filed suit Tuesday and said the effort was illegal.
President Donald trump's administration has sought to return a broad range of environmental requirements imposed by former President Barack Obama as part of a broader agenda that is expected to boost economic growth, according to trump.
However, efforts have sparked the setback of Democrats and conservation groups, who are worried about the impact of larger emissions on public health.
The EPA's Web site says that inhaling air, ozone contains "the lung function and can strengthen respiratory symptoms" such as asthma.
Local council wants community space
In the end, the decision was clear: With two votes against, the local council of fluorn-Wines decides to set up a Community area in the future senior residential complex.
Before the discussion, there is an important information: The purchase agreement for the still missing plot was signed, Mayor Bernhard Tjade reports.
Although it will take place until the church community has been part of the community, there is now no planning obstacle for the project to be used by a private investor.
There is a debate on this in relation to a Community area.
One of the two investors still in the boat has offered to meet the community.
On the ground floor, it would provide a living space - around 55 square feet - and an adjacent terrace with 70 square feet of space for a special price.
The administration and the majority of the local council are hovering just not to provide such a Community space as a meeting point only for residents of the elderly, but open to the community.
As an example, the word from the "knitting Café" made the round.
The decision, which was decided by the provision of funds for the current budget last autumn, will be sweetened by means of funding.
Construction is in the rehabilitation area.
Setting up a community space would be, Tjade said, with 60 percent of 30 percent eligible.
The decision-making proposal to signal to the investor that, in this respect, he does not want to throw a stick between his legs, the observation that both attorneys - which is based on environmental construction - as well as Pultroof - which reduces drowsiness and makes construction more economical - would be possible.
Unnecessary, not just Wilfried Sohmer, is this addition.
If it helps: Unanimously he happens to the panel.
It is not as simple as the Community area.
Daniela's reputation points to the many own buildings that are not made quite clear, but they are now opposed to the Community area from the window, she says: "I am struggling with it."
Yvonne Staiger is absolutely committed to the Community area - but absolutely against local participation.
It sees behind it a covert subsidy to already wealthy or even foreign investors.
This is not the case, because with the acquisition of the area there is no subsidy, but a real, in doubt, marketable counterpart, is the counter-speech.
Staiger's request to split the decision-making proposal accordingly finds three supporters.
This is the case with two votes against the original programme, which Stefan Haller summed up: "If we take the decision so we take a giant step towards closing a huge gap in our infrastructure."
Collision with car: Cyclist is thrown out on road
While crossing the road, an 82-year-old cyclist was captured by a car on Wednesday in Garath and seriously injured.
As police rushed, the 82-year-old longfield was traveling at 12.20 with his bicycle on the bike path of the road Black Way from the direction of Hilden.
The senior wanted to cross the runway at the height of the street Am Buchholzer Busch.
A passenger car leader in the same direction gave him priority.
When the longfield drove down the road, however, he apparently did not pay attention to the counter-traffic.
He met with a car that headed a 66-year-old Hildeiter.
The man was thrown onto the street.
He suffered serious injuries and was taken to hospital with a rescue truck.
FC Bayern Munich must abandon the Super Cup against Borussia Dortmund on David Alaba and Thiago
The SuperCup takes place without him: David Alaba must leave the game against Dortmund.
With staff concerns, FC Bayern travel to Dortmund for the first mandatory game of the new season.
Seven pros are missing the title defense in the SuperCup against the Cup winner.
German Football League champions Bayern Munich are getting bigger and bigger before the SuperCup on Saturday (8.30pm / ZDF and Eurosport) at postseason Borussia Dortmund.
Coach Carlo Ancelotti must also miss out on David Alaba in the duel with the PHB.
The Italian confirmed Friday.
In addition, the Munich-based Manuel Neuer, James, Thiago, Jerome Boateng, Arjen Robben and Juan Bernat are missing.
For the five defeats in the past six Test matches, Ancelotti has blamed the physical condition and the lack of balance in his team's game.
"We know we're not in the best physical condition," Ancelotti said, adding: "The most important point is the balance in the team.
It was last not good. "
The 58-year-old, however, believes in a performance increase in the first official mandatory game of the season.
"Football is also tactics, strategy, personality and motivation.
I have great confidence that my team is showing these qualities.
The team is ready.
We want to play intelligently, "said Ancelotti, who expects a" difficult, intense game. "
The duel of the two German football heavyweights draws the fans into their spell.
The game is sold out with 81,360 viewers, the German Football League (DFL) said on Friday.
Walking in the Harz from Stern to Stern
In the Harz, the first "stellar path" is to be created.
This is planned by the Stellerwarte Sankt Andreasberg.
A planetary path exists in Göttingen - since 2003.
A "stellar path" will meet the need for information from many Harzvisitors, it was said.
He combines nature, science, movement and athletic performance.
The members want to create boards along the planned route and inform them about stars and stellar images.
In a first phase by 2018, the association plans "well-achievable installations at five to six locations" in the Oberharz.
In question, St. Andreasberg, Braunlage, Hohegeße and Sieber were called into question.
The information on the boards is to be added via the Internet.
Therefore, a good mobile network reception plays a role in the selection of locations.
Accessibility is also a criterion.
Later, the stellar path will be extended by train.
"On the stellar path, the viewer experienced a lot of knowledge, for example, about the physics of the individual stars," the club explained.
In addition, they learned why stars would have different colors or why a star would be more luminescent than another, though it is much farther away.
Also, in which star image is a selected star and when it is best to see.
The association has already been operating in the mountain town of St. Andreasberg since 2014, the highest-lying observatory in northern Germany.
The location in the heart of the Harz National Park is one of the six darkest regions in Germany, according to the Federal Office for Nature Conservation.
Often from there the Milky Way and even the Andromeda galaxy are visible with the naked eye.
Since 2003 there has been something similar in the university city of Planetarium Göttingen, such as the planned Stellenwerg - the Planetenweg.
Starting from Gebhards Hotel in the Goetheallee, which forms the interior of our solar system, the Planetenweg leads with its Stelen to the Hainberg and the observatory - as well as an "alien" location in Diemarden (commune equals) with the planet Sedna.
The Stelen with the individual planets - including the Pluto on the dwarf planet - are positioned exactly at the distance and scale of one to two billion.
The Earth shrank so on a bullet of 6.5 millimeters diameter, while the sun's exactly 75 meters, at least 70 centimeters, measures 70 centimeters.
The entire distance of the Planetenweg is a good four kilometer.
While light is needed from sun to Pluto about eight hours, pedestrians need a good hour to go to Stelle with Pluto.
Pedestrians are therefore faster than the light in world space.
But the march to the next fix would take six months.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for the first time, discussing a possible showdown
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who should be in a collision course to showcase the most exciting boxing match in the near future under 147 pounds, met for the first time on Thursday.
They were in separate rooms at ESPN offices in Los Angeles until Garcia, the undefeated World Boxing Council lightweight champion, walked down the hallway to greet Lomachenko, the World Boxing Organisation super-featherweight champion.
After Garcias's victory by unanimous decision on former four-division champion Adrien Broner on Saturday at Showtime, both fighters are members of the top five Pound for Pound list.
Garcia stretched out the right hand and said, "How do you go, champion?
I wish you luck. "
Lomachenko defends his belt against Miguel Marriaga on Saturday night at 7pm on ESPN.
As the pair posed for photos, Lomachenko's manager, Egis's climate, noted that a possible showdown between the fighters would be the "perfect magnitude."
"I'm a former featherweight," Garcia recalled.
"I went up for Broner [at 140 pounds] but I'm not that great.
I'm small for 140.
I want to get down to light weight.
And he's got to move on lightweight [135 pounds] and then we fight.
That's what the fans are asking for.
Let us give them that. "
Lomachenko agreed.
"Boxing needs this fight."
Climate asked if it should be on pay-per-view, part of a strategy that Lomachenko must contend with a 135-pound debut this year to agree with Garcia a date next summer (37-0, 30 knockouts) of interest in the fight against the winner of Jorge Linares-Luke Campbell after their lightweight title fight in the forum on September 23.
"This fight could take place in the pay-per-view mode because all the fans asked for him," Garcia said, and later pressed openly to fight on the network, which offers the best financial package.
We're the best.
No other names can generate that kind of attention.
Whenever they are ready... "
Garcia said he appreciated Lomachenko as "an enormous fighter," and he may be attending his Saturday fight.
But Lomachenko held on to the generous praise for Garcia and said that he thinks the three-game champion from riverside looks "very slow, sorry Mikey... you want the co-off."
Garcia said the focus is to show stroke, then boxing.
Both said they could feel the momentum building up for their own fight.
"This is the fight that needs to be done.
No other fight creates so much attention and enthusiasm.
I'm more than happy to work on it, "Garcia said.
Lomachenko said: "I've been waiting for the top fighters, and that's Mikey.
It's going to be a great fight. "
Four injured after tyre burst
In an accident on the A7, four people were seriously injured on Thursday afternoon.
According to initial information, the driver of an Opel Zafira lost at 4.30pm just before the junction marketwide, presumably after a tyre burst, took control of his vehicle.
The car dragged into the embankment to the right, where it fell over and then stuck on the roof in the green strip.
The four inmates - two adults and two children - were seriously injured in the accident.
During the initial supply of the injured by the ambulance service, the A7 was closed towards the north for about an hour, then traffic on the left carriageway could be passed at the site.
Fortunas Hoffmann: 'Three-chain works better'
Andre Hoffmann is hoping for the 2: 2 to start the season opener against Braunschweig that improves defense formation in Aue points.
With the first season of the season, Andre Hoffmann was pleased, with the result also, if not the two opponents were at 2: 2 against Braunschweig.
"These were two opponents too much, and we need to be even better careful in Aue," says the defenseman of Fortuna Düsseldorf.
In the Erzgebirge, the three-chain chain is also expected to be further optimized.
And a goal after a free-kick, the fortune also doesn't want to catch up.
"For the future, it will be that no more besides Michael (Rensing) is putting on the line."
Hoffmann is convinced that his team will do better after the experience in preparation with the triple-chain than with the four-string.
"I don't yet know how we're going to operate in Aue," says his trainer Friedhelm Funkel, but Hoffmann is sure of his cause "because we just have in the three-string at the semi-positions in Kaan Ayhan and Niko Gießelmann players who can build well," Hoffmann said.
"Condition is, but that we are even better in harmony and we aren't doing so many playoff errors in the build-up."
Of course, Hoffmann also drives to Aue to win the game.
"Whether you can talk after a draw from a failed start doesn't know.
The performance could well be okay, "Hoffmann said.
"If we stand out on Sunday with four points and be able to focus on the cup, we will certainly be able to talk about a proper season kick-off."
His coach didn't want to know anything about that.
"The start to the season I only judge after six to eight days," said Friedhelm Funkel, who doesn't want to speak of an advantage over Aue just because the game of the Saxons in Heidenheim had to be aborted prematurely because of a storm.
"Now they can start the season virtually with a home game," said Funkel and Hoffmann believes the players from Aue might even be a little more fresh as they don't have a difficult and complete game like Fortuna against a rise favorite in the bones.
"But they don't know as 100 percent where they are at the moment," says the interior designer of the Fortuna.
While the guests from the Rhineland as a slight favorite go to the meeting at last (almost) finished Stadium of Aue.
"That we sweep them away just because we have the right to come under the first six is nonsense," says Funkel, whose record is well positive in just one defeat against Aue from nine games.
"There's no team in the 2nd Bundesliga that you have to beat from the outset," explains Fortunas head coach.
"To make such a statement would be arrogant and arrogant."
And so Funkel doesn't want to experience his players on Sunday.
New results of Swedish asylum-seeker testing published
The latest findings of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden, which have been subjected to a new method of medical assessment of their age, show that more than 80 per cent of those tested are older than 18, but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results.
The Swedish authority for forensic medicine (Rättsmedicinalverket) started carrying out the tests last year.
They are expected to make the assessment of age more accurate during the asylum procedure after the Swedish Migration Agency (Migration Verket) was criticised for errors in assessing the correct age of some refugees who were under-age.
To date, migration sales have sent 6,880 to test cases and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now released the results of a total of 2,481 tests from mid-March to July 31, 2017.
Eighty percent (2002) were judged to be 18 or older, while in another 25 cases the Forensic Medicine Agency judged that the person was "possibly 18 years or older."
In 432 cases, the conclusion was that the person "may be under 18 years old."
The tests are carried out only in cases where the age of the person is questioned.
According to Johan Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency, the results have been consistent in recent months.
"We don't see a big difference in the statistics of the past few months, the numbers are pretty constant," he told The Local.
The high proportion of cases in which the person was judged over 18 years does not necessarily mean that the asylum seeker lied about his age.
In May, the agency released the results of 581 tests and said there were 442 cases that "suggest that the person investigated is 18 years or older."
When the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet investigated the 581 published results, she noted that in 243 of those cases, the person had frankly said that she was 18 years old this year.
The method of medical age assessment, when X-rays of wisdom teeth and MRT shots are made of knee joints, which are then analyzed by dentists and radiologists, has also been criticized in some areas.
A skeptic is the endocrinologist Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute, whose work involves assessing the biological maturity of people to see if they used to go sooner or later than usual through puberty.
"I had reason to think about it and I don't think the type of measurement should be used.
Judging the biological age in this way is very uncertain.
If we can't say it safely, we shouldn't pretend we could, "he told the newspaper Metro.
However, Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency defended the accuracy of the tests: "In general, you can say that the risk of misjudging a child as an adult is low.
The biggest risk is when the person is just under 18, in this case this is about 10 percent. "
Fully in plan
The work on the three bridges of the road 108 between Lauterbach and Schramberg is progressing well.
On Wednesday, a seven metric ton of heavy concrete was installed at the bridge at Lauterbach's eastern entrance.
"We're very good at the time, it's going great," says Reinhold Light, building manager at the Department of Street and Transport in the government's Bureau of Freiburg.
In April, work began at the same time at all three clean-up bridges between Schramberg and Lauterbach.
It is planned for October and it is easy to see that the timetable is being complied with.
The first bridge next to Schramberg leads through the Trombach.
It is a vaulted ceiling of concrete dressed with red bunt sandstone and has a total length of 4.80 metres.
It was built in 1900.
Like the other two bridges, she has now come into the years.
In order to ensure stability and safety, the three buildings will now be thoroughly renovated.
The two other bridges lead over the Lauterbach.
They are built from red bunt sandstone.
Both were built in 1939 and are 12, or 10.60 feet long.
The bridge at the entrance of Lauterbach has now received a 1.30 metre wide and seven tonnes of heavy so-called bridge cap on Wednesday morning on the north side.
This is an edge fastening that is also used as an operating path.
On the southern part of the bridge, a 2.20-metre-wide bridge cap is to be used on Friday.
This is where the pedestrian path is supposed to go.
The special thing is that these are finished parts, a patent of the Schramberger company Dizno.
The other two bridges are already fitted with the patented bridge caps.
Special finger tips have required the laying of wires through the building in Lauterbach.
Because there is also a fiber optic cable to which many companies are connected.
Residents were briefed on the project in the run-up to the work.
In addition, fish and crabs had to be fished out.
Traffic is regulated by a traffic light for the bridges between the building of the building and the collector in the direction of Schramberg.
For the construction work on the bridge at Lauterbacher village entrance, the road in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotel "Tannenhof" and "Seven Linden" is fully locked.
The cost of the three bridge renovations is EUR 700 000.
It is funded by the country.
AFD in Gerolstein: Bland protest at German potato salad
It doesn't happen so often that parties are pulling together, but when it comes to the Alternative for Germany (AFD), it comes together, which is otherwise hard to get under a hat.
The party (CDU, SPD, Green, FDP, FWG, Left) is part of a broad alliance that shows a peaceful flag this day because the AFD invites to the "big campaign kick-off" in Gerolsteiner Stadthalle Rondell.
And known names to launch - like Alice Weidel, who, along with Alexander Gauland, forms the top duo for the general election on September 24, and the deputy federal chairman Beatrix of Storch.
But those who are on the ground already hours before the start of the event do not want to listen to the AFD learning, but demonstrate.
The motto "The Eifel remains colorful."
Originally, the city picnic was planned under the slogan "All at a table" in the fountain, but is now taking place in the parking lot below the Rondell - and thus directly in front of the eyes of those who come to the AFD event in the city hall.
A colorful picture that offers itself.
And what Christa Karoli, chairman of the Forum A World and one of the authoritative organizers, is right to say: "Great how many people have come together here."
There is music and plenty of food, including a "urdeutscher potato salad, which the AFD could easily eat," says the woman who brought him.
Police have ordered many officers to Gerolstein, showing presence in particular at the station, which is just a few metres from the venues.
How did the AFD actually come to Gerolstein?
Mario Hompes of the AFD Volcano Eifel reports that he was trying to get such an event and get the supplement.
The 45-year-old from Gentersdorf had first asked in Daun but there was a cancellation because there were not enough parking lots available because of the already built Laurentiuskirmes.
So now the Rondell, Hopes is pleased that "we can have such a beautiful event here."
Looking at the event at Rondelvorplatz, he says: "This is the good right of the people, main thing, it remains peaceful."
It also does: At around 8pm on the Rondellvorplatz, a band for entertainment, in the city hall various speakers, including the Rhineland-Palatinate's AFD chairman Uwe Young.
In the hall, about 200 listeners are waiting for the top candidate to hold their speeches for the general election, Alice Weidel, and Deputy Federal President Beatrix of Storch.
The police presence is unchanged, but so far officials have had a quiet evening.
A little more than an hour takes the AFD event, the guests in the front seat have a longer breath, but there is also a need to clean up just after 9pm.
The police can move away - no special events.
Posaune hits trumpet
A re-hearing with the Wolf Posaunist Frederic Belli is available in the series Haslacher Monastery concerts tomorrow, Sunday, at 8 p.m. in the Klosterkirche.
Together with the Bulgarian trumpeter Miroslav Petkov, he gives a concert under the motto "Black Sea meets Black Forest," or even "Balkan folklore" meets classical German training with roots in the blasmus.
Both soloists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and have held solo positions in European top orchestras.
Thus, Petkov is solo trumpeter at the renowned Concertgebouw Orchestra Amsterdam and Frederic Belli is Soloposaunist of the SWR Symphony Orchestra.
Both combine the desire to cross not only the boundaries on their instruments, but also to merge the boundaries of the different genres.
Johann Sebastian Bach sounds like a new dress, Daniel Schnyder's "world music" with Bulgarian folklore, and in the piece "Exchange suite" of the jazz echo winner Nils Wogram, mixing classical, jazz and free games to a fascinating overall artwork.
This centerpiece of the program was premiered this spring with huge success in Freiburg.
The renowned composer Nils Wogram has written it for both musicians and more: The Haslacher Klosterkirche with its special acoustics is deliberately included in the concert.
Kristen Stewart talks about her bisexuality
"Some people love grilled cheese and will eat it until the end of their life.
But I want to try everything, "Kristen Stewart quite frankly about her bisexuality.
"When I first bite in grilled cheese, I think, 'Oh that was cool, what comes next?'"
The Hollywood star's best-known relationship was the one to her "twilight" colleague, Robert Pattinson, who was ultimately bitter.
In spite of all this, the brooding actress assures me of the "Harper's Bazaar" magazine: "I was in love with everyone I danced.
Or do you think, for example, I would have played it? "
After her separation, Kristen admitted that she was bisexual: "I've always lived the dualism and seriously believed in it.
So it has never left me confused or disabled.
I just never liked it not to be taken seriously. "
She was particularly affected by the "Bang Showbiz" but in school time, when she prefers to dress like a lad: "Not all girls are typical girls.
That really hurt me.
When I was 11, the children told me I would look like a lad.
I felt really attacked, scared and ashamed.
Now I look back and think, 'girl, be proud of you!'.
Especially the public don't like to explain their love life: "People expect you to behave in a certain way and that annoys me.
And maybe some describe me as undeterred, but I don't like to have to justify myself to the whole public. "
West Virginia governor announces he changes the party
. The Democratic governor of West Virginia, Jim Justice, announced Thursday night at a rally with President trump that he will change the party.
Whether you like it or not, the Democrats have moved away from me, "Governor Justice said.
"Today I'll tell you with lots of prayers and a lot of reflection... today I'll tell you as a resident of West Virginia, I can't help you anymore if I'm a Democratic governor."
The rally erupted in jubilation.
"Tomorrow I will change my registration to Republicans," Justice added.
"As a coach, I would say it's time to play another game."
Mr. trump promised a big announcement at the West Virginia rally before.
Mr. trump won West Virginia with 42 points, and Justice did not approve Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice, who is the only billionaire in the state, according to Forbes, was elected in 2016.
Forbes notes that he owns coal mines in five states, and inherited a coal business from his father.
It is worth about $1.59 billion.
Meanwhile, the Republican National Committee issued a statement Thursday night in which it said: "The party change of Governor Justice is another blow to a Democratic Party that would rather prevent us than work to make our country great again."
"With only 15 governorships and the control of the least legislatures in history, the announcement of Governor Justice is only the last rejection of a party that is from top to bottom without leadership and is unable to find a positive, unifying message," RNC Chairman Ronna McDaniel said in a statement to CBS News.
CoE praises' honest 'Russian apology for doping scandal
The world's head of athletics, Sebastian CoE, praised Thursday for what he described as an obvious apology from Russia on a doping scandal, but he reiterated that it was not the moment for the country to get back into sport.
Russia's athletics chief Dmitry Shylakhtin said during the IAAF Congress on the eve of the athletics championships that his country's banishment from the sport was correct and that he was determined to fight doping.
He said he was sorry for "all the athletes who were taken away at competitions gold and silver medals."
Despite his comments, the IAAF Congress voted to uphold the ban imposed in November 2015 after a report by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) found evidence of state-sponsored doping in Russia.
"I thought it was a very open response today, a very honest presentation," IAAF president CoE told reporters.
"The entire council and the entire Congress were pleased that the Russian Federation recognised at itself that it has experienced some pretty hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the federation is redesigned."
CoE said he was also "pleased" with Russia accepting the criteria for its reinstatement.
"I think it was a very constructive day and I think progress has been made, but Congress supports the recommendations of the task force that this is not the moment to reinstate Russia," CoE said.
"We need to do everything in the next few months to normalize this situation.
The guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the tainted system, "he added
Nineteen Russian athletes will compete in the World Athletics Championships, which begin in London on Friday, according to the strict IAAF criteria as neutral players.
The head of the IAAF task force, Rune Andersen, said Monday that Russia still needs to meet some of the criteria for reinstatement.
Drug tests are still inadequate and banned trainers are still free, he told reporters in London after a lecture at the IAAF Council.
Marriage act for Mali's crashed soldiers
At a funeral ceremony in the Northern Hessen Fritzlar, around 1000 people have thought of the two soldiers killed in a helicopter crash in Mali.
The ceremony took place on Thursday in the cathedral city under high security arrangements.
To the still unresolved crash cause, Defense Minister Ursula von der Leyen (CDU) said nothing.
She called the two killed pilots, however, as the "skill of their compartment."
"We bow to this highest casualty, which they have provided on behalf of the Federal Republic of Germany," she explained.
The 33-year-old major and 47-year-old chief of staff from northern Hessen were killed a week ago in West African Mali.
Their coffins were transferred to Germany and on Thursday accompanied by a death guard of the Bundeswehr in the Fritzlarer Dom Sankt.
At noon, only the relatives in the church said goodbye.
After that, the funeral ceremony began in the circle of family, closest friends, representatives of the Bundeswehr as well as politics.
Among them were Hessen's prime minister, Volker Bouffier (CDU) and the chief inspector of the Bundeswehr Volker Wieker.
Funeral guests laid down roses, the relatives stood arm in arm at the coffins.
In front of the church, Fritzlarer and numerous soldiers watched the ceremony on a canvas.
Defense Secretary of the Leyen called the killed soldiers "highly decorated" and deployed.
The chief of staff has built the flight operations of the fighter helicopter tiger in Fritzlar and was one of the first six trained tiger pilots of his regiment.
Even Volker BauerSachs, commander of the regiment, to which the soldiers belong, said: "If this crew couldn't avert the crash, it wouldn't have been able to."
Doubts about the UN mission in Mali did not show Minister of the Leyen: The stakes are dangerous.
But he is also of high importance "for a country from which we are only separated by two states," she said.
After the funeral ceremony, the coffins were brought out of the cathedral.
When and where they will be buried, the Bundeswehr did not provide details.
Prince Henrik doesn't want grave next to his wife
The man of Danish Queen Margrethe (77), Prince Henrik (83), does not want to be buried next to his wife after his death.
This was shared by the Royal House on Thursday.
Traditionally, the Danish royal couple will be joined in the Cathedral Church of Roskilde.
The sculptor Bjørn Nørgaard produced a sarcophagus for the two.
The Queen agrees with her husband's decision, it would be said in the communication.
Where Prince Henrik is buried is still unclear.
But he did not intend to be joined at his French home.
Prince Henrik had never made a heck of it that he was not happy with his title.
After climbing his wife Margrethe in 1972, he would have liked to become king.
In 2016, he retired and also sets out the title of "princess."
Since Henrik in Denmark didn't get the title and the function he wanted, he did not see himself as equal to his wife - even after death, said Lene Balleby, the chief spokeswoman of the Danish kinghouse.
Where the last resting place of the 83-year-old will ultimately be, is still unclear.
However, he has no intention of being attached to his French homeland, but in Denmark.
He likes the country for which he has worked for the last 50 years.
Born Henri de Laborde de Monpezat, son of a French nobleman, Margrethe had met in London in 1965.
On the Thames, he worked in the French embassy.
During his later wife's expressions of sympathy for the people, Prince Henrik had a serious stand in his almost 50-year reign at the Danes.
In an autobiography, Henrik said over the first few years in Denmark: "A few months after my arrival, everything I did was criticised.
My Danish was volatile, I preferred wine rather than beer, silk turkey instead of knit socks, Citroën instead of Volvo, tennis rather than football.
Even for the Gauloises, which I smoked instead of Virginia-tobacco and who had the reputation of being the brand of social-critical intellectuals, I couldn't hope for leniency.
I was different.
I seemed to be happy with that position and not to be ashamed.
These were two mistakes! "
Prime Minister Weil wants swift reelection
CDU and FDP ahead of possible majority in Lower Saxony
Dutch Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) is in favour of a rapid reelection of the country after the loss of the red-green government, but he does not want to resign.
It was because of the dissolution of Parliament on Friday.
Earlier, the surprising departure of a Green MP from her country parliament in Lower Saxony had plunged the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) into a severe crisis.
Five months before the official deadline of the state election, the red-green coalition in Hanover lost its narrow one-vote majority in parliament to the opposition from the CDU and the FDP.
Previous Greens MP Elke Twest justified her move with the non-nomination for the 2018 election in her constituency in Rotenburg (Wümme).
"I see my political future in the CDU," she declared in Hanover on Friday.
CDU leader Björn Thümler wants his group to recommend it to be included.
In this way, the CDU and the FDP would have 69 seats in the Lower Saxony state, the SPD and the Green 68.
So far, the ratio has been reversed.
The new country will be elected on January 14 next year.
Thüller said the red-green state government must now decide whether to govern in this situation without a majority.
However, Stephan Weil thinks it is essential that the country decide its self-resolution as soon as possible.
The CDU group is expected to decide on its further action on Tuesday.
The country's constitution also provides for the possibility that the country will cut the trust and elect a successor to the Prime Minister.
"Our Constitution offers several options.
These opportunities need to be considered legally clean, "Thümler said.
"You will discuss calmly all the issues when they are legally properly examined."
Thüller called Twest's move "but something curious."
The politician himself stressed: "I'm not a seducer.
I feel very good. "
She described himself as a supporter of black green.
The Greens urged the renegade MPs to return their country's office.
"We are, of course, assuming that, with immediate effect, she will return her country estate mandate that she has received through the Green Landeslist," the country's leaders met Meta Janssen-Kucz and Stefan Körner.
The group's chairman, Anja Piel, said: "We regret the decision by Elke Twest extraordinary."
She has deliberately chosen not to hold a debate in the group.
"Even against the background that there were no substantive differences, we cannot understand this move."
SPD chancellor Martin Schulz condemns the departure of the Dutch Greens MP Elke Twest to the CDU as a betrayal.
"The behavior of the former Green MPs in Lower Saxony is not only treason to the voters, but also betrayal of red green," the Federal Chief of Social Democrats wrote on Facebook on Friday.
He supports the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) to quickly re-elect the country.
The exit Twest costs red green in Lower Saxony the majority.
The politician "in her violated vanity and in her frustration her personal interests before the good of the country," criticized SPL Secretary Hubertus Heil.
"It's a scandal that the CDU in Lower Saxony is involved in this dirty intrigue game and is trying to capitalize on it."
Dutch CDU leader Björn Thümler wants to recommend his MP to include Elke Twest in the CDU.
The leader of the SPD in the Bundestag, Thomas Oppermann, accused Twest of falsifying the result of the 2013 state election with personal career thinking.
At the time the CDU was in front of the SPD's strongest force, SPD and Greens had a razor-thin majority of one vote in the country.
Agriculture Minister in the interview - How do we protect ourselves from toxins, Mr Schmidt?
Germany discusses contaminated eggs.
How could the scandal happen?
How can consumers protect themselves.
Agriculture Minister Christian Schmidt (CSU) is in the interview with the editorial network of Germany (RND) speech and response.
Mr Schmidt, how can consumers protect themselves from poisoned eggs?
I can only encourage all consumers to look carefully at the eggs in your fridge and check the stamp print.
On the consumer protection portal www.foodwarnung.de, the federal states provide the latest information about the affected egg batches.
Affected eggs should be destroyed or returned.
Even if, after everything we know at the moment, a health hazard is virtually excluded.
Is ALDI now taking the best possible crisis response - all eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the Enlightenment is not really perceived by the Federal Minister for Agriculture?
Food monitoring is the task of the federal states.
Nevertheless, my house has opened up immediately and has been in close exchange with the authorities of the countries since it became known to the people of Germany.
All information and risk assessment are available for consumers.
Trade has just as much as manufacturers to ensure that the products sold are commercially viable and safe.
If the residue level of eggs is exceeded by 0,005mg / kg, they are not available.
Untainted eggs, however, can be sold and eaten.
This time, not the farms are to blame.
Are production companies and consumers sitting in the same boat?
According to the current level of knowledge, production companies are not directly responsible.
Instead, they have to face economic damage due to alleged illegal practices by service companies.
As always, there are too few inspectors in the serious case.
Is there only a lack of staff or a coherent competence?
It was just the official controls that exposed the process.
The truth, however, is that food fraud and criminal energy can never be excluded 100%.
It is precisely for this reason that a consistent explanation of such events and the handover to the public prosecutors in cases where crimes can be available are crucial.
I have made it clear on several occasions that I expect a full explanation from the authorities responsible.
Is the regular alarm in food scandals really necessary?
Consumers have the right to obtain only safe and accessible food.
When an unauthorised insecticide is used in the food industry, consumers are rightly outraged.
As a result of the adulterated means, manufacturers, dealers and consumers are in a situation that is absolutely not necessary.
In principle, it must be clear: The illegal use of the insecticides Fipronil in the attitude of food-supplying animals is unacceptable and must be terminated immediately.
This must be done consistently and with high pressure at all levels.
I expect all the relevant authorities to ensure that the situation is cleared up quickly and fully.
How football's financial rules affect Neymar's move to Paris
The rules aimed at preventing unhindered spending by European football clubs will not disrupt Neymar's world record transfer from the Spanish Barcelona to French Paris-Saint Germain.
Any consequences will still come for Paris Saint-Germain of UEFA, because the senior organisation overseeing the European game has the power to ban teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament.
Financial Fair Play rules launched by UEFA in 2011 mean that PSG will have to prove at some point that the transfer from Neymar was funded without major losses.
Barcelona has paid 222 million euros ($262 million) to buy out the Brazilian out of its contract, and Neymar will receive a salary that will be several tens of millions of dollars a year.
Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymar's move to France.
PSG can certainly make the money loose so that Neymar is underwriting and bringing him into a galaxy of other stars, given the team's funding through the energy rich man's family of Qatar.
Clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money on acquiring players but must counter with legitimate revenue streams that allow them the break-Even point in their on football-related business.
FFP was conceived by Michel Platini after his election to the UEFA president in 2007.
The former French player believed clubs who had taken huge debts in their pursuit of success were effectively cheating and risked ruining themselves when banks or owners withdrew their support.
In 2011, FFP shifted from focusing on the clubs' debt to monitoring their losses.
The change meant that the business model, which Roman Abramovich originally used in Chelsea in 2003 - bought a club with potential and then invested heavily to improve the team and build a global brand - should become a tougher matter.
During the current three-year FFP disposition period, which runs until 2018, clubs can accept losses of EUR 30 million.
And although Platini has fallen from the presidency in disgrace in 2015, his UEFA successor, Aleksander Cefin, continues to advocate to deter excessive spending.
"Certainly, FFP is not dead and we will certainly reinforce the rules for the future," Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for FFP at UEFA, told The Associated Press last week.
Although PSG has paid Neymar's buy-out clause in a lump sum, it can distribute the amount for accounting over the duration of its contract.
Neymar has signed a five-year contract, allowing the transfer to be expelled for the next five years of £44.4 million in annual accounts.
The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 has hit PSG along with Abu Dhabi, which is owned by Manchester City, with the heaviest sanctions.
The PSG received a fine of 60 million euros (then $82 million), which was later reduced to 20 million euros - and it was ordered that the team members remain limited to 21 players for the 2014 / 15 season, rather than the otherwise normal 25 players.
UEFA is looking for clubs to try to outperform their financial supervision by inflating their revenue through companies linked to the owners of a club.
While a cathartic company could sponsor PSG if the value of sponsorship was to exceed standard market rates, UEFA would not be allowed to apply this as a legitimate income.
That is exactly what happened in 2014 when UEFA decided that the value of the PSA's sponsorship was inflated by the Qatar Tourism Authority.
It has been reported that part of the PSG payments to Neymar could come over payments from the organizing committee of the World Cup in Qatar in 2022.
But PSG and Qatar 2022 have denied that Neymar will become World Cup ambassador and such a maneuver could easily be found out for the UEFA regulators.
Previous sanctions against PSG mean that UEFA will be even more attentive to respecting any attempt to circumvent the rules.
UEFA had no preparatory talks with PSG over Neymar's transfer, saying on Thursday the people familiar with the situation said.
They spoke on condition of anonymity with The Associated Press as they were not authorized to discuss the PSG situation.
The latest published reports show that PSG 2015 / 16 achieved a profit of more than €10 million with a turnover of 542.4 million euros.
The accounts for the last fiscal year have yet to be published.
PSG expects Neymar's arrival to be a boon for sponsorship deals, merchandising and jersey sales.
The club assumes that sales will increase by at least 30 per cent after signing.
The Spanish league was clearly irritated to see one of the best football players go, and they tried to prevent Neymar's move by claiming that PSG would violate the FFP.
"It is a clear case of" financial doping "with the club and the state," said the president of the La Liga, Javier Tebas, the Spanish daily as in relation to Qatar's eventual ownership of PSG.
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, whose club is owned by an American sports tycoon, shares La Liga's reservations against a state that funds a club.
"It's the consequence of ownership and that has completely changed the entire landscape of football over the last 15 years," Wenger said Thursday.
"Once a country owns a club, anything is possible.
It will be very difficult to respect the financial fair play because you can go different ways or have different interests when a country has such a big player to represent a country. "
Swiss is looking for a new bowling supplier
In recent years, chocolat Frey has produced Frey on-board chocolate for the Swiss.
Now, the sweetness of cooperation faces a possible end: The airline is rewriting the order.
Swiss spokeswoman Meike Fuhlrott confirmed a corresponding report from the newspaper "Northwestern Switzerland" on Friday, on request from the SDA news agency.
According to current planning, the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018.
The products would be reviewed every two to three years and subjected to quality control.
"With the current supplier chocolat Frey we are very pleased," the spokeswoman said.
About 17 million small red-white boxed shotguns at 14 grams each year distribute the flight attendants before landing to the passengers.
Over the cost, the Swiss did not want to provide details.
Industry insiders estimate the volume of contract according to "Northwestern Switzerland" to 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the Migros subsidiary achieves annual sales of around one billion Swiss francs.
But more important is the advertising effect: It is a prestigious order for a chocolate manufacturer.
How many applicants there are in the new contender does not want to betray the Swiss.
In question, however, only Swiss manufacturers are coming.
According to the newspaper report, chocolat Frey wants to seek a renewal of the contract beyond the spring of 2018.
For the SDA, the largest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not available for comment.
Chocolate boards have distributed the Swiss since 2006 on board their flights.
Before the Swiss completed a contract with the Migros daughter, Barry Callebaut had delivered chocolate tablets in collaboration with Hug.
The ability to place the logo led Swiss two-and-a-half years ago with the start of co-operation with chocolat Frey.
The airline is working with different Swiss chocolate producers.
On long-haul flights, First Class customers are pampered with delicacies from the Confiserie Sprüngli, in Business Class nasal passengers Schoggi of Lindt and in Economy Class Schoggi of chocolat Frey.
Swiss Schoggi is also distributed by chocolat Frey on the short haul, both in business and economy class.
Athletics - Discussion Olympic champion Robert Harting reaches World Cup final
The three-time world champion is fighting a medal on Saturday in the final.
His brother, Christoph, Olympic champion from 2016, had failed in the national World Cup draw and was able to look at the floppy competition only from the grandstand.
Also with the first attempt, Polish defending champion Piotr Malachowski, who threw 65.13 yards, qualified for the final fight.
Nostalgia goes into "Wet hot American Summer" and "Comrade Detective" in the niche
This repeat of the story is simultaneously nostalgic for the glorious days of the characters "80s, for the 90-year-old grunge era (when the presenters David Wain and Michael Showalter turned the sketch comedy" The State "for MTV), and for themselves - that is, for 2001, before their stars, such as Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd went to bigger things.
As a cultural artifact, it is equally a parody and an embodiment of our Facebook-capable era of permanent memories.
But as a franchise, it feels like time is short.
"First Day of Camp" worked surprisingly well, not only because of its absurd humor (it included an original story for a talking can of vegetables spoken by H. Jon Benjamin).
By stiffening up at the heart of the gags - actors of middle-aged play, horny kids who grow up - they nonetheless created the impossibility of winning back the final part of the joke.
"Ten Years Later," with his adults now playing adults, is less emotionally entrenched and his parody goes more according to the casting principle, including a riff on the stalker movies of the 90-year-old like "The Hand That rocks the cradle" ("The Hand That's the cradle").
At one point, a character stares through an Apple Powerbook, some inline skates and "a number of other things from 1991."
Many of the central stories are the same.
The amiable coop (Mr. Showalter), now novelist, has still not forgotten Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) has still not lost his virginity.
And there is another crazy-bad plot in which Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter) is involved, who is now supported by George H. W. Bush (a well-managed impression of Michael Ian Black).
As always, the excursions are the best part of the franchise.
It's especially fun to see the forever young Mr. Rudd, who shows Matt Dillon's underlip beard of "singles," whose former Big Man-on-camp Andy now feels like an old knack.
It's the moments of random madness that could fuel this franchise like a kind of repetitive "Seven Up!" Series until he reaches what I accept as his logical conclusion: "Wet hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later," whose final scene will show the gang as they attend the film premiere of "Wet hot American Summer."
"Comrade Detective" on Amazon is now reminiscent of another kind of nostalgia: To the revival of the Cold War of "The Americans," to the film "Atomic blonde" and even to "GLOW" with its East-against-West Ringfight iconography.
The comedy created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka, with Rhys Thomas as a director, admits to being a found TV series: A Romanian drama of the 1980s with the two policemen as friends, two officers from Bucharest who are fighting for truth, atheism and the path of Marxism-Leninism.
The main roles - a hard-pressed Gregor and an idealistic Iosef - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Ulici, whose dialogues are synchronized by Channing Tatum (also an executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt in English.
It's a brilliant idea.
But it's not much more than an idea.
There are some beautiful gags to reputation (the police spend the time watching chess on television, as Americans may do with football).
And the list of famous speakers - including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny - makes for a decent game 'find the voice out'.
But "Comrade Detective" is so much committed to the veracity of a desperate propaganda drama - a murderer wearing a Reagan mask - that it often plays like a single one.
At six long episodes, it pulls out, and the comedy is not fast or frequent enough.
"Comrade Detective," which was edited at a lower length, could better deliver its agitprop satire as Gregor and Iosef repeatedly visit the American Embassy, whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who devour a bunch of hamburgers.
The message for the imagined communist audience is that Western culture can do everything to feed for a gelage.
The fictional Romanian creators were not wrong: We are even doing it with our own recent history and with theirs.
Blow to drug mafia in the country
The police have struck a blow to the Italian mafia in Baden-Württemberg.
On Wednesday morning, a large number of objects were searched in the Black Forest Bar circle, in Rottweiler, Konstanz, Esslingen and Stuttgart, as the prosecution told Konstanz on Friday.
In doing so, 15 defendants aged between 25 and 77 were arrested and arrest warrants were already issued against them.
In addition, officials provided larger amounts of marijuana and cocaine, firearms as well as several hundred thousand euros.
Two people were arrested during simultaneous raids in Italy.
There were German warrants against the two suspects in Italy.
The two are therefore likely to be delivered to Germany.
Italian and Bavarian investigators were involved in the action.
A total of over 300 police officers were deployed.
The members of the mafia are accused of organised drug crime, serious acts of violence, attempted murder and robbery and extortion.
Since the summer of 2016, the prosecution has been investigating the organised drug trade in the south German region.
Between the prosecutors in Konstanz and Palermo, a regal exchange and investigators from the Kripo Rottweiler had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily.
As a result, the big stakes were also accompanied by four officials from Palermo on Wednesday morning.
In the case of the investigations, it was mainly Italian nationals with a close relationship with the Italian mafia.
An incident on May 27 in Hüfingen, in which several shots were fired into a restaurant early in the morning, is likely to go to the gang's account.
Way complains of big gaps in the foreigner register
"Data from citizens who should not appear": According to a report, the foreigners register in Germany has significant shortcomings.
This leads to some serious errors in asylum procedures.
According to a media report, the representative of the Federal Government's refugee management agency, Frank-Juergen Weise, has drawn attention to large gaps in the foreign central register.
Deficiencies in the data registered there could lead to "some serious misjudgments" in asylum procedures and deportations, according to an analysis presented by the Süddeutsche Zeitung.
According to the data, ten million people are covered by foreign nationality, including around 5.7 million from non-EU countries.
The data is therefore administered by about 600 foreign authorities in Germany.
Because the data has not been adequately maintained, data quality has not been good in parts so far.
In individual cases, data from 1921 had been found, "of people who are no longer alive, or of citizens who have become German citizens and should no longer appear in the register."
"Faulty data sharing can significantly slow return processes," the report said.
There are also EU citizens who would not have to leave in the statistics on people leaving outside the Union.
Such false allocations, however, led "to a distorted debate on the handling of exit duties," according to the analysis.
Meanwhile, the federal government appears to have begun returning refugee families with under 16-year-old children back to Italy when they arrived from there.
This is based on an internal paper by the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF), the New Osnabrück newspaper reports.
The paper therefore states that the BAMF is conducting such procedures "concerning families with children - with the exception of infants and infants - to Italy since June 1, 2017."
Since the end of 2014, that has been virtually impossible, according to the newspaper, citing the difficult situation on the ground.
The Dublin Convention is responsible for refugees from the EU State, which they first reach.
If a migrant travels to another EU country, this state can send him back to the country of entry.
On the grounds, the office now writes: "Meanwhile, the absorption capacity for families with underage children in Italy has significantly increased."
Italy has made guarantees for the reception and accommodation of families.
Even the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) considers these pledges to be sufficient.
Other EU countries would also send refugees back there as part of the Dublin Convention.
The Home Office spokeswoman for the Left Group in the Bundestag, Ulla Jelpke, criticised this decision: "Families with children face human-unlawful reception conditions and a threat to child welfare because of the shortcomings in the Italian asylum system."
Zweig's earnings score
A total of 220 litres of blood from people living in Oberrichbach have already provided the blood donation service to other people.
At least of the 12 citizens who were awarded Friday.
In the meantime, Juergen Greule, who has now shared 50 litres of blood with his 100 donations.
Traditionally, the community in the council's meeting honors the multiple willingness to donate blood.
"It's ingenious how our body is designed for it and we pay respect to the donors who provide their blood to strangers, still unselfish," Mayor Karlheinz Kistner pointed out.
"A single blood donation helps several people," explained the district's leader of the German Red Cross (DRC), Holger Maisenbacher, because canned food is broken into its components.
For example, three people could benefit from a blood donation.
At the same time, Maisenbacher reported the actions carried out in the spring in Oberrichbach.
"This year, with 114 donors, we achieved the second-best result," said the Rangers County Council leader.
Obviously, the move to the theater house a few years ago led to higher subscriber numbers.
Even before that, Thomas Bockstadt, Susanne Reichle, Sandra Schöck, Thomas Reichle and Meta Umbeer were among the multiple donors and were awarded 50 blood donations each.
Half as many as Herbert Mair and Dorothee Riexinger, while Tamara Pbrymmer, Petra Schleeh, Stefanie Stoll and Uwe Vetter spent ten times each 500 millilitres of their life juice.
The Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged after weak economic growth and the slowdown in inflation have dampened speculation about a rise.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain "sluggish" when it retained interest rates on family incomes in the middle of an intensifying pressure.
Policymakers of the Monetary Committee (MPC) of the Bank voted 6-to-2 to keep interest rates at 0.25%, with fewer members seeking an increase this month as weak economic growth has weakened support for an increase.
In its quarterly inflation report, the bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7% and for 2018 to 1.6% and warned that pressure on household incomes would continue, with inflation expected to rise to just under 3% in the autumn.
But it signaled that interest rate hikes in the next few years would be needed to rein in the inflation-fuelled inflation and said that borrowing costs may have to rise more than expected in financial markets.
Members also voted to withdraw some of the mammoth stimulus package issued a year ago after Brexit.
It will call for time for the funding plan to provide cheaper funding for banks from next February, although it has been said that it is now expected to raise £15 billion more within the framework of this system - with £115 billion.
Minutes after deciding on the interest rate, the bank said: "In the MPC's central forecast, gross domestic product (GDP) remains weak in the short term as pressure on household incomes continues to strain consumption."
On interest rates, she reiterated that "a certain tightening of monetary policy" would be needed to cool inflation and a "slightly larger" scale than markets expect.
Markets are currently forecasting the first rise in next year's third quarter and another in 2020.
However, the bank stressed that increases would be "gradual" and "limited."
The bank's revised growth forecasts for this and next year are compared to the 1.9% and 1.7% forecast in May.
It has maintained its growth forecast to 1.8% in 2018.
The pound fell after that news against the dollar and the euro.
The pound fell 0.5% to $1.31 and fell 0.4% to EUR 1.11.
The decision to no change comes after recent disappointing growth figures dampened rising expectations for a rate hike and GDP rose to 0.3% in the second quarter from 0.2% in the previous three months.
Growth is expected to be up 0.3% in the third quarter, although it will easily recover after the bank fell against the end of the year.
The latest inflation report offered little enthusiasm for households affected by rising inflation and minor salary increases as tightening first becomes worse before it gets better then.
She added that monetary policy in the next few years could not "prevent" the income collapse, but she added that wages will recover "significantly" at the end of its three-year forecast.
The economy is also strengthened by rising demand for UK goods, which is due to the weak pound, which will compensate for some of the lower consumer spending.
The decision comes a year after cutting interest rates to 0.25% last August after the shocking EU vote that caused the sinking of the pound.
The bank estimates it will likely take four years before it will fully achieve prices and the economy.
Before the bank's last ruling on interest rates, the call for an interest rate hike had risen as inflation boosted pressure on hard-pressed households, with three policy makers calling for an increase to 0.5% in July.
Inflation has fallen from 2.9% in June to 2.6% in June, although the bank said this was expected and will attract it again in the coming months.
The bank said the transgression relative to its 2% target was "quite" attributable to the weak pound.
Andrew Montlake, director at Coreco Mortgage brokers, said: "Given the recent decline in swap rates, the mortgage market is likely to become more competitive again, as lenders are clamoring for business and want to end the year in a positive way.
The market looks particularly good for those where the existing deals expire and the new mortgages finish, and many with toll-free options and low rates are becoming more and more popular. "
NHS (The National Health Service) is to prescribe controversial HIV drug 10,000 people
Patients will be given access to a "transformative" HIV prevention treatment from September after a fight in front of the High Court against funding for the drug in the NHS.
NHS England announced that a pre-sex drug overdose (prep), which can reduce the risk of infection in high-risk patients by about 86 per cent, is now being delivered by the health service via an initial three-year study for an estimated 10,000 people.
He agreed to fund the process after the Court of Appeal upheld a Supreme Court ruling last year, saying the NHS had the power to pay for the prep despite claims that local authorities should fund it.
The move announced on Thursday was welcomed by NHS England boss Simon Stevens as "important new intervention," while the National Aids Trust (NAT) described this as a "crucial moment."
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to allow people to sign up and more clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced across England in April 2018.
Preexposure prophylax (prep) is a consequence of HIV preparations taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
Studies have shown that Prep significantly reduces HIV transmission in infectious diseases.
Taking prep before intercourse means that just enough drugs are present in a person's body to prevent HIV infection.
Such drugs can be taken every day or as early as two hours before intercourse.
Among those eligible for treatment include gay or bisexual men, transsexual and people with HIV-positive partners who have not been treated successfully.
In clinics, appropriate participants are identified, who agree with the study, including men, women, transgender and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by antiretroviral treatment.
People who live in England and are registered with a family doctor may also sign up for possible participation at their local participating sexual clinic.
The programme will be £10 million and NHS England signed a contract to supply the drugs this week following an international competitive procurement.
The study is intended to assess the entire potential of Prep by collecting clinical evidence, as targeted, recorded and implemented on a large scale.
Stevens said: "This big new intervention should complement and overhaul the far-reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV.
It is another milestone in the more than three decades of progress in managing one of humanity's biggest health challenges. "
Deborah Gold, chief executive at NAT (National Aids Trust), said: "This is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV.
Prep, if targeted at needy and vulnerable people, offers the opportunity to change the English HIV epidemic.
From September, people with high HIV risk will have access to this NHS-funded effort in England to develop a new instrument that is truly individually controlled and is not subject to a negotiation with a partner, leading to the improvement of many, many lives.
We warmly welcome this announcement. "
Ian Green, chief executive of the Terrence Higgins Trust, said: "The priority must now be to ensure that the study is carried out quickly across the country and that no one who has a risk for HIV will be left behind.
Now that prep test medicine has been acquired, we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV-infected people. "
Sharon Hodgson, shadow health secretary, said: "The start of the prep process is welcome and overdue after months of delays and hesitant implementation by the government.
The evidence shows how transformative this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transmission of this life-changing infection.
This attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the advantages of Prep.
Now it is important that this study be carried out as soon as possible across the country to protect people who are HIV-infected and that it will help us get a step closer to ending the spread of HIV in society. "
Living the big life: Hecklers and clever designer tricks have turned this little Earls Court home into a generous home
Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, narrowed down from a large house in Knightsbridge to an Earls Court apartment in 2014.
It is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it's proof of the new design that Joanne has not packed and sold her bags.
"Before that I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much bigger room," Joanne says.
"I was looking for something that was comparable to my price.
I was shown this flat in Earls Court and she had the same high ceilings.
I fell in love with them and made an offer that day. "
Since the first visit, the 1,000 square foot tall apartment has been completely overtaken.
Originally a one-bedroom property with a nested layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get to the bedroom - wanted Joanne Staudroom and an intermediate floor to make the most of the generous ceiling height.
"I wanted high ceilings, big windows, a lot of light.
That was my requirement, "she says.
To that end, she instructed the Architecture and Design Studio Duck & Shed by Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill to use the 12.5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not just a development but also a place to live for Joanne.
The ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms in a row, so the architectural challenge was to create an intermediate floor where you could stand.
Erfan had to think creatively to solve the preset.
"The steelwork is quite complicated," he explains.
"We had to arrange the rooms so they were stacked in a row without us having to be blasted.
It was not just a matter of building a simple platform, but building the steel so that it had the right height for the function above or below. "
This arrangement allowed Erfan to place two rooms in full height, with much extra drama.
For the intermediate floor, a classic copper light window of retrouvius looks down over the glamorous lounge area.
Mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program.
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theaters, space and light.
At both ends, a short corridor is mirrored to allow him to work longer.
In the kitchen, the mirrors feel like a window into another room.
At the entrance, mirrored units provide space for all cutlery and glasses of Joanne.
By perception of a more glamorous space, the beauty of the living room can shut the kitchen when it is not used.
Coffable kitchens are nothing new.
The special thing about this is that it is a garage door.
"A bit of engineering went out there," explains Erfan of the steel-reinforced, furnished MDF door.
"It's opposite, so if you push the door up, it's very easy to glide."
Thanks to the clever use of space and storage space, Joanne was able to win an extra 16 m ², an extra bedroom and an improved layout.
"At the end of the day, you'll sell the base area - or how your property is valued," says Erfan.
"In a rudimentary form, a real estate agent will enter and make a calculation based on the floor size."
Here they managed to magnify the floor space while using high-quality materials that give the space its luxurious advantage.
"The materials are the things you touch and which therefore help create an emotional bond in a home," says Erfan.
"You don't fall in love with the electrical sockets in the walls.
These are important, but they don't play with your heart. "
It shows that an apartment can transform itself through good design and elevated square meters of something by default into something quite amazing.
In fact, like Joanne, you could choose not to leave it.
Brothers fight for a $500 million property empire
Two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty, in a confrontation because of one of Victorias's biggest property empires worth over $500 million.
The former director of the Carlton Football Club and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a villa in Toorak, just three doors away from his younger brother Paul, which has brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how to split their property and business assets.
Paul wanted to withdraw from the family business since 2014, but a sharp clash over the separation takes place in the Supreme Court.
Along with her mother Anna, the brothers own 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars, accumulated since the family bought a shop in Smith Street, Collingwood in 1973.
There, the family founded Westco jeans and grew to a chain of 160 retail stores.
It was sold for $85 million in 1999.
This money was invested in properties, and De Lutis's portfolio now includes offices in the City Centre, the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento, the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller as well as shopping centers in the suburbs.
According to an agreement with her late father, Colin - from Paul as the "main operator and the dominant personality" in the De Lutis family - has described - about two-thirds of the company's wealth and Paul about a third.
A court filing says this means that Colin owns property worth $316 million and Paul worth $176 million.
The division of properties and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul.
"The divisions proposed by Colin have left him with what I thought was the best objects," he wrote in a first affidavit in 2015.
Last Friday, after several failed mediation, the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place.
The brothers are now also fighting for control of the existing business - of which Colin, as Paul claims, has ruled him out.
Colin argues this is not true, but accuses Paul of managing some possessions incompetent.
In an early affidavit filed by Colin, he says he hopes to settle the dispute.
"My Italian heritage writes that the family is the main priority," he wrote.
The cost is rising in the case, with hundreds of pages with affidavits, e-mails and reports from companies including Deloitte, pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and with leading attorneys, including Allan Myers, QC, and from both sides held law firms.
Ms De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated milk bars and delicatessen shops from the late 1950-era and bought a shop in Brunswick in the early 1970s.
They used the security to buy the Collingwood property, in which Colin opened the family's first Jeansshop.
Colin says he started Westco there when he was "in my last years of high school when Paul was still a little kid (about 10 years old)."
Anna De Lutis says she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to pass their property amicably to their sons.
"Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to land in court," she wrote.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis business group, with Colin claiming that Mark was paid $10 million and Luke $26 million when leaving the company.
Both Lukas and Mark are, so Paul said "over the terms of their financial separation have become bitter."
Colin has been very restrained, though he was a former AFL board member and, according to a 2015 biography of Eddie McGuire, the TV star's best friend.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers.
Only Colin replied by SMS to say "I really can't say much" because the case is before the courts.
"It is very, very sad that my brother Paul decided to sue me and pull our family name through the courts," he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote in a letter to the court that he tried to meet his brother's demands.
"Our father would not have wanted Paul and I would end up in our current dispute," he said, adding that he "still hopes for a solution."
On Friday, that hope seemed over.
"Our matter will be resolved by the courts in the near future," Colin wrote.
Trump's new chief of staff plans to restrict the president's media abstinence.
Others tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly actually can do it.
If so, he will be the first.
Politico reports that the White House's new chief of staff plans to restrict the flow of information to President trump - including news media reports - in hopes of keeping the boss on a more consistent course.
Here's a piece by reporter Josh Dawsey:
"When John F. Kelly, the White House's new chief of staff, met with senior staff on his first day of work, he posed a major problem in President Donald trump's White House that he wanted to repair: Bad information that got into the president's hands.
Kelly told staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in briefings - because the president would make better decisions if he received good information. "
Kelly's diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to tame trump by overseeing his media diet.
President trump's relationship with television dates back decades - and now that he is in the White House, his television advertising is still strong.
"If candidate trump was upset because of an unfair coverage, it was productive to show him that he received fair coverage of jobs that were to be convinced," former campaign adviser Sam Nunberg said in February against politico.
Politicos Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that "the key to keeping trump's Twitter habit under control, according to six former campaign officials, is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady praise."
Okay.
But the idea that trump's Twitter habit was ever "under control" is ridiculous.
Perhaps these campaign officials know something we don't know - that trump's tweets would have included more spark without their interventions.
We'll probably never know anything about the tweets that trump hasn't sent.
If his staff were able to keep trouble away from him some times, their efforts were worth it.
But no one has consistently prevented trump from causing controversy.
Part of the problem is that people in a White House composed of competing parties are repeatedly trying to advance their own agenda by presenting trump material that may promote their views from the world.
Politico - preoccupied with this story - reported in May about the consultants' preference to provide dubious information to the president for strategic reasons.
This was an example described by reporter Shane Goldmacher:
"Current and former trump officials say that trump, like a volcano, can respond to negative press releases, especially those with damaging leaks, and that he is bent on figuring out where they come from.
That's exactly what happened in late February, when someone gave the president a printed copy of an article from GotNews.com, the site of Internet provocateur Charles C. Johnson, who accused Deputy Chief of Staff Katie Walsh of being "the source behind a pile of leaks" at the White House.
Although Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter because of harassment or that he has offered no specific evidence or that he has expressed false allegations in the past and has revoked it.
Trump read the article and began questioning staff about Walsh. "
Goldmacher added that then-Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and the White House's general secretary, Rob Porter, "have tried to implement a system to manage and document the paperwork that trump receives."
How did that work out?
Kelly is trying three months later to do the same.
Perhaps he will prove to be a more effective manager than Priebus, but trump is still his impulsive self, and his advisers are still seeking influence.
These immutable factors make Kelly's mission very difficult.
Most-wanted criminals get post from Europol
As the address is unknown, the assistance of the population is requested and hoped for.
Police across Europe are sending (virtual) postcards to dangerous criminals on the run this summer.
As the addresses of the serious criminals are not, naturally, known, indications from the population are hoped and requested.
Europol reported Friday of the action, which follows the "EU Most Wanted" advent calendar of winter.
Experience has shown that many volatile destinations hide from Europol.
There were 21 postcards for sought-after criminals from 21 EU countries.
Since 2016, the website www.eumostwanted, more than 2.5 million times, has been seen.
Thirty-six of the online geologists have been arrested so far, at least 11 of them because of clues after the release on the website.
Travelers negotiate a ditch and return to 'millionaire row'
Some of the West Midlands's wealthiest homeowners are back with some determined travelers on war ground, which have negotiated a ditch drawn by the community to reclaim a field in front of their mansions.
Travelers parked their 20 caravans on a field outside a wealthy street of Solihull, dubbed the "millionaire series."
They have brought horses, babies and an army of vans after they were only thrown out in May, but without being deterred by a ditch excavated by the council to prevent their incursions.
The taciturn group found a gap in defense facilities and pushed their vehicles through a section that remained unobstructed to find a way.
Angry residents have pressed the council of Solihull, who said it was "useless to deal with the problem."
An anonymous resident said: "They moved there on Monday night after being sent by Bentley Heath, where they threw stones at the passers-by.
The Council must be forced into action by shame, because it was useless when dealing with the problem.
The travelers were there in May, moved on and are now back.
More came last night, probably more today. "
She added: "The Council of Birmingham knows how to deal with it by holding long undercuts to protect their parks.
I live on Streetsbrook Road and I'm not happy to continue to pay my community tax if the council can't even stop it. "
One resident, who did not want to be named, said: "It is ridiculous we have just seen the last round of these travelers, only to be looted by another round.
The numbers have increased this time and you've even seen a horse in the park area. "
A spokeswoman for the council of Solihull said: "We are aware of an unauthorized camp on the land beyond Streetsbrook Road and are working with Solihull's police and we are taking the necessary legal action so that they move forward as soon as possible.
In order to support our collection of evidence, it is very important that as many residents as possible report anti-social or criminal behaviour to the police by calling 101.
This helps create a picture of the situation in which the court has to examine when we will present our case. "
From Sheenhof will be Waldhotel Luise
The Waldhotel Luise is located in the former Hotel Schenhof.
The house in front of the gates of Freudenstadt is currently being renovated and is scheduled to reopen on March 1 next year.
These are good news for the city.
Because of the closure of the Hotelhof hotel by the then ambient operating company mbH on 13 April 2014, some 30 000 nights were lost per year and also revenue through the tourist tax.
In the fall of 2014, in the face of dramatically increasing numbers of refugees who came to the county, the hotel building was offered to the county council as a gathering shelter, causing controversial discussions.
The city prevented the accommodation of asylum seekers by drawing up a building plan to secure the area as a hotel location.
The decision was not undisputed at the time in the local council.
But, above all, Freudenstadt Mayor Julian Osswald defended the hotel location and was already talking about serious interested parties at the house at the time.
He should be right.
The group of Luisenhotels with director Birgit Scherer, headquartered in Bad Bergzabern, has acquired the former Hotel Erhhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it back to a house of the three-star Plus category under the name Waldhotel Luise.
The group has four houses with the Freudenstadt object.
Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Herrenalb.
They are called Hotel Luise, Luisenpark, Parkhotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise.
At the former Hotel Schnehof you have been standing in front of the entrance for a long time, and when you enter the house it becomes clear what extensive renovations will be done.
The floors were torn out, blankets partly dismantled, old bathtubs removed from the rooms.
The whole hotel building is a single building site.
There is still a lot to be done by March.
"It's actually a nice hotel," Thomas Scherer says in conversation with our newspaper.
Everything is to be renewed in the Black Forest style.
The rooms are equipped with large walk-in showers, the entrance area is redesigned and new windows are built.
Everything should be "pretty close to the citizens" later, as Thomas Scherer expresses.
"We want to do a piece of jewelry."
Swimming pool, wellness area and a meeting room are part of the facilities.
You don't want to position yourself at the high level of hotels in Lauterbad, but already at an upscale downtown level, Scherer stresses.
The Waldhotel Luise, with its about 60 rooms, wants to develop broad, explains Scherer.
Both individual holidaymakers, groups or businessmen are expected to feel comfortable in the hotel.
Talks with OB Julian Osswald and tourism director Michael Krause have already led, according to Scherer.
The city's ideas are equal to those of the hotel group.
"We're on the same line."
Asked about the amount of investment, Thomas Scherer doesn't want to set out exactly.
Just under a million euros, he expects.
The outdoor facilities are also brought to the fore, which is already clearly visible.
In an inner courtyard there is a large terrace that will be accessible from the restaurant, which is public.
Thomas Scherer is optimistic: "Joy City is a good market."
Russia affair: U.S. special investigator sets up grand jury
In the Russia affair for U.S. President Donald trump, special investigator Robert Mueller is said to have used a so-called grand jury after a report.
The panel began work in recent weeks, The Wall Street Journal wrote, citing people familiar with the matter.
The newspaper hailed the move as a sign that Mueller expanded his investigation and stepped up.
CNN reported that there are already initial charges of the panel related to a meeting between trump's oldest son and a Russian lawyer.
U.S. intelligence officials have long accused the Kremlin of being targeted in the 2016 presidential race.
Mueller is investigating whether there were collusion between trump's campaign team and Moscow.
In the focus of the investigation, several men are expected to stand in the campaign as an adviser to the Republican.
According to reports, Mueller also scrutinized more and more trump's private and business environment.
The Washington Post wrote a few weeks ago that the special investigator had moved trump personally to the center and investigate the allegation whether the president may have hindered the judiciary in the wake of the affair.
Grand juries' main task is to examine available evidence in possible criminal cases and decide if charges are to be filed.
Grand juries are therefore also called charges.
Mostly they are switched on when it comes to larger and controversial cases.
The procedure is always done behind closed doors.
The panel can also be turned on by the prosecutor to summon people to interrogation under oath.
According to CNN, preliminary charges have already been issued around the meeting between Donald trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer.
People involved in the meeting were called to a statement, the report said.
They should also provide documents.
In addition to trump Jr., trump's advisers and son-in-law Jared Kushner, as well as his former campaign manager, Paul Manafort, were involved in the conversation.
Legal experts said on Thursday night on US television that the appointment showed that Mueller was not intimidated in his work and that if needed, he wanted to act quickly.
But it does not necessarily mean that the grand jury will end up being turned on to decide on the survey of a charge.
Still, the establishment of the panel is the start of a new phase in the investigations and a new reason for concern for President trump.
Amid the new revelations, the president made a speech in West Virginia on Thursday night to portray the Russia affair as a campaign of his political opponents.
"Russia's history is a total invention," trump said.
The issue gives Democrats a way to "feel good because they have nothing else that they can talk about."
His special adviser, Ty Cobb, said in an opinion that he knew nothing about setting up a grand jury.
But they usually work in secret, he pointed out.
The White House advocates any action that accelerated the special investigator's work on "fair" ways.
Former FBI chief James Comey has said three times that not being investigated against the president.
There is no reason to believe that something has changed, the statement said.
Mueller, however, was only used after trump fired Comey.
Because of this rout, allegations against trump had become loud that he wanted to obstruct the judiciary.
Comey said in June before a Senate committee that trump asked him for a halt to the investigation against then-national security adviser Michael Flynn.
The president is under great pressure because of the investigation.
After presenting U.S. media, the White House collected material against the special investigator and his staff.
That sparked speculation about whether trump wanted to sack Mueller.
Unlike an independent special investigator of Congress, such as in the Watergate affair surrounding the later resigned President Richard Nixon, Mueller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired at the president's insistence by the Justice Department.
Several senators from both parties, however, want to prevent such a move.
Two groups of Republican and Democratic senators unveiled lawmakers on Thursday, after which the special investigator could no longer be dismissed so easily.
Antarctica: Giant iceberg drives in Antarctica
In the West Antarctica, a gigantic iceberg has been solved by the almost seven-fold size of Berlin from the Schelleis.
This was shared by the Bremerhaven Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday.
Over a trillion tons of heavy and 5800 square kilometers of great colossus now drift north and will probably need two, three years until it has melted.
With 175 kilometers of length and width of up to 50 kilometers, it is one of the largest ice giants that researchers have registered over the past three decades.
It is not a threat to people.
The extent to which climate change has played a role in breaking the iceberg is unclear, according to research data.
Overall, however, there have been a series of unusual collapses of ice chelks in the region for about 30 years, the U.S. Research Center for Snow and Ice (NSIDC) writes in a factual background.
In the opinion of many researchers, this can be linked to global warming.
The now aborted colossus has so far been part of the Larsen-C-Schelkeis.
Schelfice floats on the sea and is fed by large glaciers.
It continues to grow into the sea and breaks down regularly.
The Larsen-C-Schelkeis is located south of South America almost at the top of the Antarctic Peninsula.
North of this sleekees, the balance of growth and breakage was disrupted a few years ago.
A complete slew of ice falls apart there, writes AWI researcher Daniela Jansen.
There is a lot to say that the Larsen-C-Schelkeis is in danger as well, because the front edge has never recovered as far as it is currently.
In addition, the ice sheet is under tension and can fall apart if a piece aborts at a key point.
The melting of shelky ice and iceberg does not increase sea levels as they swim on the water and squeeze ice as much water as it emerges after the melting itself.
However, the loss of the celestial ice causes the glaciers to flow directly into the sea and drain much faster than before.
This could possibly increase sea levels, but only to a lesser extent, writes the British research project on Antarctic observation (Midas).
The Larsen-C-Schelkeis is the fourth largest sleeke of Antarctica, according to AWI data, with almost 50 000 square kilometres.
On the transition from the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick, on the front edge to the free ocean about 200 meters.
It breaks out there regularly.
"Although it is a natural event and we are not aware of any direct link to climate change, the ice sheet is now coming into a more vulnerable position," said Martin O'Leary of British Swansea University.
"This is the furthest retreat since records began," he also acknowledged.
Among scientists, it is controversial whether the Larsen-C snake will now grow again or go back in the long term and possibly coincide, said his colleague Adrian Luckman and added: "Our models say it will be less stable."
But this development will take decades.
Even though these researchers do not attribute the demolition of this gigantic iceberg to climate change, in the past few decades, a lot of ice chelfs of the Antarctic Peninsula have fallen apart.
This long bay of Antarctica stretches towards South America.
According to data from the British Antarctic Survey's research programme, the ice sheet of the Antarctic Peninsula has dropped by 28,000 square kilometres since the 1950s.
The drop in temperature has contributed to the decline.
The Antarctic Peninsula has warmed by around three degrees over the past 50 years and is one of the areas where the temperature is rising fastest.
CDU wants domestic fare at staff
Because it is becoming increasingly difficult to fill vacancies, the CDU is asking to leave the employers' association to become more attractive.
Just before the summer recess, Kreiday has pushed 41 new posts in the administration.
More than 1100 employees and officials work for the district administration in Mettmann.
Now, once again, 17 trainees have their first working day behind them.
The teachers at the circle appear to be very coveted.
About 620 applications were recorded for the places to be awarded this year.
Nevertheless, the circle of staff is still lacking in order to cope with the increased demands and tasks.
At present, there are still 50 non-occupied posts at Mettmann.
Doctors and engineers as well as forces of general administration are being sought.
The CDU would like to take the initiative together with the FDP and the UWG in the Kreisday and oppose the lack of expertise in the administration.
According to the wishes of the parties, the administration is to "develop a concept of personnel development and personnel development."
The aim is not only to meet short-term needs of skilled workers, but to counter the future-oriented shortage of applicants, it says.
The overall concept should look inward and out, highlight concrete measures for cross-border workers and include a training offensive, calling for the CDU, the FDP and UWG.
That sounds like a good approach.
Because the circle has to do with personnel problems that you didn't know before.
Other cities advertise good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions.
The speech is of a veritable "competition of public employers."
This includes a large number of staff who leave hospital or age-related services out of service.
So it is high time to act so that there are not even more posts left vacant.
But Klaus-Dieter Volker, leader of the CDU, goes beyond the joint motion with his party.
He recently made a fistful surprise in the gym when he publicly questioned the staff cost cap and stunned the rest of the parties.
People want all the possibilities to be reviewed, which will allow the local employers' association to leave.
"If we do not come to a satisfactory solution here in the short term, the county administration should seek a domestic tariff with the unions - perhaps even in cooperation with the district cities -" according to peoples.
In doing so, the CDU is trying to pay the employees and officials better than the collective bargaining system actually provides for the public service.
The salaries are currently strictly prescribed, increases or more money only exist if you move to a higher level, which is geared towards professional years.
But the tasks of the circle have grown more and more in recent years.
Just a few weeks ago, new spaces had to be set up where employees took care of the provisions of the new prostitution law.
Not least by the rising number of asylum seekers, Councilman Thomas Hendelle and district director Martin Richter have a problem: They have too few staff.
Italy tightens the tone on NGO migrant rescue boats
Italy has warned NGOs that use rescue boats for migrants in the Mediterranean that they must not continue this unless they comply with new rules for their operations.
"If NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct, it is difficult to see how they can continue working," Interior Minister Marco Minniti said in an interview with the Turin daily La Stampa.
Minnitis' warning came a day after the Italian authorities seized a boat from the German aid organisation 'Youth Save' because their team had worked effectively with traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration.
The aid organization, which has only been in operation for a year, declined to comment on detailed allegations by the Italian prosecutor, Ambrogio Cartosio.
"For us, saving human life is our top priority, so we are very sorry that at the moment we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone," the organization said in an opinion on social media.
"We can only judge all the allegations currently being made after we have collected all the information and judge the situation."
The Italian authorities had been monitoring the boat of 'Youth Save', the Iuventa, since October.
It is believed that its crew is taking rubber boat migrants on board, which are supplied to them directly by traffickers, and that the smugglers can go off to allow the ships to be used again.
At least one such meeting reportedly took place just 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast, according to the prosecutor's file, whose contents were released by Italian media.
The crew is suspected of flouting the authority of the Italian Coast Guard, which monitors rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives.
Under the code of conduct, boats like Iuventa must, in particular, have an Italian police officer on board who monitors their activities.
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have so far agreed to stick to the code: Save the Children, MOAS from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain.
The latter said Thursday that the new rules would be deemed unnecessary but acceptable as they would not involve "significant changes or disabilities" of their bailouts.
Among those who refuse to sign is the Nobel Prize-winning organization Doctors Without Borders (MSF).
Minniti, meanwhile, said that the number of migrants who arrived in Italy after rescue operations fell sharply in recent weeks, indicating that efforts to strengthen Libya's coast guard and cooperation with local mayors have borne fruit.
"In the last few days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel," the minister said.
He announced plans for further talks with Libyan mayors this month on economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving those countries in the hope of reaching Europe.
Climbs and Trials
Nine Weilermer bikers, the "Berlin outpost" and two guest drivers met in Wachenheim in the Northern Pfalz to enjoy four days of Trials and sights.
Three friendly guides were available for this purpose.
The accommodation in the Wachenheimer Valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours.
The castle and wine festival of Wachenheim was a welcome extra.
The first tour resulted in hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Michael Chapel above Deidesheim.
It was followed by vantage points, partly on towers, of which you could look far beyond the Pfäzer forest and the prelaid plains.
In between, there were always longer climbs, for which long Trials were rewarded.
On the second day it went to Bad Dürkheim to Saline and the Volksfest sausage Market.
Again, vantage point at vantage point, connected by "flowige" Trials and moderate climbs.
On the last two days a lot of height meters were called.
Caves, rocks, towers, castles, ruins and refuge huts brought welcome breaks.
In Bad Dürkheim, the bikers breathed into the open air inhalatorium.
Neustadt was also headed.
After 173 kilometers and almost 4500 metres, the group met the Pfäzer Forest from its best side - sporting and cultural.
Console rather than turf - Bundesliga equips itself for e-sport
Do the sports stars sit in front of computer consoles in the future, instead of fighting through the wind and weather over the stadium race?
Fact is: E-sport has long become a serious industry, becoming a lucrative business - big stars, millions of fans and huge tournaments with high gags including.
This has also recognised the first Bundesliga clubs that are increasingly engaged in this area.
The start of the VfL Wolfsburg in 2015, followed by FC Schalke 04 and most recently the VfB Stuttgart, which founded an E-Sport department in mid-July and took two pros for the computer game FIFA 17 under contract.
"We hope to inspire quite new young target groups for the VfB," says CEO Jochen Röttgermann.
He is sure that a number of clubs are rising on this train. "
Next weekend, soccer World Association FIFA will organise the first "interactive Club World Cup" in London, where players from different clubs compete against each other.
In addition to Schalke and Wolfsburg, Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain or PSV Eindhoven have qualified.
Robin Dutt also sees great potential in e-sport.
The ex-trainer of Bayer Leverkusen and Werder Bremen is now advising an agency for virtual football players.
"Real football, in particular, has to deal with the 14 to 30-year-olds that young people are still going to the stadium in the future," says the 52-year-old.
And: The clubs tried to conquer all sorts of markets, especially the Asian ones.
With prominent e-athletes under contract, you could have a much more frequent presence on these markets online than just sending the Bundesliga team to Asia once a year.
What is it all about?
In E-Sport, computer games such as "League Of legends," "Dota 2," "Counter-Strike," or just football simulation FIFA are fought at the level of competition.
For a long time, as in the normal sport, leagues have established themselves in which the pros compete against each other.
And in the Asian Games 2022, E-Sport is already part of the official program.
But is it really a real sport?
For many, the idea is certainly in need of normal.
Ingo Froevil has also been grappling with the question for a long time.
For the professor at the German Sports College in Cologne, E-Sport is a sport because it is competitive and shows many biological and physical reactions that are also found in classical sport - such as increased heart rates, stress reactions, hormonal changes.
In addition, there needs to be cognitive skills, a technical and tactical understanding and rapid responsiveness.
Professional gamers should train not only on the console but also their bodies and pay attention to nutrition.
"The fit player is a good player."
Froevil, however, also sees problems: "Doping is becoming more and more an issue."
Controls are difficult to implement in online games, and the scene lacked the structures of classical sport.
In positive terms, the scientist highlights the high inclusive effect of e-sports.
The players are traveling internationally, which is like a big global family, there are no intercultural barriers.
A study by the consultancy Deloitte and the Federal Association of interactive entertainment Software (BIU) predicts rapid growth in e-sport.
In 2016, it was implemented in Germany 50 million euros, mainly through advertising, sponsorship and major tournaments.
In three years, sales are expected to be 130 million.
Against the nearly $2.4 billion of the football Bundesliga, that is little.
However, the e-sport "is no longer far from the other established sports such as handball, basketball or ice hockey," the Deloitte consultants write.
Many countries are already at international level.
Major markets are Asia and the US, where ex-basketball player Shaquille O'Neal and baseball star Alex Rodriguez are involved in the US team NRG eSports.
Hollywood actor Ashton Kutcher invests in the eSports betting provider Unikrn.
There is also a great deal in Europe.
In a Norwegian school, e-sports had been introduced as a lesson, Froevil says.
In the Netherlands and France, football first-round clubs, according to Dutt, are now required to set up an e-sports department.
"In European comparison Germany is lagging behind," explains VfB's board of directors Röttgermann.
Just falling into nostalgia, and clarifying the old times, is no longer enough today.
It is a matter of preserving the tradition of the association, but at the same time adapting the company to the modern market.
"We live in a digitized world," says Dutt.
"There's no way you can stick to that only when football stays everything as it always was."
Poison eggs Ade - The egg alternatives to cooking and baking
Almost all the federal states are now affected by the scandal of toxic-laden eggs.
ALDI Süd and ALDI Nord have responded and have taken all eggs from sale in Germany.
On the shelves, only eggs are only to be taken, which do not prove to contain a fipronil.
Michelle Carter convicted of the lyrics urging Conrad Roy to commit suicide
A woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years for encouraging her boyfriend through texts and calls for suicide.
Michelle Carter, now 20, will spend 15 months of her conviction behind bars and five years have been suspended on probation.
Carter was convicted in June of negligent homicide by Conrad Roy, who took life on July 13, 2014.
The father of Roy said at the hearing on Thursday: "My family is inconsolable.
My son was my best friend. "
Carter was allowed to remain free until the appeal.
She had been faced with a maximum sentence of 20 years, but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy suffered from a mental illness.
Dressed in red pants and a cream-coloured blouse, Carter stood with tears in the eyes, with folded hands and downward looking eyes when she was convicted.
"Their actions killed Conrad Roy," the prosecutor told the court.
"She finished his life to make her own better.
She has not taken responsibility, "she said.
"She has shown no remorse."
But Carters's attorney said it was a "horrible circumstance they completely regret."
However, Judge Lawrence Moniz said he did not find out that her "age or maturity or even her mental illness had a significant impact on her actions."
A prosecutor read a statement from Roys's mother, Lynn Roy, who said there was "no day in which I don't mourn the loss of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and how I deal with everything.
Roys's sister, Camdyn Roy, said she was "persecuted" by the finding that she would never attend her brother's wedding or be an aunt for his children.
"Not having this single person with whom I have been together since my birth is a pain I will always keep with me for the rest of my life," she said.
The case seems to set a legal precedent because there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to ask another to commit suicide.
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead from carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle in 2014.
The case drew national attention after Carter's text messages revealed that she had encouraged him to end his life.
"Hang yourself up, Spring from a building, stab yourself, I don't know, there are a lot of ways," she said in several messages she had sent in the two weeks before his death while he was on holiday with his family.
In the moments before his suicide, she wrote, "You've got to do it, Conrad" and "Everything you need to do is turn the generator and you'll be free and happy."
Judge Moniz said Carter's attention was sought by Roy's death and ordered it to benefit from any press from the case.
The case has divided legal opinion.
Among the few who defended Carter, Amanda Knox, who was convicted of murder at her British co-worker in Italy in 2007 before being acquitted two years ago.
Ms Knox, 30 years old, published a comment in the Los Angeles Times: "Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help, not jail."
Joshua Kimme: Learn from the new mini-lame of FC Bayern
The fact that Joshua Kimme was allowed to run as captain at the Audi Cup is no coincidence.
FC Bayern trust the Confederations Cup winner a great season - extra motivation does not harm.
Something was different on his place in the cab, which saw Joshua Kimme immediately, even if the extra garment was very, very small.
However, as far and wide on the second day of the Audi Cups, of course, no Philipp Lahm and no Manuel Neuer was to be seen, he made himself the arm.
"The coach didn't announce it," the Confederations Cup winner told him afterwards, after his first deployment as a Bayern captain.
Good, the one could have run better than at 0: 2 against the SSC Naples.
But the sign of the coach was able to interpret Kimme as well.
Not the eight-year-old Arturo Vidal had chosen C-Elf as a game leader in youth players, debutants and just out of the holiday, but he.
Sugar is best distributed to those who trust a lot that you want to keep on a whim.
So anyone who has been chosen to leave the legacy of Lahm can only use a little extra motivation well.
Kimme confirmed: "This is what you want as a player: Take responsibility."
On Wednesday, the 22-year-old flashed as a mini-lame over the field.
Right behind, that's his position now, the white bind on the arm did her rest.
And at all, Kimme worked in this starting formation like the one who can best take the helm.
He gave instructions, trying to steer the unplayed squad.
He had the look for the whole thing, while many others were preoccupied with himself.
Vidal thus overplayed his lack of fitness (barely flipped); Renato Sanches, on the Devil, come out on the achievements of the Asia trip (also only conditional); and Sebastian Rudy and Niklas Süle not to be negative in their first appearance in the Bayern jersey.
That, after all, worked very well.
Süle ran alongside Kimme, Rudy before the defense, both acting sovereign.
The most famous Napoli storm was often difficult, and Süle was also successful in the game building a few times.
His colleague Rudy admitted that the result "wasn't as we hoped for."
But he also showed a proper performance on the debut.
Change of play, tempo change: "For this style I was brought up."
How unusual this Bayern world is still for the new entrants, one saw following the match.
Rudy, for example, did not give one or two in the catacombs, but determined six or seven interviews.
Kimme passed away after a few crisp statements in the back of his new fellow players.
There he heard from sweetness an interesting phrase: "What's going on here, I've already noticed.
At Bayern you just have to win every game. "
After all, he no longer has to teach the new.
Alaba motivates ÖFB ladies
David Alaba believes the success of our ÖFB ladies
Austria's best-known footballer has reported on Twitter just before the game and wanted the ÖFB ladies all the best.
The Bayern-Legionnaires is almost a club-mate of ÖFB captain Schnaderbeck and fiebert with our ladys.
The Tweet of the Austrian footballer of the Year and Champions League winners should be a special motivation injection.
The famous Bayern-Dusel might also need our ladies well.
Companies satisfied with Rhineland-Palatinate minister: Economy praises Wissing's pace
It was often irreconcilable, the relationship between the country and the regional economy, when Eveline Lemke (Green) was still economics minister of Rhineland-Palatinate.
This is evident after more than a year in which the new Economy Minister, Volker Wissing (FDP), is in office.
Chambers and companies from the region speak on T V-request of a change in economic policy - and, at the same time, blame the old minister.
Frank Natus, chairman of the Trier company (VTU), says: "Wissing attacks the wishes of the economy that Lemke has all blocked."
The biggest U-turn sees Natus in infrastructure policy: The gaps in highway 1 between Kelberg and Adenauer are now at the top of the country's list of priorities.
Later this year, the ministry hopes for a planning review process until 2021 is expected to be the building right.
A role in the country's plans also plays down the Westbypass Trier, which is in the urgent need of the federal transport plan.
The aim is to take the track into operation in December 2020, Ministry spokeswoman Cornelia Holtmann says.
Natus sees it as a signpost to prop up regional but internationally competing companies.
The Chamber of Commerce (IHK) Trier (IHK) Trier is aiming for a Rhineland-Palatinate label, as suggested by Wissing, in order to increase sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of German wine exports that have been lost for ten years.
In addition, Wissing has an open ear for people who want to start their own company, praises the IHK.
The Trier Chamber of Commerce provides an additional incentive for young trainees in the new Master Bonus, says Managing Director Matthias Schwalbach.
A premium of 1000 euros is provided for the existing master exam and 2500 euros if graduates make themselves self-employed within ten years of master training.
The homework list for the country, however, remains long.
The planned road construction will quickly create facts, while it lacks the necessary personnel, says Jan Glockauer, chief executive of IHK Trier.
Of 56 new engineers who want to hire Wissing at the country farm, only 29 posts have been filled.
IHK is calling for more orders to be awarded to outside offices.
Christian Baldaluf, Christian Baldaluf, refers to calculations by the Court of Auditors that the country is investing more than EUR 20 million less in the preservation of national roads in 2017 and 2018.
Frank Natus also expects a concept of the country as it seeks to fix the shortage of skilled workers in the region.
The current broadband expansion in the country is also sobering.
In 2016, regional companies rated network supplies in an IHK survey only with the Note 3.4.
They complained about stalled internet connections and crashes.
In contrast, ex-Economy Minister Eveline Lemke is out of politics at the moment and still sits on the supervisory board of the wind power company Pro Wind.
The Green Group left Lemke for April to become president of a private university in Karlsruhe - where, after four months of disagreements, she cleared the field again.
Audi is expected to change 850,000 diesel vehicles - automakers face a backlash
A day before Audi's announcement, BMW said it would offer to update the software in more than 350,000 vehicles.
The BMW chairman said the company believes that "there are smarter options than driving restrictions," referring to European cities - including Munich, where BMW is based - to ban or restrict diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions.
None of the companies described the ventures as a recall.
European automakers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with rules for carbon dioxide emissions.
But the nitrogen oxides that diesel engines emit are considered carcinogens and can cause asthma.
The cost of car manufacturers to install equipment for neutralizing the exhaust gases emitted by diesel vehicles is also taking place, making it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also charged with mocking the powerful car companies and ignoring signs of the problem.
The companies are trying to avoid the mistakes of Volkswagen, which used the use of so-called switching devices that could regulate emissions to comply with the regulations when a car was tested but go back in normal driving conditions.
Several employees of Volkswagen have been charged in the United States, while others are being investigated on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former head of thermodynamics was arrested in Audi's engine development in Germany.
The former manager, Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio, is Italian and is therefore not protected from extradition and could be brought to justice in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi was involved in German criminal investigations at Volkswagen after authorities accused Audi of having installed a system to circumvent emissions regulations in Europe, and a request focused on the United States was expanded.
The inclusion of Audi in the investigation could seriously strain Volkswagen: The luxury car manufacturer is disproportionately contributing to Volkswagen's profit.
That message left the raft Saturday at Isar
The city wants to protect Isar.
In order for the Isar visitors to join, there will be a float through Munich tomorrow, which has a special message.
If you want to go to the Isar on Saturday, you will see a large float there between Flüber and Regenbachbrücke.
And this is not a common float, with Isar tourists.
But the Baureferat wants to clear up.
On the raft you can see a large information transparent.
It shows a rubbish mountain.
The prelude to a publicity campaign to appeal to the Isar visitors.
With the motto "True Love," it is intended to raise awareness of the Isar as a protected wild flow.
Even last summer, the raft went through the Isar and this year there are other actions and measures to achieve a considerate and environmentally conscious behavior.
Murderillos ankles and the laughter against the suffering
Mordillo was at times one of the most-published cartoon draughtsman, the knoll nasties of his characters are his trademark.
Even with 85, the Argentine still paints and works on a film.
His message: Laughing, "because there's too much suffering in the world."
Guillermo Mordillo was born on August 4, 1932, as the son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires.
In the first few years as an artist, he suggested himself, among other things, as a draughtsman for greeting cards - which frustrated him.
"The happiest day in my professional life was the day when in my job lost," he once said.
After stations in Lima, New York and Paris, he succeeded in the late 60s: With the publication of his cartoons in "Paris Match" and then in "Stern" and other leading magazines around the world.
Even in China, Mordillo found many fans.
Time and time again, the artists of cities have been inspired.
Large, circular murder-illo figures are strolling in drawings with the slate tower of Pisa, Big Ben in London and Red Square in Moscow.
In the early morning, according to his own figures, he is still on the table today, working almost ten hours a day.
Over calendars, puzzles, books for Gross and Klein, T-shirts, plush animals and watches, his droll figures continue to be widely spread worldwide.
For six years he has been working on a cartoon and a TV series with his characters.
The main person in the movie "crazy Island" is a giraffe - murderillos most popular animal in his drawings - that has a thousandfold as an opponent.
For the first time, his characters speak in the 3D movie, which is to come to the cinema screen in 2019.
"I don't know exactly what they're going to say, it's strange for me," says murderillo.
The script is not written by him.
That's why he relies more on the TV series, which, like his original drawings, is produced wordless.
Lavender from Provence threatened by climate change
He has become a symbol of Provence in the south of France, but there is a warning that he is threatened by climate change.
The lavender is declining because of the conditions of drought that are reminiscent of drought and because of the diseases transmitted by scientists and farmers trying to find solutions, causing great headaches.
Eric Chaisse, expert at the agricultural research institute CRIEPP in Provence, said: "Lavender in Provence is effectively at risk because the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change in recent years, which has brought much less rain in the spring and much more in the autumn.
This has implications for Lavendel's life span.
There is also a small Zikade, a microbacterium that transmits dwarf pads, and in very dry weather there are very many of them. "
And there is a lot at stake.
Lavender oil not only attracts tourists, it is also very much in demand for perfume and cosmetics.
Eric Chaisse said: "Instead of having very long plant drilling with a large number of flowers, we have smaller, underdeveloped and either missing or weakened.
So we have fewer parts with ethereal oil. "
The solutions being considered include better water distribution and slowing evaporation from the ground, but also spraying the plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and the development of varieties that are more resilient to drought.
The town of Geisa in the Thuringian Rön is celebrating its 1200-year anniversary this year.
The highlight is this Saturday and Sunday with a middle-aged fest.
Crows, guilds, traders, Vagants or a landfield camp are to be seen in downtown these days.
The murder of a journalist underscores the growing threat in Mexico
Employees of the weekly newspaper Riodice usually meet Wednesday to review their plans for coverage of the recent chaos in the state of Sinaloa by organized crime, corrupt officials and cease-fire drug wars.
But on that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security.
They were told it was important to change their routines.
Two senior journalists are discussing what feels safer: They are supposed to take their children to the office who were the target of an attack with grenades in 2009, or leave them at home.
Security experts have written three words on a plaque at the front of the room: Opponents, neutral, allies.
They ask reporters to propose names for each column - no proof is necessary, perceptions and abdominal feelings are enough.
There are drug smugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists suspected of standing on the government's payroll or cartels, a catalogue of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous.
There is no respite from violence, and while the bodies are piling up throughout the country, more and more journalists are involved: At least 25, since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012.
Among the latter is her editor and her conspirator of Riodice, the co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.
"The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs.
His absence is deeply felt, though his presence is present everywhere - a large photo of Valdez showing his middle finger with the word "justices" hangs on the facade of the Riodoce building; two reporters in the Thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wearing T-shirts showing his smiling face with glasses or his typical Panamahat.
The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and reporters discuss their shared themes, trauma, their nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.
Although a special federal prosecutor's office was erected in 2010 to process the cases of journalists, it has only initiated two criminal proceedings, according to the committee to protect journalists.
As with most of the thousands of murders linked to drug trafficking and organised crime each year, journalists' killers are rarely brought to justice.
At Riodoce, they still insist on treating the violence of Sinaloa, though they are inconsolable and although the terrain is now even more treacherous.
Without information about the killers, without justice, the meeting to discuss security has little benefit, Ibarra says.
"It's very stupid to waste my time in this workshop," he says.
"As long as we don't know the Why, we distrust everyone."
On the morning of May 15, Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodice in the provincial capital of Culiacan.
He only managed to drive a few blocks wide before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men; he was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot at him, presumably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with "twelfth river."
The shooter drove away in his car and damaged it nearby.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He left a woman and two adult children.
Rumors tend to fly freely in Culiacan.
But there is virtually nothing to silence on the Valdez issue.
Since Guzman's arrest last year and extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa has become one of the country's bloodiest battleground states as rival factions struggle here to fill the vacuum.
It doesn't make anything that in Sinaloa every day someone or several people are shot on the street or that the cemetery is full of decorated, two-storey mausoleum for drug lords who are bigger than many homes for the living.
Forget for a minute that there is a state of "calm" when only one cartel has control of the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trade routes to the United States.
Nevertheless, despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, broke the blame for failing to protect his friend.
He believes that two misunderstandings have contributed to the murder.
First, in February, there was the release of an interview with Damaso Lopez, a leader of one of the rival cartel groups in the war with Guzman's sons.
This release may have angered the sons, suspected gang members bought every copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to newspaper kiosks.
The second mistake was not to force Valdez to leave after seizing another newspaper, which had published the same story to leave the country to his own security.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is seen as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists.
He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues accepted that he would always be there.
He served as an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003 when he joined with five colleagues to set up Riodice and sold $50 U.S. holdings.
In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to engage journalism without hitting on the narcotics problem," Bojorquez said.
Over time, the newspaper earned a reputation for bold and honest reporting, and sales and advertising revenue declined.
Reporters loved to publish hard-hitting investigations without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else dared to treat.
Eight years after the creation of Riodice, it received the prestigious "Maria-Moore Cabot Prize" for its coverage in Latin America.
In the same year, Valdez won the Committee's International Press Freedom Award to protect journalists for his courage in pursuing Mexican drug history, wherever it led.
He voluntarily admitted that he was scared.
"I want to continue," he said at the time of the CPJ award.
Drug trafficking in Sinaloa "is a way of life," he said last October in an interview with Rompieviento-TV.
"You have to take over the task that goes to you as a journalist - either that or you play the dummy.
I don't want to be asked: "What did you do in the face of so many dead... why didn't you say what was going on?"
The Riodoce team misses Valdez, the fun bird who was able to curse like a port worker, the boyfriend who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.
They trusted on his routine.
He would always wear his hat.
He would always go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, and always sit there at the same table.
Now they ask: Was his love of routine his demeanour?
His death has also forced her to question her own assumptions about how best to do her work and stay alive.
"They don't like it if you deal with their wives, their children, their clean shops, their secret runways," to move drugs.
"These things weren't allowed," Bojorquez said.
The result is, even in the best of times, a high level of self-censorship and self-preservation.
Trust his own instincts.
If it smells wrong, it stays away.
The trouble is, said the editor of the Riodoce Andres Villarreal, that "smell a sense that can be misled... and then the thing happened with Javier."
The old rules, as he and others say, are no longer valid in Sinaloa - just as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states where a toxic mix of lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt government officials are at home.
The landscape is constantly changing.
In the space where Riodice's employees met for security training, no cell phones were suddenly allowed.
Outside, two policemen sought shelter from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shade of a tree.
They were instructed by the provincial government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-storey building in a middle-class district of Culiacan.
Half in the joke, some of the reporters wondered if those officers were among the 50 percent of police officers who the governor himself described as not trusted.
It has been months since reporters went into the mountain landscape, where drug gangs are de facto under control.
For this week's edition, Riodice has bathed on three main stories.
There was the murder of the brother of former well-known boxer Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.
They also had an exposé on government spending, which focused on the governor's hometown.
And there was a group that carried out a kidnapping in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the prosecutor's office.
There was no official word on who was kidnapped or how it happened, so caution was offered when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows: That the restaurant is a favorite local of drug dealers and authorities.
A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician who belongs to the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (pri), which has dominated all political levels almost the entire century.
Several pri governors have recently been accused of high-profile cases of corruption.
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in that restaurant, including one in which a son of "El Chapo" Guzman escaped a military raid.
Just a few months earlier, readers would have seen Valdez's column as the most informed source about the kidnapping.
"We used to know what happened," said Villarreal, 46, with the nickname "El Flaco" because of his slim body stature.
"Now all channels of communication are broken with our sources."
The Valdez office has been turned to the storage room for signs and stickers protesting against the murders of journalists, because the staff have become something they themselves would never have expected: Activists on behalf of the press.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez grabbed a few signs and went to a demonstration the next morning because of another journalist's office.
Salvador Adams disappeared three days after Valdez was killed, in the western state of Michoacan.
A burned body has been discovered and officials say, based on DNA tests, that it is his.
Across the country, journalists have become more vocal by writing in organized protests "SOS Press" on walkways and buildings.
On that day, the director Bojorquez is away in Washington and is trying to gather international support for the judiciary in the Valdez case.
At a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa the day after the Valdez murder, Ramirez accused authorities of spying on journalists and killing them because they told the truth.
She has since asked that she be reassigned by the government because she is concerned that her anger has violated her objectivity.
Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were "surrounded" by organized crime, involved government officials and an indifferent society.
In his last book, "Narco Journalism," he wrote that reporters are not only killed by drug gangs, but also on orders from politicians and security forces involved with organized crime under a blanket.
The media watchdog group "articulo 19" added more than half of the attacks to journalists from the police and officials last year.
"In Mexico, you die because they want you to keep your mouth shut," Ramirez said.
Obviously, the murders have a deterrent effect.
No one forgets the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago.
Her body was found along with a note allegedly signed by the Zetas cartel: "Here I am because of my reports."
A computer keyboard and headphones were located next to their severed head.
Some branches have chosen to close as the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state of Chihuahua following the assassination of the correspondent Miroslava breach in March.
Others continue, as did El Manana of Nuevo Laredo after the assassination of their director in 2004.
In 2010, the Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed the drug cartels with an editorial on the front page with the headline "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists have fled their home states or even from the country.
It is a painful decision.
It's hard to find work in exile, and they still watch the streets and look for dangers.
And sometimes they are hunted, as appears to be the photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered in 2015 along with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after fleeing from Veracruz.
For those who stay back and continue working, it's a daily dance with high-risk decisions.
Ibarra, who once wanted to be a poet, admits that drug trafficking scares him.
"Mexico goes to hell, and that's why I became a reporter," he said.
At midnight last Friday, when the last edition was already finished, the editors of Riodice sat on the pavement in front of the office and drank beer when at once all their phones began to sum up.
A series of shootings involving gang rivals and security forces near the seaside town of Mazatlan had left 19 confirmed dead.
The war continued to escalate as promised by a number of cartel messages in the region.
From the brothel edge, they have released the news on the website of Riodice via mobile phone.
The front page had to be changed the next day.
Sirens hovered nearby - another shooting in the area.
Bojorquez threw a look at the police officers who kept guard to see if they were in readiness.
If they were scared at all, they didn't show it.
Among the huge portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper, whose middle finger was visible for all of Sinaloa, the staff of Riodice followed his tracks.
"How can you just think of it," Bojorquez said, "if the same day Javier was murdered, the intern asked me to send them to the street for reporting."
Dinosaur used camouflage to evade its enemies
At first glance, it looks like a statue, albeit a terrifying one.
Now researchers have found that the initial findings of the incredible rhino of a Canadian mountain worker were so well received that experts described it as "Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs."
It was so good that they could even find that his scaly skin was of reddish brown - and they said she had something of a "troubled past."
The report in the journal Current Biology described it as "the best-preserved armored dinosaur ever found, and one of the best dinosaur specimens in the world."
The fossil is a newly discovered type of nodosaurier that lived in the middle of chalk time between 110 million and 112 million years ago.
His incredibly well-preserved condition has stunned researchers who describe it as "really remarkable."
According to reports in National Geographic, the armored plant worker is the most preserved fossil of its kind.
It was found by Shawn Funk when he dug in the Suncor Millennium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011.
He met something that seemed misplaced by the surrounding rock, and decided to watch more closely.
The fossil that he discovered was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.
They spent the next six years trying to uncover the wild animal within the 2,500 pound (1,100 kg) heavy ground clubs.
After all this hard work, the finished result is now ready to be unveiled.
"If you just blink a little with your eyes, you could almost believe it was asleep," said the main author, Caleb Brown, scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature is seen.
"It will go into science history as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaur specimens - the Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs."
Researchers have found that even though it is covered with an armor and resembles a changing tank, it was likely threatened by meat freshening dinosaurs.
The heavily armored dinosaur used a red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and used a compression technique known as counter-terrorism, which is also used by many modern animals.
This would have allowed it to mix better in its surroundings and evade its enemies, experts say, suggesting it was threatened by larger dinosaurs.
The 110 million year-old creature from the family of the Nodosaurier made headlines for the first time in May and is now seen at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.
Researchers have now studied the wild animal and called it Borealopelta markmitchelli after the museum technician Mark Mitchell, one of a team that spent more than 7,000 hours to reveal it carefully.
The amazing preservation of the specimen enabled Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and shape of scales and armor over his body.
They discovered the contestants, a common defense method in the animal kingdom, meaning that the top of the creature was darker than its bottom.
Although the contestants are common, the results are surprising, as the size of Borealopelta far exceeds the animals living today.
It suggests that the dinosaur was hunted by enough pressure by meat freshman dinosaurs that evolution favoured the cover-up of the confrontation as a means of survival.
But most contemporary animals using the contestants - think of deer, zebras or glasses - are much smaller and more vulnerable than prey, which signals that this nodosaurier was exposed to a real fight for survival.
"Strong predator behavior on a massive, heavily armored dinosaur shows how dangerous the dinosaur predators have had to be," Brown said.
The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the dinosaur's skin was red-brown.
Scientists continue to investigate the animal on clues about his life, including his canned intestinal content, to find out what it ate as his last meal.
They believe the dinosaur, when he died, ran into a river and was driven to the sea where it sank on the back to the seabed.
At that time, Alberta was as warm as South florida today, and rivers and oceans are likely to spread much farther inland than they are today.
"This nodosaurier is truly remarkable because it is fully covered with canned scaly skin but also remains in three dimensions and maintains the original form of the animal," Brown said.
"The result is that the animal looks almost the same today as in early chalk time.
You don't need to use much imagination to reconstruct it.
The chalk season was a time when giant theropods, carnivorous dinosaurs that stood on two legs crossed the earth.
Although the king of them, the Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions of years to Borealopelta, the armored dinosaur was hunted by some of its fearsome ancestors.
This includes the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 foot (11.5 m) long, six tons of heavy monster.
The scientists, whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta sank after death in the sea and mummified in the mud.
The creature was found by Shawn Funk when he dug in the Suncor Millennium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011.
According to the museum, it is the best-preserved armored dinosaur in the world, including skin and armor, and is complete from the muzzle to the hip.
The creatures were on average about 18 feet (5 feet) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).
It contained two 20-inch long peaks that raged from his shoulders.
The researchers believe that the armored plant feed was washed through western Canada until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea.
But the dinosaur's underwater heritage kept its armor in exquisite detail.
The petrified remains of this particular specimen are so well preserved that the skin remnants still cover bumpy anti-tank plates along the dinosaur
As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, such a level of conservation is so 'rarely like a win in the lottery.
The more I look at it, the more confusing it becomes.
Weathered remnants of the skin still cover the hollowed tank plates that carry the animal's skull.
His right front foot is on his side, his five fingers are spiced up.
I can count the scales on his sole. "
In the thunderstorm: Mass carambolage on A8: Many injured
Fierce accident on Thursday night on the A8: Just under 30 vehicles are involved in a mass carambolage.
There are numerous casualties, miles of traffic jams - and gaffer.
On the highway Stuttgart-Munich (A8), about 20 people were injured late Thursday afternoon at a mass caramage.
According to first figures from the police, at 5 p.m., between the junctions of Adelzhausen and Odelzhausen (district of Aichach-Friedberg) during a thunderstorm, almost 30 vehicles, including probably trucks, were in disarray.
The exact number of casualties was not available at first.
It is a matter of minor to medium-sized injuries, a police spokesman said.
A major lineup of rescue vehicles was at the scene.
The A8 was completely closed towards Munich.
In the direction of Munich, a total of 10 kilometers of backlog formed.
As an AZ reporter reports, it also came on the opposite carriageway to massive disabilities - through numerous gaffer.
The fire department noted the hallmarks of the vehicle driver, who now face sensitive penalties.
Shortly after 18: 45, a second accident occurred on the A8, this time between Augsburg and Dasing.
There was a collision between a car passenger and a passenger car.
A rescue helicopter was on the road to the site of the accident.
German rail: Group tests' comfort check-in'
It's a moment almost everyone has already experienced: Nothing ahningly sits in the train and sleeps.
Or you are deeper into his work and has just got a brilliant thought.
And then: Puff.
Comes the conductor and creates an ungently or tore the passenger in the middle of the workflow.
Ticket control.
But the days of disruption are soon over.
Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the schaffnerless ticket control system.
It is simply confirmed by mobile phone that you take your seat and devalue the ticket.
Currently, a test operation runs on two routes.
"Come the offer, let's get it out.
It is then expected to be available early next year on many other long-distance routes in Germany, "a rail spokesman said.
"Comfort Check-in" calls the train the ticket validation without conductors.
To be able to use it, however, some requirements must be met: You need a smartphone or a tablet.
And you have to book an online ticket - what most passengers already do.
You also have to buy the APP of the train, the DB Navigator, which is the most convenient way of ticket booking anyway.
Finally, you need a seat reservation.
Because the "comfort check-in" works like this: One rises in the train, calls its ticket under "My tickets."
A button for the electronic devaluation will appear with the test customers.
The train attendants get a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is in the train and has taken the booked seat Y.
If the train companion in the ticket control of Y.Y knows, he knows that there is a passenger with already devalued online ticket.
We can therefore continue to sleep, continue working, keep silent.
The "check-in" has two advantages: One for the customer, one for the train - which, in turn, is to use the passengers.
"If you want to travel without ticket control through our train crew, you just check yourself in the DB Navigator.
This allows passengers to make their travel time in the train more personal, "says Michael Peterson, Marketing Board of DB television.
Second Plus: "And our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs."
Those who often train, know that, in addition to delays and missed trains, ticket controls are among the biggest annoyances.
Because often you have yourself, but in any case one of the travelers does not have all the documents you need to validate online tickets.
Either the credit card or the identity card or otherwise a document you have to show is missing.
As a result, there are endless discussions between train attendants and passengers, resulting in bad mood in the abdomen or large room and delays in controlling your own ticket and taking the conductors at the end of the time to take care of other concerns.
Only a small number of test customers can still use the new service.
And that's just on the connections ICE 915 Dortmund-Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart-Essen.
Other train numbers on the same track have not yet been unlocked.
How an activist came to learn the answer to the question: "Wish streets?"
On August 9, 2014 Brittany Ferrell was shaken to her core.
Just a day after she arrived in New York City, sitting in St. Louis was sitting on the bed of an Airbnb apartment she rented and scrolled through Facebook on her phone.
She stumbled across a post from someone from high school.
"The police have just killed an 18-year-old child and it's still on the road," it said there.
Confused, since no one else had posted the information on her feed, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
A user with the handle @ TheePharoah was constantly retweeted on her timeline.
The rapper from the St. Louis area was killed by the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old who was killed by a white policeman in Ferguson, Mo., live.
He posted a picture of Brown's lifeless body that was outstretched on the street and would stay there four hours.
"That's wild," Ferrell thought at himself.
But the death was nothing new for her and her community.
She set off her cell phone to return to tweets about people on the Canfield Drive later in the evening.
There were photos of the police tape and people screaming, and by a man who claimed to be Brown's father wearing a sign with the inscription: "Ferguson's police have just killed my unarmed son!"
She watched a live feed where a policeman stood in front of a group of protesters with a barking dog.
In another video, she said, another policeman escaped his rifle and shouted: "I'm going to kill you... animals all kill."
"It's not common," Ferrell recalled telling her.
"This is not the kind of murder we have become accustomed to and which we can call typical."
At that moment, I felt chills.
I was angry and crying. "
She booked a return flight and went home the next day.
After landing at 11pm, she picked up her 6-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided that the two would go to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened in the following three years with Ferrell and Ferguson is the subject of a new documentary, "Whose streets?," in cinemas from 11.
It is a history of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and toughness that consists of the view of the people who live in the community and have filled the streets to demand answers.
When Ferrell, with her daughter, wearing a flower dress and a fitting crown, drove to Ferguson, the two discussed a conversation they had countless times this morning "about the black experience and the black state."
"You remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe?" She remembered what she said.
"We are now going to Ferguson because police have killed an 18-year-old boy and that wasn't right.
I couldn't take them away, "Ferrell said later.
"What happened today is a highlight of what happened in the past.
She needs to know it and see it and be raised in it.
It needs to be well-developed, not just activism and organization, but also the different layers of black experience and the black constitution and what we need to do to get free to free ourselves.
Even though I am lucky enough to give her an experience in which she personally does not experience blatant racism, she is no different than the next black women's child.
I feel I would be doing her a disservice to keep them away from it. "
The first stop when they arrived in Ferguson was on South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police authority that became a campsite when activists waited for the possible non-prosecution of Officer Darren Wilson.
There, Ferrell and her daughter connected with a local business owner who made lunch.
They prepared bags and helped pass them on to protesters.
Slowly, a new kind of activism for Ferrell began to take shape.
"My activism has changed totally after August 9," she said, noting that she was a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis president of the Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on food-justice and health inequalities in black communities.
"I had no experience in organizing.
It's all come. "
Weeks later, Ferrell met during an evening demonstration, Sabaah Folayan, one of the film's co-directors.
Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar just wanted to "document" what happened.
One question came Ferrell in mind: "Do you want to document her or try to find a story that could exploit her?"
That skepticism was fuelled by countless cases of people, often of whites -- in a community that benefited from their pain and resilience.
As Folayan recently explained in an interview: "We had heard that people born and raised in Ferguson didn't center their voices and we wanted to do it differently."
Folayan had already collaborated with then-co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the area known for his activism around death row inmates.
His involvement brought Ferrell closer to the project, along with six other locals followed by the team of "Whose streets?" In the years after Brown's firing.
"This documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks with us... we talk," Davis said.
"That was the main thing for me as these people are being portrayed, because so I will be portrayed."
The goal was not to focus on Ferrell's experience - to show that the movement is "not about a Messiah leader but a community that comes together," Folayan said - she proved to be the most open participant in the film.
As a result, documents from "Whose streets?" Surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrell's life as she fell in love and married her wife.
"I felt like naked," Ferrell said and laughed when she saw the finished product for the first time.
"But I understand that there has to be some injury in this work and in the human being of black people."
In addition, Ferrells's story repeats the role of black gay women in the broader Black-Lives-Matter movement.
Two of the three founders of the movement, which marked the film "Blacklivestsmatter" in social media after the killing of black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012, identify themselves as gay.
"Black, gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement overall," Ferrell said, "and therefore we are constantly fighting on different fronts.
Black, gay women must bear the brunt of everything. "
Folayan agreed to notice that "the movement is really maintained by black women and many black women."
However, she insists that "this is not an affirmative type of action," at which Ferrell was selected as the heart of the film because of her identity.
"She was the person who was shaking up that energy," she said.
"It's no accident, though it was at the forefront because in a life at these crossings as a black, gay woman is so much at stake.
You can feel their energy through the screen. "
Meanwhile, the news cameras in Ferguson have long disappeared, but the racial links between the community and the police continue to exist.
Ferrell is on probation for 2 ½ years because of blocking a highway at a demonstration.
She describes the social atmosphere of the area she calls her home: "A mess."
Yet she clings to a chant and she feels obliged to this memory since she went to the streets three years ago in Ferguson.
"It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It is our duty to win.
We need to love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose - except our chains. "
From 'dream' to 'economies of scale': TV readers discuss bit gallery
The bit gallery moves people even though it's not built for a long time.
But the idea of a shopping mall at the southern end of the pedestrian zone has split the population in supporters and opponents since the first presentation in 2009.
Cold leaves the issue barely one.
The topic is also discussed on our Facebook page "People's Friend Bitburg."
While the one to the bit gallery say: "This would be a dream" (Anja Becker) or "That would be real class" (Nicole Schauten), comes from the other side: "Don't need a person" (Siggi Betzen) or quite simply: "Economies of scale!" (Lars Scholz).
While supporters rely on a gallery to attract more customers to the city, as well as the rest of the business, opponents fear that then the pedestrian zone is bleeding.
In addition, the gallery is planned exactly on the plot where the farm market hall stands, in which 13 direct marketers offer their products.
With the start of the construction work, it will stop.
The gallery makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - and to the Beda Square with possibility to sit outside.
Simone Zimmer: "We have been buying in the farmhouse for many years almost every week.
Mainly our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of the rural women always very happy.
We also discovered the buttocks for us.
We would like to see a chance, even during and especially after the construction of the gallery, to maintain this offer.
In other cities, there is also.
Especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting. "
Gerd Densing: "Whether direct marketers settle in a market hall in the gallery comes at the height of the rent.
The new project, however, is unlikely to be just low. "
Eva Kilic: "What shopping palaces in Bitburg?
Whether clothing, shoes, drugged or supermarkets: I find that superfluous.
There's already enough of that in our city.
You can see how many store shops are empty here - some for months and years.
However, since there is not even a proper weekly market, it is all the more important that we at least retain the market hall.
After all, the goods offered there are fresh, is mostly offered directly by the producer and is also inexpensive.
As you see, retail stores in a shopping center are rented only by larger companies, because rents there are often not sustainable for a retailer.
It is a pity that special deals are almost no longer available and what is left is probably going to disappear. "
Wolf Fandel: "A shopping mall with a market hall doesn't fit together for me.
And the gallery doesn't fit into Bitburg.
Above all, where is the farm market hall going to go during the construction period?
The old Edeka would be the solution - even in the long run if the bit gallery actually comes in at some point.
Or does it create the ghost bit gallery beforehand to drive all the shops out of Bitburg? "
George Marquet: "This just won't work.
And a shopping center that stands empty doesn't need anyone either.
In my view, it would have been better to promote a proper farming market, rather than this gallery.
But for a farm market hall, thanks to the crazy many - as I find - pointless construction projects in Bitburg no longer have a place.
If the farm market hall is broken, a piece of culture will disappear again. "
A fitting resemblance: Artist creates portraits with Chelsea Manning's DNA
In the middle of the area of the Fridman Gallery in New York, many faces are seen - white, black and brown, which are almost imperceptible - which hang on cables from the ceiling.
The 30 portraits were created by the artist heather Dewey-Hagborg from cheek-tups and hair cuts sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent out the excerpts from the Fort Leavenworth prison, where the former intelligence analyst was serving a 35-year sentence after she publicly made classified diplomatic messages about the site WikiLeaks.
The new exhibition, which opened on August 2, is called A becoming Resemblan (A matching similarity).
She is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline united her expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a transwoman and pioneering dissident whose sentencing was converted by Barack Obama when he had only three days in his office.
Dewey-Hagborg has been through the algorithmic analysis of the DNA extracted from Manning and created from the 30 portraits of how anyone could look with this genomic data, a sharp, if somewhat intellectual commentary, not only to the formability of DNA data - the many ways they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of those interpretations - but also to identity.
Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward but has already spoken openly about identifying as a woman since her puberty, was convicted of 20 charges in 2013, including six violations of the spy law, computer fraud and theft.
Through prison, her image was suppressed, so much so that there was only one photo - a grainy, black-and-white selfie in which Manning visibly uncomfortable sitting on a driver's seat and wearing a platinum blonde wig - with which she was associated.
In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg came just from the great success of her 2012-project 'Stranger visions'.
In it, the artist produced portraits of strangers from forensic artifacts such as cigarette and chewing gum by extracting the DNA from the waste to produce a picture of what those people might look like.
That was the time she received an email from a newspaper magazine.
"They conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while they were in jail, and they wanted some kind of portrait to accompany this article," Dewey-Hagborg explained at a press preview of the new exhibition.
And she could not be visited at that time and she could not be photographed, so you contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait.
The artist and her imprisoned muse became disparate letter friends who exchanged several letters over the course of two years.
They even created one of Shoili Kanungo's illustrated comic "Suppressed Images," which saw a future in which the president would convert Cheltenham's verdict and they would be able to see the exhibition personally.
That Obama, in fact, just days after the book was released, would call for Manning's release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas, was a welcome kind of happy coincidence.
There is also now something deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition, as Donald trump is waging a war against informants from the government camp and against transgender troops to find new, tweetable ways to further inflame the rigid divisions he should actually fix.
When Dewey-Hagborg was asked about the strange timing of all these things, she said that "things happen for a certain reason."
In a artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery, Manning called with her supersized signature among them (the "i" in her family name, with a heart), an end to "automatic fragmentation, whose basis has been gender, race, sexuality and culture."
On the opposite wall, her mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousandths of Cs and GS and As, is written in pencil.
Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show by including the 200 letters (or nucleotide according to the artist's highly developed scientific lexicon) how surprisingly similar, at least in biological terms, we are all.
"What people will hopefully take away from it is that our genome doesn't care who we are and how open genetic data is for an interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video work of 2007, spurious memories, is also to be seen.
"DNA data can tell so many different stories, so the 30 of these stories are."
The last piece in the exhibition, kept in a separate room, is a page from the above comic novel.
She shows Manning as she emerges with a hands-on phone in hand from the United States' disciplinary barracks such as King Kong.
"If they cold-put your speech, they won," it said.
"So never keep your mouth."
"It came directly from a letter she wrote to me," said the artist, who greets from Philadelphia.
"I still get goose bumps when I talk about it."
Manning has not yet seen the exhibition personally - just as it was anticipating in the comic book - but if she was to do it, then she will be greeted in the middle of the room by the masks, from her own genomic simulacrims that look like hordes of protesters.
This was also targeted, like everything in the exhibition, to the size (5 "2, Manning's stint), where their genetic haplogroups were written with pencil.
"In the past I had them on the wall, but I wanted them to feel like a crowd," Dewey-Hagborg said of the portraits.
"I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea, like the movement that was also behind its liberation."
Professor of the University of Northwestern and an employee of Oxford University sought for killing
A nationwide manhunt is under way for a professor at Northwestern University and an employee of the University of Oxford who are being sought as suspects after a man was stabbed in a luxury apartment in Chicago with fatal injuries.
On Monday, for Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) warrants issued for murder for their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, as the files of Cook County's District Court show.
The documents say that Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after several stitches.
A Community alert system released by the Police Department of Chicago says the body was discovered on July 27.
Officials received a call, arrived at the Grand Plaza apartments and found the victim with multiple injuries to his body.
Cornell-Duranleau was still pronounced dead at the scene of the event, and detectives are investigating the stabbing as a murder while police are actively seeking the two suspects, officials said.
Lathem has been an extraordinary professor of Microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, the vice president for university relations, said in an e-mail statement that Lathem is now being vacated and barred from entering the campus of Northwestern University.
"This is now a criminal matter investigated by the relevant authorities, and Northwestern University is cooperating in this investigation," Cubbage said.
Warren is Senior Treasury Assistant at Oxford University.
A spokesman for the University and Somerville College said in an e-mail statement that "we are in contact with the police in the UK and are prepared to help the U.S. investigation authorities in any way possible."
The statement added that Warren's colleagues were shocked and want him to face up.
Chief Communications Officer of Chicago's Police Department, Anthony Guglielmi, said he strongly urged the suspects to face the authorities.
"The police have an idea of their whereabouts, and our efforts to locate them are stepping up," Guglielmi said.
Guglielmi said local, regional and national authorities are helping to find the suspects.
Guglielmi said police received a call from the building manager of the Grand Plaza building who had just received a puzzling tip that said that something had happened in apartment 1008.
Police described the scene as being very cruel.
Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the incident was also taking place on July 27.
It was confirmed by security cameras that Lathem and Warren were in the building.
"We believe that Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," Guglielmi said.
The Grand Plaza's management team issued a statement to residents: "The police are currently working on the timeline and background of the victim and explores a variety of motives, including a possible domestic incident."
"We will complete the WADA roadmap in the near future" - Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mutko
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said it will not take long for the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) to be implemented for the restoration of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA).
"At a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the roadmap, RUSADA has been given the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD (UK Anti-Doping).
The WADA roadmap has been updated in this respect, "Mutko explained on Thursday.
The PM commented on the second part of WADA's roadmap to comply with the code, which describes the criteria for the reinstatement of RUSADA and was recently published on the organisation's website.
According to Mutko, he does not contain anything that could cause concern for Russia.
"Everything has been announced, everything is being implemented.
And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA in the near future, "he added.
One of the criteria mentioned in the list, however, notes that the Russian anti-doping authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the investigation by the Canadian lawyer, Richard McLaren, to alleged state-sponsored doping in Russian sport.
In relation to the matter, Mutko said: "We are conducting the investigation as our anti-doping system has admitted a mistake.
All measures have been implemented.
But there were no government programs, and we won't admit something that doesn't exist. "
Mutkos words agreed with those of Vitaly Smirnov, the head of the independent Russian anti-doping commission.
Speaking with Russian sales office RSport at the start of the day, Smirnov admitted problems of the past in Russian anti-doping organisations, but then added: "We have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations.
No one has to accept this report unconditionally, "Smirnov added.
RUSADA was ruled out in November 2015 in the wake of the doping scandal by WADA from conducting doping controls in Russia.
However, it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and UK Anti-Doping (UKAD).
After a visit to the organization's headquarters in Moscow in July, WADA director-general Olivier Niggli said RUSADA was moving "in the right direction" to be reinstated.
ALDI doesn't sell eggs for now
The business groups shared that.
It was a purely precautionary measure that it could not be assumed by any health impairment, it was said in the communication.
From now on, only eggs are likely to be delivered to ALDI that have been proven to have been tested negative for fipronic anti-liceants.
ALDI wants to make it clear and transparent to its customers.
The start-ups that will help your company not become the next Uber
Amy Errett wanted to measure happiness at your e-commerce start-up, but the polls didn't work.
Answers were often vague, unhelpful or - even worse - fraudulent.
And even if you promised anonymity, some workers didn't trust the process.
"There was just never consistency and objectivity," said Errett, who runs the 75-person San Francisco e-commerce hair Care company Madison Reed.
She called people from outside for help.
A new breed of Human Resources start-ups is on the increase to help companies find out how their employees feel.
By creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring staff engagement, it allows companies to conduct surveys, address special groups and demographic groups, provide staff anonymity and complaint hotlines, and in some cases allow whistleblowers to bypass the C-suite executives and contact the board directly.
"They now have tools like Strava and Fitbit for tracking their health, but where is the Fitbit for your company?" Said Jim Barnett, co-founder and chief executive of Redwood City start-up glint, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement.
Errett said she has a better insight into what your staff think and will feel with glint in the three years.
In addition to the snap polls and surveys of certain teams, it offers a heat card of the company that shows at a glance which units have the most complaints and which executives have low approval results - so you can drill why.
Companies come to see that they have to stay at the top of the workplace culture so that you will not become the next Uber who has been implicated in scandals since a former employee has published a blog post describing an environment of harassment where those who have spoken have been punished.
For start-ups like glint, that desire, after an overview, is a lucrative business opportunity.
The global governance, regulation and compliance industry could own more than $118.7 billion in 2020, according to the financial website Let's talk Payments.
Denver, Colorado, start-up Convercent, which helps companies prevent and detect bad behavior, saw a rising interest and activity earlier this year amid the Uber case into disrepute.
Convercent has nearly 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber has recently signed up as a client.
Like glint, Convercent companies can send custom-made "pulse" surveys, gather confidential responses in real-time and watch the heat maps of your problem areas.
It also offers an anonymous SMS hotline with which employees can report bad behavior.
And if the chief executive is involved, complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board.
"The court of public opinion has covered the regulators," said Patrick Quinlan, the founder and managing director of Convercent.
If a company is found that treats its employees badly or behaves unethical, it can experience costly consequences through consumer boycott, employee fluctuation and lawsuits, Quinlan said.
Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 locations, has used Convercent for more than a year to ensure employees are aware of the policies and procedures and have an easy way to reach their corporate headquarters.
Earlier, if an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a phone number or email for the company's headquarters, file a formal complaint and hope he was taken seriously.
It was often an intimidation and awkward experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesdays General counsel who said there was no good way to track the complaints from staff.
Now that the company uses Convercent, problems previously hidden by executives who sat in offices in cities or states can be identified - such as discrimination, harassment or unfair practices more quickly identified and addressed.
"I can get closer to this holistic, 360-degree view of the experience with employment," said Vitrano, who heads Ruby Tuesday's Risk Management Group.
"And we protect our shareholders from employment litigation."
Companies began taking ethics, values and employee engagement more seriously in 2002 after accounting firm Arthur Andersen collapsed because of ethical violations by the Enron scandal, Quinlan said.
But it took until the "social media came to their right" that companies realised that you could not prevent their dirty laundry going online.
"Before using technology to monitor ethics, people used hope as a strategy," he said.
Both glint and Convercent offer your software as a service, and charge the companies with recurring charges for using their products.
It is a business model and a chance to find the approval of Venture Capital investors who have supported both start-ups.
Convercent received $10 million in funding in February from firms such as Sapphire ventures and Tola Capital, raising total capital to $47 million.
Glitches secured $10 million in November from Bessemer Venture Partners and brought its total funding to $60 million.
These investments are hardly surprising, given the networked nature of companies, culture and venture capital.
There is a growing complex of research showing that today's employees expect more from their jobs than before.
In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are only bets.
The staff want to feel that you are accepted and valued and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission.
"If people are glad to be in a company that belongs to their voices, and that the work you do is worth it, they feel more committed to making this company successful," said Nina McQueen, vice president of Global Benefits and employee Experience at LinkedIn, which uses both Convercent and glint.
Investors are achieving returns when their portfolio companies run well, and companies are running well when employees are committed and engaged.
If the analytics tools of third parties promise to increase commitment and the use of the employees, it is no wonder that you will find support.
The data on employee engagement according to the experts of workplace culture is important.
But the data are useless if the administrator of a company does not take any action.
In fact, if a company asks employees after your feedback, it may have an expectation that change is on the way.
And if the change doesn't come fast enough, or not at all, this can breed disappointment and motivate employees.
"If you ask for 4,000 suggestions, you have to be willing to have 4,000 conversations," said Russell Raath, president of consulting at business management firm Kotter International, who has seen companies relying too much on collecting data.
"Because if you don't follow employees wondering," Have you really heard me?
Do you care about that?
And who you don't care about, why should I? "
Madison Reed, who is now conducting monthly staff surveys, was able to take action on the same day when a problem is reported about glint, according to Errett.
And after collecting feedback from frustrated employees, it was through the speed of decision-making and the quality of communication, able to reorganize several teams within the company and add a communications training session to address the problems.
At Ruby Tuesday, the company is getting new insights about the employees, and it hopes that in the long run, this leads to a better bond of workers in an industry that is known for high sales.
"If you are not required to create a culture of transparency, you will lose people," Vitrano said.
"And if you lose people, you lose customers as well.
And if you lose customers, then you will lose businesses.
The NCAA eliminates the two-day practice and makes a long day for the Bruins
It goes to 11pm when a crowd of UCLA football players entertain on one side of the team's new practice fields on campus.
Some have pulled out their jerseys and show the back full of sweat from the first day of training camp.
For a good part of the team, these idle minutes represent a lunch break.
Players enrolled at the summer courses will return to their final exams after the three-hour exercise before returning to the Waterman Football Center next morning at 6: 30 p.m.
"This is a real treadmill for the guys the next three days," Bruins coach Jim Mora said shortly before Monday's match.
The NCAA eliminated two-day exercises to ease the players' load and it has actually extended their days - at least to the final on Friday.
That's why UCLA's first three training sessions should start at 7: 15 p.m. to meet the players' already packed schedules.
The compromise away from the two days is more than a day when the Bruins postponed the start of the camp almost a week after last season and performed practical exercises during the summer school for the first time during moras six seasons in Westwood.
They are expected to hold 18 exercises over the course of August, 20 before the start of formal game preparations for their kick-off against Texas A & M in September.
Mora said he supports the NCAA's rule change, even if it adds another point to the players' busy routes.
"We put this huge burden three or four days on them, and it's very challenging," Mora said.
"And they just pushed it through, they plucked on, they're great people.
I think once we get through to Saturday and we have more time, it's going to be really great. "
UCLA will end its practices once the camp is finished, which, given the clear lines of sight of its fields from an adjacent parking lot and the adjacent Luskin Center, a hotel of the upscale class already pelted with footballs that cleared a protective net behind a goalposts, will not be an easy task.
Bruins players are expected to occupy the hotel from this weekend, but Mora conceded there could be a problem once those rooms are free during the season.
"We will use our security," Mora said.
"This is a real problem and it's not far-fetched to think that people are renting a room there and then setting themselves up there to record an exercise.
If you have the video tape of an exercise, it's a pretty good deal.
But we have security forces there, and we have security forces on parking 8.
We'll do the best with what we have.
I do not worry too much about this.
We have a plan. "
Facebook wants to intensify fact-checking in the fight against fake news
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with false messages to factual auditors from third parties and then show their results under the original post, the world's largest online social network said Thursday, saying it is one of its efforts to combat so-called fake news.
The company said in an opinion on its Web site that it will begin using updated machine learning methods to detect possible false messages and send them to factual auditors who may see results of the fact-checking from the original article.
Facebook has been criticized as one of the main distribution points for so-called fake news, many of whom believe they have also influenced the 2016 US presidential election.
The problem has also become a major political issue in Europe, with French voters being flooded with false stories in the run-up to the May presidential elections, and Germany supports a plan to punish under social media networks if they fail to quickly eliminate hate-filled postings as before the elections there in September.
On Thursday, Facebook said in a separate statement in German that in the U.S., France, the Netherlands and Germany, a test of the new facts review will be launched.
"In addition to finding out what stories are being challenged by fact-checking third parties, people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share," said Sara Su, product manager for Facebook messages in a blog.
She added that Facebook will continue to test its feature on the "related article" and is working on other changes to its news feed to reduce false news.
Create a comic novel: A castle in the history of England
In his recent past, the little Scotney Castle was seen in a squeeze-music video and was a loophole for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970-he and 1980-era years.
But Scotney has seen 700 years of turbulent history from his cozy seat in the Bewl River Valley in Kent, and has now become an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes, a mophaary Yorkshireman with a penchant for historical documents.
"I find it so nice to look at the handwriting of someone who has been dead for 300 years," he says hurt.
"What a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand."
'a Castle in England 'spans the period from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families living in Scotney; each story was illustrated by another, emerging British artist - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
It is not the first book by Rhodes based on an archive: He wrote 2014 'Dead Men's teeth and Other stories', a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project he found unexpectedly emotional.
"I only reacted to the thumb on the side of a letter written by a double agent in the 1700-year-old who worked for the Jacobiner," he says.
"This is his thumb!
And letters always smell smoke, because at the time you ignited a fire because of the light.
For someone who lives 300 years later, the smell has an effect as if he were even there.
Oh, I love archives! "
For someone who is so beaten with old papers, that he is supported by the National Trust and Arts Council England and lived almost four months in a castle ("To be honest: I gave my welcome a little overpriced") this seems all too nice to be true.
Rhodes spent his days exploring the Victorian "new" castle, watching the archives and studying the castle's many treasures and curiosities, such as the mounted hyenas on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the ditch.
He wandered through the terrain and the ruins of the old castle, talking to landscape gardeners, gardeners and sometimes with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book.
Then, at night he drank "whiskey and began to write."
The intimate story of Scotney is relatively unknown since the National Trust gained full access only in 2006 when the last heir, Elizabeth Hussey, died.
When Rhodes arrived a decade later, the employees just began to worry about the archive he described as "hundreds of years in which aristocrats said" Oh, discard it on the attic. "
Diaries, letters from the time of the English Empire, maps that represent who possessed what: "You might think that land conflicts would be boring," says Rhodes, "but there was a birdie to fight the two families.
Guys, let everything go his gear! "
Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to immerse in English history on a broader basis, including 'The Labour', which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the farm uprising of 1381.
"There is a record of a riot that occurred in 1380 in the castle, in this book titled 'Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex'," Rhodes says.
"The farm uprising began in that area and I thought an uprising was a good start.
Maybe the two are connected? "
Other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like 'The Priest', which tells the story of the Jesuit patter, which the Darrell family hid for seven years during the English Reformation.
Or 'The smuggler', in which the smuggler Arthur Darrell is portrayed from the 18th century who staged his own funeral by filling a coffin filled with stones (a discovery that was made only years later when his coffin was excavated).
The Darrells are Rhodes' favorite family of Scotrail: "The gentlemen seemed to be pretty crooks, always blaming and spending money on things they couldn't afford.
Other generations of Darrell men unleashed their debt crises by marrying rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of good-looking guys, with a talent to advertise Erland. "
After the end of his deployment in the castle, Rhodes is looking for other unique writing experiences
He has taken a two-week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about Elämämämire, the site of a sanatorium dating from the early 20th century, which has since been reclaimed by nature.
But Scotney has a special place for him.
"I was sad to go back," he says.
It was like, "Oh, now I have to deal with the damn life."
Campaign launched: Over 300 year-old Marienchapel in Rhoendorf shrouded
With the enveloping of the 301 year-old Marienkapelle in Rhoendorf, the city of Bad Honnef launched its campaign to introduce a new roof brand (round show Thursday) on Friday.
Until Thursday, Mayor Otto Neuhoff and his marketing team around Nelson Artz want to keep the logo and slogan secret.
At the end of August, there should be a festival on the island of Grafenwerth as a highlight of the campaign.
"Too nice for us.
Or? "The makers of the action have been asking for the posters at the Rhoendorfer Chapel yesterday.
"We don't really think of that (of course!)," they write on their website released yesterday.
"But we use this measure to attract your attention.
And to make it clear that some are better than it seems.
Basically, we are firmly convinced that as Bad Honnefer citizens we know very well about the beauty and attractiveness of our city. "
The action is about more than "just" a logo and a slogan, it said.
"It is true to formulate a single promise, one that gives the city a distinctive single position."
After all, they are competing with other local authorities.
A mid-five-figure sum can cost the city of Bad Honnef its new umbrella brand and the campaign.
Military reforms in Turkey - Erdogan's fear of the army
Every year in early August, in Ankara, the Supreme Military Council (YAS) advises on retirements and promotions in the officer corps.
So did this week.
At first glance, a normal process.
But nothing is routine among Turkish forces a year after the coup attempt.
The meeting was no longer held in the General Staff's building, as before, but in the prime minister's office.
The discussions took place under the presidency of the Heads of Government now including the five Deputy Prime Ministers and the Ministers for Defence, Home Affairs, Justice and Foreign Affairs.
As a result, the civilians in the YAS were in the overnumber.
The government is taking the reins in the military.
Chief of Staff Hulusi Akar remains in office, but the commanders of the Army, the Air Force and the Navy have been deposed.
Since the failed coup, leader Erdogan has fired 169 of the 326 generals and admirers.
More than 10,000 troops have been removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of alleged ties to the movement of exiled preacher Fethullah Gülen, whom Erdogan sees as a wire-bearer of the coup attempt.
Against 486 people who have been directly involved in the coup attempt, it is being negotiated in Ankara this week.
Even the day after the coup, Erdogan called the coup attempt "God's gift," as he gave him the opportunity to "fully cleanse" the armed forces.
But does Erdogan really have the army under control?
In late February, the newspaper "Horriyet" published an article titled "unease at the military headquarters."
In the General Staff, there are concerns about an increasing "Islamisation" of the army, which, among other things, appears to manifest itself in the lifting of the headscarf ban for soldiers, the newspaper wrote.
In any case, the large-scale intervention in the army and the security forces continues.
In mid-July, Erdogan released another 7395 public servants by decree, including 2303 police and 546 soldiers.
In doing so, it seemed as though Erdogan was taming the military.
The generals used to be the real masters of the country.
Three times, she put her role as the guardian of the secular state order.
After his 2002 victory, Erdogan pressed the military's power to step back, not least citing the European Union's reforms.
Former officers say Erdogan is targeting an Islamization of the armed forces.
In the magazine "vocal Europe," an unnamed officer who sought asylum after the coup attempted for fear of persecution abroad said the Turkish army will be "full of extremists and Salafists" in a few years.
If that is true, such a development could not leave NATO cold.
In any case, there are doubts about the readiness of the Turkish army in the alliance after the clean-up.
The leadership structures and operational capabilities are "weakened," NATO diplomats say.
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
There will be a new U.S. immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card, said President Donald trump, quoted by the media.
He looks to lower legal immigrants to 50,000 a year, stricter rules for obtaining visas for a temporary work permit and restrictions on family-oriented visas.
The new rules are proposed by Republicans and supported by the president.
The bill is to be discussed in the two chambers of Congress.
"This law will reduce poverty, increase wages and save billions of dollars for taxpayers and will do so by changing the way the US will change the way citizens from other countries are spent on Green Cards."
The law will prevent chain migration and replace the current system.
This new application procedure will benefit the candidates who speak English, who have the financial resources to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy, "trump said, quoting the American media.
Ministry wants to clean up track for racecourse shuttle
Over the past few months, over the past few months, the future of the racecourse has been disputed - now it is to go very quickly.
Before the end of the year is to be built at the ailing track on which the tourist train runs.
To ensure the future of the racecourse in the long term, construction work is expected to begin at the track later this year, according to the Department of Transportation.
"With the decision to further order and repair the Ilmenau circuit, the country is committed to this particularly important link for tourism," Transportation Secretary Klaus Sühl said Friday in Erfurt.
The cost of repairing the track was estimated at about EUR 2.5 million.
Of that amount, the country is taking 75 percent.
The treaty, on which the shuttle will also be ordered from the country in the future, is currently being voted on, Sühl said.
The Ministry and the South Thuringian Railway as operators are already agreed on the technical details.
"With that, the road map, the vehicles used and the quality standards are negotiated," Mr Sühl said.
The planned contract between the Ministry and the Railway Company will be closed for a period of 11 years.
This will allow the racecourse Shuttle to be ordered regulars in December 2017.
The racecourse shuttle is one of the most popular railway connections between the railway stations of Ilmenau and the racecourse.
In recent months, in the course of a pilot operation, it has been tested whether the track is used by enough people to re-order them in the future.
The track is also heavily decrepit in parts.
The rise of sex robots is real and we should be worried
Just as you thought it won't be even more crazy in 2017, a new report on technological developments in the field of sex robots comes in.
Yes, indeed.
Sex robots are a big thing at the moment.
Recently, the Foundation for Responsible robotics (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years.
According to Noel Sharkey, emeritus professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of FRR, we must begin to take their rise seriously.
Customers can choose the robot's eye color, its shape of nipples and the type of fingernail.
"People are making fun of them, but the companies are delivering lots of it, and we're going to see them much more often," Mr. Sharkey said in the release of his new report.
Modern sex pups have evolved from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with deliberately human reactions achieved by artificial intelligence.
The user can also "customize" his robot according to his beliefs and select everything from the robot's eye color to the shape of the nipples to the type or color of his fingernails.
But it becomes even more troubling as many robots own the "personalities" who would make a Stepford woman progressive.
Modern sex pups have evolved into robots with a silicone skin.
For example, the RealBotix robot allows its users to adjust their robots to the properties they find appealing, such as shyness.
And then there is the Cryxxy Gold Sex robot developed by True companion with pre-programmed personalities such as "frigid Farrah," which conveys the impression of shyness and "Wild Wendy" with an "adventurous" personality.
"Cryxxy Gold has a personality that is as best adapted to your personality as possible," says the website of True companion.
So she likes what you like, and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc.
She also has her moods throughout the day - quite like real people!
She can be tired of being fixated on conversation or she can be "in mood"! "
There are a lot of troubling aspects to this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the submissive female features, the allusions to rape, when you get a move on frigid (called here: Reluctant) Farrah, worry one most.
On his website, True companion Cryxxy compared with a vibrator, but for men.
"If women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can men then have no PHxxy?" Said on the site.
However, these sex robots are not just a fetish or just another sex toy.
Their emergence and increasing sophistication point to something darker and deeper in our culture, to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with submission as an optional addition.
Most men, of course, will not hold sex robots, and while the FRR notes its rising popularity, they still remain on the verge of consumer culture.
But what is leaked out of the fringe zones can be very instructive in terms of the spirit of the time we live in.
And many people are not weird or abusive until the free market gives them permission to do so.
There is some overlap, however, that these highly developed sex robots appear at a time when women's rights are under threat worldwide, in which there is a president in the White House who has boasted of sexually assaulting women.
The most daunting aspect of the television series' The Handmaid's Tale '(' The Report of the Magd ') is not the graphic images, the devout bodies and the stuffed eyes, but how realistic this vision works.
The Republic of Gilead is a leap, but at the moment this doesn't feel like a big jump.
The goal behind these sex robots is to make a physical resemblance to actual women as realistic as technically possible (albeit with porn star proportions).
Their builders want them to feel human, that they imitate the movement of a real body.
But, to the point when it comes to their "personalities," the robots do not represent real women.
You can't separate from their companion or just go away.
They have no mediation or background history, nothing that suggests independence or anything, which could disrupt the imagination of total submission.
In other words, they are fake slaves.
Or to put it in the redesign of 2017: Service girls
Trump's great achievement?
He makes Mitt Romney the epitome of common sense
It has become a truism of the trump era that the political divisions that have polarized the US electorate have also split families in small format.
Around Christmas and Harvest Festival, there were newspapers in the US with advice on how to deal with the horror of trump's elected relatives.
We are all supposed to be trying to burst our filter bubbles.
Less noticed is trump's power to bring families together.
I mention this because my cousin, a left-leaning poet who lives in Chicago and has long been dealing with Republicans in our family, visited me this week in New York.
She reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.
With trump in the White House, anyone she knows, including the Republican kinship with whom she had fought for decades because of politics, suddenly and quite odd on the same page.
This is certainly a good thing about the dining table, but it falls to me in another context that there are also significant risks.
The left has been strengthened by trump, but the distorting effect of his presidency has the strength to push all of us to the right.
When we talk about "normalisation" and trump, we refer to the grinning possibility that one day's patrons will no longer be repelled.
There is, however, an even more terrifying long-term scenario in which trump's right-wing Republican is "normalised," which suddenly appears to be the epitome of sensible at once compared to his standards.
Today I find myself affected by an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's urcomic version of the madman - the dog on the car roof, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew what his tax declaration looked like) - the two, compared with trump, are indeed a very mild crime.
If trump goes, the next Republican nominee must be only mentally healthy to qualify as a vast improvement.
As my cousin was in town, we brought our children to the carousel in Central Park, the biggest of the carousel of the New York Park Department, and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don't need caffeine.
The horses are huge, the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are knee-jerk and the animals are twisting themselves to look full of fear over their own shoulders - extremely sinister and the clunky music conveys this in a strange way.
So many clichés of a city disappoint: The views of high buildings become old, the skylines are becoming too familiar to offer a lot of excitement, and the reality of the city is not fair to the dream.
Thirty-five years later, and I'm still not quite over the day when I found out that Swiss cottage is indeed not a Swiss cottage - the theme pub Ye Olde Swiss cottage does not count - but a big roundabout in north London.
The Central Park carousel, however, is still a strangely magical experience, as here two two-year-olds, an 11-year-old and two women in the 40-year-old can go on it and all have a great time.
If I could have assessed the carousel, I would have given him the full score, but luckily no one asked about it.
On the other hand, I was forced into a mall this week to assess my "experience" with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could go through my credit card.
In the coffee house on the corner of my street, it's the same, plus the option to withdraw the rating with a 15 per cent tip - this to buy something about the counter.
This not only leads to a slowdown in what should actually be a neutral exchange, but also puts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where none is required.
The poor woman in the mall stood excruciating, while I was tired of the experience of reaching her my credit card with five stars.
Oscar Pistorius with chest pain from prison to hospital
Pistorius has left jail for a hospital visit for the second time.
Last year, he was taken to hospital because of the treatment of cuts to his wrist, which he reportedly suffered from prison authorities after a case in his cell.
Pistorius was convicted of murder following an appeal by prosecutors against a first-degree murder conviction.
He killed Steenkamp in the early morning hours of Valentine's Day 2013 by shooting her several times through a door of the toilet cubicle at his home in Pretoria.
Pistorius claimed he held his girlfriend for a late-night intruder who hid in the cab.
Prosecutors have announced their intention to appeal this time against Pistorius's six-year jail sentence, from which they say she is too lenient.
The National Criminal Justice Department said it will appeal to the South Africa Supreme Court, and the appeal may be heard this year.
Pistorius is in danger of increasing his sentence to 15 years if prosecutors are successful.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
As Bauer Arnold finds a strange egg
As the last of the Blumberg schools, fourth-graders were released from Fützen and Eftenhofen in the holidays and in the secondary schools.
Three of the redundant students will go to gymnasium in the future, four to the secondary school.
School teacher Angelika Sitte welcomed the parents and representatives of the public at the Civic House Biesental in Eppenhofen on Tuesday night.
As a symbol of the school release, the 29 students of the four classes led by Sophia Schumacher and Regine Meder chose a young eagle growing up in the chicken farm, but then released into freedom.
To this end, the mating char led a musical titled "The Adler in the chicken hof."
Farmer Arnold found a strange egg, and left it out of his chickens.
Instead of a chicken kissing, a small eagle came out.
But the hope of making a chicken out of him smashed, the eagle spread on a high mountain his wings out and excitedly.
After that, the classes showed three and four in the enrollment of Yvonne Frank a chicken dance.
The hens danced with the young goggles carrying cylinders to make the bet.
The eagle is standing for integration, said school teacher Angelika Sitte.
The kitten is different than the other kitten (chicks), but it is part of it.
He will never be like a chicken, though.
His provision is to be free.
She wished every fourth-grader that he feels accepted at his new school.
It followed thanks to colleagues, former school teacher Michael Müller, who repeatedly jumps up in teaching shortages, and the parents' representatives.
The kissing time is now over, explained class teacher Sophia Schumacher.
She sacked her students after two years of teaching only very reluctantly, because it was a really great time.
Finally, she was able to rely on fourth-graders.
At the end, all students left a song of daylight saving time and holiday time.
In doing so, great joy broke out among the children.
Eight first-graders are already registered for the new school year.
Two Bulgarians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
Two Bulgarians were arrested for illegal campuses in Greece, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, quoted by television, said.
On the morning of August 1, in Sithonia, a group of illegal camping people were arrested by police, including the two Bulgarians.
The same day they were released while an investigation is under way.
The State Department told bTV that Bulgarians were later released.
The Greek authorities have tightened up control of the free camp and put on anyone who is found to remain in a place that is not intended for that purpose, imposing significant fines.
The checks will continue throughout the season.
The ministry said the court may impose a fine.
Software update for diesel vehicles: What those affected now need to know
How exactly does the software update take place?
Do diesel drivers have to participate in the action?
The most important questions and answers in the overview.
At the diesel summit, BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW Group offered software updates for a total of about 5.3 million cars.
They are intended to improve the exhaust behaviour of cars of the emission classes Euro 5 and partly Euro 6.
Euro-4 diesel or worse are exempt.
Anja Smetanin of the ACE Auto Club Europe gives assessments:
Is the new action mandatory?
No, the negotiated software updates are voluntary.
"The mandatory updates previously apply only to the vehicles that have chummel software," says Anja Smetanin.
Their retrofitting has been ordered by the Federal Office of Power (KBA).
How and when will customers be informed about updates?
Manufacturers have announced a swift implementation over the next few months but not yet called an exact date.
Daimler has been told to write to any concerned.
If an inspection is due anyway, this will be done within the framework.
How long should the conversion be taken as a whole?
"Hard to say," says Smetanin.
That depends on manufacturers' commitment and political pressure.
"Because we have seen, voluntarily the automakers do not act on the environment so far."
How long should the update take?
The conversion itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop.
Time-consuming, it may be to get an appointment.
What are drivers who do not drive a car from BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW Group?
The ACE advises for waiting.
Presumably foreign manufacturers would follow suit, according to Smetanin.
Is there now a massive fall in the price of euro-4 cars?
The ace worries that.
But just in the regions where driving bans are threatening.
In rural areas, there is no loss of value for older diesel so far.
The ACE advises, with a sale yet to be seen.
Ll Cool J receives Kennedy Center award
The Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most glamorous events in Washington.
The first award ceremony under President trump promises to become political.
One of the laureates doesn't want to come - out of protest.
Ll Cool J (49) gets first rapper one of the prestigious Kennedy Center's coveted awards.
As the cultural institution announced on Thursday, this year, singer Gloria Estefan (59), Lionel Richie (68) as well as the choreographer Carmen de Lavallade (86) and the TV producer Norman Lear (95) are among the honors.
The awards will be handed in early December.
Traditionally, U.S. President Donald trump will host a reception and join with his wife, Melania, at the ceremony.
The award winner Lear, which has been announced with progressive TV series, has already announced that it will refrain from participating in the gala.
The New York Times said: "This presidency has decided to completely neglect the arts and human rights - even depriving them of the means - and that burdens me."
The 59-year-old Estefan stressed that she will use the conversation with trump to clarify her view.
The Kennedy Center named after former President John F. Kennedy is the largest cultural institution in the U.S. capital.
Previous award winners include Meryl Streep, Aretha Franklin, Robert De Niro, George Lucas, Tom Hanks and sting.
We make the city life-worth
Roland Wacker, Haslach's city builder, retires next year.
The place is already advertised - but suitable applicants are rare.
WACKER city builder for 31 years.
And the work still makes him great fun as he conveys in the press briefing.
He reports varied but also demanding tasks awaiting his successor.
At the same time, it surprises him that no application has so far fulfilled the requirement profile.
The city is looking for an architect or civil engineer at the earliest possible time.
So, in accordance with the regular termination deadlines, there is still plenty of time for training.
As Haslach functions for the administrative community as a lower right-wing authority, the applicant must show appropriate degrees.
Because this function wants to keep the city in any case.
If it could no longer fill it, the citizens would have to go to Offenburg for advice.
But close to the people is important to the city and to it itself, says WACKER, who reports from a good operating climate and good mood between the authority and the public.
In more than 30 years in office, some significant projects have accumulated, looking back at WACKER with pride.
"We make the city life-worth," he is sure about the construction office and his staff.
But also in the future there are varied projects on the agenda: The transformation of the former Hukla area and the low-court parkplatz are about to be initiated.
The Kinzigbridge between Bollenbach and Steiach is being renewed, even the stadium renovation is still subject.
The latter alone will beat about 1.5 million euros to book "if we're doing right," WACKER estimates.
"All in all, great tasks await my successor.
The work here is fun. "
There is a lot of space for a city builder.
With Haslach's own Bauhof and gardening, you can react to a lot of flexibility.
"You can move a lot," WACKER said, and the design of the greenery is often praised by citizens and visitors.
As the old town stands as an ensemble under monument protection, it is important to "have an eye for what fits" when new buildings are approved, the outgoing city builder stresses.
In any case, the city builder has a high responsibility.
He's builder, "in the end, everything is going through my table here."
In the case of care and coordination, he can count on many years of staff: Markus Neumaier (Hochbau) has been in the process for ten years, Manfred Schöner (deep-building) for 15 years.
Also, that his successor remains long, WACKER wants: "We are looking for someone who really wants to identify and stay with the place."
Because continuity is not only important for a good operating climate, but also for the further shape of the city.
If you want to inherit Roland WACKER, you should be able to have a completed study as a graduate engineer or bachelor's degree in architecture, as well as a bachelor's degree in building planning and building law, according to the city Haslach.
The municipal building is built on high and low construction, construction management planning, basic acquisition, management of urban properties, urban farmyard with building yard and townhouse, as well as the lower right-wing authority including conservation.
Bike thrown on wires: Southern railway line closed
According to police, the previously unknown offenders had thrown the blue bike from the railroad tracks in the area of Leobener Street (B116) on the lines.
These were so badly damaged that the moving freight train had to be stopped.
Investigators are out of two male offenders and have been searching for them since the night hours.
Close to the scene, witnesses were watching a rosary rollercoaster and a bicycle driver.
"This goes well beyond a Lusatian strip," said ÖBB spokesman Christoph Posch to APA.
That or the perpetrators would have put themselves in great danger and also put the train service at risk.
In addition to the damage to the lok and the plant as well as the delay minutes and the cost of rail replacement, Pölalen of the railway customers could also come to the perpetrators.
Overall, a "substantial" amount should be expected, the spokesman said.
The damage was fixed again on Friday afternoon, while rail traffic on the south lane could be run without a disability.
Just under 10 passenger trains were on Friday morning, two of which concerned long-distance traffic.
Freight trains did not fall, but they had been delayed.
According to ÖBB spokesman Christoph Posch, about 200 metres of overhead lines had to be exchanged.
Insulators and poles were also damaged.
Red meat, dairy products and chocolate could help alleviate IBD (inflammatory bowel disease)
Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.
But a new study claims exactly the opposite: A diet rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products could relieve the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel diseases.
The incurable condition, which affects around 1.3 million in the US and 300,000 in the UK, causes stomach cramps and blisters, recurring or bloody diarrhoea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
While those affected are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to relieve their symptoms, researchers at Washington University found that the essential amino acid Tryptophan of proteins helps develop immune cells that promote a tolerant intestine.
The senior researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, said that immune cells in the intestines are patrolling to ensure that harmful microbes that hide in food do not penetrate the body.
Cells capable of causing inflammation are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissue.
If the balance tends too far toward inflammation, it may result in inflammatory bowel disease.
Experiments have been found that a type of tolerance promotes immune cells in mice that carry a certain bacterium in their enrollment.
And the bacterium requires Tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of cells.
Professor Colonna said: "We have made a connection between a Bakterienart - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of bowel microbioms, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.
The more Tryptophan had the mice in their food, the more they had from these immune cells. "
He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and one at Tryptophan's rich diet promotes more tolerant, less inflammatory bowel environments if the same system affects humans as well.
The postdoctoral fellow Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan studied a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when it found that a group of study mice had such cells, but another group of the same tribe, but which was separated, had not.
They suspected that the difference had to do with the bowel microbiomen of the mice - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi that normally live in the gastrointestinal tract.
The diners of the mice were DNA sequenced and there were six bacteria species found in the mice with the immune cells, but without them missing in the mice.
Mice were raised in a sterile environment, so they lacked a bowler microbiom and they did not develop these types of immune cells, and they were given the L. reuteri and the immune cells.
To understand how the bacteria affected the immune system, the researchers allowed L. reuteri to grow in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of the liquid -- without the bacteria -- to immature immune cells isolated from the mice.
The immune cells evolved into the tolerance-enhancing cells.
When the active component was cleaned from the liquid, it proved to be a byproduct of the Tryptophan metabolism known as Indol-3-lactic acid.
When the researchers doubled the amount of Tryptophan in the lining of the mice, the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent, but when the trepptophan values were halved, the number of cells fell by half.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that people have the same tolerance-enhancing cells as mice, and that most of us protect L. reuteri in our gastrointestinal tract.
It is not known whether Tryptophan by-products from L. reuteri develop cells in humans as in mice, but defects in genes in relation to Tryptophan were found in people with inflammatory bowel disease.
She said: "The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestine.
Potentially, high Tryptophan values in the presence of L. reuteri can lead to an extension of that population. "
Jose Mourinho believes Manchester United have committed a "genius" with Nemanja Matic
At Manchester United, with Nemanja Matic having signed a "genius," Jose Mourinho believes after the midfielder had his debut against Sampdoria on Wednesday night.
Chelsea's £40 million signing began with a 2-1 win in Dublin, the last pre-season game before the UEFA Super Cup starts against Real Madrid on Tuesday, and impressed in the hamstring role as people like Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira marched ahead.
However, Matic had been ruled out of the blues' preparation Asia tour and created only 45 minutes, which Mourinho admitted he had to improve before the start of the Premier League season.
"He takes time but his experience, intelligence, a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football," Mourinho said.
"We will help him be ready sooner than later."
In addition to Matic, Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku also started at the Aviva Stadium when Mourinho formed his starting XI for the start of the season.
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho still wished for three more new commitments, but he insisted the club had already done a "fantastic job" of meeting three of its four priority new commitments.
"To get three out of four, for that I thank the club," he added.
"I'll be happier if they get four out of four for me, but they've got big trouble."
Boeing "paints" Dreamliner in the sky
The US aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the Silhouette of a Dreamliner in the sky.
The pilots flew from Seattle in the U.S. State of Washington, but the drawing began in Marquette in U.S. state of Michigan and moved in the form of a Dreamliner over the U.S., which is several thousand kilometers.
The action took 18 hours and a minute.
On the radar screens, the form of a Dreamliner was to be.
The whole thing was a endurance test for new engines.
Boeing had already made such advertising earlier.
So the number "787" and the Boeing logo were painted in the sky.
New low for Martin Schulz - Hanover, we have a problem
As the wind turns out, when Sigmar Gabriel was still SPL chief, Socialist prime ministers always looked to Berlin with some concern about Berlin.
Just no sturgeon from the party headquarters, no headwinds from the federal government - so was the most important wish of the election fighters.
Since Martin Schulz led the party, that has changed fundamentally.
Since then, employees from the Willy-Brandt-Haus, with growing horror, have been watching events in the SPD-ruled state capitals.
What Schulz has got from there since the beginning of the year would not be described in the approach with headwinds.
It was deep blows.
One after another.
After the surprising end of the red-green majority in Lower Saxony, the Federal CDU sees a general signal against coalitions of the SPD and the Greens.
"This shows once more: Red-green can simply not govern reliably," CDU Secretary-General Peter Tauber told the editorial network of Germany (RND).
The surprising faction leaving a Green MEP has plunged the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) into a serious crisis.
Five months before the country election, his red-green coalition lost its one-vote majority to the opposition from the CDU and the FDP.
Greens leader Michael Kellner has called on the renegade Dutch Green MP Elke Twest to return her mandate.
The resignation of the CDU means a clear falsification of the sake of the electorate.
Elke Twest must immediately return her mandate, "the federal executive and campaign manager of the Greens told the editorial network of Germany (RND).
"This may not be true all at all," a SPL campaign official said, when the new Hiobsbots reached the party headquarters on Friday morning.
Stephan Weil, SPL's prime minister of Lower Saxony, is there after the resignation of the Green MP Elke Twest to the CDU without his own government majority.
It is the preliminary culmination of a whole series of big and small crises in SPL National Associations.
And no one knows what's next.
The plight began with the unexpectedly clear defeat at the Saarland election in March.
A blue eye, more not, calmed the comrades at the time.
After the provincial elections in Schleswig-Holstein and North Rhine-Westphalia, everything will be different.
It was then - and it all became much worse.
The defeat in Kiel brought down the SPD, the Dusseldorf bust smooth the party.
Painstakingly rapped the comrades in the weeks afterward.
Then, when they had just got new courage, the G-20 summit came from Hamburg.
And with him came the next low.
Mayor Olaf Scholz, the last strong SPD leader, lost his Nimbus this weekend because he sat in the Elbphilharmonie while his city burned.
And because he was doing so pretty much wrong in crisis communication after that, which can be done wrong.
Since then, Scholz has been fighting for his political survival.
Now also Stephan Weil.
Due to the VW exhaust and its role in the Supervisory Board, the Prime Minister of Lower Saxony has been in the criticism for a long time.
Mies poll numbers added.
Nevertheless, or perhaps precisely that is why, in recent weeks, Weil has been increasingly trying to put accents in the federal state.
The efforts of the former mayor of Hanover to expand his power in Berlin did not hide comrades in the context of Martin Schulz.
They allowed him, as they promised to stabilize the party for Weil.
Now the exact opposite could happen.
For some reason, Weil is not guilty of the partisan dispute between the Green Party of Lower Saxony.
And Schulz is not at all.
In the meantime, the comrades are trying to keep their own ranks closed.
Her anger is directed at the Greens, and here mainly on the renegade parliamentarian Twest.
"It's unbearable and democratic, as Ms. Twest puts her own career choices about everyone else's interests," says Matthias Brasssch, head of party leftists in the SPD's Bundestag, the editorial network of Germany (RND).
Mrs Twest has not been elected as a direct candidate because of her person but has been elected to Parliament on the national list of the Lower Saxony Greens, according to the Dutch MEP.
The logical consequence would be for her to return her mandate.
Thomas Oppermann, head of the SPD's Bundestag, laments an "undemocratic maneuver."
"The voter's desire four years ago was clear: People have made Stephan Weil the prime minister," says Oppermann, who leads the Lower Saxony SPD as the top candidate in the general election, the RND.
"Now the personal career thinking of a future CDU member is distorting the election result," Oppermann said.
He called for the background to be investigated.
I would like to know whether there has been more or there have been further commitments from the CDU Lower Saxony.
Funding allowance for local core III
Anyone who wishes to renovate his house in the years can get support from the country in the near future.
On Wednesday, Mayor Albert Schindler and three representatives of Steg city development were informed on Wednesday.
At the beginning of the information event Schindler once again gave a look at what happened to date.
Since 1991, there have been sanitized areas of rehabilitation.
At the time, in the rehabilitation area I from 1991 to 2004, the country of Baden-Württemberg still took over two thirds of the funding.
In the rehabilitation area II from 2005 to 2016, the grant was still 60%.
For Schindler, previous renovations are a "success project" - it is, after all, important to promote internal development as well, and not just to tap into new construction areas.
On 4 April, the Government Bureau of Karlsruhe received the information that there will be a rehabilitation area III.
The funding amounts to EUR 833 333, of which EUR 500 000 would be received from the country, the rest of the community.
What is the result of a rehabilitation area?
One will, so Schindler continues, investigate where the "really old" houses are.
But it also plays a role in determining whether there is any interest in the planned area.
If necessary, the territorial boundaries could be postponed again.
The Steg represented Martin Keller, Gaby Pietzschmann and Sarah Gotzel on Wednesday night.
Keller presented the contents of the Bundesliga programme "Social City," in which the renovations would then be carried out.
The core of the programme is the revitalization of inner cities, the improvement of the living and working conditions and the preservation and expansion of the infrastructure.
The measures would be carried out, in other words per plot.
The clean-up area would then be established as statutes.
The grant period for funding has been under way since 1 January 2017 until 30 April 2026.
Until September this year, however, it would only be possible to take stock in the context of those involved in the rehabilitation area to fill out a questionnaire.
In November or December, as far as possible the decision of the sentence is to be made, so that the renovations can begin next year.
Pietzschmann then explained that any local community must conduct the pre-trial investigations.
It is a matter of assessing and deciding the urban problems, when it will be repaired and to what extent.
It will also be registered for the property in the basic book.
Pietzschmann himself will come back after receiving and make a picture of the situation, she promised.
Gotzel stressed that a key success factor for the project was the participation of those involved.
Therefore, there will be questionnaires sent to the public in the coming weeks and can be filled up until after the summer holidays.
The yellow questionnaire is the "Building and Grundstäcksbogen" which, among other things, deals with the structural state and the restoration intentions.
In the grey questionnaire, the "household and housing arc," information on the size, distribution and residents of a living room can be made.
The blue "operating sheet" is only to be filled if business premises are operated in the building.
However, to note, Gotzel pointed out that a completed questionnaire is not at the same time a request for funding.
Moreover, new construction measures are not eligible.
Schindler still stressed that the distribution of funding will work according to the "greyhound principle" - who comes first, mahl first.
You cannot "reserve" funding for later.
At the end, photos of the "Local II" project were still shown to make a refurbishment "tasty" to attendees.
British inventor is putting himself a microchip to come up with a hand movement in house and car
A British inventor is the first in the country equipped with a microchip to open his door, enter his office and even start his car with a hand movement.
Steven Northam, 33, had implanted the tiny chip between thumb and index finger and now offers the service to businesses and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology through his company BioTeq.
He joined Dr. Geoff Watson, an advisory Anaesthesia at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester, Hants, to ensure the implant procedure is carried out according to medical standards.
The technology resembles a cat and dogs implanted microchip and takes only 30 seconds.
Mr Northam's company also wants to change the locks on houses and cars so that they are compatible with the chip, all for an extra charge of £300 per lock.
The married father of one has now built in both home and his BMW Z4 technology, which begins when his hand is at the wheel.
White House's advertising costs cost taxpayers thousands
The White House's decision to fly a Marine helicopter to South lawn for an event that highlights U.S. manufacturing last month costs taxpayers up to $24,000, according to the military's figures, which were left to TIME magazine.
The green-white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One when the president is on board, was the centrepiece of the event on July 17 at the White House with American building programs.
President Donald trump, Vice President Mike pence and senior White House officials made a tour of products from all 50 states.
The helicopter, manufactured in Connecticut, was issued alongside a yacht from Maine, a fire truck from Wisconsin and a forklift truck from Mississipi.
The White House military office demanded the helicopter's presence in a piecemeal order or FRAGO, barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South lawn, according to records of the Marine helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for operating the helicopter.
"I just wanted you to be aware of this because it is such an unusual event with high visibility," the commander of the HMX-1 wrote on the eve of the event of his superiors, the deputy naval commander for aviation.
The news showed that the helicopter arrived at the South lawn for the event at 3pm on July 17, and stayed until the lawn was cleared between 18: 00 and 21: 00 this evening.
The note adds that if the departure from the White House was to be delayed, a second team would be needed for the return flight due to restrictions on service hours.
The original flight crew was at the helicopter during the event, while the unit's security personnel remained on the ground during the period.
The records provided by TIME did not make it clear whether a second flight crew was ultimately required.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using state-owned property for political purposes.
Records show that HMX-1 asked if the event could violate the provision.
"A question we asked was whether it was a violation of the Hatch Act and we were informed that this was not the case," the commander wrote.
"Sounds as if you're closed," the deputy commander replied.
The "Made in America" event was described by the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act.
But official events also have political overtones.
At the event, the president gave a push to reform health care reform that was under way in the Senate, and he promoted efforts to curb government regulations.
The use of the aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One is hardly a new phenomenon for politically advantageous purposes.
Presidents are required to use them for the trip.
But asking for their use only for a photo surgery is unusual.
Trump conducted an investigation in February when the presidential plane provided taxi services against the backdrop of his first campaign rally in Melbourne, Florida, and his Twitter account is full of messages complaining about the use of the presidential plane by his predecessor.
"The White House is thrilled with the show" Made In America "-- the products from all 50 states produced by American workers with American materials," said the White House's deputy press secretary, Lindsay Walters.
HMX-1 crews frequently run training flights in the area around Washington and in the South lawn to remove the U.S. president at the White House with precise centimeters.
When trump was at the G20 summit in Germany in early July, HMX-1 led 58 practice sessions at the White House.
The flight for the "Made in America" event counted in the flight crew's training needs for the month, an official said.
Helicopter units flew an additional 11 hours this day for "non-presidential support missions."
The White House said taxpayers took the burden for none of the other props presented at the event.
A spokesman for Sikorsky said the company was not involved in issuing the helicopter on the South lawn.
HMX-1 does not maintain budget records for the presidential flights, and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event.
According to hourly rates from the US Department of Defense for the financial year 2017, the DOD reimbursement rate for the VH-3D is USD 24,380 per flight hour.
Records of the unit recorded the plane's flight time as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Facility in Quantico in Virginia.
The White House argues that the actual cost of operating the helicopter is well below that rate.
"The cost to taxpayers based on the estimates for the reimbursement rates is highly misleading," Walters said.
"These estimates include staff, maintenance and many other hidden costs that are included in the annual funds."
According to an Rand study from 2015, the reimbursement rates for DOD do not include personnel costs, but take into account the cost of fuel, maintenance and contract completion.
At that time, the former White House press secretary, Sean Spicer, defended the helicopter's use for the event.
"The idea is to present things this week that are made in America," Spicer said.
"And I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud that they contribute to our national security, and I assume that hundreds, if not thousands, of people are dependent on it.
And I think like most Americans, we're all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked tirelessly.
It is, of course, appropriate to highlight that. "
It was not clear whether trump interacted with the helicopter when he entered his tour of the South lawn for the event, but he sat in the driver's seat of a fire truck.
At the White House, trump spoke to representatives of Sikorsky and joked with the media about his own fleet of company products.
"I know Sikorsky very well," the president said, "I have three of them."
TC BW Neuss ahead of tricky task
Spitzerreiter der Second Tennis-Bundesliga resigns at the Search Village Search Village SV.
The Tc Blau-Weiss Neuss arrives in Kiel at the table third Search Village SV tomorrow from 11 o'clock in Kiel.
Despite five scores of still pristine record, the top tier of the Second Tennis Bundesliga has gotten the sense of reality.
Team leader Marius Zay certainly has respect for the opponent.
"This is a compact team that always plays in quite similar formation.
Just on the back positions I find the team very good. "
For class and stability at the Search Village SV above all, imports from the high north.
"Their Danes and Finns can even point to stakes in the Davis Cup.
And they are also strong in doubles, "says Zay with a view to Harri Heliovaara (Finland), Andre Göransson (Sweden), Sören and Esben Oread, Martin Pedersen as well as Andreas Bjerrehus (all Denmark).
"That, as always, will be hard for us.
You also need a good dose of luck. "
The new team for the trip to the high north is handy.
His debut for blue-white could give Maxime Janvier.
The tournament in the Czech Liberec playoff Zdenek Kolar (Czech Republic) will play his first bet this season in the tournament in the Czech Liberec.
The previously undefeated Chile Hans Podlipnik-Castillo was on the ball yesterday with the White Russians Andrei Vasilevski at the ATP tournament in Kitzbühel.
He should be in Kiel as well as Botic Van de Zandschruck, Niels Lootsma (both Netherlands) and the Belgian Julien Cagnina.
After his two victories last Sunday against the club at the Alster, Máté Valkusz could also return to the team.
Enough for the 18-year-old Hungary, who was still the number one junior world number one in January 2016, is filling someone out of the coaching staff around Marius Zay the caddie.
How America can hurt OMV
Donald trump was not really happy when he put his signature under the law to tighten sanctions against Russia on Wednesday night.
"In his haste to enact the law," Congress wrapped up a few "unconstitutional regulations," he etched.
The reaction from Moscow was also as sharp as expected, and even Brussels limped against the US push.
After all, the draft provides for punishing European companies that help Russians build gas pipelines into the EU.
Since then, investors of the local OMV, which together with other European companies have co-financed the construction of the Russian Baltic Sea Management Nord Stream 2.
The dropdown is huge.
However, it is too early for an assessment of the consequences, according to the oil company's official statement.
Indeed, Donald trump himself would have to create the sanctions even by executive order.
Twelve weapons stand for him.
"The press" looked at which of the Group could ward off and which could really hurt him.
Narcos season 3 trailer: Without Pablo Escobar, the Cali cartel will be thrust into the spotlight in the hit series by Netflix
Despite the second season of Narcos revealing Pablo Escobar's killer, Netflix's series is far from over.
The seasons three and four were already confirmed by the streaming service, the first received their first trailer and showed the show's latest villain.
With the third season, the DEA has focused its attention on the world's richest organization of drug trafficking: The Cali cartel.
Led by four powerful pats, they operate "like a fortune 500 company" only with more government briefs and violent actions.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) is the leader of the cartel, Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) is her head, Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) commands the Mexican compound, and Chepe Santacruz Londono (Pepe Rapazote) is located in New York.
In the newly released trailer, Pedro Pascal returns as Javier Peña, the guy who invites American and Colombian law enforcement agencies to support the war on drugs.
Other new actors include Matias Varela, Michael Steel-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishe and Arturo Castro.
The third season of Narcos will begin on September 1.
Role backwards: The city represents 46 kitchen aid
The city organizes the Kita-Mittagstisch again.
With firm contacts for the children and an assignment to the team.
In urban day-care centers, the clock is shot back.
As of September 1, the city of Krefeld takes over food supply in the city's children's day institutions (Kitas) again in self-rule.
For Sonja Pommeranz, deputy leader in the field of youth aid, this is good news: "We were all very pleased."
Cooked will continue to be out of house: A caterer takes over this task and supplies freshly cooked chilled.
The city operates 46 day-care centers in the Krefeld area, and in 44 children get a warm meal at lunch time.
In the last kiteyear, 2800 children each sat at the tables, and the need is growing steadily.
"Meanwhile, not only children who are cared for 45 hours of hours, in the Kita at noon," explained Pommeranz.
"The offer also applies in the 35-hour care when children stay until 2pm."
46 part-time staff from 1 September have kitchen service: They warm the delivered dishes, supplement them around salad, raw taste and fruit, portioner the meal individually, give the food out, clean up, rinse and clean the kitchen.
"The employees are firmly assigned to a Kita," says Pommeranz.
The size - there are two-group as well as seven-group facilities - decides on the hour scale.
"The kitchen assistants are now firmly part of the Kita team," says Pommeranz.
"So they are much more involved and it is easier for the Kitalite to implement educational concepts."
This is also what it is about: Healthy eating and cooking lessons.
"The children are supposed to help prepare the food."
The direct connection of the kitchen power to the team makes sense.
Even for the children.
"You have a known force in the Kita, a person familiar to them, and not constantly changing people."
This continuity is important for children.
The cleaning of the Kita rooms - so far also the task of the kitchen forces - will be done by special cleaning staff in the future.
This variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - also has the charm, in addition to the quality improvement of the kitchen performance, which it has identified in the cost comparison between self-governing and foreign lending for the city as the most economical, the press office says.
And that, although 46 part-time workers are being rehired.
"But these hours don't fall so strongly at around 750 people in the education sector," says Sonja Pommeranz.
Afghan democracy depends on women's political role, UN says
Elections can only be representative if all members of society, including women, play a role, the head of the UN mission in Afghanistan said Wednesday.
Nicholas Haysom, acting head of the United Nations mission, said that hundreds of women will be standing in the provincial elections in the provinces, and three women are women for the role of Vice-President and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women.
"The role of women cannot be overestimated," he said in a statement on Wednesday.
Elections can only be truly representative and credible if women are fully involved and involved in all parts of the electoral process.
Afghan elections for the provincial council and presidential elections will take place on April 5.
The Taliban have issued threats against an election process that coincided with the transition from international fighting to an advisory role.
This year, for the first time, the elections will be held peacefully by a democratically elected government to the next.
Haysom said a strong role for women will reinforce Afghanistan's democratic success.
The Afghan Independent Electoral Commission reports that 1.2 million women of a total registered 3.6 million voters are registered.
Hike to TV anniversary
On the occasion of the 10th anniversary, the TV Kaiserring invites you to a small hike with a coffee and cake.
The hike will start on Sunday, July 9, at 1pm in Frohnstetten at the water reservoir in the Americanstraße.

Men try to weed out 13-year-old girl
Two young men aged 19 and 23 are said to have tried to deprive a 13-year-old girl on Thursday.
According to police information, the men spoke to the 13-year-old, who was staying with friends at Kolping Road, at about 14.55 because they wanted to phone the girl's phone.
The 13-year-old rejected the request but went on with her friends.
As a result, one of the offenders tried to grab the girl's cellphone and necklace, but what failed.
Without prey, the duo fled.
The two young men were later arrested by police.

GMB concerns over investment at McVitie factory in Glasgow
A union would like to see McVitie's long-term commitment to production at its plant in Glasgow.
GMB Scotland said the company was silent about the future of investments at the Tollcross site.
More than 500 employees work in the plant, which produces Hobnobs and Rich Tea biscuits in addition to other products.
McVities owner Pladis said he has invested more than £5 million in recent years.
He added that staff and union representatives "would be the first to find out" if their activities were to change.
In a letter to the company's branch manager, GMB Scotland called on McVitie's to "express concern that funding for the modernisation of production lines will not be pushed forward."
GMB senior organizer Drew Duffy, said: "The fact that we can't get clarity from the general-site manager about the business needs and investment plans for the future of Tollcross affects our members deeply.
Generations of families have worked here and the workforce is concentrating heavily on the local community and the Greater Glasgow area, an important pillar of decent employment in an area with high unemployment and social deprivation.
Therefore, under the perspective of jobs, wage and prosperity, and against the backdrop of Brexit, the rising cost of living and the chronic production decline, the eastern end of Glasgow desperately needs a thriving production presence at McVitie. "
A spokeswoman from Pladis said: "The branch manager at Tollcross only received a letter from GMB Scotland yesterday and the company will respond directly as we appreciate the continuing commitment to staff and union representatives.
Two months ago we had a regular meeting with staff and GMB representatives at Tollcross, where some questions were discussed openly.
We discussed with the employees that, like all companies operating in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate, we are constantly reviewing our business - and this applies to all our divisions and locations - to remain competitive.
She added: "In recent years, we have invested more than £5 million in our Tollecross site, particularly in production lines and operational improvements.
We recognise the legacy of Tollcross as a production facility, and if our operations are changed at the location, the employees and their trade union representatives will be the first to find out. "
Did PSG warn Barcelona three years ago before Neymar?
La Liga's side may regret their interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain will not let down in their pursuit of Neymar after giving an offer of £189 million to trigger his release clause, but did they warn Barcelona three years ago before the world record raid?
The sensational approach has fueled the transfer window in the summer, because the Ligue 1 club is poised to break the world record by more than double the previous mark, with Paul Pogba returning for £89 million to Manchester United last season.
After finishing, Neymar will become the world's most expensive player and the highest-paid professional athlete in the world, with PSG offering wages of more than £500,000 a week.
Barcelona are angry at the way Neymar has forced his way out there, although a source close to the Catalan board insists the club has always done its best to take care of him since arriving from Santos in 2013.
But was the football world warned about this prospect three years ago by the PSG president?
When Manchester City announced 2014 interest in signing Blaise Matuidi, Nasser Al-Khelaifi had a stern warning for any club that wanted to sign one of PSG's best players.
"I'm not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players then we will be in opposition to them, we will contact their players," Al-Khelaifi said.
"We respect all clubs.
But if they try to sign one of our players in themselves, this will have consequences. "
Barcelona seem to have crossed that line, with the Spanish club expressing interest in PSG midfielder Marco Verratti earlier this summer.
PSG made it clear that they would not allow the International from Italy to travel under any circumstances, and Barcelona could feel the consequences of that interest by losing one of their price offers for Neymar.
Scooter thrown and damaged
On the night of Friday on Saturday, an unknown offender deliberately turned down a scooter parked in the Königsfelder Straße in front of the property number 30, causing damage to the vehicle in excess of EUR 200.
Police Schramberg, phone 07422 / 27 01-0, asks for clues.
To an accident on the B 215 between Stolzenau and Leese, police are seeking witnesses.
Because he met a car on his track, the driver of a VW Touran had to escape and touch the guide.
On Thursday night, the 34-year-old was out of Rehburg-Loccum with his VW at 7.7pm on the B 215 from Stolzenau heading towards Leese.
In the area of Stolzenau's village, he had a car on his track, so he had to move to the right.
In doing so, the Touran driver touched down the guard rail.
Property damage was caused by the car.
The driver of the opposite car, a Mercedes Benz, had overtaken a lorry and continued his drive without taking care of the traffic accident.
It can be good, according to the accident victim, that the Mercedes driver had not noticed the accident at all.
The police are now appealing for witnesses to the incident and the driver of the driver's vehicle to contact the station in Stolzenau on Tel. 05761 / 92060.
Interview: 'Domspatzen report relieves Pope brother Georg Ratzinger'
The Regensburger Domspatzen report on the abuse cases relieves Pope brother Georg Ratzinger.
That means author and historian Michael Hesemann.
The final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen continues to cause discussion.
Christian Weisdder, spokesman for the reform movement "We are Church," explained after publication to the German Press Agency that he was expecting an apology from the former Regensburg bishop and today's Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as by the cathedral captain, Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of the emeritus Pope Benedict XVI.
It would serve the reputation of the Catholic Church very much if Müller and Ratzinger expressed their deep regret at their own omissions or their then false assessment of the events.
The Vatican newspaper "Osservatore Romano," on the other hand, criticized the fact that the reporting of violence in the Domspatzen was measured using "double standards."
With regard to the assaults in Regensburg, no one doubts that these are "shameful and shameful acts" that would have to be punished and prevented in the future; it is striking, however, the "degree of media manipulation," according to the author Lucetta Scaraffia, historian and member of the national Italian bioethics committee.
"The habit of describing the Catholic Church as a source of all ills is already part of everyday experience and prepares public opinion to keep that for normal," Scaraffia writes.
In the interview with Bayerischer Rundfunk, Princess Gloria of Thurn and taxis also said: "You are happy to go to the church and this is a found freshman."
She also pointed out that in her youth "blows were a very normal pedagogical means" "to be ready with cheeky children, like I was one."
It would find it unfair to apply today's standards to previous decades, because the world has changed.
In connection with reports of the cases of abuse, Pope brother Georg Ratzinger often appeared.
The author and historian Michael Hesemann, the author and historian Michael Hesemann, who wrote the "My Brother of the Pope" memoir with Ratzinger (translated into 12 languages).
"I have to take Georg Ratzinger into protection," says Hesemann, "because all this had nothing to do with him," he assesses the results of the final report.
What exactly is in the 440-page report presented by the lawyer Ulrich Weber, who was commissioned by the Bistum Regensburg with the Enlightenment?
A total of 547 Regensburger Domspatzen were sexually abused between 1945 and the early 1990s "with high plausibility" victims of assaults, 67 Domspatzen.
The final report refers to Georg Ratzinger, who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994: "To sum up, in many cases, the form of physical and psychological violence has been used by Domkapellmeister R.
In the case of high emotion, the punishment could also be more severe for the students.
Nevertheless, unlike many other defendants, many victims appreciate the general humanity of R. and therefore, in many cases, even combine positive memories with him. "
In the interview, Hesemann explains why the final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger is relieved of his opinion.
Mr Hesemann, the 440-page report on the "incidents of violence in protective custody at the Regensburger Domspatzen" gives a contradictory image of cathedral captain Georg Ratzinger.
For one thing, many students highlight his "humanity."
On the other hand, he also appears as a Cholerician and perfectionist who often became handy when a Domspatz didn't score a top performance musically.
How do you think as his biographer do this final report?
Michael Hesemann: If you take the trouble and read the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the back, you have to ask yourself why the name Georg Ratzinger occurs at all.
He is just eight pages dedicated to him and he is clearly acquitted of any suspicion of the mitter- or co-worker in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.
The violence at preschool also occurred outside its sphere of influence.
At best, you can accuse him of being too late or not taken seriously enough.
The Domspatzengymnasium, on which he acted, was perceived by virtually all respondents as - so literally - "redemption," "heaven" and "better world."
Thus, the vast majority of his students, Georg Ratzinger, presents an excellent record, describing him as "warm-hearted," "popular," "sincere," "competent" and "sympathetic," as an extremely good-natured teacher who regularly provided the boys with cakes, biscuits and candies and "always surrounded by grapes from children."
Only a minority complained about his perfectionism and his high emotionality, which also led to Wutausscheigen.
The fact that he didn't just kneel with chairs and threw the key covenant on the floor, but also slapped distributed and too cheeky guys on the hair or ears, he himself admitted years ago, deeply regretted and apologized for it.
To his honor rescue, however, it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the time in question, the 1960s and 1970s, with parents as with teachers.
Are you even aware of such chastity methods?
Of course, I think every one of us who was born before 1968.
I, too, experienced that in a secular school, a state grammar school.
However, compared to what this report is all about, namely the appalling sexual abuse and the excesses of violence at preschool, this is small.
One wonders whether it is not more with his notoriety and role as brother of Benedict XVI, that many media have just rushed to him.
At the Bavarian Pope, many who have never understood him are still working diligently.
The truth is, however, that the report relieves Georg Ratzinger in every respect!
In the media, there has been a lot of talk about the issue of abuse at the Regensburger Domspatzen in connection with the report.
Is Georg Ratzinger, in the final report, also put to the burden of any involvement or involvement in sexual abuse?
Michael Hesemann: Absolutely no.
No one of the 67 victims of sexual assault claims to have entrusted himself to the cathedral captain.
Not even the parents were inaugurated.
"I never dared to talk to my father or my mother about it," one person said deputy to the others, "It was all very embarrassing to me."
The real problem in educating sexual abuse was, and is, that most of the victims are silent.
If they were not even entrusted to parents and siblings, then certainly not a choir leader who, in a sense, would have been a colleague of the perpetrators.
How do the Domspatzen students assess Ratzinger's role in terms of abuse cases?
Michael Hesemann: A student questioned: "Regarding sexual abuse... I see... no case in which he (Georg Ratzinger) would have had timely knowledge and could have stopped the respective perpetrator.
I think it is really absurd to assume that he has, of course, opened himself... Jacks more forcefully, or clearer or more, than to their parents, Internatsladders, trust teachers, etc.
That you talk to him about sex... - unthinkable. "
So the report comes to the very clear result: "That it was entrusted to him in the run-up to the students and / or their environment, could not be confirmed in the context of the investigation."
So, as far as sexual abuse is concerned, Georg Ratzinger is free to speak out of any co-wisser.
Nor can he be accused of failing to prevent or bring him to the display.
There is therefore no reason to associate its good name with these repulsive crimes, as has unfortunately happened in some cases.
In the media, much of "violence" was read at the Regensburger Domspatzen.
The former cathedral captain, Georg Ratzinger, is accused of "walk-in" in the report.
Does he have to live with this accusation?
Michael Hesemann: This is the big problem in the reporting of everything mixed up and confessing to a huge melange of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere, in the middle of it, Georg Ratzinger.
This is, however, an abuse of the report.
In fact, there is a clean separate: Between pre-school and grammar school, between sexual abuse and violence and, let us say, other allegations.
The report also deals with incidents from the period since 1945, including four decades in which Georg Ratzinger was not a choral conductor of the Domspatzen.
All the terrible caning, the cases where boys of sadistic teachers were regularly harassed and malted and suffered horribly, all occurred at preschool in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where truly scandalous conditions had to be prevailed.
But with those, Domkapellmeister George Ratzinger had nothing to do, because he got the boys only to face when they were already on the Domspatzengymnasium.
On that, as the vast majority of witnesses stress, the theme "preschool" is taboo.
One was only happy to have escaped her and enjoyed so much better treatment and for many even "paradisiacal" states.
What else was in the Domspatzengymnasium?
Michael Hesemann: There was discipline, but no sadistic violence.
And this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, where the report concludes that "many victims appreciate the general humanity of R. and therefore, in many cases, even combine positive memories with him."
So at best, the accusation remains to have looked away.
But despite all the efforts, the report could only define two periods in which it was reported by the states at preschool.
The first time in 1970 / 71, when he had just started to establish himself and of the events at a school where he was not acting and responsible, (so the witness) did not want to hear anything, and then again in 1993.
Does Georg Ratzinger consistently listen to the ears?
Michael Hesemann: No, because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the Director of Domspatzengymnasium, which the report even reproduced.
In it, he points out that "the caning sentence continues to be practised in preschool."
In the face of the risk of negative press releases, he recommended urgent intervention.
This was, of course, at a time when legal clarity existed when caning also had long been banned in Bavaria.
Before that, they took place in a legal grey area, as everyone knows.
It was also difficult for him to assess where those affected may have been exaggerated or dramatized and where the permitted limit had really been exceeded.
You can't say, though, that he'd always looked away.
That's just not true.
It was only in 1980 that the caning of schools was officially abolished in Bavaria.
Princess Gloria of Thurn and taxis claimed that it was unfair to apply today's pedagogical standards to the time.
How do you see that?
Michael Hesemann: We historians talk about the "pitfalls of anachronism," that is, the danger of evaluating the past according to today's moral standards.
The princess is already right.
But, of course, this does not apply to sexual abuse, which was abhorrent at all times, and not for what has been broken up in preschool and violence to innocent children's souls, which goes far beyond that of ordinary people at the time.
That is all very terrible and I am glad that it is finally being investigated.
But at the same time, I have to take Georg Ratzinger into protection, because all that had nothing to do with him.
His means of disciplining and punishing, so slap and pulling on the hair and ears, were widespread in the 1970s.
When corporal punishment was then banned, he also strictly adhered to it.
What image of his Regensburg time has Georg Ratzinger reproduced in the conversations with you for the book "My Brother of the Pope"?
Did the subject of caning also be discussed?
Michael Hesemann: Now, the book is about the life of his brother Joseph, that is, Pope Benedict XVI, from his perspective, since the Domspatzen played only a supporting role.
Nevertheless, I do not hide the fact that he led a strict regimen there.
However, this must also be said: Without this perfectionism, without the requirement of absolute discipline, it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of world rank from the hitherto nationally known Regensburger Domspatzen, true cultural ambassadors of Europe and his musical tradition, which went on tour twice in the United States (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).
With cookies and candies alone, you don't have to be a great singer from reclusive bowls and every success, regardless of what territory, but always discipline, passion and self-overcoming.
As for a man, did you see Georg Ratzinger at the talks on her book?
Michael Hesemann: By working on the book and beyond, I have really met Georg Ratzinger quite well and have seen again and again as a wonderful, humorful, basic, deeply believer and heartbroken man, of which you can't imagine that he could do anything too sorry for a fly.
I regularly get to know how many former Domspatzen still today, 23 years after his Emeritation, keep in touch with him, visit him, read him - he is almost blind - and treat him like a member of their family.
Those who, to this day, have not forgiven him for being strict on them, are therefore clearly in the minority.
Most Domspatzen are grateful to him today for enriching their lives and bringing them to the world of music.
And that he always has a good, paternal teacher - a strict father, certainly, that may be - but also an adorable respect person to whom they are still watching today and who downright worship them.
And I would ask you to make it quite clear once again: Everything you accuse him of is educational methods that were on the agenda at the time.
We can be glad that we have long overcome this time.
But it is highly unfair to make a man, just because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother, to become a media scapegoat.
The bad intention behind it is all too obvious.
Because the report that has just been published relieves him.
Now the decency would command, a 93-year-old man who has gained great merit and without the outside of Bavaria and perhaps Germany's probably no one to know the Regensburg Domspatzen would finally be allowed to leave in peace.
