Munich 1856: Four maps that change your view of the city
An Irish institution where young people are supposed to meet today.
A pit chapel, where is now dug for the S-Bahn tunnel.
Small gardeners manage the former reason of farmers.
The oldest official map of Munich promotes exciting stories to days.
It's annoying when maps aren't up to date.
This is familiar to anyone who has had to get excited because the Auto-Navi displayed a green meadow instead of a bypass.
The historical maps of the digital Bavaria atlases, a bid by the state government's Geoportals Bayern, are far from up-to-date - but that is precisely why it is very revealing.
Especially if you compare them to current online maps.
It then becomes clear how towns and cities in the distribution area of Munich's Mercury have changed since the 19th century.
The digital Bayern-Atlas is a patchwork that, as such, is not recognized in the same way.
More detailed maps, known as position sheets, have been incorporated into the large overview map for towns and cities.
According to the Bavarian surveying administration, these were created between 1810 and 1864 and are the result of the first surveying of Bavaria.
Your client: Napoleon.
The French army leader has occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria.
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied land and commissioned a topographical recording of Bavaria - for military purposes, of course.
Even though the French troops finally pulled out with the peace of Lunéville on February 9, 1801: It was today's neighbours who created the idea of a blanket Bavaria map.
Elector Max IV. Joseph continued to drive the project, establishing the "Topographical Bureau" - and thus the Bavarian surveying administration.
The position sheet for Munich dates back to 1856 and, like all the others, can be found on the website of the Bavarian National Library.
The comparison Early / Today is most impressive on the example of the state capital.
The city has expanded in all directions and grown together.
An example of this is subsendling, which still appears relatively isolated in the map of 1856.
Sendling was incorporated as a Munich district 21 years after the map was created, that is, in 1877.
Today, Untersendling is in the middle of the city.
The houses of Untersendling are concentrated around 1856 along the present-day Plinganserstraße, which was only named in 1878 after Georg Sebastian Plinganser, a leader of the Bavarian farmers "uprising against Austria in 1705.
Where the Westpark is today, you see nothing but fields - at first glance: When zooming in, a smaller-scale map appears with dozens of lines and numbers: Handwritten numbered flurries from the so-called "primeval" from which the land tax was derived.
Small parcels no longer occupy farmers there today - but small gardeners of the "Land in the Sun" plant.
A large green area is located north of Untersendling.
The Theresienwiese, the site of the Oktoberfest since 1810, was in fact still a meadow - not a concrete desert - in the 19th century.
On the other side of the Isar, the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.
In the area of the present district of Au-Haidhausen you can read not only the street name "am Gasteig" or from the hill "Auf der Lüften" - but also in big letters "Irren Anstalt."
Yes, here on Auerfeldstrasse, you once shut down people with madness.
The Munich circle-Irrenanstalt "Auf der Auer Lüften" was founded there in 1858 / 59.
From 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden led the institution - that psychiatrist brought in connection with the death of King Ludwigs II.
"He was progressive for his time and, for example, ended up anchoring the so-called Irish.
He also prohibited staff from using force against the inmates, "says Hermann Wilhelm, head of the Haidhausen Museum, who has worked for an exhibition with the institution.
There was room for 280 patients at first, and later expanded to 500 places.
At some point, this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the Kreisirrenanstalt in Haar in 1905.
The Isar-Amper-Klinikum München-Ost, one of the largest psychiatrists in Germany, has been located there since 2006.
In the area of the former Auer Anstalt, young people are now meeting in the Salesianum in Munich.
The Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and transformed it into a youth home with training establishments.
To the west is the football pitch of the TSV München Ost, east residences dating back to the 1980s.
In 2015, the children's house "Casa Don Bosco" was built - in architectural reference to the original building of the Irrenanstalt, which had been destroyed in bombing raids in World War II.
The Marienplatz was listed as the "main square" around 1856, and the Kaufingerstraße was called "Kaufinger Gasse."
The Second World War also brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich.
The Allied bombs ripped many holes into the city centre in December 1944.
A big one remained to this day - at the Marienhof.
The English Institute, small business houses and a medieval pit chapel once stood at the Marienhof, where the groundwork is taking place these days and the spate of spades for the second S-Bahn regular line on April 5, 2017.
With the slider, you can compare the old Munich map with the aerial view of today - and fill the hole at the Marienhof.
Civil rights group releases travel warning for Missouri
The National Association for the promotion of people of color has issued a warning for colored people traveling to Missouri due to the state's discriminatory policies and racist attacks.
"The NAACP Travel Advisory for the state of Missouri, due to come into effect by August 28, 2017, urges African-American travelers, visitors and Missourians to pay special attention and exercise extreme caution when traveling through the state, as a number of questionable, race-based incidents occur recently throughout the state and are noted here," the group's opinion states.
A recent Missouri law that makes it harder for people to win discrimination lawsuits, as well as the state's law enforcement agencies that disproportionately target minorities, prompted the group to issue the travel warning, the NAACP said.
'They have violations of civil rights that happen to people.
They are stopped because of their skin color, they are beaten up or killed, "the president of the Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, told the Kansas City Star.
'We're hearing complaints at such a frequency that we haven't heard yet. '
It is the first such warning the organization has issued for a state in the United States.
The group cited incidents such as racist offenses against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died in questionable circumstances earlier this year after he had no gasoline while traveling through the state and was taken into custody by Missouri police without being accused of a crime.
The council also points to a recent report from the Missouri attorney general's office showing that black drivers in the state are 75 percent more likely to be stopped than whites.
"The recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families, friends and staff about what might happen in Missouri," Chapel said.
'People need to be prepared whether to bring in chewing money or let relatives know they're travelling through the state. '
Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest figures from the FBI's hate crime reporting program, which ranks the state 16th in the country in terms of the number of such injuries.
The travel warning is also a response to a new Missouri law that would make it harder to sue a company for housing or employment discrimination.
Earlier in the day, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after states passed immigration laws requiring local law enforcement agencies to arrest people for immigration violations, which the ACLU says will contribute to further racial profiling.
Travel warnings are usually issued by the State Department for other countries, but lately interest groups have used the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the United States.
One-size-fits-all project is basic
The Fischerbacher Weidezaun project is a success project and will continue next year.
The CDU's Peter White and Kordula Kovac took a picture on the ground.
Representatives of the Fishermen's CDU local association, along with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two deputies, met at the Schwendemann family's legal tomb.
Markus Schwendemann initially granted insights into his farm, where he manages 55 acres of meadows and 40 acres of forest, supplies 40 dairy cows and as many juveniles, and houses holiday homes in five apartments.
For him, "Black Forest milk" is the aging marketing route for the milk of his cows, according to Schwendemann.
On the table of the holiday guests comes exclusively regional.
As he is also the BLHV chairman of Fishbach, he described the pasture project as "elementally important."
I can't manage profitably on such steep surfaces.
The grassland area provides a lot of work, and a lot of things have to be dealt with with the Motorsense.
"We are struggling with the conditions and with the topography here," Schwendemann pointed out.
In 2003, he took over the parental farm and managed it without chemical plant protection and fertilizer, even if he did not run a organic farm.
For Mayor Thomas Schneider, it was clear that "the commune has recognized the importance of the White House project and is pleased with the Leader promotion."
Farmers would have to be supported at a cost of EUR 3000 to EUR 4000 per hectare.
It is hoped that this could drag out the afforestation of the land for a while.
"The biggest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and are concerned about how they continue to bring their operations," the mayor stressed.
Farmers are often criticised over the promotion
In 2013, a total of 25 parcels of 11 participants were fenced off over the production of wheat.
As a result, the disclosure area is 40 hectares, which may not be forested until at least 2023.
Of the total cost of €71 500, half was funded through Leader, with a quarter carried by the municipality of Fischerbach.
As a result, farmers were left with EUR 12 610, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometres of wheat.
"The big advantage is the longevity of the fences," Schwendemann explained.
Kordula Kovac insisted: "You're doing a really good job, without farmers and rural women, it's not going to happen."
It was also noted for Peter White: "This is where best food is produced."
The Land Management Directive (LPR) Baden-Württemberg allows for the state support of white fences.
The aim is the disclosure of the Black Forest.
The prerequisite is the existence of a funding backdrop described by the LPR.
In addition, the area to be fenced must not be traceable (a slope of more than 35%) and must therefore be threatened by afforestation.
The application of eight participants with 24 parcels, which would like to build just under 16 kilometres of fence, is currently under way for the 2018 Fishbacher Weidezaunproject.
The disclosure area is 35 hectares and the calculated cost is more than EUR 112 000.
Is nothing more sacred?
Now the White House is taking the Statue of Liberty from Trump
The surest sign of a regime change is when they start attacking the statues.
Americans value them as much as any other - hence the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein in the Firdos square in Baghdad in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the Trump regime's key ideologues, certainly knew what he was doing when he took a symbolic axe in a heated argument with CNN's Jim Acosta about the president's proposals to drastically restrict legal immigration to the Statue of Liberty.
To be fair, Miller did not attack the statue itself.
A horde of boat owners and Liberty imitators would have lynched him if he did.
But he attacked its significance, and in particular the importance attributed to it when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus was added to its base in 1903, 17 years after the monument was completed.
When Miller labeled Acosta, "I don't want to go into a complete thing about history here, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the world.
The poem you refer to, which was later added and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty. '
Miller is factually correct, but as he put it himself, it's not really about history.
It's about the contemporary resonance to the awkward words of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state invites not just any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "Your fatigues, your poor, / your beleaguered masses who yearn to breathe freely, / the elating waste of your rich shores."
There was never a time when the "elated waste" was better seen on our screens.
Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people are not welcome in Trump's United States.
This conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural dispute: It is, in fact, a conflict over the importance of America.
Lazarus - and her friends who set out to place her words at the base after her death - knew very well that she was performing a highly political act.
The sculpture was meant to show the connections between French and American republicanism by depicting the female embodiment of freedom in a worn-out classic pictorial representation.
Lazarus changed that meaning: In her poem, the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice.
And she gives herself a very different name: Mother of the exiles.
The poem's connection with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American nativism.
And just as Lazarus changed the significance of the statue, people from the right wing wanted to change this back for a long time.
The great shrimp Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty was not inviting anyone, but rather an early neo-conservative bringing the American flame to the surging world: "Lady Liberty is moving forward.
It is designed to carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
The torch is not meant to illuminate the way to the United States. '
Quite unusually, Limbaugh has come across something here.
The significance of the statue is entirely a matter of the position of perception.
The great imaginative act of Lazarus was to see her as she was seen by the exhausted, elated but hopeful people after long and often terrible journeys on the decks of ships.
It is, in the truest sense, about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives.
Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome they must hear.
And, of course, that's not the perspective that Miller and Trump would ever want to acknowledge.
Their torch is not meant to illuminate the path, but to ignite the hatred that is their only source of power.
World Championship 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish members of UK team
Eilidh Doyle recalls a time when only two Scots were part of the Great Britain team
UK athletics performance director Neil Black says the 16-strong Scottish contingent in the world championship squad will "make a massive contribution to the team."
A record number of Scottish athletes have been selected for London 2017, which kicks off on Friday.
Black believes that "something special is developing in Scotland" and the UK's athletics needs to learn something from it.
"We welcome it, and we're trying to understand it, and we're going to continue it until we figure it out," Black said.
'i speak to people at the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it's something to do with what they've done.
Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done.
British athletics: It has something to do with what they have done.
And also with the guy on the street corner.
Whatever the combination of circumstances, it's absolutely brilliant. '
Several of the Scottish athletes are medal contenders, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m track, while Eilidh Doyle has been elected team captain by the team.
'Eilidh is pretty humble.
Your captain's speech was incredible, "Black says.
'a number of athletes, whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train, walked out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated.
The passion and real feeling that Eilidh brought in quite naturally was great. '
The Commonwealth silver medallist, who will compete in the 400m hurdles at her fifth world championships, says it is "unbelievable" that 16 Scots are in the British team.
Scotland's best total number of athletes to date at the World Cup was seven achieved in 1983 and 2015.
The middle-distance runner, Muir, is leading the way and last year set five British and two European records.
She will take part in the 1,500 m and 5,000 m runs.
Chris O'Hare, who runs 1,500m, is another Scot to watch after a great season that included winning the British Team Trials and Anniversary Games.
Doyle remembers her first world championships when the only other Scot in the team was Lee McConnell.
The team captain says she is "hugely proud" of the fact that many of her compatriots are not only part of the team but in some cases will also be involved in the medals and the finals.
"The special thing about being a team captain is because she was chosen by the other members of the team so it was a great honour anyway, but knowing that my teammates voted for me and chose me makes it something very special for me," she added.
"Obviously I'm very proud of all the Scots who are part of the team.
It just shows how far we've come.
And they're here as established athletes, athletes who want to get on podiums.
As for my speech as captain?
Yes, I think she went well.
I just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship.
So it's really important to put on that home support and benefit from being back in the Olympic Stadium.
I get a second chance to go out there and compete and it's just going to be such a great atmosphere out there. '
Blocking critics over Facebook: Don't apply for public office if you can't fault the encroachment of voters
The father of our country knew something about bad press.
Americans loved George Washington, but it didn't take long for the newspapers to beat him because of everything from domestic politics to his political principles.
He shrugs at the criticism, for sure.
But he has not silenced his critics.
Because in 1783, Washington said, "Freedom of speech can be taken away - and, stupid and mute, we are led to slaughter like the sheep."
Which brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan, who has to work to be more like Washington.
Hodge's staff have blocked and deleted the posts of at least 450 people who have expressed their views on his official Facebook page.
And that's why the American Civil Liberties Union indicted him earlier this week.
The governor's bar dismissed the lawsuit as frivol, and the online comment was full of a backlash with "Na, and?."
"It's just Facebook," a lot of people said.
But it's important.
And it's especially important when it's a guy like Hogan.
This is a Republican governor in an overwhelmingly Democratic state that is remarkably popular.
He has the second-highest endorsement of the nation's 50 governors.
Hogan is not a reactionary heathead.
He has shown a firm hand in leading his state and strict adherence to the principles.
He was also very adept at using Facebook as a primary means of connecting with his constituents and playfully debuting his hapless head after chemotherapy on his side.
As a result, blocking people coming to the governor's side - which is a public forum called official and by employees paid with public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
In an interview with The Washington Post, Hodge's spokeswoman, Amelia Chasse, defended the governor's actions, arguing that blocking the comments was nothing more than a moderation.
But it's too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hate-filled people swinging the whip online.
The Post spoke to some of the real people blocked by Hogan.
And these are just real people talking to their elected leaders: A teacher, an entrepreneur and a pastor, not trolls.
They all said their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not profound.
The pastor quoted the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogan's Catholic faith.
Attorney Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., wasn't hate-filled, but she asked about hate crimes.
"I politely commented that I was disappointed that there was no response to hate crimes and other recent news," she wrote in the comments section of The Post news outlet.
'i don't appreciate this idea either, when a number of people take a stand on the same issue, they are more likely to be disregarded by some as a so-called collective effort and not recognised as a large group of citizens affected. '
What the governor's staff called a "concentrated spam attack" would likely call others "advocacy."
The Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment.
It is much cleaner than in the past, if you had done the same, that staff were dispatched to collect and burn newspapers with critical editorials, or to arrest and silence protesters.
But that's exactly what's happening digitally right now.
Hogan is not the first public official to be criticized for impacting Facebook and other social media.
President Trump is being sued by Twitter users blocked from his Twitter feed.
One of the first milestones on the issue fell last week in Virginia.
The chairman of the Loudoun County Board of Supervisors violated the First Amendment, according to U.S. District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when she banned a voter from her Facebook page.
And in Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit from the ACLU over his use of Facebook and Twitter.
It shouldn't be that hard.
At the time of Washington, the time of the affordable portion had a similar effect to the Internet.
The number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letter writers suggested his leadership.
And even then, Washington had anonymous trolls.
The people who used pseudonyms like "Juricola," "Valerius," "Belisarius" and "Portius" all wrote letters to newspapers laying down Washington's decisions.
Petitions that criticised his position on the Amity contract, trade and shipping with Britain overwhelmed his office, according to the historic documents collected by the George Washington Project's Online Papers.
But he didn't silence them.
Freedom of speech, difference of opinion and discourses are the foundation of our nation.
And true leadership means accepting that.
Ronan Rafferty hopes for domestic comfort at Renaissance Club
Former European No 1 Ronan Rafferty will hope for domestic comfort over the next three days as the Renaissance Club in East Lothian hosts the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open.
The Northern Irishman, who led next door at the Archerfield Links until the final round last year before losing to Paul Eales, is linked with the new venue and acts as a tournament ambassador on behalf of the club's founder and CEOs Jerry Sarvadi.
"I've seen the Renaissance club built, and we see how he achieves his fame with this event," Rafferty said.
"The players will see this course from his best side, he's in a great state.
Jerry did a great job when he set this place.
He is a keen advocate of this game and is proud of his performance here.
This is a great showcase for this course. "
Englishman Eales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time despite winning both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour in his 32-year career.
"That feels really special," said the Southport-based player.
'i haven't been able to defend the Extremadura Open as it was taken out of the program the year after I won it.
Coming back to that part of the world is magical.
It's a wonderful place to play golf.
The memories from last year come back and it was special for me and my wife Sharon to win here last year.
It was a really special time and one we'll always cherish. '
Gary Orr, who joined the European Senior Tour after his 50th birthday earlier this year, returns to action on home soil.
This event will be his first Scottish appearance since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
"It always means a little bit more when you're playing at home," said Orr, the man from Helensburgh.
'You want to do well but you also feel that extra pressure.
I really enjoyed playing again, and I played some solid golf.
I'm glad about how it's gone. '
With the trio on the field are former Masters winner Ian Woosnam and senior major champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNULTY.
Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are among the six Scots on the field, the others being Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
Entry is free, the car park costs £5 per car with one occupant and £10 per car with two or more occupants.

Fewer lung cancer deaths from passive smoking
Over the past two decades, fewer and fewer people have died of lung cancer due to passive smoking.
Scientists from the University Hospital of Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) come to this conclusion in a study.
"According to our estimates, 167 lung cancer deaths per year are due to passive smoking," said study leader Heiko Becher.
As a comparison, he drew up his own study on this subject from 1994.
At the time, there were still 400 lung cancer deaths due to passive smoking a year in Germany.
The new research is published in the International Journal of Public Health.
Home connections turn out to be very complex
Construction work in the town's street is in full swing and "is reasonably in time," according to the head of the yard, Fred Heinze.
In the area of house connections, the situation is more complicated than believed, as there is a lot of hiding underground, which is not noted in the plans.
Traffic, which repeatedly hampers construction work, is a major problem for the builder of the Stumpp company.
"Drivers" ignorance of red lights and lockouts is already enormous, "Heinze reports.
The road was closed and only the scheduled buses were eligible for passage.
Angelo Caruso, Marvin Kostorz and Tim Kostorz of the Stumpp company have been busy working on the bridge for weeks.
"The hot days were quite exhausting.
But luckily we were provided with cool mineral water by our friend Fritz Matt, "says Marvin Kostorz.
Poverty and Death in Indonesia's Goldland
When Bardina Degei cooks dinner, she doesn't use a stove.
It even rarely uses a pot.
In her wooden house in Enarotali, the capital of the Paniai reign in the troubled Indonesian province of Papua, the housewife normally places a sweet potato - locally called "nota" - straight into the fireplace.
After half an hour, the cramped knit is taken out and devoured with eager, unwashed hands.
Degei sits on the clay floor - she has no furniture - where she also carries out her daily work, such as washing clothes with trashed water from the nearby swamp.
A bucket in a homeless room serves as a latrine.
As the youngest of her husband's four wives, she was not assigned any fields.
Polygamy is common here.
Of course, working late can be dangerous: Most village men are unemployed, and many drink heavily, and there are the soldiers here.
"No one dares to walk around in the village after 5pm," she says.
It is a rare glimpse into daily life in the highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony recorded in 1969 after a controversial referendum in Indonesia, when only 1,026 elders were due to vote in front of the occupying forces through a public handering.
An existing movement that stirred for independence against Dutch rule quickly turned against the Jakarta government, which maintains control of the region and excludes foreign journalists or legal observers from it.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua, with the independent part of Papua New Guinea encompassing the eastern part of the island.
The trip includes a 90-minute flight from the provincial capital of Jayapura to Nabire and then a morning 5-hour drive by car.
There is no public transport.
The town, which has a population of about 19,000, is made up of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences and corrugated metal roofs converted by rust into various yellow-brown tones.
Very few Indonesians have made their journey here, let alone journalists and virtually no foreigners.
Before Christian missionaries arrived, Mee Pago Papuans honored a god named Uga Tamee.
There have been other changes as well.
"We weren't used to wearing these clothes," says Degei, hinting at her lively, hand-woven turban, her dark shirt and her bright skirt.
'in the past we only had leaves on our bodies. '
Papua is Indonesia's poorest province, where 28% of people live below the poverty line and have some of the worst child mortality and literacy rates in Asia.
But it's also Indonesia's Goldland.
The world's largest and most profitable gold mine, Grasberg, owned by the Freeport McMoRan of Phoenix, is just 60 miles from Paniai, a highland province the size of New Jersey with a population of 153,000.
In 2015 alone, Freeport, worth $3.1 billion, mined gold and copper.
In addition, Papua has timber resources worth an estimated $78 billion.
These riches, however, are a source of misery for Papua, which ensure Indonesia's powerful military retains a suffocating presence.
A 2005 investigation in the New York Times reported that Freeport paid local military personnel and units nearly $20 million between 1998 and 2004, including up to $150,000 to a single officer.
Papuan demands for greater autonomy threaten these golden gans and are treated mercilessly.
According to activists, more than 500,000 Papua have been killed and thousands have been raped, tortured and imprisoned by the Indonesian military since 1969.
Mass killings in dad's tribal highlands in the 1970 "s became genocide, according to the Asia Human Rights Commission.
In the region alone, Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful protesters last year.
"We are scoring all losing," says a 2016 report by the Archdiocese of Brisbane, which includes reports of last year's atrocities, such as unlawful executions and torture - rape and electric strikes are particularly popular, according to another report - and the brutal defeat of peaceful demonstrations.
"It's difficult to count the number of victims as incidents happen every week," says Andreas Harsono, Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch.
The screws have intensified as Papua's resources bring an influx of settlers from other parts of Indonesia.
The province's population of 3.5 million residents is 83% Christian, but demographics are changing as Muslim economic migrants come from the populous islands of Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Javanese warung canteens sell fried chicken and gado gado, a mixed vegetable served with peanut sauce.
Local people are fighting to keep up here.
"The migrants have started selling chickens and vegetables in the traditional market cheaper than local Papua," explains Abeth You, a 24-year-old Paniai native who moved to the provincial capital of Jayapura for work.
'it's cost local Papua - the mum's mum [the women] of Papua - their market. '
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, popularly known as Jokowi, promised to address inequalities and rights violations in Papua during his 2014 campaign.
The former Zimmerman secured 27 of Papua's 29 districts - including Paniai - en route to the presidential palace in Jakarta.
But little has changed in Papua and today locals feel cheated.
"Our hearts are broken because we voted for Jokowi in 2014, with the expectation that he will fulfill our hopes that justice will be restored," says You.
In fact, just two months after Jokowi's inauguration in October, Paniai suffered a low point.
On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children were outside and sang Christmas songs in front of a campfire in Enarotali when two Indonesian soldiers broke through the darkness on a motorbike.
The terrified children told them to turn their headlights on.
One of the soldiers took kick-off on her tone and later came back with four soldiers, according to local pastor Yavedt Tebai.
The soldiers who had been drinking chased and beat the group with their rifles, victims and witnesses said.
Then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children.
One child, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was beaten so badly he fell into a coma.
A couple of hours later, the nearby government commission's building was set on fire and things escalated the next day.
About 1,000 young Papua men, women and children gathered on a football pitch in front of the local police station and the military command centre to demand justice.
They wore ceremonial hunting arches and performed the Waita dance - ongoing in circles and imitating a birdsong - of Papua's Mee Pago tribe.
Some protesters began tossing stones at police and military posts.
When the mood was heated, the soldiers were sent a command via an internal radio: "If the crowds resist more than three times, they shoot them dead," says an official document from TIME that was not released to local media.
Yeremias Kayame, 56, the head of Enarotali's Kego Koto district, saw the imminent danger and called for calm and urged the crowd to return home.
No one was in the mood to listen.
"When I turned around, I was suddenly shot in my left wrist," he told TIME on the veranda of his colorful painted wooden house.
Kayame still doesn't know who fired but says the bullet came from the ranks of the soldiers gathered here.
"It was crowded, a lot of shots were fired," he adds.
Local man Alfius Youw was hit three times, according to his cousin, who witnessed the shootings.
"I ran to him and examined his body to make sure he was," Yohanes, who, like many Indonesians, bears only one name, told TIME in a grim mood.
'i saw he was dead... I kicked him. '
Papua police chief inspector Yotje Mende told reporters that his officers only wanted to "secure" their station because it was being attacked.
"We have to defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us," the spokesman for Papua police, Commissioner Pudjo Sulistiyo, said in 2015.
'it's all about life and death. '
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and many more wounded.
News of the killings only came 'filtered' to Jakarta the following day.
Three weeks ago, Jokowi gave an impassioned speech in Jayapura expressing sympathy for the families of the victims and vowing to address the historic grievances in Papua.
"I want this case resolved immediately so it won't happen in the future," he said.
Security Minister Wiranto said in October 2016 that he was setting up an out-of-court mechanism to settle historic human rights abuses.
But the excuses began almost immediately.
'Most of the injuries occurred a long time ago.
Some were in the 90 "s and early 2000" s.
The point is that we have committed to addressing these violations, but there are processes that need to go through, "he said.
Then Wiranto made a retreat when he spoke to TIME in Jakarta on June 5, saying he had no plans to set up a complaint mechanism in Papua.
Instead, "everything is regulated by law," he said.
Wiranto, whom the UN has charged with "crimes against humanity," which claimed more than 1,000 deaths in East Timor's bloody 1999 independence vote, said 11 cases of human rights abuses in Papua had already been settled, including the Paniai incident.
Families of the Paniai victims took such claims with grim incredulity.
"I've been interviewed four times over the last three years, but there's been no progress whatsoever," Yohanes says.
'i'm tired. '
He says that years later, he still lives in fear.
"I'm afraid," he says.
'i'm afraid of being arrested by the military, afraid of being shot. '
His brother, Yacobus, repeated the view that the people of Paniai are afraid to discuss the incident.
He says he was beaten by the military after helping to bury four of the victims.
"After I buried the bodies, the military searched for me," he says.
The gunmen have not stopped.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police shot at villagers in Paniais neighborhood of Deiyai.
One person died and 17 others were injured, including children, during a confrontation between villagers and the manager of a construction company that refused to take an unconscious man to hospital.
The man, 24-year-old Ravianus Douw, who drowned when he was fishing in a nearby river, died on his way to hospital.
Excited villagers protested in front of the company's location office.
Police said villagers threw stones at officers who responded by firing warning shots.
But locals say the mobile brigade (Indonesian paramilitary police) began shooting at the crowd, killing one.
"We were so panicking, we are afraid there will be revenge," says 29-year-old Dominggu Badii, who lives near the hospital and witnessed how the injured were quickly delivered here, according to TIME.
'i've been hiding in my house for two days. '
The Deiyai parliament has called for the officers involved to be held to account and for the police mobile brigade to be withdrawn from the area.
Paniai has always been a source of trouble for the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development strengthens the discontent of tribal members Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal, who live in Papua's green highlands.
Many joined the Free Papua Movement (OPM), the rebel army that claims to defend Papua's rights by inciting sporadic attacks and kidnappings of Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the top OPM leaders are from Paniai, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
In response, thousands of people have been arrested and arbitrarily detained in Paniai in recent years on the pretext of "securing national sovereignty."
Some never appear again.
Among the people of Papua, Paniai is known as "a tragic, forgotten place."
Poverty strengthens discontent.
The bit of rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive for locals.
Bread is just as out of reach.
People here are building everything they eat: Especially nota and fruit and leaf vegetables.
Agriculture is the task of women, who can each handle four or five fields of sweet potato.
They keep most of the crop for the family, while the rest are sold on the local market.
Ten pieces of Nota cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Over time, economic inequalities have grown between native Papua and the new migrants, who have arrived in greater numbers since the opening of new flight routes to Nabire Airport.
The few jobs that exist in the region usually go to the better-educated and wealthier migrants.
Papua rarely have the capital or the necessary skills to run their own businesses competitively.
"Young people are not interested in staying in the village... because there are no jobs or money here," says John Gobai, the chairman of the Paniai tribal council.
Isolation keeps the eyes of the world far from Papua.
In addition, restrictions on reporting remain strained by international media.
Earlier this year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were deported from Papua for lack of coordination with related institutions despite being given rare permission to film.
According to Phelim Kine, the deputy Asia director of Human Rights Watch, the promises of Jokowi's campaign to lift restrictions on reporting to promote transparency and development have not been realized.
"There are new dangers to foreign journalists trying to report from Indonesia's troubled easternmost provinces of Papua and Westpapua: Visa denial and a blacklist," he said in a statement.
A lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indonesian government remains largely confined to Papuan's immediate neighbours.
In March, six Pacific states - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the "various and widespread violations" in Papua including the Paniai shooting.
The same countries have historically supported OPM.
Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesman Arrmanatha Nasir rejected the group's allegations, telling journalists in Jakarta: "A democratic system is still in place in Indonesia and there is free media so it is difficult to cover up the evidence of human rights cases."
Local people want more foreign governments to take note of this.
When an official delegation from the Netherlands, led by the human rights ambassador Kees Van Baar, visited Jayapura on May 4, locals broke their silence and pressed him "We want freedom," according to a source who also attended the meeting but wishes to remain anonymous.
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019 but the Papua say they are unlikely to vote for Jokowi again.
"Jokowi is a person who has good intentions, but he is surrounded by the people involved in the Paniai shootings," says Gobai, the leader of the tribal council.
He wants Jokowi to know that the Paniai people, apart from living under the constant threat of a predatory military, are in poor educational and health services.
Gobai says that the Paniai people, like others Papua, view their vote for Jokowi as a "guilt" he has to repay.
"They don't need money, they just want justice," he says.
Despite the threats and intimidation, families of the Paniai shot victims carried out one last symbolic act of comfort: The body of a victim was buried on a site just opposite the police and the military station.
They know they may never get justice, but at least they don't let those responsible forget their crimes.
"A member of our family was killed," Yacobus says with a lowered head.
'What else can we do? '
Fires capture Dubai's' Torch 'skyscraper for second time
A fire took hold in one of the world's tallest residential towers in Dubai on Friday, forcing hundreds of residents to flee the 337-foot-high, 79-story building.
It is the second fire to blow through the skyscraper in just two years, which is accidentally called the Torch Tower (torch tower).
The building was evacuated, no injuries were reported, and there was no direct word on the cause of the flame.
'We slept and we got up at the fire alarm and when people were screaming.
We ran down the stairs, and it took about 10 minutes to get down from the 50th floor, "one resident, who gave his name as George, told Reuters.
Dubai's civil protection authorities said fire control units extinguished the fire at 4: 00 a.m. local time (00: 00 GMT) and cooled the building.
The government said it was working to provide accommodation for those affected.
The incident can revive questions about the safety of materials used in outdoor areas of high-rise buildings around the world.
An investigation by the management of the Torch building following its fire in 2015 found that most of the damage came from the lining, the outside lining for decoration or insulation.
In the UK, police said they believe the system of plates to isolate and disguise at London's Grenfell tower in June may have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire that killed about 80 people.
No Davis Cup reform: Continue best-of-five
The president of the International Tennis Federation (ITF) has fallen through with his big Davis Cup coup at the General Assembly.
At the meeting in Ho-Chi-Minh City, the proposal, revolutionary for this sport to play Davis Cup singles only on two winning sets, was skinny not supported by the required two-thirds majority.
So the five-set classics, which are often very long, but also therefore highly valued, remain the trajectory.
63.54 per cent of member states voted in favour of the reform, so ITF president David Haggerty's target was only narrowly missed.
"We respect this decision but are disappointed that our member nations have not adopted the entire package of reforms for the Davis Cup and Fed Cup.
We need a change to secure the long-term future of these iconic and historic contests, "Haggerty said.
We will continue to work to improve the applications.
It was not until the vote, after many objections, that the proposal was made to carry out the final in a neutral place.
New from 2018 are only comparatively minor details: So in the future the finalists in the Davis Cup and Fed Cup will have the hosting right in the first round the following year.
To reduce the cost to organizers, requirements in terms of training places etc. will be made easier and players will have to complete fewer official media appointments before the Davis Cup.
More than 1 in 5 U.S. travelers bring banned items to the plane, a survey finds
A survey of airline passengers found that more than 20 percent deliberately or unconsciously smuggled prohibited items past the U.S. Transportation Security Administration checkpoints, including at least 6 percent who entered the plane while accidentally carrying prohibited knives or other items with blades.
Less than 1 percent claimed they had belatedly discovered they had mistakenly traveled with firearms, ammunition or explosives.
The survey of more than 1,000 people - conducted by a jet charter service, Stratos Jet Charters Inc. - also found that younger travelers were more likely to disregard the rules.
Of those surveyed who admitted they knowingly tried to fly with something banned by the TSA, 19.7 percent were millennials, compared to less than 15 percent who were members of Generation X.
The most common items deliberately passed to TSA agents were food and liquids.
More than 3 percent said they knowingly carried items with blades through security control, while 2.2 percent of female respondents and 3.7 percent of male respondents also confirmed they had deliberately placed banned drugs on the plane.
The company said it had interviewed travelers around the country to find out how many had accidentally brought contraband through airport security and how many had done it deliberately.
It's no surprise that the people most likely to carry contraband - knowingly or unwittingly - through security were the ones who fly most frequently.
However, the company points out that the TSA guidelines are somewhat complicated and confusing.
People are often unsure what liquids they may take with them or how much of it.
So it's no surprise that the largest amount of items seized by the TSA are banned liquids.
For a while, people thought the TSA might view books as contraband.
Liquids are allowed on domestic flights, but not on international flights.
Elon Musk doesn't care: Tens of thousands of Tesla customers cancel order
Electric-thousandsassa Elon Musk is happy to give up with the huge number of pre-orders for his new Tesla "Model 3."
In doing so, he has so far understated that some of the customers have already withdrawn their non-binding reservation.
In addition to the ever-triumphant numbers on sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets, Tesla CEO Elon Musk has betrayed a different, less ghastly figure for the first time when the latest quarterly review was announced: That of cancellations in the new mass-market Model 3.
In recent months, Musk has frequently campaigned with the more than 500,000 pre-orders for the new car, the delivery of which is just beginning.
Now Musk admits that of the total of 518,000 pre-orders, 63,000 have already been withdrawn.
Critics have repeatedly pointed out that these are merely non-binding reservations.
In the event of a cancellation, Tesla will fully refund the €1000 (US $1000 in the US and £1000 in the UK) "reservation deposit."
There are currently 455,000 such non-binding reservations, Musk acknowledged in a conference call with analysts.
However, the Tesla chief does not believe that cancelling about 12 percent of all orders so far could become a problem.
His argument is that the challenge with the ambitious growth targets is not on demand, but on the production side.
Last year, Tesla delivered 84,000 vehicles.
In 2018, it will be 500,000 - all models combined - and a million in 2020.
The demand for it is obviously there.
According to Musk, 1,800 reservations are currently made per day.
If you order a "Model 3" today, you may not expect delivery until the second half of 2018 at the earliest - if Tesla manages to drive its brand new production lines, which have never been tested in practice, without major interruptions with maximum utilization.
Many experts doubt that is possible.
But if there are major delays, then the non-binding nature of the reservations could become a problem for Tesla.
Because then the company can't prevent unhappy customers from running away in droves.
EPA's Pruitt withdraws for delaying Obama-Era rules to reduce emissions
A day after being sued by 15 states, Scott Pruitt, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, took back his earlier decision to delay implementation of Obama-era rules to reduce emissions of smog-causing air pollutants.
Pruitt presented the change when his agency proved more responsive to the needs of state environmental agencies than previous administrations.
He did not mention the lawsuit, which had been brought against his previous position in a federal appeals court.
At issue is a deadline that expired on October 1 for states to comply with 2015 standards for ground-level ozone.
Pruitt announced in June that he would delay compliance by a year to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid "interfering with local decisions or hampering economic growth."
Pruitt, who was Oklahoma's state attorney before being appointed by President Donald Trump, has long been a reliable opponent of stricter environmental regulations.
Since arriving in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly moved to block or delay regulations that the chemical industry and fossil fuel industry oppose.
Wednesday's sudden reversal is the latest legal setback for the Pruitts regulatory rollback agenda.
Last month, a federal appeals court in Washington ruled that the EPA administrator exceeded his authority when he tried to delay implementation of a rule by the Obama administration that required oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leaks.
In a statement issued Wednesday night, Pruitt suggested that his U-turn on ozone standards quite simply strengthens the EPA's willingness to cooperate with the states through the complex process of timely meeting the new standards.
"Under previous administrations, the EPA often failed to meet the deadlines for implementation and then waited to be indicted by activist groups and others, and to set the date for implementation in an agreement," said Pruitt, who sued the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job.
'We don't believe in regulation through court proceedings and we take deadlines seriously.
We also take the law and authority it gives us seriously. '
Still, the EPA's opinion said Pruitt will eventually use his "power to delay and all other legally available powers" to ensure the rules are "based on sound policies and the best available information."
Congressional Republicans are pushing for a broader recasting of the ozone rules.
A bill approved last month is expected to delay implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years.
The measure has not yet been put to a vote in the Senate.
New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who led the coalition of states that sued the EPA this week, said the group intends to maintain legal pressure.
"The EPA's reversal - following our actions - is an important win for the health and safety of these 6.7 million New Yorkers and the over 115 million Americans directly affected by the smog pouring into their communities," Schneiderman said.
In this case, New York joined California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington and the District of Columbia.
Soil ozone is created when pollutants from cars, power plants, oil refineries, chemical plants and other sources in the atmosphere react to sunlight.
The resulting smog can cause serious breathing problems in sensitive groups of people, contributing to thousands of premature deaths each year.
Public health officials and environmentalists cheered on Pruitt's surprising change of course.
"It's worrying how much pressure it takes to get this reasonable step from the person responsible for protecting the air we breathe," said Lori Ann Burd of the Center for Biological Diversity.
"We must continue to fight the Trump administration's ideological crusade to pander to polluters and their special interests."
Tumour celebrates 750 years of St. Hilarius church
750 years of St. Hilarius Church: On the occasion of the anniversary of the mountain church, a serenade will be invited to the old cemetery area in Tumlingen on Sunday, July 16, at 4.30pm.
With its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village, the historic St. Hilarius complex is a popular place to stay.
Visitors to the sixth Benefiz Serenade can be enchanted by this powerful place.
The rescue and conservation of the oldest building in the town has made the friends and promoters of Tumlingens their concern.
As Walter Martini points out: "It's a unique village gem."
In 1267, the St. Hilarius Chapel was first mentioned in the Wuerttemberg Urgent Book: Count Hermann von Sulz sold "the mountain with the parish church on it to Tumlingen and the bird" to Magister Eberhard von Horb and to his brother Dietrich for 20 marks of silver.
According to the wording of the document, on the Tumlinger Berg, apart from the former parish church, there was also a magnificent courtyard, which included the church or the right of patronage, and not the other way around.
So people lived there as well.
As can be seen from the description of the Oberamtes Freudenstadt in 1858, in addition to the Unterdorf and the Oberdorf, which are still visible today in the village of Tumlingen, the "mountain" was the third, the glorious settlement centre of the village.
Old maps dating back to the year 1600 substantiate these historical facts.
The right of patronage arose from the early medieval equity law.
A gentleman who built a church, refunded it, and occupied it with a priest, continued to be the owner of that church and was able to inherit that equity as well.
Associated with this was the right to use a priest or to propose a new pastor to the bishop.
There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower.
The biggest of the two zeroed in on Christmas 1673.
The newly created bell then first sounded in 1692, but had to be handed down later in World War II in 1942.
In the 30-year war (1616 to 1648) the window panes were taken and the bell-siders were stolen.
The roof was unsealed.
In 1796, French troops lagged near the church.
They broke out the chancel and church chairs and used them as firewood.
Remains of the church threatened to collapse in 1809.
Until 1869, the Tumlinger Hilarius Cemetery also served as the final resting place for the dead from Hörschweiler.
In 1823 the cemetery was extended and the Hilary church was canceled.
Only the church tower was left standing.
On New Year's Eve in 1834, a storm split the church tower and half collapsed.
To prevent an accident, the tower was canceled.
Only the tower dwarf that still exists today was preserved as a witness to the 750-year-old church history.
Today, Horst Kallenberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem of the "sheepish pensioners" maintain the Hilarius plant in place of Dieter Dockhorn.
As organizers, the friends and supporters of Tumlingens invite the sixth serenade to the old cemetery to the St. Hilarius Chapel on Sunday, July 16.
It is designed by the Combo of the Kepler-Gymnasium Freudenstadt and with contributions by Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis.
Local resident Hartmut Romann speaks the final word.
The program starts at 4: 30 p.m.
Admission is from 3: 30 p.m.
A trunk takes place in front of the cemetery to finish the serenade.
"Enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with the wide view over meadows to the forest," the organizers highlight the fantastic view.
The serenade only takes place in dry weather.
The organizers are hoping for many supporters to preserve the historic St. Hilarius facility, which is important for tumors and hearing welders.
The friends and supporters of Tumlingens feel particularly committed to home care, as Serenade organiser Walter Martini affirms.
Association to allow approval of windmills to be examined
"Boisheim is resisting" does not see a legal requirement for construction and has therefore written to the Councillor.
The "Boisheim wests" association has called on Councillor Andreas Coenen (CDU) to withdraw its approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Boisheimer Nette.
It was unlawful.
The association argues that no wind turbines could have been approved at all at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 in the Boisheimer Nette, as at the time a wind power concentration zone existed in Viersen only on the city's border with Schwalmtal.
Within this concentration zone, the construction and operation of wind turbines is basically possible, but at the same time the concentration zone causes an exclusion of wind energy use for the rest of the city.
Such zones are designed to prevent a "saving" of the landscape.
The city of Viersen had decided a second wind power concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette a few days earlier by changing the land use plan - but it had not been approved by the Duesseldorf district government, due to a form failure.
"Due to the lack of a planning requirement, the permit granted is still illegal and therefore also to be withdrawn," said Christoph Erkens, chairman of "Boisheim wests."
Current state of affairs: The council has again decided the wind concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette ahead of the summer break; a permit from the county government is pending.
Mr Erkens said: "This means that, at this point, the granting of a permit for the construction of wind turbines is legally excluded."
The circle confirms the receipt of the call.
"The relevant letters have been received at Viersen County since last week," a spokesman said.
The county is taking it as an occasion to re-examine the matter.
However, they are not expected to cause the proceedings to be halted.
With a view to ongoing proceedings at the administrative court, the county did not want to comment on the substance of the association's "Boisheim wests" argument on Thursday.
NEW Re, a subsidiary of NEW, plans to build four windmills, each 200 metres high, on an area on the Boisheimer Nette.
As recently as last year, the company, which the city of Viersen is indirectly involved in, closed lease agreements with the owner of the approximately 65-acre site.
The four wind turbines are designed to meet the electricity needs of around 11,400 households - roughly one fifth of the electricity needs of all four-seater households.
The NEW Re aims to invest around 20 million euros.
Last summer, Viersen's council gave the go-ahead for the purchase of three wind turbines at the Linnich wind farm near Aachen, as well as a stake in a wind energy plant in Übach-Palenberg in Heinsberg County.
Car and tractor crash: Woman dies in horrific accident
One horrific road accident took place on the L 333 between Niederwallmenach and bogel (Rhein-Lahn-Kreis) about 10am on Friday morning.
One woman was fatally wounded.
Two other people were slightly injured.
The national road remained closed for hours.
Police believe a 17-year-old young woman from Bornich was driving the L 333 towards the bogel with her car as part of the accompanied driving with her 53-year-old mother as an accompanying person.
City and traders plan 'home shopping' weekend
Bad Langensalzaer and people from the region are to rediscover shopping in the city centre in September.
The business association and the city council want to use the weekend on September 8 and 9 to lure residents to the city centre for shopping.
As the chairman of the business association, Christian King, announced, the "home shopping" weekend aims to raise awareness among customers of what offers their own city offers away from the usual supermarket goods.
The plan is therefore to create a market with regional suppliers, similar to the weekly market.
In addition, local firms are to present themselves with their apprenticeships.
In addition, the shops of the city centre will invite you to "midnight shopping."
In doing so, the action not only targets residents of the city and the surrounding region.
In preparation are commercials on the radio, an internet video and printed bags that point to the action weekend, according to Christian King.
The city council and the trade association cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry.
This will take the business association and the city to another stage of the "Attractive city centre" project.
These include new offerings such as the first "Active Day" to the Brunnenfest and sold-out Sunday, talks with all tradesmen and hosts to encourage them to actively participate.
Attractive offers on Saturday and the abandonment of parking fees that day are also part of the concept.
In addition, customer potential will be reopened or re-opened.
This includes spa guests and tourists.
But many locals would also have lost sight of the city centre when shopping.
In the end, everyone would have to help invigorate the city centre - right down to landlords, the businesses of the whole city and clubs.
It was to overcome lethargy with a network that had partly spread, King said in the spring.
Birgit Streich, head of the IHK-Center in Mühlhausen announced that at the nationwide third "home shopping" day, five Thuringian cities will participate for the first time.
In addition to Bad Langensalza, these are Weimar, Sömmerda, Heiligenstadt and Bleicherode.
The day should "promote the appreciation of local trade and highlight its importance to the common good of our cities," Mr Streich said.
The action under the auspices of the Chamber of Commerce and with many partners also makes it clear that every citizen with his purchasing behaviour can influence his direct environment.
Two dead and several injured after explosion at US school
During construction work there was a gas explosion in the school building.
New other people were injured.
Two people have been killed and nine others injured in a gas explosion in the US city of Minneapolis, some of them seriously.
According to the fire department, an injured person was still in critical condition on Wednesday (local time).
One person died when part of a school building collapsed in the explosion.
One initially missing was also later pronounced dead.
The dead were employees of the school.
As a cause of disaster, the authorities suspected work on a gas pipeline.
At the holiday season, few people were staying in the building of the Mpause aha Academy.
Trump put pressure on Mexico over paying the border wall after leaked transcripts of phone calls
Transcripts of phone calls between US President Donald Trump and leaders of Mexico and Australia have been published by The Washington Post.
On January 27, Trump called in a phone call with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto to stop saying publicly that he would not pay for a proposed border wall.
The US president seized on him for publicly denouncing the wall, reportedly saying to him: "You can't tell the press."
Trump launched his presidential campaign with a promise to build a wall on the southern border of the United States, vowing to make Mexico pay for the project.
Transcripts of his first call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull were also released and revealed a tense exchange.
Mr. Trump told Mr. Turnbull that a trade for the United States to take on refugees who emigrated to Australia was "ridiculous," "mies" and "stupid," and that the existence on trade brokered by the Obama administration would make him look like a "dump" after he proposed a ban on resettling refugees to the United States.
Mr. Trump ended the call after telling Mr Turnbull, "This is the most unpleasant call for all day."
Moores Ford massacre: Activists resume racist lynch act as call for justice
A 1948 Ford Mercury drove through a group of spectators in rural Monroe, Georgia, and rumped onto Moore's Ford Bridge.
Before the car, which had four black passengers and a white driver, could reach the bridge, a group of white men with guns emerged to block his path.
The leader of the mock - a middle-aged man in a needle-striped suit - took a long train at his cigar and looked checking through the windscreen.
Inside, the inmates were floating in fear.
"We want this n ---- r Roger!" The man shouted.
"Get him out of the car!"
Screams tore the silence as a young black man was dragged from the passenger seat.
Luckily, this horrible scene, played on July 22, is just a rendition.
But then when a blade is thrown around the neck of "Roger," almost everyone in the audience encountered very real sigh.
Since 2005, civil rights activists have come back to Moore's Ford Bridge to emulate the night two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and Mae Murray Dorsey - were lynched by the Ku Klux Klan in 1946.
No one has ever been charged with the murders.
"It's really unfathomable that not a single person has been arrested in all these years - even though we see them in our communities, even though we know who they are," said Tyrone Brooks, who helps organize the rendition.
'it's a smear stain on a story but it's a burden on our souls. '
Brooks is a 71-year-old former congressman of the state of Georgia and a lifetime civil rights activist.
For him, the rendition serves as a dramatic call to action and represents an annual reminder to the Monroe community that an injustice has never been corrected.
"We want law enforcement, we want the ending, we want healing, we want reconciliation, but first we have to get justice," he said.
'We can't get to healing and reconciliation until we get justice. '
A court medical officer places a bed cloth over the body of one of the victims of the Moore Ford Lynch on July 27, 1946.
According to FBI files obtained by NBC News, more than 50 men from Monroe and surrounding counties were suspected in the lynching process.
But none have ever been charged.
Although the suspects have remained at large for decades, civil rights activists say the double motivation for the Lynch actions across the city has always been known: Politics and sex.
In April 1946, a Supreme Court decision allowed black citizens in Georgia to vote in the summer's primary contest for the first time.
Around the same time as the election, according to the FBI, black color guard Roger Malcom stood down a white landowner, Barnett Hester, during a fight - allegedly because of a woman.
Brooks said the rumour in the city was that Hester had slept with Malcoms's wife, Dorothy, and that the baby she was carrying was not from her husband.
On July 25, 1946, Loy Harrison, a prominent white landowner, paid $600 to free Malcom from prison, according to the FBI.
He was accompanied to prison by Dorothy and her cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey.
But when they then got away from the jail and approached Moore's Ford Bridge, a lynch mob surrounded the car.
"As it turns out, it was Harrison who prepared and ordered the killings," an FBI report concludes.
'it's also obvious there was a plot between state and local law enforcement that wasn't just involved in the murders, removing evidence and covering up the identity of witnesses. '
Brooks puts it even more succinctly.
"It was a suffrage massacre," he said.
"They were all killed sending a message to black people in this community:" If you register and if you vote, that's what's going to happen to you here. ""
For nearly a decade, Cassandra Greene has led the annual rendition of the Moore Ford Bridge Lynch murders.
Her portrayal is vivid, moving, and grounded in a kind of deep racism that many would like to believe no longer exists in America.
It's hard to watch, and even harder to look away from, but Greene said that's the point.
"We don't want to talk about the Lynch because then we are confronted with its ugliness in all of us," she said.
'But I can't build a relationship with you if you don't want to listen to me or don't want to hear what I've been through. '
Rehearsals for this year's production began in June, and on the first day, nearly 30 actors - a dozen whites and the rest of blacks - crowded into a room and listened as Greene launched a well-played overview of the play.
Wade Marbaugh is Greene's co-director here.
He has played the role of chief clanmember for years, but he said the role never gets any easier.
"I feel dirty because I'm not like that," Marbaugh said.
'But I think it's very important to keep this story alive because we don't want to return to those times. '
On the other side of the room, actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, who play Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester, tried their lines.
The play begins with Malcom shouting at Hester and pushing him, furious that he has slept with his wife Dorothy.
"I said, n --- er, vanish from my property!"
Rascona wields the fire.
There's a pause.
And then everyone (at least all black actors) breaks out in laughter.
Greene laughs the loudest.
"What?!" Asked Rascona.
He is alarmed and confused.
Was I too hard?
"No," Greene said, still kicking.
'i just don't think white people said 'n --- er' at the time. '
"Yet," one of the other black performers withered.
'You just have to hit the hard 'R.'
And that's where the energy in the room shifts, a sense of companionship replacing the discomfort.
Everyone is busy getting this right, not just because of the game but also because of the memory of the four people killed.
The scene begins again.
This time, when Rascona says the N-word, he says it sharply and forcefully.
Absolutely no one is laughing.
This repetition ends violent and fast.
There are screams, shots and then silence.
A woman, wearing a wedding dress, stands over the bodies of the actors and performs Billie Holidays's grieving praises "Strange Fruit."
Her voice breaks at every second word.
About a hundred yards behind, a group of about four dozen spectators wipes sweat and tears from their eyes.
The audience is split almost evenly between black and white.
A couple have travelled from Ithaca, New York, to see the performance, many just coming down the street.
They have all experienced Georgia's oppressive moisture for nearly eight hours when Brooks leads them on a pilgrimage to the tombs of the Malcoms and Dorseys.
Up to this point, the killings have remained an anecdote, but now, when you're on the same land where the Lynch killings took place, the air feels ghostly.
When the song's final notes finish, Greene invites the crowd to come closer and inspect the corpse.
Children hook on their heads, register the fake blood and the silent bodies and whisper to each other.
"They're not really dead," murmurs one little boy, as if to remember.
After a few minutes, Greene thanks the crowd - and suddenly it's over.
The actors throw away the lynch rope and wipe away their tears.
BRADSHAW embraces Marbaugh, the man in the suit who played the clanmember.
Nick Rascona hugs two of his fellow players and then collapses awkwardly in their arms, the emotional burden of the performance eventually breaking out at him.
"It's okay," one of the women whispers.
'We know that's not in your heart.
You did that for a reason. '
Later, the audience will sit down with the actors for dinner.
At one table, a white couple from Atlanta chatted about the rendition with a black couple they've just met.
Denise Duplinski struggled to find words about the feeling the performance has left.
"It's hard to hear these horrible words and actions... coming from people who look like yourself and who do that because they look like you," she said.
"What this really does to me makes me believe that the Lynch is still going on," she added, "today this is just called police shooting."
In the same room, Tyrone Brooks is holding court at his table, he's eating and remembering civil rights.
He said he had already started planning next year's performance.
"The rendition is inspirational in a way, because it describes the horror of what we have endured, but it is also a moment of learning," he said.
'it's like if we don't learn anything from it then it can happen again.
Those who don't study their own history, who don't know their own history, are condemned to repeat it. '
'Divine Dawn 'reconciled the Wagnerians in Bayreuth
Also in the fourth part of Richard Wagner's monumental work, director Frank Castorf puts on a colorful-frivolous staging in front of a gigantic, six-story setting.
The rotary stage (designed by Aleksandar Denic) optionally shows a shabby street corner including Mauerrest and Dönerbude in Berlin, a "Plaste and Elaste" logo from the GDR era, or the New York Stock Exchange.
Before that, an open Mercedes classic car is parked in which the Rhine daughters pose as Rockergirls, or alternatively an Isetta.
Stacked oil barrels recall Castorf's leitmotif - money, power and greed - that moves through his "ring" staging.
The three Rhine daughters - sung by Stephanie Houtzeel, Wiebke Lehmkuhl and Alexandra Steiner - harmonize wonderfully, as they did in the "Rheingold."
Kess they seduce Siegfried (Stefan Vinke), clasp a body in the boot in Hollywood fashion and give the Krawallo clique.
Stephen Milling sings the wonderfully fiddly Hagen that surrounds the aura of a heavyweight boxer.
Brutal the scene when he kicks off Siegfried.
Later, Gunther (Markus Eiche) also has to believe in it.
The audience thanks it to the ensemble with strong applause.
Precipitously celebrated are Foster, Milling, Vinke and conductor Janowski, who is modestly bending his hands to the Merkel Raute.
There is great applause for the Festival Orchestra, which is showing up on stage for the first time - given the great heat back in legless leisure wear.
The performance of Frank Castorf and his Regieteam was eagerly awaited.
Had he yet to have a gleaming pipe concert over in 2013, there was great cheer five years later in which the isolated "Buh" calls went down.
Festival director Katharina Wagner is expected to be pleased with this.
"You notice that the audience grew up with the" ring "in a way," she said shortly before the dpa's performance.
Not only did the audience make a form of peace with Castorf, but it also grew an understanding of its point of view.
I draw a positive resounding.
Max Menge works as a volunteer
They work in several places in their volunteer year.
Where everywhere?
Crowd: Normally in Steinfurt in the furniture exchange, once a week I help out here in Greven in the furniture bridge.
And I also worked at the school in the open full day.
What are your experiences with that?
Crowd: It's a beautiful, broad spectrum that I see here.
I have to do with different people, with young people, with refugees, with young adults.
They are now 26 years, so a late-career volunteer.
How does that happen?
Crowd: I graduated.
And then a civil engineering degree, let's say, successfully canceled.
I've realised for myself that it's the wrong thing for me and I want to do something different, work with people.
And then I wondered, what are you doing.
Make a social year, there's an insight, because you can see what it's like on the ground, in the focal point maybe, really.
And was it?
Crowd: I collected great impressions.
I will start my studies in social engineering in the winter semester.
I will study dual, probably do a social work education in the Youth Welfare Office of Herne and study in Hamm at the University of Applied Sciences.
Is it not a little unusual to have several different locations during the volunteer service?
Crowd: Yes, it's very variable.
It probably always comes down to where you do your FSJ.
You can do it from retirement home to youth work - in all sorts of facets of social work.
It was very varied with me.
I was also in the OGS in part, so in afternoon care.
For me, that was exactly the right thing that irritated me.
I was able to see my own strengths and see how it really works out.
Unlike in civil engineering studies?
Crowd: Well, this is not about counting stats.
You always have other people in front of you who each have a very different story behind them.
Whether a refugee, whether a young person who has been taken out of the family - you always have to go into it individually.
Very interesting.
And you had no sense of touch?
Crowd: I'm not the guy for that.
It's an area that gives you a lot.
A lot of love, a lot of kindness.
There are negative moments, too, but that's just the way life is.
Pearson cuts another 3,000 jobs and cuts dividend to revive business
British education group Pearson said on Friday it would cut another 3,000 jobs and cut its interim dividend by 72 per cent as another restructuring programme is launched to overcome the pressures facing the company.
The job cuts, announced by director general John Fallon mostly for late 2018 and early 2019, comes on top of its previous restructure, which has already lost 4,000 jobs.
In May, Pearson announced a plan to cut costs by a further £300 million (US $394 million) in a third cost-cutting program to revive a business hit by the rapid move to digital learning.
The company, which sold its stake in Penguin Random House to partner Bertelsmann last month, said the outlook for the financial year was unchanged after it posted a 1 per cent increase to £2.05 billion in the first half of the year.
Kabul convoy attack: NATO soldier killed in suicide bombing
A suicide bomber attacked a military convoy in the Afghan capital Kabul, killing a NATO soldier and wounding several others, officials say.
Five soldiers and an interpreter were injured, a statement from NATO said.
According to unconfirmed local reports, three civilians also died in the incident in the Qarabagh district.
The bombing is the latest violence to hit Afghanistan this month - more than 30 people were killed at a mosque in Herat on Tuesday.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
A statement from NATO says Thursday night's explosion happened when a joint patrol with the Afghan army was attacked by a "person-worn improvised explosive device."
The statement says all of the injured are in a stable condition and are being treated at the U.S. Military Hospital at the Bagram airfield.
Correspondents say the growing strength of the Taliban and the group known as the so-called Islamic State (IS) in Qarabagh is a major concern for NATO forces in nearby Bagram.
According to the United Nations, there were at least 1,662 civilian deaths in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, of which about 20% were in the capital.
In late July, a suicide car bomb killed at least 30 people in a mainly Shiite district of Kabul.
The Taliban said they carried out that attack.
On May 31, a huge bombing in the center of the city killed more than 150 people with the country's deadliest militant attack since US-led forces pushed the Taliban from power in 2001.
The violence underscores the precarious security situation in Afghanistan as U.S. President Donald Trump weighs in on increasing the number of U.S. troops supporting the military and police in the country.
Correspondents say the suicide bombings in Kabul in recent weeks have also caused a crisis of public trust in the government, its policies and, in particular, the reputation of President Ashraf Ghani.
EPA reverses decision to delay smog rule after lawsuits
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has lifted a decision to delay regulation of the Obama administration, requiring states to curb smog-causing emissions, a day after 15 states sued the agency over the stride.
The EPA announced late on Wednesday the decision to push ahead with so-called "ozone regulations in 2015," saying it showed the agency's commitment to work with states.
"We believe in dialogue with and in responding to our state partners," EPA Chief Scott Pruitt said in a statement.
In June, Pruitt announced the EPA's intention to delay ozone regulations - in which pollutant emissions are to be measured in part of the country to determine where cuts must be made to meet stricter air quality standards - by a year until October 2018.
A group of 15 largely Democratic states, along with the District of Colombia, filed a lawsuit on Tuesday, saying the effort was illegal.
President Donald Trump's administration has sought to roll back a wide range of environmental requirements imposed by former President Barack Obama as part of a broader agenda designed to boost economic growth, according to Trump.
However, the efforts have prompted the setback of Democrats and conservation groups worried about the impact of greater emissions on public health.
The EPA's website says inhaling air containing ozone "can reduce lung function and increase respiratory symptoms," such as asthma.
Local council wants community space
In the end, the decision was clear: With two votes against, the local council of Fluorn Winds decides to set up a community space in the future senior residence.
Before the discussion, there is an important piece of information: The purchase contract for the missing part of the land has been signed, reports Mayor Bernhard Tjaden.
Although it will be a long time before the area so far belonging to the church community is in community ownership, there is now no planning impediment to the project to be stamped by a private investor.
There is a discussion about a common area for this.
One of the two investors still on the boat has offered to meet the community.
On the ground floor, it would provide a living space - about 55 square feet - and an adjoining terrace with at least 70 square feet of space for a special price.
It is up to the administration and the majority of the local council not to provide such a common space as a meeting place only for the residents of seniority housing, but openly into the community.
As an example, the word from the "knitting café" made the rounds.
The decision, which was pre-decided by the provision of funds for the current budget as early as last autumn, will be sweetened by funding opportunities.
Construction is in the rehabilitation area.
The establishment of a community space would be eligible, Tjaden reports, at 60 per cent from 30 per cent.
The proposal for a decision, in order to signal to the investor that he does not want to throw a knuckle between his legs in this regard, provides for the finding that both saddle - which is leaning on environmental development - and pultroof - which reduces the level of truss and makes construction more economical - would be possible.
Unnecessary, not only Wilfried Sohmer thinks, is this addition.
If it's helping: Unanimously, he's passing the panel.
The common room is not as simple as that.
Daniela's reputation points to the many separate buildings you don't quite move forward with, for which you now rest out the window at the common room, she says: "I'm struggling with it."
Yvonne Staiger is keen to speak out in favour of the common space - but absolutely against community involvement.
It sees it as a covert subsidy to already wealthy or even foreign investors.
That's just not the case, because with the acquisition of the area, you don't give a grant, but get a real, in doubt, marketable equivalent, the counter-statement reads.
Mr Staiger's request to split the proposal for a decision accordingly is supported by three advocates.
So there are two votes against the original programme, which Stefan Haller sums up: "If we take the decision in this way, we will take a giant step towards closing a huge gap in our infrastructure."
Collision with car: Cyclist is thrown onto road
While crossing the road, an 82-year-old cyclist was struck by a car and seriously injured in Garath on Wednesday.
As the police spoke, the 82-year-old Langenfelder was riding his bike on the bike path of the Black Way road from the direction of Hilden around 12.20pm.
The senior wanted to cross the carriageway in the height of the street Am Buchholzer Busch.
A car driver driving in the same direction granted him priority.
When the laneway took to the road, however, he did not appear to be paying attention to the counter-traffic.
He came across a car stealing a 66-year-old aid worker.
The man was thrown onto the street.
He suffered serious injuries and was taken to a hospital with a retouching car.
FC Bayern Munich must miss out on David Alaba and Thiago at the Supercup against Borussia Dortmund
The Supercup takes place without him: David Alaba has to suck up the game against Dortmund.
With staffers, FC Bayern will travel to Dortmund for the first penny of the new season.
Seven pros are missing the defending champion in the Supercup against the cup winner.
The staffers at German football's record-breaking Bayern Munich are getting bigger ahead of the Supercup on Saturday (8.30pm / ZDF and Eurosport) at cup winner Borussia Dortmund.
Coach Carlo Ancelotti must also do without David Alaba in the duel with BVB.
The Italian confirmed that on Friday.
In addition, the miners are missing Manuel Neuer, James, Thiago, Jerome Boateng, Arjen Robben and Juan Bernat.
For the five defeats in the past six Test matches, Ancelotti has blamed the physical condition and lack of balance in his team's game.
"We know we are not in the best physical condition," Ancelotti said, adding: "The most important point is the balance in the team.
It wasn't good last. '
However, the 58-year-old believes in an increase in performance in the first official penny of the season.
"Football is also tactics, strategy, personality and motivation.
I have great confidence that my team is showing those qualities.
The team is ready.
We want to play intelligently, "said Ancelotti, who expects a" difficult, intense game. "
The duel of the two German football heavyweights is attracting fans.
The game is sold out with 81,360 viewers, the German Football League (DFL) said on Friday.
Walking from star to star in resin
In the resin, the nation's first "star trail" is to be created.
This is planned by the association Sternwarte Sankt Andreasberg.
There is a planetary path in Göttingen - since 2003.
A "star trail" meets the information needs of many resin visitors, it said.
It connects nature, science, movement and athletic performance.
Members want to set up panels along the planned route and inform them about stars and constellations.
In a first phase until 2018, the association plans "well-achievable installations at five to six locations" in the Oberharz.
Ineligible would be St. Andreasberg, Braunlage, Hohegeiß and Sieber.
The information on the panels will be supplemented by the Internet.
That's why a good mobile network reception plays a role in the choice of location.
Accessibility is also a criterion.
Later, the star trail was to be expanded train by train.
"On the star trail, viewers experience a lot of knowledge, for example about the physics of the individual stars," the association said.
They also learned why stars had different colors or why one star lit up more than another, although it was much further away.
It also conveys the star image a selected star is in and when it is best seen.
The association has already operated the highest-altitude observatory in northern Germany since 2014 in the mountain town of St. Andreasberg.
The site in the middle of the Harz National Park is one of the six darkest regions in Germany, according to the Federal Office of Nature Conservation.
Frequently from there, the Milky Way and even the Andromeda galaxy are clearly visible with the naked eye.
There has been something similar to the planned Starwerg - the Planetary Trail - in the university city since 2003, on the initiative of the funding association Planetarium Göttingen.
Starting in front of Gebhards Hotel in the Goetheallee, which forms the interior of our solar system, the planetary path leads up to the Hainberg and the observatory - as well as an "alien" location in Diemarden (municipality of Gleichen) with the planet Sedna.
The stelae with the individual planets - including the Pluto degraded to the dwarf planet at the endpoint - are positioned exactly at the distance and scale of one to two billion.
The Earth thus shrinks to a sphere of 6.5 millimetres in diameter, while the sun, which is exactly 75 metres away, measures 70 centimetres after all.
The entire distance of the planetary path is a good four kilometres.
While the light from sun to Pluto takes about eight hours, pedestrians need a good hour to the stele with Pluto.
So pedestrians are faster than the light in the universe.
The march to the next fixture, however, would take another six months.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for the first time, discussing a possible showdown
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who should be in a collision course to stage the most exciting boxing match in the near future under 147 pounds, met for the first time on Thursday.
They were in separate rooms at ESPN offices in Los Angeles until Garcia, the unseeded World Boxing Council lightweight champion, walked down the hallway to greet Lomachenko, the World Boxing Organization super-featherweight champion.
After Garcia's victory by unanimous decision on former four-division champion Adrien Broner on Saturday on Showtime, both fighters are members of the top five Pound for Pound list.
Garcia stretched out his right hand and said, "How are you going, champion?
I wish you good luck. ""
Lomachenko defends his belt against Miguel Marriaga on Saturday night at 7pm on ESPN.
As the pair posed for photos, Lomachenko's manager, Egis Climate, remarked that a possible showdown between the militants would be the "perfect magnitude."
"I'm a former feather weight," Garcia recalled.
'i went up for Broner [on £140] but I'm not that big.
I'm small for 140.
I want to come down to lightweight.
And he has to move on to lightweight weights [135 pounds] and then we fight.
That's what the fans are asking for.
Let's give them that. '
Lomachenko agreed.
"Boxing needs this fight." "
Climate asked if it should be on pay-per-view, part of a strategy Lomachenko must fight with a 135-pound debut this year to agree a date with Garcia next summer (37-0, 30 knockouts) who also has an interest in battling the winner of Jorge Linares-Luke Campbell after their lightweight title fight at the Forum on September 23.
"This fight could take place in pay-per-view mode because all the fans asked about him," Garcia said, later openly opting to fight with the network that offers the best financial package.
We are the best.
No other names can generate that kind of attention.
Whenever they are ready... "
Garcia said he appreciates Lomachenko as "an enormous fighter," and he may be taking part in his Saturday fight.
But Lomachenko stopped at the generous praise for Garcia, saying that he thinks the three-match champion from Riverside looks "very slow, sorry Mikey... you want the co-off."
Garcia said the focus was to show concussion, then boxing.
Both said they could feel the momentum building up for their own fight.
'This is the fight that needs to be carried out.
No other fight creates so much attention and enthusiasm.
I'm more than happy to work on it, "Garcia said.
Lomachenko said: "I've been waiting for the top fighters, and that's Mikey.
It's going to be a great fight. '
Four injured after tyre burst
Four people were seriously injured in an accident on the A7 on Thursday afternoon.
According to initial information, the driver of an Opel Zafira lost control of his vehicle about 4.30pm just before the market-wide junction, presumably after a tyre burst.
The car veered to the right into the embankment, where it was overshadowed and then left on the roof in the green strip.
The four passengers - two adults and two children - were seriously injured in the accident.
During the emergency service's initial care of the injured, the A7 was closed towards the north for about an hour, followed by traffic on the left-hand side of the road at the accident site.
Fortunas Hoffmann: "Threesome works better"
After 2-2 to start the season against Braunschweig, Andre Hoffmann hopes that optimising the defensive formation in Aue will score points.
With the first game of the season Andre Hoffmann was satisfied, with the result also, had there not been the two opponents at 2-2 against Braunschweig.
"That was two tackles too much, and we have to be even better in Aue," says Fortuna Duesseldorf's defender.
In the Ore Mountains, the three-chain is to be further optimised.
And a goal after a free-kick, the Fortunes don't want to capture either.
"For the future, it will be that no one is putting themselves on the line next to Michael (Rensing)." "
Hoffmann is convinced that even after the experience in preparation, his team will cope better with the three-pointer than with the quadriceps.
"Still I don't know how we're going to operate in Aue," says his coach, Friedhelm Funkel, but Hoffmann is sure of his cause "because we've just got players in the three-way line at the half positions in Kaan Ayhan and Niko Gießelmann who can build well," Hoffmann said.
"The prerequisite, however, is that we harmonise even better and we don't make as many playoff errors in the build-up."
Of course, Hoffmann also drives to Aue to win the game.
"But whether you can talk about a failed start after an indecision, you don't know.
The performance might well be okay, "Hoffmann said.
"But if we can get by four points on Sunday and focus on the cup, we'll certainly be able to talk about a decent start to the season." "
His coach didn't want to know about that.
"I don't judge the start of the season until after six to eight days of play," said Friedhelm Funkel, who doesn't want to talk about an advantage over Aue just because the game of the Saxons in Heidenheim had to be canceled early because of a storm.
"Now they can virtually start the season with a home game," said Funkel and Hoffmann believes the players from Aue might even be a little fresher as they wouldn't have a heavy and complete game like Fortuna against an upstart favourite in the bone.
"But they don't know as 100% where they currently stand," says Fortuna's interior defender.
Although the guests from the Rhineland will go to the meeting at the finally (almost) finished stadium of Aue as a slight favourite on Sunday.
"The fact that we are feasting them away just because we are entitled to get under the first six is nonsense," says Funkel, whose record in just one defeat to Aue from nine games is quite positive.
"There is no team in the 2nd Bundesliga that you have to beat from the start," explains Fortune's head coach.
'to make such a statement would be arrogant and arrogant. '
And so Funkel doesn't want to experience his players on Sunday.
New results of Swedish asylum-age assessment tests published
The latest results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden, which have been subjected to a new method of medical assessment of their age, show that more than 80 per cent of those tested are over the age of 18, but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results.
The Swedish Forensic Medicine Authority (Rättsmedicinalverket) started carrying out the tests last year.
They are expected to make the assessment of age more accurate during the asylum process after the Swedish Migration Agency (Migrationsverket) was criticised for errors in assessing the correct age of some refugees who were underage.
To date, Migrationsverket has sent 6,880 cases to be tested and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now released the results of a total of 2,481 tests from the period from mid-March to July 31, 2017.
Eighty per cent (2002) were judged to be 18 or older, while in a further 25 cases the Forensic Medicine Agency judged the person was "possibly 18 years or older."
In 432 cases, the conclusion was that the person "may be under the age of 18."
The tests are only carried out in cases where the person's age is called into question.
According to Johan Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency, the results have been steady in recent months.
"We don't see a big difference in the statistics over the past few months, the numbers are pretty steady," he told The Local.
The high proportion of cases in which the person was judged to be over the age of 18 does not necessarily mean the asylum seeker lied about his age.
In May, the agency released the results of 581 tests and said there were 442 cases that "suggest the person under investigation was 18 years or older."
When the Svenska Dagbladet newspaper examined the 581 published results, it found that in 243 of those cases, the person had openly said that she would be 18 years old this year.
The method of medical age assessment, which makes X-ray images of wisdom teeth and MRI shots of knee joints, which are then analysed by dentists and radiologists, has also been criticised in some areas.
One skeptic is the Karolinska Institute's endocrinologist Claude Marcus, whose work includes assessing people's biological maturity to see if they went through puberty sooner or later than usual.
'i had reason to think about it and I don't think the type of measurement should be used.
Judging biological age in this way is very uncertain.
If we can't say it for sure, we shouldn't pretend we could, "he told the Metro newspaper.
However, Mr Göransson, of the Forensic Medicine Agency, defended the accuracy of the tests: "In general you can say that the risk of misjudging a child as an adult is low.
The biggest risk is if the person is just under 18, in which case that's about 10 per cent. '
Full in plan
Work on the three bridges of Landstraße 108 between Lauterbach and Schramberg is progressing well.
On Wednesday, a seven-tonne concrete part was installed on the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lauterbach.
"We are very good in time, it's going super," says Reinhold Leicht, a construction manager at the Department of Road and Transport at the Freiburg governor's office.
In April, work began at the same time on all three remedial bridges between Schramberg and Lauterbach.
Construction is scheduled for October and Leicht is certain the timetable will be met.
The first bridge, from Schramberg, leads over the Trombach.
It is a vaulted bow bridge made of concrete, which is covered with red buntsandstone and has a total length of 4.80 metres.
It was built in 1900.
Like the other two bridges, it has now come into the years.
In order to ensure stability and road safety, the three buildings will now be thoroughly restored.
The other two bridges lead over the Lauterbach.
They are made of red Buntsandstein.
Both were built in 1939 and are 12, or 10.60 metres long.
The bridge at the entrance of Lauterbach has now received a 1.30 metre wide and seven tonne so-called bridge cap on the north side on Wednesday morning.
This is a fringe attachment that is also used as an operating path.
A 2.20-metre-wide bridge cap will be used on the southern part of the bridge on Friday.
This is where the pedestrian path is supposed to go.
The special thing is that these are finished parts, a patent from the Schramberger company Dizwo.
The other two bridges are already fitted with the patented bridge caps.
The laying of lines by the building in Lauterbach has required particular sensitivity.
This is because there is also a fibre-optic cable to which many companies are connected.
The residents were informed by hand papers about the project in the lead-up to the work.
In addition, fish and crayfish had to be fished first.
For the bridges between the yard building and the saddle weiler in the direction of Schramberg, traffic is regulated single-lane by a traffic light.
For the construction work on the bridge at the Lauterbach entrance, the road in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotels "Tannenhof" and "Seven Linden" is completely closed.
The combined cost of the three bridge renovations is EUR 700 000.
The whole thing is funded by the country.
AFD in Gerolstein: Bout protest at German potato salad
It is not so common for parties to pull together, but when it comes to the Alternative for Germany (AfD), it comes together, which is otherwise difficult to reconcile.
The parties represented in the Vulkaneifel district (CDU, SPD, Greens, FDP, FWG, left) are part of a broad alliance that shows a peaceful flag on this day because the AfD in the Gerolsteiner Stadthalle invites Rondell to the "big campaign launch," according to the poster.
And well-known names to launch - such as Alice Weidel, who along with Alexander Gauland forms the top duo for the federal election on September 24, and Deputy Federal President Beatrix von Storch.
But those who are on the ground hours before the event starts don't want to listen to the AfD people, but demonstrate.
The motto "The Eifel remains colourful."
The city picnic was originally planned under the slogan "All at a table" on the fountain square, but now takes place in the parking lot below the Rondell - and thus right in front of the eyes of those who come to the AfD event in the town hall.
A colourful picture that offers itself there.
And what Christa Karoli, president of the Forum One World and one of the key organizers, is really looking forward to: "Great how many people have come together here."
There is music and lots of food, including an "ancient German potato salad that the AfD could also eat easily," says the woman who brought him.
The police have ordered many officers to Gerolstein, and it shows presence especially at the station, which is just a few metres from the venues.
How did the AfD actually get to Gerolstein?
Mario Hompes of the AfD Vulkaneifel reports that he has sought such an event and has been awarded the contract.
The 45-year-old from Gönnersdorf first asked in Daun, but got a cancellation there because there were not enough parking spaces because of the Laurentiuskirmes already built.
So now the Rondell, Hompes is pleased that "we can have such a beautiful event here."
Referring to the event on the Rondel precinct, he says: "This is the good right of the people, the main thing is that it remains peaceful."
It also does: At 8pm, there is a band for entertainment on the Rondellvorplatz, and various speakers in the town hall, including the Rhineland-Palatinate AfD chairman Uwe Junge.
There are about 200 listeners in the room waiting for the front-runner for the federal election, Alice Weidel, and Deputy Federal President Beatrix von Storch to deliver their speeches.
The police presence is unchanged, but so far officials have had a quiet evening.
The AfD event takes just over an hour, and guests on the precinct have a longer breath, but there is also a need to clean up there just after 9pm.
The police can move away - no special incidents.
Trombone meets trumpet
There will be a rehearing with the Wolff trombonist Frederic Belli in the series Haslacher Klosterkonzerte tomorrow, Sunday, at 8 p.m. in the monastery church.
Together with the Bulgarian trumpeter Miroslav Petkov, he gives a concert under the motto "Black Sea meets Black Forest," or even "Balkan folklore" meets a classical German education with roots in brass music.
Both soloists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and hold solo positions in top European orchestras.
For example, Petkov is a soloist at the renowned Concertgebouw Orchestra Amsterdam and Frederic Belli is the Soloposaunist of the SWR Symphony Orchestra.
Both unites the desire not only to cross the boundaries on their instruments, but also to merge the boundaries of the different genres.
That's how Johann Sebastian Bach sounds at the two as in a new guise, Daniel Schnyder's "world music" reunites with Bulgarian folklore, and in the play "Exchange Suite" by the jazz echophile Nils Wogram, classical, jazz and free play blend into a fascinating overall work of art.
This centrepiece of the program was first premiered in Freiburg this spring with huge success.
The renowned composer Nils Wogram has written it specifically for the two musicians and more than that: The Haslacher Klosterkirche with its special acoustics is consciously included in the concert.
Kristen Stewart talks about her bisexuality
'Some people love grilled cheese and will eat it until the end of their lives.
But I want to try everything, "Kristen Stewart said quite frankly about her bisexuality.
"Once I bite in grilled cheese, I think, 'Oh that was cool, what's next?'"
Arguably the Hollywood star's most famous relationship was the one to her "Twilight" colleague Robert Pattinson, who ultimately fell apart bitterly.
Despite all this, the brunette performer assures the Harper's Bazaar magazine: "I was seriously in love with everyone I was dating.
Or do you think I'd played it? '
After her split, Kristen admitted she was bisexual: "I've always lived the dualism and seriously believed in it.
So it has never confused or hindered me.
I just never liked not being taken seriously. '
However, according to "Bang Showbiz," she particularly suffered in school time when she preferred to dress like a cub: "Not all girls are typical girls.
That really hurt me a lot.
When I was 11 the children told me I would look like a cub.
I felt really attacked, scared and ashamed.
Now I look back and think, 'girl, be proud of you!' "
She doesn't like to explain her love life to the public in particular: "People expect you to relate in a certain way and that annoys me.
And maybe some describe me as undeterred, but I don't like having to justify myself in front of the whole public. '
West Virginia governor announces he's changing the party
. The Democratic governor of West Virginia, Jim Justice, announced Thursday night at a rally with President Trump that he would change the party.
Whether you like it or not, Democrats have moved away from me, "Governor Justice said.
"Today I will tell you with lots of prayers and a lot of thought... today I will tell you, as a resident of West Virginia, I can no longer help you if I am a Democratic governor."
The rally erupted in cheers.
"Tomorrow I will change my registration to the Republicans," Justice added.
"As a coach, I'd say it's time to play another game." "
Mr. Trump promised a major announcement at the West Virginia rally before.
Mr. Trump won West Virginia by 42 points, and Justice did not endorse Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice, who is the only billionaire in the state, according to Forbes, was elected in 2016.
Forbes notes that he owns coal mines in five states, and inherited a coal business from his father.
It's worth about $1.59 billion.
Meanwhile, on Thursday night, the Republican National Committee issued a statement saying, "Governor Justice's party change is another blow to a Democratic Party that would prevent us rather than work to make our country great again."
"With only 15 governors and the control of the least legislative entities in history, Governor Justice's announcement is just the final rejection of a party that is without leadership from top to bottom and unable to find a positive, unifying message," Ronna McDaniel, the RNC chairman, told CBS News in a statement.
CoE praises' honest 'Russian apology for doping scandal
The world's head of athletics, Sebastian Coe, on Thursday praised what he described as an apparent apology from Russia to a doping scandal, but he repeated it was not the moment for the country to be re-admitted to the sport.
Russia's athletics chief Dmitry Shylakhtin said during the IAAF congress on the eve of the World Athletics Championships that his country's exile from the sport was correct and that he was determined to fight doping.
He said he was sorry for "all the athletes who have been snatched away gold and silver medals in competitions."
Despite his comments, the IAAF Congress voted to uphold the ban, which was imposed in November 2015 after a World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) report found evidence of state-sponsored doping in Russia.
"I thought it was a very open answer today, a very honest presentation," IAAF President Coe told reporters.
"The entire Council and the entire Congress were pleased that the Russian Federation has recognized in itself that it has experienced some pretty hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the federation is redesigned."
CoE said he was also "pleased" that Russia accepted the criteria for its reintroduction.
"I think it was a very constructive day and I think progress has been made, but Congress supports the task force's recommendations that this is not the moment to reinstate Russia," Coe said.
"We need to do everything we can in the coming months to normalise this situation.
The guiding principle has always been that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the spoiled system, 'he added
Nineteen Russian athletes will compete as neutral players at the World Athletics Championships, which begin in London on Friday, under the strict IAAF criteria.
The head of the IAAF task force, Rune Andersen, said on Monday that Russia still had to meet some of the criteria for reinstatement.
Drug testing is still inadequate and banned trainers are still free to operate, he told reporters in London after a lecture at the IAAF Council.
Mourning act for soldiers who crashed in Mali
A ceremony in the northern hemisphere of Fritzlar has commemorated around 1000 people of the two soldiers killed in a helicopter crash in Mali.
The ceremony took place in the cathedral city on Thursday under high security precautions.
On the still unexplained cause of the crash, Defence Minister Ursula von der Leyen (CDU) said nothing.
But she described the two fallen pilots as "kings of their specialist."
"We are linking ourselves to this highest sacrifice they have provided on behalf of the Federal Republic of Germany," she explained.
The 33-year-old Major and 47-year-old Stabshauptmann, from northern Hesse, were killed in west African Mali a week ago on Wednesday.
Their coffins were transferred to Germany and taken to the Fritzlarer Dom Sankt Peter on Thursday accompanied by a German army death guard.
At midday, at first, only the loved ones in the church took leave.
After that, the ceremony began in the circle of the family, closest friends, representatives of the German army as well as politics.
Among them were Hesse's prime minister, Volker Bouffier (CDU) and the general inspector of the Bundeswehr Volker Wieker.
Mourners laid roses, and the relatives stood arm in arm at the coffins.
In front of the church, Fritzlarer and numerous soldiers watched the ceremony on a canvas.
Defence Minister von der Leyen described the fallen soldiers as "highly decorated" and fed up.
The Stabshauptmann built the flight operations of the Tiger combat helicopter in Fritzlar and was one of the first six trained Tiger pilots of its regiments.
Volker Bauersachs, commander of the regiment to which the soldiers belong, also stated: "If this crew could not avert the crash, then none would have been able to."
Minister von der Leyen did not show any doubts about the UN mission in Mali: The deployment was dangerous.
But it is also of high importance "for a country from which we are separated only by two states," she said.
After the ceremony, the coffins were brought out of the cathedral.
The German army did not specify when and where they will be buried.
Prince Henrik doesn't want a grave next to his wife
The man of Danish Queen Margrethe (77), Prince Henrik (83), does not want to be buried next to his wife after his death.
The Royal House announced on Thursday.
Traditionally, the Danish royal couple are settled in the Cathedral Church of Roskilde.
The sculptor Bjørn Nørgaard already made a sarcophagus for the two.
The queen agreed with her husband's decision, the notice said.
It is still unclear where Prince Henrik will be buried.
However, he has no intention of being settled in his French homeland.
Prince Henrik had never made a secret of the fact that he was not happy with his title.
He would have liked to become king after thrashing his wife, Margrethe, in 1972.
He retired in 2016, also laying out the title "Prinzgemahl."
Since Henrik did not get the title and function he wanted in Denmark, he does not see himself as equivalent to his wife - even after death, explained Lene Balleby, the Danish royal's chief spokeswoman.
Where the 83-year-old's final resting place will ultimately be is still unclear.
However, he did not intend to be settled in his French homeland, but in Denmark.
He likes the country he's worked for for the last 50 years.
The native Henri de Laborde de Monpezat, son of a French aristocracy, had met Margrethe in London in 1965.
He worked in the French Embassy on the Thames.
While his later wife always floated the people's expressions of sympathy, Prince Henrik had a serious stand in his nearly 50-year reign with the Danes.
In an autobiography, Henrik spoke about the first few years in Denmark: "A few months after I arrived, everything I did was criticised.
My Danish was swanky, I preferred wine instead of beer, silk stockings instead of knitting socks, Citroën instead of Volvo, tennis rather than football.
Even for the Gauloises I smoked in place of Virginia tobacco and who had a reputation here for being the brand of socially critical intellectuals, I couldn't hope for leniency.
I was different.
I seemed happy with that position and not ashamed of myself.
That was just two mistakes! '
Prime Minister Weil wants swift re-election
CDU and FDP facing possible majority in Lower Saxony
Dutch Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) is in favour of a swift re-election of the country after losing the red-green government majority, but he does not want to resign.
Because spoke out on Friday for the dissolution of parliament.
Earlier, the surprise exit of a Green MP from her rural faction in Lower Saxony plunged the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) into a serious crisis.
Five months before the official date of the state election, the red-green coalition in Hanover lost its narrow one-vote majority in parliament to the opposition from the CDU and FDP.
The previous Green MP, Elke Tested, justified her move with the non-nomination for the 2018 election in her constituency in Rotenburg (Wümme).
"I see my political future in the CDU," she declared in Hanover on Friday.
CDU group leader Björn Thümler wants to recommend that his group include them.
This would give the CDU and the FDP a combined 69 seats in the Lower Saxony country, SPD and Greens 68 seats.
So far, the relationship has been reversed.
The new day will be elected as a regular on January 14 next year.
Mr Thümler said the red-green state government must now decide whether to continue to govern in this situation without a majority.
However, Stephan Weil believes it is essential that the country decides its self-resolution as soon as possible.
The CDU group is expected to decide on its way forward on Tuesday.
The state constitution also provides for the possibility of the country depriving the prime minister of confidence and electing a successor.
"Our Constitution offers several options.
These possibilities need to be examined in a legally clean way, "Thümler said.
'one will calmly discuss all the issues if they are considered legally reasonable. '
Thümler called Twestern's move "a little curious."
The politician herself insisted: "I am not a traitor.
I feel very good. '
She described herself as a supporter of black and green.
The Greens called on the breakaway MPs to return their land deal.
"We assume, of course, that she will return her country's mandate, which she has received through the green national list, with immediate effect," the country's chairmen, Meta Janssen-Kucz and Stefan Körner, said.
The leader of the Green Party, Anja Piel, said: "We are extremely sorry for Elke Tested's decision."
She deliberately chose not to have a debate in the group.
"Even in the light of the fact that there were no substantive differences, we cannot understand this move."
SPD chancellor Martin Schulz condemns the transfer of the low-profile Green MP Elke Tvests to the CDU as a betrayal.
"The behaviour of the former Green MPs in Lower Saxony is not only betrayal of the electorate but also betrayal of red-green," the federal leader of the Social Democrats wrote on Facebook on Friday.
He supports Prime Minister Stephan Weil's (SPD) decision to quickly re-elect the country.
The exit of Twest costs red-green in Lower Saxony the majority.
The politician, "in her injured vanity and in her frustration, is putting her personal interests before the good of the country," criticised SPD general secretary Hubertus Heil.
'it's a scandal that the CDU in Lower Saxony is involved in this dirty intrigue game and is trying to make political capital out of it. '
Dutch CDU group leader Björn Thümler will recommend that his MPs include Elke Tvests in the CDU.
The leader of the SPD in the Bundestag, Thomas Oppermann, accused Tvests of distorting the outcome of the 2013 state election with personal career gifts.
The CDU was the strongest force before the SPD at the time, but the SPD and Greens had a skinny majority of one vote in the day.
Agriculture Minister in interview - How do we protect ourselves from toxic ponds, Mr Schmidt?
Germany discusses contaminated eggs.
How could the scandal happen?
How can consumers protect themselves?
Agriculture Minister Christian Schmidt (CSU) is speaking in an interview with the editorial network Germany (RND).
Mr Schmidt, how can consumers protect themselves from poisoned eggs?
I can only encourage all consumers to look closely at the eggs in your fridge and check the stamp print.
On the consumer protection portal www.foodcauung.de, the federal states provide the most up-to-date information on the affected eggs batches.
Affected eggs should be destroyed or returned.
Even if, according to everything we know at the moment, a health hazard is virtually excluded.
Is Aldi now taking on the best possible crisis response - all eggs out of supply - because the central role of the reconnaissance is not really perceived by the federal agriculture minister?
Food monitoring is the responsibility of the federal states.
Nevertheless, my house has been delayed without delay and has been in close contact with the authorities of the countries since the announcement of Germany's concern.
All information and risk assessment are available to consumers.
Trade, like manufacturers, must ensure that the products sold are marketable and harmless to health.
If the maximum residue level of 0.005mg / kg is exceeded for eggs, they are not marketable.
However, uncontaminated eggs can be sold and consumed.
This time, it is not businesses that are to blame.
Are production companies and consumers in the same boat?
According to current knowledge, the production companies are not directly responsible.
Instead, they face economic damage due to alleged illegal practices by service companies.
As always, there are too few inspectors in the event of an emergency.
Is it just a lack of staff or a lack of conclusive competence?
It was the official controls that uncovered the operation.
But the truth is that food fraud and criminal energy can never be 100% excluded.
It is precisely for this reason that a consistent investigation of such events and handing over to prosecutors in cases where crimes may be available are of crucial importance.
I have already made it clear on a number of occasions that I expect full clarification from the responsible authorities.
Is regular alarmism really necessary in food scandals?
Consumers have the right to obtain only safe and marketable food.
When an unapproved insecticide is used in the food industry, consumers are rightly outraged.
The adulterated remedy has put manufacturers, distributors and consumers in a situation that is absolutely not necessary.
In principle, it must be clear that the illegal use of the insecticide Fipronil in the keeping of food-supplying animals is unacceptable and must be stopped immediately.
This needs to be worked on consistently and with high pressure at all levels.
I expect all the competent authorities to ensure that the facts are swiftly and fully investigated.
How football's financial rules affect Neymar's move to Paris
The rules, which aim to prevent unfettered spending by European football clubs, will not disrupt Neymar's world record transfer from Spain's Barcelona to France's Paris-Saint Germain.
Any consequences will still come for Paris Saint-Germain from UEFA, because the senior organisation overseeing the European game has the power to ban teams from accessing the prestigious Champions League tournament.
Financial fair play rules, launched by UEFA in 2011, mean that PSG will eventually have to prove that Neymar's transfer was funded without major losses.
Barcelona have paid €222 million ($262 million) to buy the Brazilian out of his contract and Neymar will receive a salary that will be several $10 million a year.
Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymar's move to France.
PSG can certainly loosen the money for Neymar to sign and bring him into a galaxy of other stars, given the team's funding by Qatar's energy-rich ruling family.
Clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money on acquiring players, but they have to counter with legitimate sources of income that allow them to break-Even point in their football-related business.
FFP was conceived by Michel Platini after his election as UEFA president in 2007.
The former French player believed clubs that had taken on huge debts in their quest for success were effectively cheating and risked ruining themselves if banks or owners withdrew their support.
In 2011, FFP shifted from focusing on clubs "debts to monitoring their losses.
The change meant the business model that Roman Abramovich originally used in Chelsea in 2003 - buying a club with potential and then investing heavily to improve the team and build a global brand - should become a tougher affair.
During the current three-year FFP disposition period, which runs until 2018, clubs can accept losses of €30 million.
And although Platini has fallen into disgrace from the presidency in 2015, his UEFA successor, Aleksander Ceferin, remains committed to shying away from excessive spending.
"Certainly FFP is not dead and we will certainly step up the rules for the future," Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for FFP at UEFA, told The Associated Press last week.
Although the PSG paid Neymar's buy-out clause in a lump sum, it can distribute the amount for the accounts over the duration of its contract.
Neymar has signed a five-year contract so the redemption fee for the next five years of €44.4 million can be shown in the annual accounts.
The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 hit PSG with the heaviest sanctions, along with Abu Dhabi, which is owned by Manchester City.
The PSG received a fine of €60 million ($82 million at the time), which was later reduced to €20 million - and it was arranged for the team members for the 2014-15 Champions League to be limited to 21 players instead of the otherwise normal 25 players.
UEFA is on the lookout for clubs that could try to oversee their financial supervision by inflating their revenue through companies linked to the owners of a club.
While a Catalan company could sponsor PSG if the value of the sponsorship was to exceed standard market rates, UEFA would not allow this to be considered a legitimate income.
That's exactly what happened in 2014, when UEFA ruled that the value of the PSA's sponsorship was inflated by the Qatar Tourism Authority.
It has been reported that some of the PSG payments to Neymar could come via payments from the organising committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.
But PSG and Qatar in 2022 have denied that Neymar will become World Cup ambassador and such a manoeuvre could be easy for UEFA regulators to find out.
The previous sanctions against PSG mean UEFA will be even more attentive to respecting any attempt to circumvent the rules.
UEFA had no preparatory talks with PSG over Neymar's transfer, telling people familiar with the situation on Thursday.
They spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to discuss the PSG situation.
The latest published reports show PSG made a profit of more than €10 million in 2015-16 with sales of €542.4 million.
Accounts for the last fiscal year have yet to be released.
PSG expects Neymar's arrival to be a boon for sponsorship deals, merchandising and jersey sales.
The club expects sales to rise by at least 30 per cent after signing.
The Spanish league was clearly irritated to see one of the best football players go and it tried to prevent Neymar's move by claiming that PSG would hurt the FFP.
"It is a clear case of" financial doping "with the club and the state," the president of La Liga, Javier Tebas, told Spanish daily AS in relation to Qatar's eventual ownership of PSG.
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, whose club is owned by an American sports tycoon, shares La Liga's reservations about a state funding a club.
"It's the consequence of ownership and that has completely changed the whole landscape of football over the last 15 years," Wenger said on Thursday.
"Once a country owns a club, anything is possible.
It's going to be very difficult to respect the financial fair play because you can go different ways or have different interests when a country has such a big player to represent a country. '
Swiss is on the lookout for a new chocolate supplier
In recent years, Chocolat Frey has made board chocolate for the Swiss.
Now, the sweet collaboration is facing a possible end: The airline is rewriting the order.
Swiss spokeswoman Meike Fuhlrott confirmed a corresponding report from the Northwest Switzerland newspaper on Friday, at the request of the sda news agency.
According to current planning, the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018.
The products would be reviewed every two to three years and subject to quality control.
"We are very pleased with current supplier Chocolat Frey," the spokeswoman said.
Some 17 million small rotten-packed jogging boards of 14 grams distribute the flight attendants to passengers each year before landing.
The Swiss did not want to provide any information about the costs.
According to "Northwest Switzerland," industry insiders estimate the volume of orders to be between 1.5 and 2 million francs - the Migros subsidiary generates annual sales of around one billion francs.
But more important, once and for all, is the advertising effect: For a chocolate maker, it's a prestigious order.
The Swiss will not reveal how many applicants there are in the new tender.
However, only Swiss manufacturers are eligible.
According to the newspaper report, Chocolat Frey will seek to renew the contract beyond spring 2018.
For the sda, the largest Swiss chocolate maker was not available for comment.
The Swiss has been distributing chocolate panels on board its flights since 2006.
Before the Swiss concluded a contract with the Migros subsidiary, Barry Callebaut had supplied the chocolate tablets in collaboration with Hug.
The opportunity to place the logo was introduced by Swiss two and a half years ago with the launch of the collaboration with Chocolat Frey.
The airline works with different Swiss chocolate producers.
On long-haul flights, First Class customers are spoiled with treats from the Confiserie Sprüngli, in business class nae passengers Schoggi of Lindt and in Economy Class Schoggi by Chocolat Frey.
Also on the shoreline, Swiss Schoggi is distributed by Chocolat Frey, both in business and economy class.
Athletics - Diskus Olympic champion Robert Harting reaches World Cup final
The three-time world champion is fighting for a medal in Saturday's final.
His brother Christoph, the 2016 Olympic champion, had failed in the national World Cup elimination and could only watch the Diskus competition from the public gallery.
Also with the first try, Polish defending champion Piotr Malachowski, who threw 65.13 yards wide, qualified for the final match.
Nostalgia goes niche in "Wet Hot American Summer" and "comrade Detective"
This repetition of the story is simultaneously nostalgic because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80 "s, for the 90-year-old grunge era (when precincts David Wain and Michael Showalter turned the sketch comedy" The State "for MTV), and for themselves - that is, for 2001, before their stars, such as Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd, went to bigger things.
As a cultural artifact, it is equally a parody and an embodiment of our Facebook-enabled era of permanent memories.
But as a franchise, it feels like time is running out.
"First Day of Camp" worked surprisingly well, not just because of its absurd humour (it included an original story for a talking tin of vegetables spoken by H. Jon Benjamin).
By sticking to the core of the gag - middle-aged actors playing horny children who grow up - they nevertheless created the impossibility of winning back the last part of the jokes.
"Ten Years Later," with its adults now playing adults, is less emotionally rooted and its parody is more about the foundational principle, including a riff on the stalker movies of the 90 "s such as" The Hand That Rocks the Cradle "(" The hand that looks the cradle ").
At one point, a character rumbles through an Apple Powerbook, some inline skates and "a number of other things from 1991."
Many of the central stories are the same.
The lovely coop (Mr. Showalter), now a novelist, still hasn't forgotten Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) still hasn't lost his virginity.
And there's another crazy-vicious plot involving Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter), now endorsed by George H. W. Bush (a well-read impression of Michael Ian Black).
As always, the Excourses are the best part of the franchise.
It's especially fun to see the forever young Mr. Rudd showing Matt Dillon's lower lip of "Singles," whose former big-man-on-camp Andy now feels like an old cracker.
It's the moments of random madness that could fuel this franchise like a kind of repetitive "Seven Up!" Series until it reaches what I assume to be its logical conclusion: "Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later," whose final scene will show the gang as they will attend the film premiere of "Wet Hot American Summer."
"Comrade Detective" on Amazon is now reminiscent of a different kind of nostalgia: The Cold War revival of "The Americans," the movie "Atomic Blonde" and even "Glow" with its east-to-west ring-fight iconography.
The comedy with Rhys Thomas as director, created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka, admits to being a found TV series: A Romanian drama of the 1980s with the two policemen as friends, two officers from Bucharest fighting for truth, atheism and the path of Marxism-Leninism.
The lead roles - a hard-hitting Gregor and an idealistic Iosef - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu ulici, whose dialogues are dubbed in English by Channing Tatum (also an executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
It's a brilliant idea.
But it's not much more than an idea.
There are some nice gags to reputation (the police spend the time looking at chess on TV, as Americans might do with football).
And the list of famous speakers - including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny - makes for a decent game 'Find the voice out'.
But "comrade Detective" is so committed to the veracity of a desperate propaganda drama - a murderer wearing a Reagan mask is included - that it often plays like a single one.
At six long episodes, it drags on, and the comedy isn't fast or frequent enough.
"Comrade Detective," which has been edited to a lesser length, could better deliver its agitprop satire as Gregor and Iosef repeatedly visit the American Embassy, whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men devouring a bunch of hamburgers.
The message for the imagined communist audience is that Western culture can make everything a fodder for a scholar.
The fictional Romanian creators were not wrong: We even do it with our own recent history and with theirs.
Blow to drugs mafia in the country
The police have managed to strike a blow against the Italian mafia in Baden-Württemberg.
On Wednesday morning, numerous objects were searched in the Black Forest-Baar county, in Rottweil, Konstanz, Esslingen and Stuttgart, the Konstanz prosecutor's office said on Friday.
Fifteen accused people between the ages of 25 and 77 have been arrested and arrest warrants have already been issued against them.
In addition, officials provided greater quantities of marijuana and cocaine, firearms and several hundred thousand euros.
Two people were arrested in simultaneous raids in Italy.
German arrest warrants have been issued for the two suspects, Italians.
The two are therefore likely to be extradited to Germany.
Italian and Bavarian investigators were involved in the action.
In all, over 300 police officers were deployed.
Members of the mafia are accused of organised drug-related crime, serious acts of violence, attempted murder and robbery and extortion.
Since the summer of 2016, the prosecutor's office in Konstanz has been investigating organised drug trafficking in the southern German region.
There was a lively exchange between the prosecutors in Konstanz and Palermo and the Kripo Rottweil investigators had near-daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily.
As a result, the major operation was also accompanied by four officials from Palermo on Wednesday morning.
The investigations targeted mainly Italian nationals with close ties to the Italian mafia.
An incident on May 27 in Hüfingen, where several shots were fired into a restaurant early in the morning, is also expected to go to the gang's account.
Weise laments major gaps in foreigner register
"Data from citizens who should not appear there": According to a report, the foreigner register in Germany has significant flaws.
This leads to some serious wrongdoings in asylum procedures.
The federal government's refugee management officer, Frank-Jürgen Weise, has reportedly drawn attention to large gaps in the country's central register.
Flaws in the data registered there could "lead to some serious misdecisions" in asylum procedures and deportations, Weise warned in an analysis available to the Süddeutsche Zeitung.
According to the data, the register covers 10 million people with foreign nationality, including about 5.7 million from non-EU countries.
The data is therefore managed by about 600 foreign authorities in Germany.
Because the data has not been adequately maintained, the data quality in parts has not been good so far.
In individual cases, data from 1921 had been found, "by people who are no longer alive, or by citizens who have become German citizens and should not actually appear in the register."
"Incorrect data input can significantly slow return processes," the report continues.
The statistics on departing people also cover EU citizens who do not have to leave at all.
However, such false assignments "led to a distorted debate about how to deal with expatriates," according to the analysis.
Meanwhile, the German government appears to have begun sending refugee families with children under 16 back to Italy if they have entered from there.
That's according to an internal paper from the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF), the Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung reports.
The paper therefore says the BAMF is reintroducing such procedures "concerning families with children - with the exception of infants and micro-children - to Italy since June 1, 2017."
Since late 2014, that was virtually no longer possible, according to the newspaper, citing the difficult situation on the ground.
Under the Dublin agreement, refugees are in charge of the EU state they first reach.
If a migrant travels to another EU country, that state can send him back to the country of entry.
For justification, the office is now writing: "In the meantime, reception capacity for families with underage children has increased substantially in Italy."
Italy has given guarantees for the reception and accommodation of families.
Even the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) considers these commitments to be sufficient.
Other EU countries would also send refugees back there under the Dublin agreement.
The home affairs spokesperson for the left-wing group in the Bundestag, Ulla Jelpke, criticised this decision: "Families with children are at risk of inhumane reception conditions and a threat to child welfare because of the flaws in the Italian asylum system."
ZWEITBESTES result achieved
A total of 220 litres of blood from people living in Oberreichenbach was already provided by the blood donation service for other people.
At least of the 12 citizens who were awarded on Friday.
Especially Jürgen Greule, who has now shared 50 litres of blood with his now 100 donations.
Traditionally, in the meeting of the local council, the community acknowledges the multiple willingness to donate blood.
"It's brilliant how our body is designed for this and we pay respect to donors who provide their blood for strangers, still disinterested to do so," Mayor Karlheinz Kistner underlined.
"A single blood donation helps several people," explained the head of the German Red Cross (DRC), Holger Maisenbacher, because the preserves are broken down into their components.
For example, three people could benefit from a blood donation.
At the same time, Maisenbacher reported on the actions being carried out in the spring in Oberreichenbach.
"This year, we scored the second-best result with 114 donors," the DRC Circuit Court of Appeals said.
Obviously, the switch to the theatre house just a few years ago led to higher numbers of participants.
Even before that, Thomas Bockstadt, Susanne Reichle, Sandra Schöck, Thomas Reichle and Meta Umbeer were among the multiple donors and were awarded 50 blood donations each.
Half as many book Herbert Mair and Dorothee Riexinger, while Tamara Pfrommer, Petra Schleeh, Stefanie Stoll and Uwe Vetter made 500 millilitres of their life juice ten times each.
The Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged after weak economic growth and weakening inflation tempered speculation of a rise.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain "sluggish" as it kept interest rates on family incomes in the middle of intensifying pressure.
Policymakers at the Bank's Monetary Committee (MPC) voted 6 to 2 to keep interest rates at 0.25%, with fewer members seeking an increase this month as weak economic growth weakened support for an increase.
In its quarterly inflation report, the bank reduced its 2017 growth forecasts to 1.7% and 1.6% for 2018, warning that pressure on household incomes would continue, with inflation expected to rise to just under 3% in the autumn.
But it signalled that rate rises would be needed over the next few years to rein in inflation fuelled by Brexit and it said borrowing costs may have to rise more than expected in financial markets.
Members also voted to withdraw part of the mammoth stimulus package issued a year ago after Brexit.
It will call time on the funding plan to provide cheaper funding for banks from next February, although it has been said it is now expected to provide £15 billion more under this system - with £115 billion in sterling.
Minutes after deciding the interest rate, the bank said: "In the MPC's central forecast, gross domestic product (GDP) remains weak in the short term as pressure on household real incomes continues to weigh on consumption."
On interest rates, she repeated that "some tightening of monetary policy" would be needed to cool inflation and a "slightly larger" scale than markets expect.
Markets are currently forecasting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020.
However, the bank stressed that increases would be "gradual" and "limited."
The bank's downwardly revised growth forecasts for this year and next year are in line with the 1.9 per cent and 1.7 per cent forecast in May.
It maintained its growth forecast to 1.8% in 2018.
The pound fell against the dollar and the euro after that news.
The pound fell 0.5% to $1.31, falling 0.4% to €1.11.
The decision to make no change comes after recent disappointing growth figures dampened rising expectations of a rate hike and GDP rose to 0.3 per cent in the second quarter from 0.2 per cent in the previous three months.
Growth is forecast to be 0.3 per cent in the third quarter, although it will recover slightly after the bank towards the end of the year.
The latest inflation report offered little enthusiasm for households hit by rising inflation and minor salary increases as the tightening first gets worse before it will then improve.
She added that monetary policy cannot "prevent" the drop in income over the next few years, but she added that wages will recover "significantly" at the end of their three-year forecast.
The economy is also bolstered by rising demand for UK goods, due to the weak pound, which will compensate for some of the lower consumer spending.
The decision comes a year after interest rates were cut to 0.25% last August following the shocking EU vote that caused the pound's sinking.
The bank estimates it will likely take four years for this to fully reach prices and the economy.
The call for a rate hike was up ahead of the bank's last ruling on interest rates as inflation increased pressure on hard-pressed households, with three policymakers calling for a rise to 0.5 per cent in July.
Inflation fell to 2.6 per cent last month from 2.9 per cent in June, although the bank said this was expected and it would rebound in coming months.
The bank said the excess relative to its 2% target was "entirely" attributable to the weak pound.
Andrew Montlake, director at Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: "Given the recent decline in swap rates, the mortgage market is expected to become more competitive again as lenders vow to look for business and end the year in a positive way.
The market looks particularly good for those where existing deals expire and who complete new mortgages, and many with fee-free options and low rates are becoming more popular. "
NHS (The National Health Service) to prescribe controversial HIV drug to 10,000 people
Patients will be given access to "transformative" HIV prevention treatment from September after a battle in the High Court against funding the drug in the NHS.
NHS England announced that pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), taken before intercourse, which can reduce the risk of infection in high-risk patients by around 86 per cent, is now being delivered by the health service through a first three-year study for an estimated 10,000 people.
He agreed to fund the trial after the Court of Appeal last year upheld a Supreme Court ruling that the NHS had the power to pay for the PrEP despite claiming local authorities should fund it.
The move, announced on Thursday, was hailed as an "important new intervention" by NHS England chief executive Simon Stevens, while the National Aids Trust (NAT) described this as a "crucial moment."
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to allow people to sign up and more clinics will follow in October before being introduced across England in April 2018.
Preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a consequence of HIV preparations taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
Studies have shown that PrEP significantly reduces HIV transmission in those at risk of infection.
Taking PReP before intercourse means just enough drugs are present in a person's body to prevent HIV infection.
Such drugs can be taken every day or so as early as two hours before intercourse.
Those eligible for treatment include gay or bisexual men, transsexuals and those with HIV-positive partners who have not been successfully treated.
Appropriate participants are identified in clinics who agree with the study, including men, women, transgenders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by antiretroviral treatment.
People who live in England and are registered with a family doctor can also sign up for possible participation at their local participating sex clinic.
The program will cost £10 million and NHS England signed a contract to supply the drugs this week following an international competitive procurement.
The study aims to assess the full potential of PrEP by gathering clinical evidence of how it is targeted, absorbed and implemented on a large scale.
Mr Stevens said: "This major new intervention should complement and overhaul the far-reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV.
It's another milestone in the more than three decades of progress in addressing one of humanity's greatest health challenges. '
Deborah Gold, chief executive at NAT (National Aids Trust), said: "This is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV.
PReP, when targeted at vulnerable and vulnerable people, offers the opportunity to change the English HIV epidemic.
From September, people at high risk of HIV will have access to this NHS-funded trial in England to develop a new tool that is truly individually controlled and not subject to negotiation with a partner, leading to the improvement of many, many lives.
We warmly welcome this announcement. "
Ian Green, CEO of the Terrence Higgins Trust, said: "The priority must now be for the study to be carried out quickly across the country and for no one who has a risk for HIV to be left behind.
Now that PrEP testing medicine has been procured, we are on track to protect more than 10,000 people infected with HIV. '
Sharon Hodgson, shadow health secretary, said: "The start of the PrEP process is welcome and overdue after months of delays and hesitant implementation by the government.
The evidence shows just how transformative this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transmission of this life-changing infection.
This attempt takes us one step closer to understanding the benefits of PrEP.
Now it's important that this study is carried out as quickly as possible across the country to protect individuals who are HIV-infected and that it will help bring us one step closer to ending the spread of HIV in society. '
Living the big life: Basement and clever designer tricks have turned this little Earls Court apartment into a generous home
Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, narrowed from a large house in Knightsbridge to an Earls Court apartment in 2014.
It's on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it's proof of the new design that Joanne hasn't packed and sold her bags.
"Before that, I was living in a much bigger room with my ex in Knightsbridge," says Joanne.
"I was looking for something that was comparable to my price.
I was shown this apartment in Earls Court, and she had the same high ceilings.
I fell in love with her and made an offer that day. '
Since the first visit, the 1,000 square foot apartment has been completely overtaken.
Originally a one-bedroom property with a nested layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - Joanne wanted to add storage space and an intermediate level to make the most of the generous ceiling height.
'i wanted high ceilings, big windows, lots of light.
That was my requirement, "she says.
To that end, she commissioned the architecture and design studio Duck & Shed by Erfan Azadi of Notting Hill to use the 12.5-foot-high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Joanne.
The ceiling wasn't large enough to place two rooms over each other, so the architectural challenge was to create an intermediate level to stand in.
Erfan had to think creatively to solve the default.
"The steelworks is quite complicated," he explains.
"We had to arrange the rooms in such a way that they were stacked over each other without us having to bask.
It wasn't just about building a simple platform, but laying the steel in a way that had the right height for the function up or down. '
This arrangement allowed Erfan to place two rooms in full over each other - with a lot of additional drama.
For the intermediate level, a classic copper-light window of Retrouvius looks down over the glamorous living area.
Mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program.
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre, space and light.
A short corridor is mirrored at both ends to make it work longer.
In the kitchen, the mirroring feels like a window into another room.
At the entrance, mirrored units provide space for all of Joanne's cutlery and glasses.
By perceiving a more glamorous space, the beauty of the living room can shut the kitchen if it is not used.
Foldable kitchens are nothing new.
The special thing about this one is that it's a garage door.
"A bit of engineering went into it," Erfan explains of the steel-reinforced, veneered MDF door.
'it's counterweight so when you push the door it glides very easily. '
Thanks to the clever use of space and storage space, Joanne was able to gain an extra 16 square feet, an additional bedroom and an improved layout.
"At the end of the day, you're going to sell the base area - or how your property is valued," says Erfan.
'in a rudimentary form, an estate agent will enter and perform a calculation based on floor size. '
Here, they have managed to increase floor space while using high-quality materials that give the space its luxurious advantage.
"The materials are the things that touch you and which therefore help create an emotional bond in a home," says Erfan.
'You don't fall in love with the electric sockets in the walls.
These are important but they don't play with your heart. '
It shows that an apartment can be transformed by good design and increased square footage from something more standard to something quite amazing.
In fact, like Joanne, you could choose not to leave them.
Brothers fight over a $500 million property empire
Two brothers are in a confrontation over one of Victoria's biggest property empires, worth more than $500 million, four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty.
Former director of the 'Carlton Football Club' and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a villa in Toorak, just three doors from his younger brother Paul, who took him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and business assets should be split.
Paul has wanted to withdraw from the family business since 2014, but a sharp confrontation over the separation is taking place in the Supreme Court.
Along with their mother Anna, the brothers own 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars, accumulated since the family bought a business in Smith Street, Collingwood, in 1973.
There, the Westco family founded jeans and grew into a chain of 160 retail stores.
It was sold in 1999 for US $85 million.
That money has been invested in property and De Lutis's portfolio now includes offices in the city centre, the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento, the Gold Coast and Mt Buller apartments, and shopping centres in the suburb.
Following an agreement with her late father, Colin - described by Paul as the "main operator and the dominant personality" in the De Lutis family - owns about two-thirds of the company's assets and Paul about a third.
A court file says this means Colin owns property worth $316 million and Paul worth $176 million.
The division of real estate and cash has proved a problem for Paul.
"The divisions proposed by Colin left him with what I thought were the best objects," he wrote in a first affidavit in 2015.
Last Friday, after several failed mediations, the first Supreme Court hearing took place.
The brothers are also now fighting for control of the existing business - of which Colin, as Paul claims, ruled him out.
Colin argues this is not true, but accuses Paul of incompetently managing some possessions.
In an early affidavit filed by Colin, he says he hopes to settle the dispute.
"My Italian heritage dictates that the family is the most important priority," he wrote.
Costs are rising in the case, with hundreds of pages of affidavits, emails and reports from companies including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and with leading lawyers including Allan Myers, QC, and law firms held by both sides.
Ms De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who ran milk bars and delicatessen shops dating back to the late 1950 "s and bought a shop in Brunswick in the early Seventies.
They used security to buy the Collingwood property where Colin opened the family's first jeans shop.
Colin says he started Westco there when he was "in my final years of high school when Paul was still a little kid (about 10 years old)."
Anna De Lutis says that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to pass on their property amicably to their sons.
"Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to end up in court," she wrote.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis group of companies, with Colin claiming that Mark was paid $10 million and Luke $26 million when he left the company.
Both Luke and Mark were, Paul says, "biting over the terms of their financial separation."
Colin has held back very much despite being a former AFL board member and the television star's best friend, according to a 2015 biography by Eddie McGuire.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers.
Only Colin replied by SMS to say "I really can't say much" because the case is before the courts.
"It is very, very sad that my brother Paul decided to sue me and move our family name through the courts," he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote in a letter to the court that he was trying to meet his brother's demands.
"Our father would not have wanted Paul and I to end up in our current dispute," he said, adding that he was "still hoping for a solution."
On Friday, that hope appeared to be over.
"Our matter will be resolved by the courts in the near future," Colin wrote.
Trump's new chief of staff plans to restrict the president's media abstinence.
Others have tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.
If so, he will be the first.
Politico reports that the new White House chief of staff plans to restrict the flow of information to President Trump - including news media reports - in the hope of keeping the chief on a more even course.
Here's a piece from reporter Josh Dawsey:
"When John F. Kelly, the new White House chief of staff, met with senior executives on his first day at work, he posed a major problem in President Donald Trump's White House that he wanted to fix: Bad information getting into the president's hands.
Kelly told staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in briefings - because the president would make better decisions if he received good information. "
Kelly's diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to tame Trump by overseeing his media diet.
President Trump's relationship with television stretches back decades - and now that he's in the White House, his television advertising is still strong.
"If candidate Trump was angry because of unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he received fair reporting from bodies that were trying to convince," former campaign adviser Sam Nunberg told politico in February.
Politicos Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that "the key to keeping Trump's Twitter habit under control, according to six former campaign officials, is to make sure his personal media use includes a steady stream of praise."
Fine.
But the idea that Trump's Twitter habit was ever "under control" is ridiculous.
Perhaps these campaign officials know something we don't know to others - that Trump's tweets would have contained even more ignition without their interventions.
We'll probably never know anything about the tweets Trump didn't send.
If his staff managed to keep trouble away from him several times, then their efforts paid off.
But no one has consistently been able to prevent Trump from causing controversy.
Part of the problem is that people in a White House made up of competing parties keep trying to advance their own agenda by showcasing Trump material that may promote their views of the world.
Politico - entirely preoccupied with this story - reported in May on the advisers' preference for providing dubious information to the president for strategic reasons.
This was an example described by reporter Shane Goldmacher:
"Current and former Trump officials say that Trump, like a volcano, can respond to negative press clippings, especially those with damaging leaks, and that he is sticking to finding out where these are from.
That's exactly what happened in late February, when someone maliciously gave the president a printed copy of an article from GotNews.com, the website of Internet provocateur Charles C. Johnson, accusing deputy chief of staff Katie Walsh of being "the source behind a bunch of leaks" at the White House.
Although Johnson has been permanently banned from Twitter for harassment or that he has offered no specific evidence or that he has made false allegations in the past and revoked them.
Trump read the article and began asking staff about Walsh. "
Goldmacher added that the then chief of staff, Reince Priebus, and the White House general secretary, Rob Porter, have "tried to implement a system to manage and document the paperwork Trump receives."
How did that work?
Kelly is trying to do the same three months later.
Perhaps he will prove himself a more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his advisers are still seeking influence.
These immutable factors make Kelly's mission very difficult.
Most wanted criminals get mail from Europol
As the address is unknown, the public's help is requested and hoped for.
Police across Europe are sending (virtual) postcards to dangerous criminals on the run this summer.
As the addresses of the wanted serious criminals are by their very nature not known, evidence from the population is hoped for and requested.
On Friday, Europol reported the action, which follows winter's "EU Most Wanted" advent calendar.
The experience had shown that many fleas were hiding at holiday destinations, Europol said.
We have compiled 21 postcards for wanted criminals from 21 EU countries.
Since 2016 there has been the website www.eumostwanted, more than 2.5 million times it has been viewed.
Thirty-six of the online faces have been arrested so far, at least 11 of them due to references after being posted on the website.
Travellers negotiate a ditch and return to the 'millionaires' row
Some of the West Midlands' wealthiest homeowners are once again on war footing with some determined travellers who have negotiated a ditch drawn by the community to recover a field in front of their mansions.
Travellers have parked their 20 caravans on a field outside a wealthy street of Solihull called the "millionaire row."
They have brought in horses, babies and an army of transporters after they were only thrown out in May, but without being deterred by a ditch excavated by the council to prevent their seizures.
The takeaway group found a gap in the defense facilities and pushed their vehicles through a section that remained unobstructed to find a way.
Furious residents have pressed Solihull council, which said it was "useless to deal with the problem."
An anonymous resident said: 'They moved there on Monday night after being sent on from Bentley Heath where they threw stones at the passers-by.
The Council must be forced into action by shame, as it has been useless in dealing with the problem.
The travellers were there in May, were moved on and are now back.
More arrived last night, probably more today. '
She added: "Birmingham council knows how to deal with this by keeping long instructions to protect their parks.
I live on Streetsbrook Road and I'm not happy to continue paying my council tax if the council can't even stop it. '
One local resident, who did not want to be named, said: "It's ridiculous, we've only just seen the last round of these travellers just to be plundered by another round.
The numbers have increased this time and you've even seen a horse in the park area. '
A spokeswoman for Solihull Council said: "We are aware of an unauthorised camp in the countryside beyond Streetsbrook Road and are working with Solihulls police and we are taking the necessary legal action to ensure they move on as soon as possible.
To support our evidence collection, it is very important that as many residents as possible report anti-social or criminal behaviour to the police by calling 101.
This helps create a picture of the situation where the court has to consider when we present our case. '
From Birkenhof, Waldhotel Luise
The Waldhotel Luise is from the former Hotel Birkenhof.
The house at the gates of Freudenstadts is currently being renovated and is due to reopen on March 1 next year.
This is good news for the city.
With the closure of the Hotel Birkenhof by the then Ambiente Betriebsgesellschaft mbH as of 13 April 2014, around 30 000 overnight stays a year were lost and also income from the tourist tax.
In the fall of 2014, in the face of dramatically rising numbers of refugees coming to the county, the hotel building was offered to the estate as a collection shelter, causing controversial discussions.
The city prevented the accommodation of asylum seekers by drawing up a plan to secure the area as a hotel site.
The decision was not uncontroversial in the local council at the time.
But Freudenstadden's Lord Mayor Julian Osswald in particular defended the hotel site and spoke of serious interested parties at the house even then.
He should be right.
The group Luisenhotels with CEO Birgit Scherer, based in Bad Bergzabern, acquired the former Hotel Birkenhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it a three-star-plus-category house under the name Waldhotel Luise.
The group has four houses with the Freudenstadt object.
Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Herrenalb.
They are called Hotel Luise, Luisenpark, Parkhotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise.
At the former Hotel Birkenhof, there have been building shuttles in front of the entrance for quite some time, and when you enter the house, it becomes clear what extensive renovations are being carried out.
Floors were ripped out, ceilings partially dismantled, old bathtubs removed from the rooms.
The entire hotel building is a single construction site.
There is still a lot of work to be done by March.
"It's actually a nice hotel," says Thomas Scherer, speaking to our newspaper.
Everything is to be renewed in the Black Forest style.
The rooms are equipped with large walk-in showers, the entrance area is redesigned, new windows are built in.
Everything should later become "beautifully bourgeois," as Thomas Scherer puts it.
'We want to make a piece of jewellery out of it. '
A swimming pool, a wellness area and a meeting room are among the facilities.
You don't want to position yourself at the high level of hotels in Lauterbad, but already at an upscale downtown level, Scherer points out.
The Waldhotel Luise, with its about 60 rooms, wants to set out wide, Scherer further explains.
Individual holidaymakers, groups or business people should feel at ease in the hotel.
He has already held talks with OB Julian Osswald and tourism director Michael Krause, according to Scherer.
The city's ideas are in line with those of the hotel group.
'We're on the same line. '
Asked about the level of investment, Thomas Scherer doesn't want to set out exactly.
Just under €1 million, he reckons.
The exteriors are also brought to the front, which is already clearly visible.
A large terrace is created in a patio, which will be accessible from the restaurant, which is open to the public.
Thomas Scherer is optimistic: "Freudenstadt is a good market."
Russia affair: Us special agent sets up Grand Jury
In the Russia affair involving US President Donald Trump, special agent Robert Mueller is said to have set up a so-called grand jury, according to a report.
The panel has begun work in recent weeks, the Wall Street Journal wrote, citing people familiar with the matter.
The newspaper claimed the move was a sign that Mueller had expanded and intensified its investigation.
The CNN reported that there are already initial subpoenas from the panel related to a meeting between Trump's eldest son and a Russian lawyer.
U.S. intelligence agencies have long blamed the Kremlin for purposefully interfering with the 2016 presidential campaign.
Mueller is investigating whether there was collusion between Trump's campaign team and Moscow.
The investigation will focus on several men who acted as advisers to the Republican during the campaign.
According to reports, Mueller also more and more took a look at Trump's private and business environment.
The Washington Post wrote a few weeks ago that the special agent had personally brought Trump to the center and was investigating the allegation of whether the president may have obstructed justice in the wake of the affair.
The main task of Grand Jurys is to examine present evidence in potential criminal cases and to decide whether charges should be brought.
Grand juries are therefore also called prosecution chambers.
They are mostly turned on when they are major and controversial cases.
The procedure always takes place behind closed doors.
The panel can also be turned on by the prosecution to charge people for questioning under oath.
According to CNN, subpoenas have already been issued that revolve around the encounter between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer.
People involved in the meeting were asked to make a statement, the report said.
They should also provide documents.
In addition to Trump Jr., Trump's adviser and son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and his former campaign chief, Paul Manafort, were also at the conversation.
Legal experts said on US television on Thursday night that the establishment showed that Mueller was not intimidated in his work and that, if necessary, he wanted to act quickly.
However, it does not necessarily have to mean that the grand jury will end up being turned on to decide on the imposition of a charge.
Still, the establishment of the panel is the start of a new phase in the investigations and a new cause for concern for President Trump.
Amid the new revelations, the president used a speech in West Virginia on Thursday night to portray the Russia affair as a campaign by his political opponents.
"The Russia story is a total invention," Trump said.
The issue gives Democrats a way to "feel good because they have nothing else they can talk about."
His special counsel, Ty Cobb, said in an opinion that he knew nothing about the establishment of a grand jury.
But this also usually works in secret, he pointed out.
The White House is in favor of any action that accelerated the work of the special investigator in a "fair" way.
Former FBI chief James Comey has said three times that it is not investigating the president.
There was no reason to believe that anything had changed, the statement added.
But Mueller was only used after Trump fired Comey.
Because of that crackdown, allegations were made against Trump that he wanted to obstruct justice.
Comey told a Senate committee in June that Trump had asked him to stop the investigation against then-national security adviser Michael Flynn.
The president is under intense pressure over the investigation.
After representing US media, the White House collected material against the special agent and his associates.
That sparked speculation about whether Trump wanted to sack Mueller.
Unlike an independent congressional special investigator, such as in the Watergate affair of President Richard Nixon, who later resigned, Mueller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired by the Justice Department at the president's insistence.
Several senators from both parties, however, want to prevent such a move.
Two groups of Republican and Democratic senators on Thursday presented draft legislation under which the special agent could no longer be so easily dismissed.
Antarctica: Gigantic iceberg drives in Antarctica
In West Antarctica, a gigantic iceberg of just under seven times the size of Berlin has been solved by the chasm.
The Bremerhavener Alfred Wegener Institute of Polar and Marine Research announced Wednesday.
The colossus, which is over a trillion tons and 5800 square miles, is now tying north and will probably take two or three years to molten.
At 175 kilometres in length and a width of up to 50 kilometres, it is one of the largest ice giants researchers have registered in the past three decades.
A danger to people doesn't go away from him.
The extent to which climate change has played a role in breaking the iceberg is unclear, according to research data.
Overall, however, there has been a series of unusual collapses of ice shells in the region for about 30 years, the US Research Center for Snow and Ice (NSIDC) writes in a factual background.
According to many researchers, this may be linked to global warming.
The colossus, which has now been aborted, has so far been a part of the Larsen C shotgun.
Schelfeis floats on the sea and is fed by large glaciers.
It thus grows further and further into the sea and breaks down regularly.
The Larsen-C-Schelfeis is located south of South America almost at the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula.
North of this cul-de-sac, the balance of waxes and breakdowns was disrupted a few years ago.
A complete shaft has disintegrated there, writes AWI researcher Daniela Jansen.
There is some evidence that the Larsen C scarf is also in danger, because the front edge has never retreated as far as it currently does.
In addition, the ice sheet is under tension and can disintegrate if a piece breaks down at a key point.
The melting of shellfish and iceberg does not increase sea levels as they swim on the water and ice squeezes as much water as it produces after melting itself.
However, the loss of the shellfish causes the glaciers to flow directly into the sea and drain much faster than before.
This could possibly increase sea levels, but only to a small extent, writes the UK's research project for the observation of Antarctica (Midas).
The Larsen-C shellfish is the fourth-largest chunk of Antarctica, with nearly 50,000 square kilometres, according to AWI data.
On the transition from the mainland it is up to 700 metres thick, at the front edge to the free ocean around 200 metres.
It breaks down there on a regular basis.
"Although it is a natural event and we are not aware of any direct link to climate change, the ice sheet is now in a more vulnerable position," said Martin O'Leary of Britain's Swansea University.
"This is the most widespread withdrawal since records began," he also confirmed.
Among scientists, it is controversial whether the Larsen C shellfish will now grow again or go back in the long term and may fade together, said his colleague Adrian Luckman, adding: "Our models say it will be less stable."
But this development will take decades.
Although these researchers do not attribute the demolition of this gigantic iceberg to climate change, a great many ice shells of the Antarctic Peninsula have disintegrated in recent decades.
This long goat of Antarctica stretches towards South America.
According to data from the British Antarctic Survey research programme, the Antarctic Peninsula's ice surface has declined by 28,000 square kilometres since the 1950s.
The decline has contributed to the rise in temperature.
The Antarctic Peninsula has been warming by around three degrees over the past 50 years, making it one of the areas where the temperature is rising fastest.
CDU wants house tariff on staff
Because it is becoming increasingly difficult to fill vacant positions, the CDU is calling for it to step out of the employers' association to become more attractive.
It wasn't until just before the summer recess that the county swept through 41 new posts in administration.
More than 1100 employees and civil servants work for the district administration in Mettmann.
Now, once again, 17 apprentices have had their first day at work.
The apprenticeships at the circle seem to be very coveted.
Some 620 applications were made for the places to be awarded this year.
Yet the county still lacks staff to cope with the increased demands and tasks.
At present, there are still 50 unfilled vacancies at Mettmann County.
They are looking for, among other things, doctors and engineers as well as forces of general administration.
The CDU would now like to take the initiative in the day, together with the FDP and the UWG, and counter the skills shortage in the administration.
The administration is expected to "work out a concept for recruitment and personnel development" at the request of the parties.
The aim is not only to meet short-term needs for skilled workers, but to counteract the shortage of candidates for the future, it says.
The overall approach should be oriented internally and externally, identify concrete measures for cross-entry and include a training offensive, the CDU, FDP and UWG demand.
That sounds like a good approach.
Because the county is dealing with staff problems that you didn't know in the past.
Other cities recruit good officials and employees and offer more attractive terms.
There is talk of real 'competition between public employers'.
This includes a high number of staff leaving the service due to illness or age.
It is high time for action, therefore, so that no more jobs are left unfilled.
But Klaus-Dieter oples, group leader of the CDU, is still going beyond the joint motion with his party.
He recently caused a frenetic surprise back in the day when he publicly questioned staff cost coverage and stunned the rest of the parties.
Peoples want all the options that make it possible to leave the local employers' association to be reviewed.
"If we do not come up with a satisfactory solution in the short term, the county administration should aim for a house tariff with the trade unions, perhaps also in cooperation with the circling cities," said Peoples.
In so doing, the CDU is trying to pay employees and civil servants better than the tariff regime for the public service actually provides for.
Salaries are currently exactly prescribed, and increases or more money are only available if you switch to a higher level based on professional years.
But the county's tasks have grown more and more in recent years.
Only a few weeks ago, new rooms had to be set up in which employees take care of the provisions of the new Prostitutes "Protection Act.
Not least due to the increasing number of asylum seekers, Councillor Thomas Hendele and County Director Martin Richter have a problem: They have too few staff.
Italy tightens tone on NGO migrant rescue boats
Italy has warned NGOs using rescue boats for migrants in the Mediterranean that they will not be allowed to continue this if they do not abide by new rules governing their operations.
"If NGOs don't sign a new code of conduct, it's difficult to see how they can continue working," Interior Minister Marco Minniti said in an interview with Turin daily La Stampa.
Minnitis's warning came a day after the Italian authorities seized a boat from the German charity 'Youth Retained' because their team had effectively cooperated with traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration.
The charity, which has only been in operation for a year, declined to comment on detailed allegations made by Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.
"For us, saving human life is and remains our number one priority, so we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment," the organization said in a statement on social media.
'We can only assess any allegations that are currently being made after we have gathered all the information and can assess the situation. '
The Italian authorities had been monitoring the 'Youth Retained' boat, the Iuventa, since October.
It is believed his crew are taking tugboat migrants on board, which are delivered to them directly by traffickers, and that the smugglers can take off so the ships can be used again.
At least one such gathering reportedly took place just 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast, according to the prosecutor's file, the contents of which were published by Italian media.
The crew are suspected of flouting the authority of the Italian coast guard, which oversees rescue operations in the zone on humanitarian grounds rather than any other motives.
Under the code of conduct, boats such as the Iuventa must primarily have an Italian police officer on board overseeing their activities.
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have so far agreed to abide by the code: Save the Children, Moas from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain.
The latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be seen as unnecessary but acceptable as they would not involve "substantial changes or obstructions" to their bailouts.
Among those who refuse to sign is the Nobel Prize-winning organization Doctors Without Borders (MSF).
Minniti has now said that the number of migrants arriving in Italy following the rescue measures has fallen sharply in recent weeks, suggesting that efforts to strengthen the Libyan coastguard and work with local mayors have borne fruit.
"Over the last few days we have started to see light at the end of the tunnel," the minister said.
He announced plans for further talks with Libyan mayors this month on economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving those countries in the hope of reaching Europe.
Rises and Trials
Nine Weilermer bikers, the "Berlin outpost" and two guest drivers met in Wachenheim in the northern Palatinate to enjoy trials and sights for four days.
Three friendly guides were available for this.
The accommodation in the Wachenheim valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours.
The castle and wine festival of Wachenheim was a welcome extra.
The first tour led in hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Michaelskapelle above Deidesheim.
Vantage points followed, partly on towers, from which one could look far beyond the Pfälzer Forest and the upstream plains.
There have always been longer rises in between, for which long trials have been rewarded.
On the second day we went to Bad Dürkheim to the Saline and the Volksfest Wurstmarkt.
Once again, vantage point reignited at vantage point, connected by "floundering" trials and moderate rises.
On the last two days there were again many meters of altitude.
Caves, rocks, towers, castles, ruins and return huts brought welcome breaks.
In Bad Dürkheim, the bikers breathed healing brine in the open-air inhalatory.
New Town was also fired.
After 173 kilometres and almost 4500 metres of altitude, the group had met the Pfälzer Forest at its best - sporting and cultural.
Console instead of pitch - Bundesliga gears up for e-sports
Are the sport stars sitting in front of computer consoles in the future instead of struggling through the stadium pitch in the wind and weather?
The fact is, e-sports has long become a serious industry, a lucrative business - big stars, millions of fans and huge tournaments with high gales included.
This has also been recognised by the first Bundesliga clubs, which are increasingly involved in this area.
The start was made by VfL Wolfsburg in 2015, followed by FC Schalke 04 and most recently VfB Stuttgart, which founded an e-sports department in mid-July and signed two pros for the FIFA 17 computer game.
"We hope this will inspire entirely new young target groups for the VfB," says CEO Jochen Röttgermann.
He is sure "a number of clubs are still going up on this train."
Next weekend, the FIFA World Cup in London will be organising the first "Interactive Club World Cup," where the gamers of various clubs will compete against each other.
In addition to Schalke and Wolfsburg, for example, Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain or PSV Eindhoven have qualified.
Robin Dutt also sees great potential in e-sports.
The former coach of Bayer Leverkusen and Werder Bremen is now advising an agency for virtual football players.
"Real football has to deal in particular with the 14 to 30-year-olds that young people are still going to the stadium in the future," says the 52-year-old.
And: The clubs were trying to conquer all sorts of markets, especially the Asian ones.
With prominent e-athletes under contract, you could be present in these markets far more often online than just sending the Bundesliga team to Asia once a year.
What exactly is at stake?
In e-sports, computer games such as "League Of Legends," "Dota 2," "Counterstrike" or just the football simulation FIFA are challenged at competitive level.
Leagues have long been established, as in normal sport, where the pros compete against each other.
And at the 2022 Asian Games, e-sports is already part of the official program.
But is it a proper sport at all?
For many, the notion is certainly ordinary.
Ingo Frobevil has also been grappling with the question for a long time.
For the professor at the German Sports School in Cologne, e-sports is a sport because it is competitive and shows many biological and physical reactions that are also found in classical sport - for example, increased heart rates, stress reactions, hormonal changes.
It also requires cognitive skills, a technical and tactical understanding and rapid responsiveness.
Professional gamers should train not only at the console but also their bodies and pay attention to the diet.
"The fit player is a good player." "
But Frobous also sees problems: "Doping is becoming more of an issue."
Controls were difficult to implement in online games, and the scene lacked the structures of classic sport.
On the positive side, the scientist highlights the high integrative effect of e-sports.
The players are travelling internationally, this is like a big global family, there are no intercultural barriers.
A study by the consultancy Deloitte and the Federal Association of Interactive Entertainment Software (Biu) says the e-sport is experiencing rapid growth.
In 2016, this meant that 50 million euros had been implemented in Germany, mainly through advertising, sponsorship and major tournaments.
In three years, sales are expected to reach 130 million.
This, though, is little against the Football League's nearly €2.4 billion.
However, e-sports is "no longer far from the other established sports such as handball, basketball or ice hockey," the Deloitte advisers write.
Internationally, many countries are already on.
Major markets are Asia and the United States, where former basketball player Shaquille O'Neal and baseball star Alex Rodriguez participate in U.S. team NRG eSports.
Hollywood actor Ashton Kutcher invests in the eSport betting company Unikrn.
There are a lot of things happening in Europe, too.
In a Norwegian school, e-sports was introduced as a teaching subject, says Frobevil.
In the Netherlands and France, football first-team clubs are now obliged to set up an e-sports department, according to Mr Dutt.
"In the European comparison, Germany is lagging behind," explains VfB CEO Röttgermann.
Just falling into nostalgia, and clearing the old days, is no longer enough today.
It is about preserving the tradition of the club, but at the same time aligning the company in the modern market.
"We live in a digitised world," Mr Dutt also says.
'Because you can't hold on to the fact that only when it comes to football everything stays the way it always was. '
Poison eggs ade - The egg alternatives to cooking and baking
Almost all states are now affected by the scandal over poison-contaminated eggs.
Aldi South and Aldi Nord have responded, removing all eggs from sale across Germany.
Only eggs that have been shown to contain no fipronil are to be taken to the shelves.
Michelle Carter convicted of the texts urging Conrad Roy to commit suicide
A Massachusetts woman was sentenced to two-and-a-half years for encouraging her boyfriend to commit suicide through texts and calls.
Michelle Carter, now 20, will spend 15 months of her conviction behind bars and five years have been suspended.
Carter was convicted in June of negligent homicide of Conrad Roy, who took his own life on July 13, 2014.
Mr Roy's father told the hearing on Thursday: "My family is uncomforting.
My son was my best friend. '
Carter was allowed to remain free pending appeal.
She had faced a maximum sentence of 20 years but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy suffered from mental illness.
Dressed in red trousers and a cream-coloured blouse, Carter stood there with tears in her eyes, with folded hands and downward-facing eyes as she was sentenced.
"Her actions killed Conrad Roy," the prosecutor told the court.
"She ended his life to make her own better.
She took no responsibility, "she said.
'she's shown no remorse. '
But Carter's attorney said it was a "terrible circumstance she completely regrets."
However, Judge Lawrence Moniz said he did not find out that her "age or maturity, or even her mental illness, has a significant impact on her actions."
A prosecutor read a statement from Roy's mother, Lynn Roy, who said there was "not a day when I'm not praying the loss of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and how I deal with everything; I try to be there for his sisters, despite all my pain that we will carry with us for eternity, "it says.
Roy's sister, Camdyn Roy, said she was "tracked" by the realisation that she would never attend her brother's wedding or be an aunt for his children.
"No longer having this single person I've been with every day since I was born is a pain I will always keep with me for the rest of my life," she said.
The case seems set to set a legal precedent as there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to ask another to commit suicide.
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead from carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle in 2014.
The case drew national attention after Carter's text messages revealed she had encouraged him to end his life.
"Hang up, spring from a building, create yourself, I don't know, there are many ways," she said in several messages she sent in the two weeks before his death while on holiday with his family.
In the moments before his suicide, she wrote, "You have to do it, Conrad" and "All you have to do is turn the generator on and you'll be free and happy."
Judge Moniz said that Carter sought attention through the death of Roy and ordered that she should benefit from the case through any press.
The case has divided legal opinion.
Among the few who defended Carter was Amanda Knox, who was convicted of murdering her British co-worker in Italy in 2007 before being acquitted two years ago.
Ms. Knox, aged 30, published a comment in the Los Angeles Times: "Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help, not jail."
Joshua kimmich: Learning from FC Bayern's new mini-Lahm
The fact that Joshua was allowed to run as captain at the Audi Cup is no accident.
FC Bayern are mourning the Confed Cup winner a big season - extra motivation is not damaging there.
Something was different in his place in the cabin, which saw Joshua kimme immediately, even if the extra garment was very, very small.
But as far and wide on the second day of the Audi Cup, of course, no Philipp Lahm and no Manuel Neuer could be seen, he made the binge assigned to him to the arm.
"The coach didn't announce it," the Confed Cup winner told me afterwards, after his first effort as Bayern captain.
Well, the stand could have been better than at 0-2 against the SSC Naples.
But the sign from the coach could also indicate kimme like that.
Not the eight-year-old Arturo Vidal had been chosen as a game leader in the C-Elf, made up of youth players, debutants and just out of holiday, but he.
You'd love to distribute sugar to those you trust a lot, who you want to keep at a whim.
So if you've been chosen to take on the legacy of Lahm, you can only use a little extra motivation well.
Kimmich confirmed: "That's what you want as a player: Take responsibility."
On Wednesday, the 22-year-old flopped across the field as a mini-Lahm.
Right back, that's now his position, the white binge on the arm did its rest.
And at all, in this starting formation, kimmich acted like the one who can best take the helm as well.
He gave instructions, trying to steer the inept force.
He had the gaze for the whole thing, while many others were busy with himself.
Vidal with overplaying his lack of fitness (barely scrambled); Renato Sanches with connecting on devils come out to the achievements of the Asia trip (also hinged only partially); and Sebastian Rudy and Niklas Southern with not falling negative in their first appearance in the Bayern jersey.
That, after all, worked out quite well.
Southern ran alongside kimmich, Rudy in front of the defence, and both were sovereign.
The well-known Napoli Storm were frequently struggling, and Southern also tried to be successful a couple of times in the build-up to the game.
His colleague Mr Rudy, though, admitted the result was "not as we hoped."
But he also showed a decent performance on debut.
Game shifting, change of pace: "I was picked for that style, too."
How unfamiliar this Bayern world still is for the new entrants was seen following the game.
Rudy, for instance, didn't give one or two in the catacombs, but determined six or seven interviews.
Kimmich passed away after a few crisp statements in the back of his new fellow players.
There, he heard an interesting phrase from Southern: "What's going on here, I've noticed now.
At Bayern you just have to win every game. ""
After all, he no longer has to teach the new.
Alaba motivates ÖFB ladies
David Alaba believes in the success of our ÖFB ladies
Austria's most famous footballer has reported on Twitter just before the game and wished the ÖFB ladies well.
The Bavarian Legionnaire is almost a club-mate of ÖFB captain Schnaderbeck and fiddles with our Ladys.
The tweet from the Austrian football player of the year and Champions League winner should be a special motivational injection.
Our ladies might well need the famous Bayern-Dusel as well.
Company happy with Rhineland-Palatinate minister: Economy praises Wissing's pace
It was often irreconcilable, the relationship between the country and the regional economy, when Eveline Lemke (Green) was still the economy minister of Rhineland-Palatinate.
This is evident after more than a year in which the new economy minister, Volker Wissing (FDP), is in office.
Chambers and businesses from the region speak on T V's question of a change in economic policy - and, at the same time, blame the old minister.
Frank natus, chairman of the Association of Trier Companies (VTU), says, "Wissing takes up the wishes of the economy, which Lemke has all blocked."
Natus sees the biggest U-turn in infrastructure policy: The leak of highway 1 between Kelberg and Adenau is now high on the country's list of priorities.
Later this year, the ministry hopes to launch a planning process, and the construction law will be in place by 2021.
A role in the country's plans is also played by the western bypass of Trier, which is in urgent need of the federal transport route plan.
The aim is to put the route into operation in December 2020, says ministry spokeswoman Cornelia Holtmann.
Natus sees it as a signpost to prop up regional but internationally competing companies.
The Chamber of Commerce and Industry (IHK) Trier is seeking a Rhineland-Palatinate label on wine, as suggested by Wissing, to increase sales in supermarkets and halt the trend of the German wine export, which has been slowing for ten years.
In addition, Wissing has an open ear for people who want to start their own company, the IHK praises.
The Trier Chamber of Crafts sees the new master bonus as an additional incentive for young apprentices, says managing director Matthias Schwalbach.
There will be a premium of €1000 for the passing master test and €2500 if graduates become self-employed within ten years of the master's training.
However, the homework list for the country remains long.
In the planned road construction, facts are quickly to be created, at the same time the country lacks the necessary personnel, says Jan Glockauer, chief executive of IHK Trier.
Of 56 new engineers that Wissing plans to hire at the state-run Mobility, only 29 posts have been filled so far.
IHK is calling for more orders to be awarded to external offices.
CDU group vice-president Christian Baldauf points to calculations by the Court of Auditors that the country is investing more than €20 million less in maintaining national roads in 2017 and 2018 than proposed.
Frank natus also expects a concept of the country as it seeks to address skills shortages in the region.
The previous broadband expansion in the country was also sobering.
In 2016, regional companies only rated network supply at the grade of 3.4 in an IHK survey.
They complained about stockpiling internet connections and breakdowns.
Former Business Secretary Eveline Lemke, on the other hand, is out of politics right now and still sits on the supervisory board of wind power company Pro Wind.
The Green group left Lemke for April to become president of a private college in Karlsruhe - where she already cleared the field again after four months because of disagreements.
Audi to change 850,000 diesel vehicles - automakers face a backlash
A day before Audi's announcement, BMW said it would offer to update the software in more than 350,000 vehicles.
The BMW chairman said the company believes "there are smarter options than driving restrictions," referring to European cities - including Munich, where BMW is based - to ban or restrict diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it would modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions.
None of the companies described the ventures as a recall.
European carmakers have strongly promoted the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with carbon dioxide emissions rules.
But the nitrogen oxides that emit diesel engines are considered carcinogens and can cause asthma.
The cost to carmakers of installing plants to neutralize the fumes emitted by diesel vehicles is also increasing, making it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also charged with chugging the powerful car firms and ignoring signs of the problem.
The companies are trying to avoid Volkswagen's mistakes, which include the use of so-called shutdown devices that could regulate emissions to comply with regulations when a car has been tested but go back in normal driving conditions.
Several Volkswagen employees have been indicted in the United States, while others are being investigated on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former head of thermodynamics in Audi's engine development was arrested in Germany.
The former manager, Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio, is Italian and is therefore not protected from extradition and could face trial in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi became involved in German criminal investigations at Volkswagen after the authorities accused Audi of installing a system to circumvent emissions regulations in Europe, and a request focused on the United States was expanded.
The inclusion of Audi in the investigation could weigh heavily on Volkswagen: The luxury carmaker contributes disproportionately to Volkswagen's profit.
This message has the float on the Isar on Saturday
The city wants to protect the Isar.
In order for the Isar visitors to take part as well, a float passes through Munich tomorrow Saturday, which has a special message.
If you take it to the Isar again on Saturday, you will see a big float there between Flaucher and Reichenbachbrücke.
And this is not a common float, with Isar tourists.
But the construction company wants to educate.
On the raft you can see a large infotransparent.
It shows a rubbish mountain.
The start of a publicity campaign to appeal to the Isar visitors.
With the motto "True Love is..." aims to sharpen the understanding of the Isar as a protective wild river.
Last summer the raft drove over the Isar and again this year there are other actions and measures to achieve considerate and environmentally conscious behaviour.
Mordillos Knollennasen and the laughter against the suffering
At times, Mordillo was one of the most-published cartoon characters, and his characters "growls are his trademark.
Even at 85, the Argentine is still recording and working on a film.
His message: Laugh, "because there's too much suffering in the world."
Guillermo Mordillo was born in Buenos Aires on August 4, 1932, as the son of Spanish immigrants.
In his early years as an artist, he proposed himself as a character for congratulatory cards, among other things - which frustrated him.
"The happiest day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job," he once said.
After stops in Lima, New York and Paris, he made the breakthrough in the late 1960s: With the release of his cartoons in "Paris Match" and then also in the "Stern" and other leading magazines around the world.
Even in China, Mordillo found many fans.
The artist was always inspired by cities.
Large, rundown Mordillo figures tumble in drawings with the Leaning Tower of Pisa, Big Ben in London and Red Square in Moscow.
In the early morning, according to his own data, he still sits at the drawing table today, working nearly ten hours a day.
Through calendars, puzzles, books for big and small, T-shirts, plumes and watches, his droll characters continue to find a lot of spread around the world.
He has also been working on a cartoon and a TV series with his characters for six years.
The main person in the film "Crazy Island" is a giraffe - Mordillos's most popular animal in his drawings - who has a thousandth as an opponent.
For the first time, his characters are speaking in the 3D film, which is due to come to the cinema screen in 2019.
"I don't know exactly what they're going to say, it's weird for me," Mordillo says.
The script is not written by him.
That's why he is more likely to rely on the TV series, which, like his original drawings, is produced in a wordless manner.
Lavender from Provence threatened by climate change
It has become a symbol of Provence in southern France, but there is a warning that it is at risk of climate change.
The lavender is in decline because of conditions reminiscent of drought and because of the disease-carrying insects, causing major headaches for scientists and farmers trying to find solutions.
Eric Chaisse, an expert at the CRIEPPAM agricultural research institute in Provence, said: "The lavender in Provence is effectively at risk because in recent years the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change, which has brought much less rain in the spring and much more in the autumn.
This has an impact on the lifespan of lavender.
There's also a small cicade, a micro-bacterium that transmits dwarf cicades, and in very dry weather there are a lot of them. '
And the stakes are high.
Lavender oil not only attracts holidaymakers, it's also very much in demand for perfume and cosmetics.
Eric Chaisse said: 'Instead of having very long plant clocks with a large number of flowers, we have smaller, underdeveloped and either missing or weakened.
So we have fewer parts with essential oil. '
Solutions being considered include better water distribution and slowing evaporation from the soil, but also spraying the plants with a protective mix of clay and water and developing varieties that are more resilient to drought.
The town of Geisa in Rhön, Thuringia, is celebrating its 1200 th anniversary this year.
The festival is held this Saturday and Sunday with a medieval festival.
Crow, ignition, traders, vagants or a country ski camp are to be experienced in the city centre these days.
The murder of a journalist underscores the growing threat in Mexico
Staff at the weekly Riodoce normally meet on Wednesdays to review their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the state of Sinaloa by organized crime, corrupt officials and ceaseless drug wars.
But that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security.
They have been told it is important to change their routines.
Two senior journalists discuss what feels safer: They are supposed to take their children to the office, who were the target of an attack with grenades in 2009, or leave them at home.
Security experts have written three words on a table on the front of the room: Opponents, neutrals, allies.
They ask reporters to suggest names for each column - no proof is needed, perceptions and abdominal feelings are enough.
There are drug smugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists suspected of being on the government or cartels payroll, a catalogue of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous.
There is no respite from the violence, and while bodies are mounting across the country, more and more journalists are in attendance: At least 25 since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012, with 589 under federal protection after attacks and threats and so far this year there have been at least seven deaths in seven states.
Among the latter is her editor and her inspirator of Riodoce, the co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.
"The biggest mistake is living in Mexico and being a journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs.
His absence is deeply felt, though his presence is everywhere - a large photo of Valdez showing off his middle finger with the word "Justice" hangs on the facade of the Riodoce building, with two reporters in the 1930s, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wearing T-shirts showing off his smiling face with glasses or his typical panamahut.
The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and reporters discuss their shared themes, trauma, nightmares, sleeplessness, paranoia.
Although a probe federal prosecutor's office was set up in 2010 to handle the cases of journalists, it has opened only two criminal cases, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists.
As with most thousands of murders linked to drug trafficking and organised crime each year, the killers of journalists are rarely brought to justice.
At Riodoce, they still insist on treating the violence of Sinaloa, even though they are uncomforting and although the terrain is now even more treacherous.
With no information about the killers, without justice, the meeting to discuss security has little benefit, Ibarra says.
"It's very stupid to waste my time in this workshop," he says.
'as long as we don't know the Why, we distrust everyone. '
On the morning of May 15, Valdez left the office of the Riodoce newspaper in the state capital of Culiacan.
He only managed to drive a few blocks wide before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men; he was forced out of his car and shot at him 12 times, presumably because of the newspaper's name - which translates to "Twelfth River."
The shooter drove away in his car and damaged it nearby.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He left behind a wife and two adult children.
Rumours tend to fly around freely in Culiacan.
But there is virtually nothing but silence on the subject of Valdez.
Since Guzman's arrest last year and extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa has become one of the country's bloodiest battlefields as rival factions here fight to fill the vacuum.
It doesn't make sense that in Sinaloa, someone or several people are shot on the street every day, or that the cemetery is full of ornate, two-story mausoleums for drug kings that are bigger than many houses for the living.
Forget for a minute that there is a state of "calm" when only one cartel has control of the coastal state, with its valuable ports and drugs trade routes to the United States.
Still, and despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, is broken with guilt for failing to protect his friend.
He believes two misunderstandings contributed to the murder.
First, in February, there was the release of an interview with Damaso Lopez, a leader of one of the rival cartel factions at war with Guzman's sons.
This release may have angered the sons, and suspected gangmembers bought every copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to newspaper kiosks.
The second mistake was not to compel Valdez to leave the country for his own safety after seizing another newspaper that had published the same story.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is seen as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists.
He had survived for so long that his friends and colleagues assumed he would always be there.
He served as an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003 when he joined five colleagues to set up Riodoce and sold $50 holdings.
In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to pursue journalism without encountering the narcotics problem," Bojorquez said.
Over time, the newspaper earned a reputation for bold and honest reporting, and sales and advertising increased.
Reporters loved being able to publish hard-hitting investigations without fear of censorship, and readers were intrigued by a publication in which they could read stories no one else dared to deal with.
Eight years after the founding of Riodoce, she received the prestigious "Maria Moors Cabot Prize" for her reporting in Latin America.
That same year, Valdez won the Committee to Protect Journalists' International Press Freedom Award for his courage in pursuing Mexican drug history wherever she went.
He voluntarily admitted he was afraid.
"I want to live on," he said at the time of the CPJ award.
Drug trafficking in Sinaloa "is a way of life," he said in an interview with Rompeviento-TV last October.
'You have to take on the task that falls to you as a journalist - either that or you play the stupid.
I don't want to be asked, 'What did you do in the face of so many totals... why didn't you say what was going on?'
The Riodoce team missed Valdez, the fun bird who could curse like a dockworker, the friend who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.
They relied on his routine.
He would always wear his hat.
He would always go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, and always sit at the same table there.
Now they ask: Was his love of routine his spoil?
His death has also forced them to question their own assumptions about how best to do their job and stay alive in the process.
"They don't like dealing with their women, their children, their clean shops, their secretive runways" to move drugs.
"These things were not allowed," Bojorquez said.
The result, even in the best of times, is a high degree of self-censorship and self-preservation.
Trust his own instincts.
If it smells wrong, stay away from it.
The trouble is, said the editor of the Riodoce Andres Villarreal, that "smell is a sense that can be misled... and then things happened to Javier."
The old rules, as he and others say, no longer apply in Sinaloa - just as they do in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states where a toxic mix of lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home.
The landscape is constantly changing.
No cell phones were suddenly allowed in the room where Riodoce's employees met for security training, and days earlier it was announced that spyware, sold exclusively to governments, was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.
Outside, two police officers sought shelter from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shade of a tree.
They were commissioned by the state government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-storey building in a middle-class neighborhood of Culiacan.
Half in the joke, some of the reporters wondered if these officers were among the 50 percent of police officers the governor himself described as untrustworthy.
It's been months since reporters went to the mountain landscape, where drug gangs are de facto under control.
For this week's issue, Riodoce has leaned on three main stories.
There was the murder of the brother of former well-known boxer Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.
They also had an exposé on government spending focused on the governor's hometown.
And there was a group that carried out a kidnapping at one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the prosecutor's office.
There was no official word on who was kidnapped or how it happened, so caution was required when it came time to write what everyone in the city knows: That the restaurant is a favourite local of drug traffickers and authorities.
A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician belonging to the ruling Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), which ruled all political levels for nearly the entire century.
Several PRI governors have recently been accused of high-profile cases of corruption.
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in that local area, including one in which a son of "El Chapo" Guzman escaped a military assault.
Just a few months earlier, readers would have viewed Valdez's column as the best-informed source about the kidnapping.
"In the past, we'd already known what happened," said Villarreal, 46, nicknamed "El Flaco" because of his slim body stature.
'Now all channels of communication with our sources have been broken. '
Valdez's office has been rededicated to the storage room for signs and stickers protesting against the killings of journalists because the employees have become something they themselves never expected: Activists on behalf of the press.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez grabbed a few signs and went to the prosecutor's office the next morning for a demonstration for another journalist.
Salvador Adame disappeared in the western state of Michoacan three days after Valdez was killed.
A burned body has been discovered and officials say, based on DNA testing, that it is his.
Across the country, journalists have become more vocal by writing "SOS Press" on pavements and buildings in organized protests.
That day, the director, Bojorquez, is away in Washington, trying to gather international support for justice in the Valdez case.
At a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa the day after Valdez was assassinated, Ramirez blamed the authorities for spying on journalists and letting them kill them for telling the truth.
She has since asked for her to be re-divided by the government because she is concerned her anger has hurt her objectivity.
Valdez has repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico are "surrounded" by organized crime, government officials involved in it and an equal society.
In his last book, "Narco-Journalism," he wrote that reporters are killed not only by drug gangs, but also on the orders of politicians and security forces who stomped under a blanket with organized crime.
Last year, the media watchdog group "articulo 19" assigned more than half of the attacks on journalists to the police and officials.
"In Mexico, you die because they want you to keep your mouth shut," Ramirez said.
Obviously, the murders have a chilling effect.
No one forgets the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago.
Her body was found along with a note allegedly signed by the Zetas cartel: "Here I am because of my reports."
A computer keyboard and headphones were next to her separated head.
Some branches have chosen to close, such as the El Norte newspaper in the northern border state of Chihuahua after the murder of the correspondent Miroslava breach in March.
Others continue, as El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did after the murder of its director in 2004.
In 2010, the Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed the drug cartels with an editorial on the front page with the headline "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists have fled their home states, or even out of the country.
It's a painful decision.
It's hard to find work in exile and they're still watching the streets and looking for dangers.
And sometimes they are hunted, as appears to be the case with photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered in 2015 along with four women at an apartment in Mexico City three months after escaping from Veracruz.
For those who stay behind and continue the work, it's a daily dance with risky choices.
Ibarra, who once wanted to be a poet, admits that drug trafficking scares him.
"Mexico is going to hell, and that's why I became a reporter," he said.
At midnight last Friday, when the last issue was already over, Riodoce's editors sat on the sidewalk in front of the office and drank beer when at once all their phones started to sum up.
A series of shootings involving gang rivals and security forces near the seaside resort of Mazatlan had left 19 confirmed dead.
The war continued to escalate, as promised by a series of cartel embassies in the region.
From the onboard edge, they have released the news on Riodoce's website via mobile phone.
The front page had to be changed the next day.
Sirens howled nearby - another shooting in the area.
Bojorquez took a look at the policemen holding guard to see if they were in readiness.
If they were afraid at all, they didn't show it.
Under the enormous portrait of the newspaper's fallen founder, whose middle finger was visible to the whole of Sinaloa, Riodoce's staff followed his tracks.
"How can you also just think of closing," Bojorquez said, "if on the same day that Javier was murdered, the intern asked me to send her to the streets for reporting."
Dinosaur used camouflage to soften its enemies
At first glance, it looks like a statue, albeit a terrifying one.
Now researchers have found that the first findings of the incredible Nashorns of a Canadian miner have been preserved so well that experts have described it as the "Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs."
It was so well-preserved that they could even find that his scaly skin was of reddish brown - and they said she'd had something of a "troubled past."
The report in the journal Current Biology described it as "the best-preserved armoured dinosaur ever found, and one of the best dinosaur specimens in the world."
The fossil is a newly discovered species of nodosaur that lived in the middle of the chalk period between 110 million and 112 million years ago.
His incredibly well-preserved condition has puzzled researchers who describe it as' truly remarkable '
According to reports in National Geographic, the armoured herbivore is the best preserved fossil of its kind.
It was found by Shawn Funk as he grub at the Suncor Millenium mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada, March 21, 2011.
He hit something that seemed out of place from the surrounding rock, and decided to take a closer look.
The fossil he discovered was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.
They spent the next six years trying to uncover the feral animal within the 2,500 pound (1,100 kg) earth stump.
After all this hard work, the finished result is now ready to be revealed.
"If you just blink a little with your eyes, you could almost believe it slept," said the principal, Caleb Brown, a scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature can be seen.
'it will go down in science history as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaur specimens - the Mona Lisa of dinosaurs. '
Researchers have found that despite being covered with an armor and resembling a changing tank, this herbivore was likely threatened by flesh-eating dinosaurs.
The heavily armoured dinosaur used a red and white camouflage to hide from predators and used a shielding technique known as a counter-coating, which is also used by many modern animals.
This would have allowed it to better blend into its surroundings and soften its enemies, experts say, suggesting it was threatened by larger dinosaurs.
The 110 million-year-old creature from the Nodosaur family first made headlines in May and is now on display at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.
Researchers have now studied the wild animal and called it Borealopelta markmitchelli after museum technician Mark Mitchell, one of a team that has spent more than 7,000 hours uncovering it carefully.
The astonishing conservation of the specimen allowed Dr Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and shape of scales and armor across his body.
They discovered counter-shading, a common defence method in the animal kingdom, meaning the top of the creature was darker than its bottom.
Although counter-shading is common, the results are surprising as the size of Borealopelta far exceeds that of the animals living today.
It suggests the dinosaur was hunted by enough pressure from flesh-eating dinosaurs that evolution favoured the concealment of confrontation as a means of survival.
But most contemporary animals that use counter-shading - think robes, zebras or belt animals - are much smaller and more vulnerable than prey, signalling that this nodosaur was exposed to a real struggle to survive.
"Strong predator behaviour on a massive, heavily armoured dinosaur shows just how dangerous the dinosaur predators of chalk time must have been," Brown said.
Chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows the dinosaur's skin was rotten.
Scientists continue to examine the animal for clues about its life, including its canned intestine, to find out what it has eaten as its last meal.
They believe that when he died, the dinosaur got into a river and was driven out into the sea, where it sank on its back to the seabed.
By this time, Alberta was as warm as southern florida today, and rivers and oceans likely spread much farther inland than they are today.
"This nodosaur is truly remarkable because it is completely covered with canned scaly skin but is also preserved in three dimensions and maintains the animal's original shape," Brown said.
'the result is that the animal looks almost the same today as it did in the early chalk period.
You don't need to use a lot of imagination to reconstruct it; if you're just shielding a little with your eyes, you could almost believe he's at sleep. '
The chalk time was a time when huge theropods, carnivorous dinosaurs standing on two legs crossed the Earth.
Although the king of them, the Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions of years after Borealopelta, the armoured dinosaur was hunted by some of its fearsome ancestors.
These include the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38-foot (11.5 m) long, six-tonne monster.
The scientists, whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology, believe Borealopelta sank in the sea after death and was mummified in the mud.
The creature was found by Shawn Funk as he grub at the Suncor Millenium mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada, March 21, 2011.
According to the museum, it is the world's most bespoke armoured dinosaur, including skin and armor, and is complete from the snout to the hip.
The creatures were on average about 18 feet (5 metres) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).
It contained two 20-inch long tips that raced from his shoulders.
Researchers believe the armored herbivore was swept through western Canada until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea.
But the dinosaur's underwater burial preserved its armor in exquisite detail.
The fossilised remains of this particular specimen are so well preserved that the skin remains still cover bumpy tank plates along the dinosaur
As Michael Greshko has written for National Geographic, such a level of conservation is as' rare as a win in the lottery.
The more I look at it, the more confusing it gets.
Fossilized remains of the skin still cover the bumpy tank plates that carry the animal's skull.
His right front foot is on his side, and his five fingers are prized upwards.
I can count the dandruff on his sole. '
In the thunderstorm: Mass carambolage on A8: Many injured
Thursday night's violent accident on the A8: Nearly 30 vehicles are involved in a mass carnage.
There are numerous injuries, miles of traffic jams - and gaffer.
About 20 people were injured in a mass carnage on the Stuttgart-Munich (A8) motorway late on Thursday afternoon.
According to initial police data, nearly 30 vehicles, including probably trucks, were intertwined at 5 p.m. between the junctions of Adelzhausen and Odelzhausen (district of Aichach-Friedberg) during a thunderstorm.
No information was available on the exact number of people injured.
They were minor to medium-serious injuries, a police spokesman said.
A large bid for rescue vehicles was at the scene of the accident.
The A8 was completely closed in the direction of Munich.
A ten-kilometre backlog formed in the direction of Munich.
As an AZ reporter reports, there were also massive disabilities on the opposite carriageway - by numerous gaffers.
The fire service listed the registration plates of the vehicle's drivers, who now face sensitive penalties.
A second accident happened on the A8 shortly after 18: 45, this time between Augsburg and Dasing.
There was a collision between a car transporter and a passenger car.
A rescue helicopter was on its way to the scene of the accident.
Deutsche Bahn: Group tests "comfort check-in"
It's a moment almost everyone has experienced before: Nothing punishing you sit in the train and sleep.
Or you are deepened into his work and just have an ingenious thought.
And then: Pufff.
Comes the sheepdog and awakens one ungently or knocks the passenger in the middle of the workflow.
Ticket control.
But the times of interruptions are soon over.
Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the creator-less ticketing control.
You simply confirm by mobile phone that you are taking your seat and thus devaluing the ticket.
A test operation is currently underway on two routes.
"When the offer arrives, we extend it.
It is then expected to be available on many more long-distance routes in Germany early next year, "a rail spokesman said.
"Comfort Check-in" calls the train the ticket devaluation without Schaffner.
To be able to use them, however, some conditions need to be met: You need a smartphone or tablet.
And you must have booked an online ticket - which is what most passengers already do.
You must also have bought it through the train's app, the DB Navigator, which is the most convenient way to book tickets anyway.
And last but not least, you need a seat reservation.
Because the "comfort check-in" works like this: You get on the train, call your ticket under "My Tickets."
A button for electronic devaluation will then appear with the test customers.
The train crews get a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is in the train and has taken the booked seat Y.
If the train attendant comes to seat Y when it comes to ticket control, he knows there is a passenger sitting there with an already devalued online ticket.
So you can go on sleeping, keep working, keep silent.
The "check-in" has two advantages: One for the customer, one for the train - which in turn is meant to benefit passengers.
"If you want to travel relaxed without ticket control by our train crew, simply check in the DB Navigator.
This allows passengers to make their travel time on the train more personal, "says Michael Peterson, DB Ferntraffic's marketing executive.
Second plus: "And our employees have more time than they do today to respond to individual customer needs."
Those who often train know that in addition to delays and missed trains, ticket checks are among the biggest annoyances.
Because often you, but in any case one of your fellow travellers, do not have all the documents you need to devalue online tickets.
Either the credit card or the identity card or any other document you have to show is missing.
The result is endless discussions between the train attendant and the passenger, leading to poor mood in the section or metropolitan area and delays in controlling their own ticket, and at the end of the day, the sheepdog takes the time to take care of other concerns.
Only a small number of test customers can still use the new service.
And only on the connections ICE 915 Dortmund-Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart-Essen.
Other access numbers on the same route have not yet been unlocked.
As one activist came to learn the answer to the question: "Whose Streets?"
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shaken to her core.
Just a day after she arrived in New York City, the St. Louis native sat on the bed of an Airbnb apartment she rented and scrolled through Facebook on her phone.
She stumbled across a post from someone from high school.
"The police just killed an 18-year-old child, and it's still on the streets," it said.
Confused, as no one else on her feed had posted the information, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
A user with the handle @ TheePharoah was constantly retweeted on their timeline.
The rapper from the St. Louis area was in the process of live-tweeting the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old who was killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Mo.
He posted a picture of Brown's leaked body stretched out on the street and would stay there for four hours.
"That's wild," Ferrell thought to himself.
But death was nothing new to her and her community.
She put out her mobile phone to return to tweets about people on Canfield Drive later in the evening.
There were photos of the police tape and people screaming, and of a man claiming to be Brown's father carrying a sign with the inscription: "Ferguson police just killed my unarmed son!"
She watched a live feed where a policeman stood in front of a group of protesters with a barking dog.
In another video, she said, another policeman uncovered his rifle and shouted, "I'm going to kill you... animals all."
"That's not common," Ferrell recalled of her statement.
'that's not the kind of murder we've become used to and that we can call typical. '
At that moment, I felt shaking.
I was angry and crying. '
She booked a return flight and went home the next day.
After landing at 11pm, she picked up her 6-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided the two would head to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened in the following three years with Ferrell and Ferguson is the subject of a new documentary, "whose Streets?," in cinemas from 11.
It's a story of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and resilience that exists from the point of view of the people who live in the community and have filled the streets to demand answers.
When Ferrell went to Ferguson with her daughter, who wore a floral dress and a matching crown, the two discussed a conversation they had countless times before this morning "about the black experience and the black state."
"You remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe in?" She recalled of what she said.
'We're going to Ferguson now because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and that wasn't right.
I couldn't take them with me, "Ferrell said later.
'What's happened today is a culmination of... what happened in the past.
She needs to know it and see it and be raised in it.
It needs to be well developed, to know not only activism and organization, but also the different layers of black experience and the black Constitution, and what we need to do to become free to liberate ourselves.
Even though I am lucky enough to give her an experience where she personally does not experience blatant racism, she is no different from the next black women's child.
I feel I would do her a disservice to keep her away from it. '
The first stop when they arrived in Ferguson was on South Florissant Road, a location opposite the police authority that became a campground as activists waited for Officer Darren Wilson's possible non-indictment.
There, Ferrell and her daughter connected with a local business owner who made lunch.
They prepared bags and helped pass them on to protesters.
Slowly, a new kind of activism began to take shape for Ferrell.
"My activism totally changed after August 9," she said, noting that as a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, she was president of the Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on food justice and health inequalities in black communities.
"I had no experience in organizing.
It's all come. '
Weeks later, during an evening demonstration, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, one of the film's co-directors.
Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar just wanted to "document" what happened.
One question came to the mind of Ferrell: "Do you want to document or are you trying to find a story you can exploit?"
That skepticism was fed by countless cases of people, often whites - in a community that benefited from their pain and resilience.
As Folayan explained in an interview recently, "We had heard that people born and raised in Ferguson hadn't centered their voices and we wanted to do it differently."
Folayan had already worked with then co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the area known for his activism around Todestract inmates.
His involvement brought Ferrell closer to the project, along with six other locals followed by the team of "whose Streets?" In the years after Brown's shooting.
"This documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks to us, we talk," Davis said.
'that was the main thing for me, how these people are portrayed, because that's how I'm going to be portrayed. '
The goal was not to focus on Ferrell's experience - to show that the movement is "not a Messiah leader but a community that comes together," Folayan said - she proved to be the film's most open participant.
As a result, documents from "whose Streets?" Show surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrell's life as she falls in love and marries her wife.
"I felt like I was naked," Ferrell said, laughing when she first saw the finished product.
'But I understood that there has to be some vulnerability in this work and in the humanisation of black people. '
What's more, Ferrell's story repeats the role of black gay women in the broader Black Lives Matter movement.
Two of the movement's three founders, who shaped the film "BlacklivesMatter" on social media after the 2012 killing of black teenager Trayvon Martin, identify as gay.
"Black, gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement as a whole," Ferrell said, "and therefore we are constantly fighting on different fronts.
Black, gay women must bear the brunt of everything. '
Folayan agreed to note that "the movement is really sustained by black women and many black women."
However, she insists that "this is not an affirmative type of action" where Ferrell was chosen as the heart of the film because of her identity.
"She was the person who stirred up that energy," she said.
'it's no accident, even though she was on the front line because there's so much at stake in a life at these intersections as a black, gay woman.
You can feel their energy through the screen. '
Meanwhile, the news cameras in Ferguson have long since disappeared, but racial links between the community and the police persist.
Ferrell is on probation for 2 ½ years for blocking a highway at a demonstration.
She describes the socio-political atmosphere of the area she calls her home: "A mess."
Yet she clings to a vocalist and she feels committed to that memory ever since she took to the streets in Ferguson three years ago.
"It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It is our duty to win.
We have to love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose - except our chains. '
From "dream" to "megalomaniac": TV readers discuss bit gallery
The bit gallery moves people, though it's far from built.
But the idea of a shopping centre at the southern end of the pedestrian zone has been dividing the population into advocates and opponents since the first presentation in 2009.
Cold leaves the issue barely one.
The issue is also being discussed on our "Volksfreund Bitburg" Facebook page.
While some say to the bit gallery: "That would be a dream" (Anja Becker) or "That would be real class" (Nicole Schausten), comes from the other side: "Don't need a man" (Siggi Betzen) or quite simply: "Megalomaniac!" (Lars Scholz).
While advocates are building for a gallery to attract more customers to the city, which also benefits the rest of the shops, opponents fear the pedestrian zone will then bleed out.
What's more, the gallery is planned exactly on the property where the farmers' market hall stands, where 13 direct marketing companies offer their products.
This will come to an end with the start of the construction work.
The gallery makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - and to Beda Square with the opportunity to sit outside.
Simone Zimmer: "We have been buying in the farmers" market hall almost every week for many years.
Mainly our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of the country women always very happy.
We also discovered the butcher for us.
We would like to see an opportunity to maintain this offer, even during and especially after the construction of the gallery.
In other cities, there is, too.
The small market hall in Frankfurt, in particular, is interesting. "
Gerd Densing: "Whether direct marketing companies settle in a market hall in the gallery comes down to the level of rent.
However, this is unlikely to be exactly low in the new project. "
Eva Kilic: "Why shopping palaces in Bitburg?
Whether it's clothing, shoes, drugstores or supermarkets, I find that superfluous.
There are already enough of them in our city.
You can see how many retail stores are empty here - some for months and years.
However, as there is not even a proper weekly market here, it is all the more important that we at least maintain the market hall.
After all, the goods offered there are fresh, mostly offered directly by the producer and, on top of that, are inexpensive.
As you can see, retail stores in a shopping centre are only rented by larger firms, because the rents there are often unsustainable for a retailer.
It's a shame, specialty shops almost no longer exist and what's left of it will probably disappear then. '
Wolf fandel: "A shopping mall with a market hall doesn't fit together for me.
And the gallery doesn't fit in with Bitburg.
Above all, where should the farmers "market hall go during the construction period?
The old Edeka would be the solution - even in the long run, if the bit gallery actually comes at some point.
Or does the ghost bit gallery manage to drive all the shops out of Bitburg before? "
George Marquet: "That's just not going to work.
And a shopping center that stands empty, no one needs either.
In my view, it would have been better to promote a proper farmers' market, rather than this gallery.
But there is no place for a farmers "market hall, thanks to the insane many - I think - senseless construction projects in Bitburg.
If the farmers' market hall is broken, a piece of culture will disappear again. '
A fitting resemblance: Artist creates portraits with Chelsea Manning's DNA
In the middle of the room of the Fridman Gallery in New York, many faces can be seen - white, black and brown, which are almost imperceptibly the same - hanging on cables from the ceiling.
The 30 portraits were created by artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from cheeks tubers and haircuts sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent the excerpts from the Fort Leavenworth prison, where the former Secret Service analyst was serving a 35-year sentence after making public classified diplomatic messages through the WikiLeaks website.
The new exhibition, which opened on August 2, is called A Becoming resemblance (A matching resemblance).
It is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline united her expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a trans woman and groundbreaking dissident whose conviction was transformed by Barack Obama when he had only three days left in his post.
Dewey-Hagborg has created a sharp, if somewhat intellectual, commentary not only on the formality of DNA data - the many ways they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also on identity, through the algorithmic analysis of DNA extracted by Manning and from which 30 portraits were created.
Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward but has already spoken openly about identifying as a woman since her puberty, was convicted of 20 charges in 2013, including six violations of the spy law, computer fraud and theft.
Through the prison, her image was suppressed, so much so that there was only a single photo - a grainy, black and white selfie in which Manning clearly sits unwell on a driver's seat and wears a platinum blonde wig - with which she was associated.
In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg just came off the great success of her 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'.
In it, the artist produced portraits of strangers from forensic artefacts such as cigarette mugs and chewing gum by extracting the DNA from the waste to produce a picture of what these people might look like.
That was when she received an email from a newspaper magazine.
"They conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in jail, and they wanted some kind of portrait to accompany this article," Dewey-Hagborg explained at a press preview of the new exhibition.
And she couldn't visit at that time and she couldn't be photographed, so you contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to do a DNA portrait.
The artist and her imprisoned muse became uneven briefings, exchanging several letters over the course of two years.
They even created a comic "suppressed Images," illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, which foresaw a future in which the president would transform Chelsea's judgment and she would be able to see the exhibition in person.
That Obama would actually demand Manning's release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas just days after the book was released was a welcome kind of happy gathering.
There is also something deep and strong now at the opening of the exhibition, as Donald Trump is waging a war against whistleblowers from the government camp and against transgender troops to find new, tweetable ways to further flout the rigid divisions he was supposed to fix.
When asked about the strange timing of all these things, Dewey-Hagborg said that "things happen for a certain reason."
In an artistic statement written on the gallery's wall, Manning, with her oversized signature below (the "i" in her family name is fitted with a heart), called for an end to "automatic fragmentation, the basis of which has been gender, race, sexuality and culture."
On the opposite wall, her mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousandth of Cs and Gs and As, is written in pencil.
By incorporating the 200 letters (or nucleotides according to the artist's advanced scientific lexicon), Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show how remarkably similar, at least in biological terms, we all are.
"What people will hopefully take away from this is that our genome doesn't care about who we are and how open genetic data is to an interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose 2007 video work, spurious Memories, is also available.
'DNA data can tell so many different stories, so that's 30 of those stories. '
The last piece in the exhibition, which is kept in a separate room, is a page from the comic novel mentioned above.
It shows Manning as she emerges from the United States' disciplinary barracks, such as King Kong, with a free-speech phone in her hand.
"If they cold your speech, then they won," it says.
'so never stop your mouth. '
"It came straight from a letter she wrote to me," said the artist, who greets from Philadelphia.
'i still get goosebumps when I talk about it. '
Manning has not yet seen the exhibition in person - just as it was foreshadowed in the comic book - but if she was to do it, she will be greeted in the middle of the room by the masks, by her own genomic simulacres, which clashed like hordes of protesters.
This was also targeted, like everything in the exhibition, right down to size (5 "2, Manning's stature), where her genetic haptic groups were written with pencil.
"In the past I had them on the wall, but I wanted them to feel like a crowd," Dewey-Hagborg said of the portraits.
'i wanted it to feel like a mass movement forming with Chelsea, like the movement that was also behind its liberation. '
University of Northwestern professor and an Oxford University employee wanted over killing
A nationwide manhunt is underway for a professor at Northwestern University and an Oxford University employee who are being sought as suspects after a man was stabbed with fatal injuries in a luxury apartment in Chicago.
On Monday, warrants were issued for Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) for murder over their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, the files from the Cook County District Attorney's Office show.
The documents say that Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after several bullies.
A community warning system released by the Chicago Police Department says the body was discovered July 27.
Officers received a call, arrived at Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with multiple injuries to his body.
Cornell-Duranleau was still declared dead at the site of what happened, and detectives are investigating the bullies as murder while police are actively searching for the two suspects, officials said.
Lathem has been an extraordinary professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, the vice president of university relations, said in an email statement that Lathem was now in assessed and barred from entering the Northwestern University campus.
"This is now a criminal matter being investigated by the relevant authorities and Northwestern University is cooperating in this investigation," Mr Cubbage said.
Warren is a senior Treasury assistant at Oxford University.
A spokesman for the university and Somerville College said in an email statement that "we are in contact with the police in the UK and ready to assist the US investigating authorities in any way we can."
The statement added that Warren's colleagues were shocked and want him to stand down.
Chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Department, Anthony Guglielmi, said he urged the suspects to face the authorities.
"The police have an idea of their whereabouts, and our efforts to locate them are stepping up," Guglielmi said.
Guglielmi said local, regional and national authorities are helping to find the suspects.
Guglielmi said police received a call from the building manager of the Grand Plaza building, who had just received an enigmatic tip that said something had happened in apartment 1008.
The police described the scene as very cruel.
Guglielmi said it was unclear if the incident also took place on July 27.
It was confirmed by security cameras that Lathem and Warren were in the building.
"We believe that Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," Guglielmi said.
Grand Plaza's management team released a statement to residents: "Police are currently working on the timeline and background of the victim and are exploring a variety of motives, including a possible domestic incident."
"We will complete the WADA roadmap in the near future" - Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mutko
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said it won't be long before the remaining World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) criteria for restoring the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (Rusada) are implemented.
"At a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the roadmap, Rusada has been given the right to plan and test in collaboration with UKAD (UK Anti-Doping).
The WADA roadmap has been updated in this regard, "Mutko said on Thursday.
The PM commented on the second part of WADA's roadmap to comply with the code, which describes the criteria for re-establishing Rusada and was recently published on the organisation's website.
According to Mutko, it contains nothing that could cause concern for Russia.
"Everything has been announced, everything is being implemented.
And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA in the near future, "he added.
However, one of the criteria mentioned in the list notes that Russian anti-doping authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the WADA-approved investigation by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren into alleged state-sponsored doping in Russian sport.
Referring to the matter, Mr Mutko said: "We are conducting the investigation as our anti-doping system has admitted a mistake.
All the measures have been implemented.
But there were no government programs, and we're not going to admit something that doesn't exist. '
Mutko's words were in line with those of Vitaly Smirnov, head of the independent Russian Anti-Doping Commission.
Speaking to Russian outlet RSport at the start of the day, Smirnov admitted problems of the past in Russian anti-doping organizations, but then added: "We have said repeatedly that the report contains controversial positions and regulations.
No one prefers to accept this report unconditionally, "Smirnov added.
Rusada was barred from carrying out doping checks in Russia in November 2015 in the wake of the doping scandal by WADA.
However, it has been allowed to plan and co-ordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and UK Anti-Doping (UKAD).
Speaking after a visit to the organisation's headquarters in Moscow in July, WADA director general Olivier Niggli said Mr Rusada was "moving in the right direction" to be reinstated.
Aldi is no longer selling eggs for now
This was shared by the business groups.
It was a pure precaution, and there could be no further risk of any health impairment, the notice said.
As of now, only eggs are likely to be delivered to Aldi, which has been shown to have been tested negative for fipronil-containing anti-lice.
As a result, Aldi wants to create clarity and transparency among its customers.
The start-ups that will help your company avoid becoming the next Uber
Amy Errett wanted to measure happiness at your e-commerce start-up with your employees, but the polls didn't work.
Answers were often vague, unhelpful or - even worse - fraudulent.
And even if you promised anonymity, some workers didn't trust the process.
"There's just never been consistency and objectivity," said Errett, who runs the 75-person San Francisco e-commerce Hair Care company Madison Reed.
She has called people from the outside for help.
A new breed of Human Resources start-ups is on the grow to help companies figure out how their employees feel.
By creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement, it allows companies to conduct surveys, address special groups and demographic groups, provide anonymity and complaint hotlines to employees, and in some cases allow whistleblowers to bypass C-suite executives and contact the board directly.
"They now have tools like Strava and Fitbit for tracking their health, but where's the Fitbit for your company?" Said Jim Barnett, co-founder and chief executive of Redwood City start-up Glint, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement.
Errett said she gained a better insight into what your employees think and feel over the three years with Glint.
In addition to snap polls and surveys from certain teams, it offers a heat map of the company that shows at a glance which units have the most complaints and which executives have low approval results - so you can rebounce why.
Companies are coming to terms with the need to stay at the forefront of workplace culture so you don't become the next Uber caught up in scandals ever since a former employee published a blog post describing an environment of harassment where those who spoke were punished.
For start-ups like Glint, this desire for an overview is a lucrative business opportunity.
The global governance, regulation and compliance industry could own more than $118.7 billion in 2020, according to the financial engineering website Let's Talk Payments.
Denver, Colorado, start-up Convercent, which helps companies prevent and recognize bad behavior, saw increasing interest and activity discredited earlier this year amid the Uber case.
Convercent has nearly 600 clients including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber recently registered as a client.
Like Glint, Convercent lets companies send tailored "pulse" surveys, collect confidential responses in real time and view the heat maps of your problem areas.
It also offers an anonymous SMS hotline that allows employees to report bad behaviour.
And when the chief executive is involved, complaints go directly to the supervisory board.
"The court of public opinion has covered the regulators," said Patrick Quinlan, the founder and managing director of Convercent.
When a company is found that treats its employees badly or behaves unethically, it can experience costly consequences from consumer boycotts, worker fluctuation and lawsuits, Quinlan said.
Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 locations, has used Convercent for more than a year to ensure employees are aware of policies and procedures and have an easy way to reach their corporate headquarters.
In the past, if an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a phone number or email for the company's headquarters, file a formal complaint and hope it was taken seriously.
It was often an intimidation and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesdays General Counsel, who said there was no good way to track staff complaints.
Now that the company is using Convercent, problems previously hidden by executives sitting in offices in cities or states - such as discrimination, harassment or unfair internships - can be identified and addressed more quickly.
"I can get closer to that holistic, 360-degree view into the experience of employment," said Vitrano, who heads Ruby Tuesday's Risk Management Group.
'and we're protecting our shareholders from employment litigation. '
Companies began taking ethics, values and employee engagement more seriously in 2002 after accounting firm Arthur Andersen collapsed over ethical breaches caused by the Enron scandal, Quinlan said.
But it took the "social media to get to their right" that companies realised you couldn't prevent their dirty laundry from going online.
"Before using technology to monitor ethics, people used hope as a strategy," he said.
Both Glint and Convercent offer your software as a service, and charge companies with recurring fees for using their products.
It's a business model and an opportunity that will find the approval of Venture Capital investors who have backed both start-ups.
Convercent received $10 million in funding in February from firms including Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, raising total capital to $47 million.
Glittering secured $10 million in November from Bessemer Venture Partners, bringing its total funding to $60 million.
These investments hardly come as a surprise, given the interconnected nature of business, culture and venture capital.
There is a growing body of research showing that today's employees expect more from their jobs than before.
In competitive markets like Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are just stakes.
Employees want to feel that you are accepted and valued and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission.
"If people are happy to be in a company that owns their voices, and that the work you do is worthwhile, then they feel more committed to making this company successful," said Nina McQueen, vice president of Global Benefits and Employee Experience at LinkedIn, which uses both Convercent and Glint.
Investors achieve returns when their portfolio companies run well, and companies run well when employees are committed and engaged.
If third-party analytics tools promise to increase engagement and employee engagement, it's no wonder you'll find support.
The data on employee engagement according to the experts of workplace culture important.
But the data is useless if a company's administrators fail to take action.
In fact, when a company asks employees for your feedback, it may have an expectation that change is on its way.
And if change doesn't come quickly enough, or not at all, it can breed disappointments and demotivate employees.
"When you ask about 4,000 suggestions, you have to be willing to have 4,000 conversations," said Russell Raath, president of consulting at business management firm Kotter International, which has seen companies that have relied too much on collecting data.
"Because if you don't follow, staff will ask," Have you really heard me?
Do you care about that?
And who you don't care about, why should I? '
Madison Reed, who now conducts monthly staff surveys, was able to take action the same day a problem is reported about Glint, according to Errett.
And after collecting feedback from frustrated staff, through the speed of decision-making and the quality of communication, she was able to reorganize multiple teams within the company and add communication training to address the problems.
At Ruby Tuesday, the company keeps getting new insights about employees, and it hopes that in the long run, this will lead to better retention of workers in an industry known for high sales.
"If you're not required to create a culture of transparency, you're going to lose people," Vitrano said.
'and if you lose people, you lose customers too.
And if you lose customers, then you're going to lose businesses.
The NCAA eliminates the two-day practices and makes a long day for the Bruins
It goes to 11pm as a crowd of UCLA footballers entertain on one side of the team's new practice fields on campus.
Some have pulled out their jersey tops and show their backs full of sweat from the first day of training camp.
For a good part of the team, those idle minutes represent a lunch break.
Players enrolled to the summer courses will return to their final exams after the three-hour exercise before returning to the Waterman Football Center at 6: 30 the next morning.
"This is a real treble for the boys the next three days," Bruins coach Jim Mora said shortly before Monday became Tuesday.
The NCAA is eliminating two-day exercises to ease players' load, and it has actually extended its days - at least until the finals on Friday.
That's why UCLA's first three workouts should begin at 7: 15 p.m. to match players' already packed schedules.
The compromise away from the two days is more than a day when the Bruins postponed the start of the camp almost a week after last season and carried out practical exercises during the summer school for the first time during Mora's six seasons in Westwood.
They are scheduled to hold 18 exercises later this August, 20 before starting formal game preparations for their start against Texas A & M in September.
Mora said he supports the NCAA's rule change even if it adds another point to players' busy routes.
"We put this enormous burden on them for three or four days, and it's very challenging," Mora said.
'and they just pushed it through, they move on, they're great people.
I think once we get to Saturday and we have more time, it's going to be really great. '
UCLA will end its practices once the camp is finished, which will not be an easy task given the clear guidelines of its fields from an adjoining parking lot and the adjacent Luskin Center, a high-class hotel already littered with footballs clearing a protective net behind a goalpost.
Bruins players are expected to fill the hotel from this weekend, but Mora conceded there could be a problem once those rooms are free during the season.
"We will use our security," Mora said.
'that's a real problem and it's not far-fetched to think people rent a room there and then set out there to record an exercise.
If you have the video tape of an exercise, it's a pretty good deal.
But we have security forces there, and we have security forces in parking lot 8.
We're going to do the best, with what we have.
I am not too concerned about that.
We have a plan. '
Facebook to step up facts review in fight against fake messages
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with false reports to fact-checkers from third parties and then display their results under the original post, the world's largest online social network said on Thursday, one of its efforts to combat so-called fake news.
The company said in an opinion on its website that it will begin using updated machine learning methods to detect possible false reports and send them to fact-checkers who may display results of fact-checking from the original article.
Facebook has been criticized as one of the main distribution points for so-called fake news, which many believe has also affected the 2016 U.S. presidential election.
The problem has also become a major political issue in Europe, with French voters flooded with false stories in the run-up to May's presidential elections, and Germany supports a plan to penalize social media networks if they fail to quickly eliminate hate-filled postings as they did before the elections there in September.
On Thursday, Facebook said in a separate statement in German that a test of the new facts review would be launched in the United States, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
"In addition to recognizing which stories are challenged by fact-checkers from third parties, people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share," said Sara Su, product manager for Facebook messages in a blog.
She added that Facebook will continue to test its feature on the "related article" and is working on other changes to its news feed to reduce false messages.
Creating a comic novel: A castle in the history of England
In its recent past, the little Scotney Castle featured in a squeeze music video and was a loophole for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970 "s and 1980" s.
But Scotney has seen 700 years of turbulent history from his cosy seat in the Bewl River Valley in Kent and has now become the inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes, a mophaired Yorkshireman with a fondness for historical documents.
"I think it's so nice to look at the handwriting of someone who's been dead for 300 years," he says wistfully.
'What a personal relationship to keep that letter in my hand. '
'a Castle in England 'spans the period from the Middle Ages to the Age of Edward, documenting the families who lived in Scotney, each story illustrated by another emerging British artist - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
It's not the first book by Rhodes to be based on an archive: He wrote 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories' in 2014, a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project he found unexpectedly emotional.
"I just reacted to the thumb print on the side of a letter in a way that was written by a double agent in the 1700" s who worked for the Jakobians, "he says.
'that's his thumb print!
And letters always smell smoke, because at the time you lit a fire because of the light.
For someone who lives 300 years later, the smell has an effect as if he were himself, too.
Oh, I love archives! '
For someone so beaten with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived in a castle for nearly four months ("To be honest, I have a little overrated my welcome") this all seems too nice to be true.
Rhodes spent his days exploring the Victorian "new" castle, browsing the archives and studying the castle's many treasures and curiosities, such as the mounted hymen's heads on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the ditch.
He wandered through the grounds and the ruins of the old castle and spoke to landscapers, gardeners and sometimes the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book.
Then, at night, he drank "whiskey and started writing."
The intimate history of Scotney is relatively unknown as the National Trust only received full access in 2006 when the last heist, Elizabeth Hussey, died.
When Rhodes arrived a decade later, employees were just beginning to look after the archive, which he described as "hundreds of years in which aristocrats said" Oh, throw it on the attic. "
Diaries, letters from the time of the English Empires, maps depicting who owned what: "You might think that land conflicts would be boring," says Rhodes, "but there was a birch that two families fought for.
Guys, let everything go his way! '
Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to dive into English history on a wider basis, including 'The Labourer', which follows a man leaving the newly built castle to join the farming uprising of 1381.
"There is a recording of a turmoil that occurred in the castle in 1380, in this book entitled 'Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex,'" Rhodes says.
"The peasant uprising started in this area and I thought an uprising was a good start.
Maybe the two are connected? '
Other stories are firmly rooted in the castle's history - such as' The Priest ', which tells the story of the Jesuit patron that the Darrell family hid for seven years during the English Reformation.
Or 'The Smuggler', depicting 18th-century smuggler Arthur Darrell, who staged his own funeral by filling a coffin with stones (a discovery made only years later when his coffin was excavated).
The Darrells are Rhodes' favourite family of Scotney: "The Lords seemed quite crooks, always making debts and spending money on things they couldn't afford.
Other generations of Darrell men solved their debt crises by marrying rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of good-looking guys, with a talent to advertise Erwithin. "
After the end of his deployment at the castle, Rhodes is on the lookout for other unique writing experiences
He has had a two-week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about Elämänmäki, the site of an early 20th-century sanatorium that has since been recovered by nature.
But Scotney has a special place for him.
"I was sad to go back," he says.
It was like, 'Oh, now I have to deal with the damn life again.'
Campaign launched: Over 300-year-old Marienkapelle hatched in Rhöndorf
With the unveiling of the 301-year-old Marienkapelle in Rhöndorf, the city of Bad Honnef on Friday launched its campaign to introduce a new umbrella brand (Thursday's round-up).
Until Thursday, Mayor Otto Neuhoff and his marketing team around Nelson Artz want to keep the logo and slogan secret.
At the end of August there will be a festival on the island of Grafenwerth as the highlight of the campaign.
"Too nice for us.
Or? "The makers of the action have been asking on the posters at the Rhöndorfer Chapel since yesterday.
"We don't really think so (of course!)," they write on their website released yesterday.
'But we're using this measure to attract your attention.
And to make it clear that some things are better than it seems.
Basically, we firmly believe that we as Bad Honnefer citizens are well aware of the beauty and attractiveness of our city. "
The action is about more than "just" a logo and a slogan, it continues.
'it's important to formulate an alluring promise, one that gives the city a distinctive unique experience. '
After all, it is competing with other local authorities.
A mid-five-figure amount can cost the city of Bad Honnef its new umbrella brand and the campaign.
Turkey's military reforms - Erdogan's fear of the army
Every year in early August, the Supreme Military Council (Yas) advises in Ankara on retirements and promotions in the officers "corps.
So, too, this week.
At first glance, a normal process.
But nothing is routine with the Turkish forces a year after the coup attempt.
The meeting was no longer held in the General Staff building, as it used to be, but in the prime minister's office.
The meeting was also attended by the five Deputy Prime Ministers and the Ministers for Defence, Home Affairs, Justice and Foreign Affairs, chaired by the Prime Minister.
This meant the civilians in the Yas were in excess.
The government is pulling the reins in the military.
Chief of Staff Hulusi Akar remains in office, but the commanders of the army, air forces and the navy have been dispatched.
Since the failed coup, leader Erdogan has fired 169 of the 326 generals and admirals.
Over 10,000 soldiers have been removed from the ranks of the army - mostly for alleged links to the movement of the exiled preacher Fethullah Gülen, whom Erdogan sees as a drag on the coup attempt.
It has been under negotiation in Ankara since this week against 486 people believed to have been directly involved in the coup attempt.
The day after the coup, Mr Erdogan had described the upheaval attempt as a "God's gift" as he gave him the opportunity to "fully clean" the armed forces.
But is Erdogan really in control of the army?
In late February, the Hürriyet newspaper published an article with the headline "discomfort in the military headquarters."
There are concerns in the General Staff about increasing "Islamisation" of the army, which manifests itself, among other things, in the lifting of the headscarf ban on female soldiers, the newspaper wrote.
In any case, the large-scale clean-up in the army and the security forces continues.
In mid-July, Erdogan fired another 7395 public servants by decree, including 2303 police officers and 546 soldiers.
In doing so, it seemed that Erdogan was taming the military.
The generals used to be considered the country's actual masters.
Three times they putted, citing their role as guardians of the secular state order.
After his victory in 2002, Erdogan pushed back the power of the military step by step, not least citing the European Union's reform requirements.
Former officers say Erdogan is deliberately driving an Islamisation of the armed forces.
Writing in the Vocal Europe magazine, a notably unnamed officer, who sought asylum after the coup attempt for fear of persecution abroad, warned the Turkish army would be "full of extremists and Salafists" in a matter of years.
If that is true, such a development could not leave Nato cold.
In any case, there are doubts about the readiness of the Turkish army in the alliance after the purges.
The leadership structures and operational capabilities are "weakened," NATO diplomats say.
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
There will be a new U.S. immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card, President Donald Trump said, citing the media.
It envisages reducing legal immigrants to 50,000 a year, stricter rules on obtaining visas for a temporary work permit and restrictions on family-oriented visas.
The new rules are proposed by Republicans and supported by the president.
The bill is to be discussed in the two chambers of Congress.
"This law will reduce poverty, raise wages and save billions of dollars for taxpayers and will do so by changing the way that green cards are issued to citizens from other countries."
The law will prevent chain migration and replace the current system.
This new application procedure will benefit the candidates who speak English, who have the financial resources to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy, "Trump said, citing the American media.
Department to clean up route for racetrack shuttle
Time and again, over the past few months, the future of the racetrack has been stripped - now it is to go very quickly.
It is expected to be built before the end of the year at the ailing track where the tourist track runs.
To secure the future of the racetrack in the long term, construction work on the track is expected to begin later this year, according to the Department for Transport.
"With the decision to continue ordering and renovating the Ilmenau-Rennsteig route, the country is committed to this link, which is particularly important for tourism," transport secretary Klaus Sühl said in Erfurt on Friday.
It estimated the cost of refurbishing the route at about €2.5 million.
Of that sum, the country takes 75 percent.
The contract, on the basis of which the shuttle will continue to be ordered by the country, is currently being finalised, "Sühl said.
The ministry and the South Thuringia Railway as operators are already in agreement on the technical details.
"This will negotiate the road map, the vehicles used and the quality standards," Sühl said.
The proposed contract between the ministry and the rail company will be concluded for a duration of 11 years.
This should allow the racetrack shuttle to be ordered on a regular basis on December 2017.
The Rennsteig-Shuttle is a rail link, especially popular with tourists, between the railway stations of Ilmenau and Rennsteig.
In recent months, as part of a pilot operation, it has been tested whether the route will be used by a sufficient number of people to order it again in the future.
The route is also heavily dilapidated in parts.
The rise of sex robots is real, and we should be worried
Just when you thought it can't get any more crazy in 2017, comes a new report on technological developments in the field of sex robots.
Yes, indeed.
Sex robots are a big deal right now.
Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (Foundation for Responsible Robotics) (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robots over the next five to 10 years.
According to Noel Sharkey, emeritus professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of the FRR, we need to start taking their rise seriously.
Customers can choose the robot's eye color, its shape of nipples and the type of fingernail.
"People are making fun of them, but companies are delivering plenty of them, and we're going to get to see them a lot more often," Mr. Sharkey said at the release of his new report.
Modern-day Sexpups have evolved from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with deliberately human reactions achieved by artificial intelligence.
The user can also "customize" their robot according to their beliefs, selecting everything from the robot's eye color to the shape of the nipples to the type or color of its fingernails.
But it gets even more troubling as many robots possess the "personalities" that would make a Stepford woman look progressive.
Modern Sexpuppen have evolved into robots with a silicone skin.
For example, the RealBotix robot allows its users to adapt their robots to the features they find appealing, such as shyness.
And then there are the Roxxxy Gold sex robots developed by True Companion with pre-programmed personalities such as "frigid Farrah," which gives the impression of shyness and "Wild Wendy" with an "adventurous" personality.
"Roxxxy Gold has a personality that's adapted to your personality as much as possible," the True Companion website warms.
So she likes what you like, and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc.
She also has her moods during the day - quite like real people!
She can be tired, fixated on conversation or she can be "in the mood"! "
There are many troubling aspects to this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the subservient female traits, the allusions to rape when you take a step on frigid (called here: Reluctant) Farrah, worry one the most.
On its website, True Companion compared Roxxxy to a vibrator, but for men.
"If women can (sic) have a vibrator, then why can't men have Roxxxy?" The website says.
However, these sex robots aren't just a fetish or just another sex toy.
Their emergence and increasing sophistication point to something darker and deeper in our culture, a retreat from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with submission as an optional addition.
Most men, of course, will not keep sex robots, and while the FRR notes their rising popularity, they still remain provisionally on the brink of consumer culture.
But what leaks out of the fringe areas can be very instructive in terms of the spirit of the time we live in.
And a lot of people aren't weird or offensive until the free market gives them permission to do so.
There is, however, some overlap between these highly developed sex robots appearing at a time when women's rights are under threat around the world, where there is a president in the White House who has boasted of sexually assaulting women.
The most chilling aspect of the television series' The Handmaid's Tale '(' The Report of the Magd ') is not the graphic images, the treasured bodies and the extinct eyes, but how realistically this vision works.
The Republic of Gilead is a leap, but at the moment this doesn't feel like a big leap.
The goal behind these sex robots is to establish a physical resemblance to actual women as realistically as technically possible (albeit with porn star proportions).
Their builders want them to feel human, that they emulate the movement of a real body.
But, to the point, when it comes to their "personalities," the robots don't represent real women.
They can't separate from their companion or just walk away.
They have no mediation or background story, nothing that hints at independence or anything that might upset the imagination of total submission.
In other words, they are fake slaves.
Or to put it in the 2017 speech: Servicemen
Trump's big accomplishment?
He makes Mitt Romney the epitome of common sense
It has become a truism of the Trump era that the political divisions that have polarized the U.S. electorate have also divided small-format families.
Around Christmas and harvest festival, there were newspapers in the United States with advice on how to deal with the horror of Trump-voting relatives.
We are all reportedly making an effort to burst our filter bubbles.
Less noticed has been the power of Trump to bring families together.
I mention this because my cousin, a left-leaning poet who lives in Chicago and has long worked with the Republicans in our family, visited me this week in New York.
It reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.
With Trump in the White House, everyone she knows, including the Republican kinship she had struggled with for decades because of politics, is suddenly and quite peculiarly on the same page.
This is certainly a good thing around the dinner table, but it strikes me in another context that this also carries significant risks.
The left has been bolstered by Trump, but the daunting effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right.
When we talk about "normalization" and Trump, we refer to the grisly possibility that one day his mates won't kick us off.
There is, however, an even more terrifying long-term scenario in which Trump "normalizes" right-wing Republicans who suddenly appear as the epitome of sensible at once compared to his standards.
I find myself nowadays tainted by an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's urcomic version of the crazy - the dog on the car roof, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew what his tax return looked like) - both of which are, in fact, a very mild crime compared to Trump.
If Trump goes, the next Republican nominee just needs to be mentally healthy to qualify as an immeasurable improvement.
When my cousin was in town, we brought our children to the carousel in Central Park, the largest of the New York park department's carousel, and the best $3 you can spend in the city if you don't need caffeine.
The horses are hugely large, the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all the clowns are growling and the animals twisting to look over their own shoulders full of fear - extremely sinister and the climate-changing music conveys this in a strange way.
So many clichés of a city disappoint: The views of tall buildings get old, the skylines become too familiar to offer much excitement, and the reality of the city doesn't live up to the dream.
Thirty-five years later, and I'm still not quite across the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is indeed not a Swiss cottage - the theme pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage doesn't count - but a large roundabout in north London.
However, the Central Park carousel is still a strangely magical experience as here two two-year-olds, an 11-year-old and two women can go on it in the 40's and all have a great time.
If I could have assessed the carousel I would have given him the full score but luckily no one asked for it.
On the other hand, in a department store this week, I was forced to rate my "experience" with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could get through my credit card.
In the coffee shop on the corner of my street, it's the same, plus the option of matching the valuation with a 15 per cent tip - this to buy something over the charge table.
This not only leads to a slowing down of what should actually be a neutral exchange, but also exerts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where none is required.
The poor woman in the department store stood excitedly grinning while I tired of the experience of handing her my credit card with five stars.
Oscar Pistorius transferred from prison to hospital with chest pains
Pistorius has left prison for a hospital visit for the second time.
Last year, he was taken to hospital for treatment of cuts to his wrist, which he said the prison authorities suffered after a case in his cell.
Pistorius was convicted of murder following an appeal by prosecutors against a first death sentence.
He killed Steenkamp in the early hours of Valentine's Day 2013 by shooting her several times through a door of the toilet cubicle at his house in Pretoria.
Pistorius claimed that he thought his girlfriend was a night intruder who hid in the cab.
Prosecutors have announced their intention to appeal this time against Pistorius' six-year sentence, which they say is too lenient.
The National Law Enforcement Agency said it would appeal to the South Africa Supreme Court and the appeal could be heard this year.
Pistorius runs the risk of his sentence being increased to 15 years if prosecutors are successful.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
When farmer Arnold finds a strange egg
As the last of the Blumberger schools, the fourth-graders were sacked from fuses and apple hoops into the holidays and secondary schools.
Three of the graduate students will go to high school in the future, four to the realtor.
Head teacher Angelika Sitte greeted the public's parents and representatives at the Biesental Civic House in Epfenhofen on Tuesday evening.
As a symbol of school dismissal, the 29 students from the four classes, led by Sophia Schumacher and Regine Meder, chose a young eagle who grows up in the chicken farm but is then released to freedom.
To do so, the mundane char performed a musical called "The eagle in the chicken farm."
Farmer Arnold found a strange egg, and left it out of his chickens.
Instead of a chicken, a small eagle came out.
But the hope of making a chicken out of it was smashed, the eagle spread its wings on a high mountain and escaped.
After that, grades three and four showed a chicken dance in the study of Yvonne Frank.
The hens danced with the young goggles wearing cylinders to make the bet.
The eagle stands for integration, said head teacher Angelika Sitte.
The juvenile, while different from the other juveniles (chicks), is one of them.
However, he will never be like a chicken.
His determination is to be free.
She wanted every four-year-old to feel accepted in his new school.
It was followed by a word of thanks to the colleagues, the former head of the school, Michael Müller, who keeps jumping at lessons, and the parents' representatives.
The kitchen season is now over, classroom teacher Sophia Schumacher explained.
She was very reluctant to release her students after two years of lessons, because it was a really great time.
Finally, she was able to rely on the fourth-graders.
Finally, all the students left a song of summertime and holiday season.
There was a great deal of joy among the children.
Eight first-time buyers are already registered for the new school year.
Two Bulgarians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
Two Bulgarians were detained for illegal campings in Greece, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, citing television, said.
On the morning of 1 August, a group of people were arrested by the police in Sithonia, including the two Bulgarians.
They were released the same day while an investigation is ongoing.
The Foreign Ministry reported to BTV that the Bulgarians were later released.
The Greek authorities have tightened control of free camping and are imposing substantial fines on anyone found to remain in a place not intended for that purpose.
Inspections will continue throughout the season.
The ministry said the court can impose a fine.
Software update for diesel vehicles: What those affected need to know now
How exactly does the software update take place?
Do diesel drivers need to participate in the action?
The most important questions and answers at a glance.
At the diesel summit, BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW Group have offered software updates for a total of about 5.3 million cars.
They are intended to improve the exhaust behaviour of cars of the emission classes Euro 5 and, in some cases, Euro 6.
Euro 4 diesel or worse are exempt.
Anja Smetanin of the ACE Auto Club Europe gives assessments:
Is the new action mandatory?
No, the software updates negotiated are voluntary.
"The mandatory updates previously only apply to the vehicles that have cheating software," says Anja Smetanin.
Their retrofitting has been ordered by the Federal Railroad Administration (KBA).
How and when will customers be informed about updates?
Manufacturers have announced a speedy implementation over the next few months but have not yet given an exact date.
Daimler has been told to write to anyone affected.
If an inspection is due anyway, it will be done within their framework.
How long are the overall installments likely to drag on?
"Hard to say," Smetanin says.
This depends on the commitment of manufacturers and political pressure.
"Because we have seen that, so far, car manufacturers are not acting voluntarily when it comes to the environment."
How long should the update last?
The conversion itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop.
It can be more time-consuming to get an appointment.
What do drivers who don't drive a car from BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW Group do?
The ACE advises to wait.
Presumably foreign manufacturers would follow suit, according to Smetanin.
Is there now a risk of a massive fall in the price of Euro 4 cars?
ACE fears this.
But it is precisely in the regions where driving bans are at risk.
In rural areas, there have so far been no losses in value for older diesel.
The ACE advises that with a sale still to be seen.
Ll Cool J receives Kennedy Center award
The Kennedy Awards gala is one of the most glamorous events in the Washington.
The first awards show under President Trump promises to be political.
One of the winners doesn't want to come - in protest.
Ll Cool J (49) is the first rapper to get one of the prestigious Kennedy Center's coveted awards.
As the cultural institution announced on Thursday, singer Gloria Estefan (59), Lionel Richie (68) and choreographer Carmen de Lavallade (86) and TV producer Norman Lear (95) are also among the scholars this year.
The awards will be handed out in early December.
Traditionally, US President Donald Trump will host a reception and attend the ceremony along with his wife, Melania.
For this reason, the winner, Lear, who has been announced with progressive TV series, has already announced that he will not take part in the gala.
He told the New York Times: "This presidency has chosen to completely neglect the arts and human rights - even deprive them of the funds - and that puts a strain on me."
The 59-year-old Estefan insisted she would use the conversation with Trump to clear her view.
The Kennedy Center, named after former President John F. Kennedy, is the largest cultural institution in the U.S. capital.
Previous winners include Meryl Streep, Aretha Franklin, Robert De Niro, George Lucas, Tom Hanks and Sting.
We make the city worth living
Roland Wacker, Haslach's city builder, is retiring next year.
The vacancy has already been advertised - but suitable candidates are rare.
Wacker has been a city builder for 31 years.
And the work is still great fun for him, as he conveys in the press section.
He reports on varied but also demanding tasks that await his successor.
At the same time, he is surprised that so far no application meets the requirement profile.
The city is looking for an architect or civil engineer at the earliest possible date.
In this way, in compliance with the regular notice periods, there will still be enough time for a review.
Since Haslach acts as a subcontracting authority for the administrative community, the applicant must have the relevant qualifications.
Because that function is definitely what the city wants to keep.
If it could no longer fill them, citizens would have to travel all the way to Offenburg for advice.
But proximity to the people is important to the city and to it itself, says Wacker, who reports on a good working climate as well as good mood between the authority and citizens.
In more than 30 years in office, some significant projects have accumulated that Wacker looks back on with pride.
"We make the city worth living," he is sure about the building office and its employees.
But there are also varied projects on the agenda in the future: The transformation of the former Hukla area and the Niederhofen parking lot, for example, have been initiated.
The kinky bridge between Bollenbach and Steinach is being renewed, and stadium rehabilitation is still an issue.
The latter alone will cost around €1.5 million "if we get it right," Wacker estimates.
"All in all, great tasks await my successor.
The work here is fun. '
In terms of design, there is a great deal of room for a city builder.
With Haslach's own yard and gardening, many things can be responded to quite flexibly.
"You can move a lot," Mr Wacker said, and the design of the green spaces is often praised by citizens and visitors.
As the Old Town is under preservation as an ensemble, it is important to "keep an eye out for what fits in" when new buildings are approved, the outgoing city builder insists.
Anyway, the city builder bears a heavy responsibility.
He's a builder, "in the end, everything here runs over my table."
When it comes to support and coordination, he can count on many years of staff: Markus Neumaier (Hochbau) has been here for ten years, Manfred Schöner (civil engineering) for 15 years.
Also, that his successor remains long, Wacker wishes: "We are looking for someone who really wants to identify and stay with the place."
Because continuity is important not only for a good working climate, but also for the further design of the city.
According to the city of Haslach, those who wish to inherit Roland Wacker should have a completed degree as a diploma engineer or bachelor with a degree in architecture and have good technical knowledge in the fields of building planning and planning law.
The Stadtbauamt is under the supervision of civil engineering, civil engineering, property management, the management of the municipal properties, the Municipal Court with a yard and city gardening, as well as the Lower Building Authority, including the Protection of Monuments.
Bike thrown on lines: Southern rail line closed
According to police, the previously unknown offenders had thrown the blue bike onto the lines from the railway track overpass in the area of Leobener Road (B116).
These were so badly damaged that the approaching freight train had to be stopped.
Investigators are looking for two male offenders and have been searching for them since the night hours.
A rosy scooter and a bicycle driver were observed by witnesses near the scene.
"This goes well beyond a Lusatia coup," said ÖBB spokesman Christoph Posch to APA.
The or the perpetrators would have put themselves in grave danger and also put train services at risk.
In addition to the damage to the locomotive and the plant, as well as the delay minutes and the cost of rail replacement services, pints of the rail customers could also be on the offenders.
Overall, it was expected to be a "significant" sum, the spokesman said.
The damage was fixed again on Friday afternoon, and rail services on the south rail line could be run without any disabilities.
Nearly ten passenger trains were out Friday morning, two of which involved long-distance traffic.
Freight trains did not fall, but they were delayed.
According to ÖBB spokesman Christoph Posch, around 200 metres of overhead lines had to be replaced.
Insulators and masts were also damaged.
Red meat, dairy products and chocolate could help ease IBD (inflammatory intestinal disease)
Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.
But a new study claims just the opposite: A diet rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products could ease the symptoms of patients with inflammatory intestinal diseases.
The incurable condition, which affects around 1.3 million in the US and 300,000 in the UK, causes stomach cramps and bloating, recurrent or bloody diarrhoea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
While those affected are normally advised to avoid meat and dairy products to ease their symptoms, researchers at Washington University found the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins helps develop immune cells that promote a tolerant intestine.
The senior researcher, Dr Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells in the intestines patrol to ensure harmful microbes hiding in food do not penetrate the body.
Cells capable of triggering inflammation are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissue.
If the balance tends too far toward inflammation, it can result in inflammatory intestinal disease.
Experiments found that a type of tolerance-boosting immune cell occurs in mice that carry a particular bacterium in their intestines.
And the bacterium requires tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells.
Professor Colonna said: 'We have established a link between a type of bacteria - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the intestinal microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.
The more tryptophan the mice had in their food, the more they had of these immune cells. '
He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and a diet rich in tryptophan encourages more tolerant, less inflammatory bowel milieus if the same system also boosts in humans.
The postdoctoral student, Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan, examined a type of immune cell that promotes tolerance when she found that a group of study mice had such cells, but another group of the same tribe, but which was housed separately, did not.
She suspected the difference had to do with the mice's intestinal microbioms - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi that normally live in the gastrointestinal tract.
The mice's diets were DNA sequenced and six types of bacteria were found that were present in the mice with the immune cells but were missing from the mice without them.
Mice were raised in a sterile environment so they lacked a bowel microbiome and they didn't develop these kinds of immune cells, and they were given the L. reuteri and the immune cells.
To understand how the bacteria affected the immune system, the researchers allowed L. reuteri to grow in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - to immature immune cells isolated from the mice.
The immune cells evolved into the tolerance-boosting cells.
When the active component was cleaned from the liquid, it proved to be a byproduct of tryptophan metabolism, known as Indol-3 lactic acid.
When researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the mice's lining, the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent, but when tryptophan levels were halved, the number of cells dropped by half.
Dr Cervantes-Barragan explained that humans have the same tolerance-boosting cells as mice, and that most of us protect L. reuteri in our gastrointestinal tracts.
It is not known if tryptophan by-products from L. reuteri develop the cells in humans as they do in mice, but defects in genes related to tryptophan have been found in people with inflammatory intestinal disease.
She said: 'The development of these cells is probably something we would like to encourage as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestine.
Potentially high levels of tryptophan in the presence of L. reuteri can lead to an expansion of this population. "
Jose Mourinho believes Manchester United have signed a 'genius' with Nemanja Matic
At Manchester United, a "genius" has signed with Nemanja Matic, Jose Mourinho believes, after the midfielder made his debut against Sampdoria on Wednesday night.
Chelsea's £40million signing began with a 2-1 win in Dublin, the final pre-season game before the UEFA Super Cup against Real Madrid begins on Tuesday, and impressed in the holder role as people like Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira marched at will.
However, Matic was ruled out of the Blues' preparation Asia tour and managed only 45 minutes, which Mourinho admitted he had to improve before the start of the Premier League season.
"He needs time but his experience, intelligence, a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football," Mourinho said.
'We'll help him get ready sooner rather than later. '
In addition to Matic, Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku also starred at the Aviva Stadium as Mourinho formed his starting XI for the start of the season.
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho wanted three more new commitments, but he insisted the club had already done a "fantastic job" of meeting three of its four priority new commitments.
"To get three out of four, I thank the club for that," he added.
'i'll be happier if they get four out of four for me, but they've made a big effort. '
Boeing 'paints' Dreamliner into the sky
Us aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the silhouette of a Dreamliner into the sky.
The pilots flew from Seattle in the US state of Washington, but the drawing began in Marquette in US state of Michigan and moved across the United States in the form of a Dreamliner, which is several thousand kilometres.
The action took 18 hours and a minute.
On the radar screens was the shape of a Dreamliner.
The whole thing was an endurance test for new engines.
Boeing had done such advertising before.
For example, the number "787" and the Boeing logo were painted in the sky.
New low for Martin Schulz - Hanover, we have a problem
As the wind turns: When Sigmar Gabriel was still SPD leader, Social Democratic prime ministers always looked to Berlin with some concern before elections.
Just no troublemakers from the party headquarters, just no headwinds from the federal government - such was the most important wish of the campaigners.
Since Martin Schulz leads the party, that has fundamentally changed.
Since then, the staff from the Willy Brandt House have been watching events in the SPD-ruled state capitals with growing horror.
What Schulz has received from there since the beginning of the year would not even be described in the approach with headwinds.
It was lows.
And one by one.
The federal CDU sees a general signal against coalitions of the SPD and Greens following the surprising end of the red-green majority in Lower Saxony.
"This shows once again that red-green simply cannot govern reliably," CDU Secretary-General Peter Tauber told the editorial network Germany (RND).
The surprise group exit of a Green MP has plunged the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) into a serious crisis.
Five months before the state election, his red-green coalition lost its one-vote majority to the opposition from the CDU and FDP.
The Greens federal executive, Michael Kellner, has called on the breakaway low-profile Green MP Elke Tested to return her mandate.
The transfer to the CDU means a clear distortion of the will of the electorate.
Elke Tested must immediately return her mandate, "the Greens' federal executive and campaign manager told the editorial network Germany (RND).
"All of this must not be true at all," sighs one SPD campaigner as the new obscurity reaches party headquarters on Friday morning.
Stephan Weil, SPD prime minister of Lower Saxony, is without his own government majority following the transfer of Green MP Elke Tested to the CDU.
It is the preliminary culmination of a whole series of large and small crises in SPD national associations.
And no one knows what's coming next.
The plight began with the unexpectedly significant defeat in the Saarland election in March.
A blue eye, more not, the comrades calmed down at the time.
After the state elections in Schleswig-Holstein and North Rhine-Westphalia, everything will be different.
That was then - and it all became much worse.
The defeat in Kiel brought the SPD into defiance, and the Dusseldorf bust hauled the party smoothly.
Painstakingly, the comrades rappelled again in the weeks afterward.
Then, when they had just gained new courage, came the G-20 summit in Hamburg.
And with it came the next low.
Mayor Olaf Scholz, the last strong SPD country chief, lost his Nimbus that weekend for sitting in the Elbphilharmonie while his city burned.
And because he did pretty much everything wrong in crisis communication after that that can be done wrong.
Since then, Scholz has been fighting for his political survival.
So now also Stephan Weil.
Because of the VW emissions scandal and his role on the supervisory board, the low-profile prime minister has been under criticism for quite some time.
Middling poll numbers were added.
Still, or perhaps precisely because of this, Weil has been trying more and more to accent in the federal government in recent weeks.
The desire of the former mayor of Hanover to expand his power in Berlin was also not hidden from comrades in the surroundings of Martin Schulz.
They allowed him to be granted, as they promised to stabilize the party from Weil.
Now the exact opposite could happen.
In doing so, Weil is basically not to blame for the partisan coercion of the Lower Saxon Greens.
And Schulz certainly didn't.
For the time being, the comrades are therefore trying to keep their own ranks closed.
Their anger is directed at the Greens, and here, in particular, the breakaway parliamentarian, Tvests.
"It is intolerable and democratizing how Ms. Tuttle puts her own career interests above everyone else's interests," Matthias Miersch, head of party leftists in the SPD parliamentary group, tells the editorial network Germany (RND).
Ms Tested has been elected to parliament not because of her person as a direct candidate but through the national list of the Lower Saxony Greens, according to the low-profile MP.
The logical consequence would be for it to return its mandate.
Thomas Oppermann, leader of the SPD parliamentary group, laments an "undemocratic manoeuvre."
"The voter fervor four years ago was clear: People made Stephan Weil prime minister," Oppermann, who leads the low-profile SPD as the leader in the federal election, tells the RND.
"Now the personal career memory of a future CDU MP distorts the outcome of the election," Oppermann continued.
He called for the background to be investigated.
I want to know whether there has been more or there have been further commitments from the CDU of Lower Saxony.
Funding for the town centre III
If you want to clean up your year-old house, you can soon get support from the country.
This was informed by Mayor Albert Schindler and three representatives of STEG urban development in sensitivities on Wednesday.
At the start of the briefing, Schindler gave a look back at what has happened so far.
Since 1991, there have been remedial areas in sensibilities.
At that time, in the rehabilitation area I from 1991 to 2004, the state of Baden-Württemberg took over two-thirds of the funding.
In remedial area II from 2005 to 2016, the grant was still 60 percent, after all.
For Schindler, the renovations so far are a "success project" - it is important, after all, to promote interior development as well, and not just tap into new building areas.
On 4 April, the Board of Governors of Karlsruhe received the information that there will be a rehabilitation area III.
The funding amount was €833 333, of which €500,000 would come from the country, the rest from the community sensibilities.
How will a rehabilitation area be created?
One will, Schindler continued, investigate where the "really old" houses are.
However, it also plays a role in whether there is any interest in sanitising in the planned area.
If necessary, the territorial borders could then be moved again.
The STEG represented Martin Keller, Gaby Pietzschmann and Sarah Gotzel on Wednesday night.
Keller presented the contents of the federal government's "Social City" program, under which the renovations would then be carried out.
The core of the programme is the revitalisation of inner cities, the improvement of living and working conditions and the maintenance and development of infrastructure.
The measures would be carried out object-related, that is, per property.
The rehabilitation area would then eventually be laid down as a statute.
The grant period for the funding has been running since January 1, 2017, until April 30, 2026.
However, by September this year, the stocktaking would be carried out, in which those involved in the recovery area would be given a questionnaire to fill out.
The sentence decision is to be made as soon as possible in November or December so that the renovations can begin next year.
Pietzschmann subsequently stated that each commune had to carry out the said pre-trial investigations.
It is about assessing urban grievances and deciding when to rehabilitate and to what extent.
A remediation note will then be entered in the land register for the respective property.
Pietzschmann will come back to sensibilities himself and get a picture of the situation, she promised.
Gotzel stressed that a key success factor for the project was the participation of stakeholders.
That's why there will be questionnaires that will be posted to citizens in the coming weeks and can be filled out by the end of the summer holidays.
The yellow questionnaire is the "building and land arch," which covers, among other things, the structural condition and the renovation intentions.
In the grey questionnaire, the "household and housing arch," information on the size, division and residents of a living room can be made.
The blue "operating sheet" can only be filled out if premises are operated in the building.
However, it should be noted that Gotzel pointed out that a completed questionnaire is not at the same time an application for funding.
In addition, new building measures are not eligible.
Schindler still stressed that the distribution of funding works according to the "greyhound principle" - those who come first are cautioned first.
You can't "reserve" funding for later.
Finally, photos of the "town centre II" project were still being shown to make a refurbishment "palatable" to those in attendance.
British inventor sets himself a microchip to get into house and car with a hand movement
A British inventor is the first in the country to be fitted with a microchip so he can open his front door, enter his office and even start his car with a hand movement.
Steven Northam, 33, had the tiny chip implanted between thumb and index finger and now offers the service for companies and individuals looking to simplify their lives using technology through his company, BioTeq.
He has joined Dr Geoff Watson, an advisory anaesthesist at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester, Hants, to ensure the implant procedure is performed by medical standard.
The technology resembles a cat and dogs implanted microchip and takes just 30 seconds.
Mr Northam's firm would also like to change the locks on houses and cars so they are compatible with the chip, all for an extra cost of £300 per lock.
The married father of one has now fitted technology both at home and at his BMW Z4, which begins when his hand is at the wheel.
The White House's advertising costs cost taxpayers thousands
The White House's decision to fly a navy helicopter to the South Lawn for an event that highlights American manufacturing last month costs taxpayers up to $24,000, according to the military's data left to TIME magazine.
The green-and-white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One when the president is on board, was the centrepiece of the July 17 White House event featuring American construction programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and senior White House officials made a tour of products from all 50 states.
The Connecticut-made helicopter was issued next to a yacht from Maine, a firefighter's car from Wisconsin and a forklift from Mississippi.
The White House military office required the helicopter's presence in a fragmentary order or FRAGO, barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn, according to the records of the Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for operating the helicopter.
"I just wanted you to be aware of this because it is such an unusual event with high visibility," the commander of the HMX-1 wrote to his superiors, the deputy naval commander for aviation, on the eve of the event.
The news showed the helicopter arrived on the South Lawn about 7am on July 17 for the event at 3pm, and remained until the lawn was cleared between 6pm and 9pm this evening.
The note adds that if the departure from the White House was to be delayed, a second team would be needed for the return flight due to the restriction on service hours.
The original flight crew was at the helicopter during the event, while the unit's security personnel remained on the plane while on the ground.
The records provided to TIME did not specify whether a second flight crew was ultimately required.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using state property for political purposes.
Records indicate that HMX-1 asked if the event could breach the provision.
"One question we asked was whether it was a violation of the hatch act and we were informed that this was not the case," the commander wrote.
"Sounds like you're closed," the deputy commander replied.
The Made in America event was designated an official event by the White House and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act.
But official events also have political overtones.
At the event, the president gave a push for health-care reform that was underway in the Senate, and he propagated efforts to curb government regulations.
Using the aircraft, known as Marine One or Air Force One, for politically advantageous purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.
Presidents are required to use them for the trip.
But to request their use only for a photo op is unusual.
Trump conducted an investigation in February when the presidential plane provided taxi services against the backdrop of his first campaign rally in Melbourne, Florida, and his Twitter account is full of messages complaining about his predecessor's use of the presidential plane.
"The White House is excited about the" Made In America "show - which shows products from all 50 states made by American workers using American materials," said White House deputy press secretary Lindsay Walters.
HMX-1 crews frequently conduct training flights in the area around Washington and the South Lawn to dismiss the U.S. president at the White House with precise centimetres.
When Trump was in Germany at the G20 summit in early July, HMX-1 conducted 58 practice landings at the White House.
The flight for the Made in America event counted in the flight crew's training needs for the month, an official said.
Helicopter units flew an additional 11 hours that day for "non-presidential support missions."
The White House said taxpayers did not take the burden on any of the other props unveiled at the event.
A spokesman for Sikorsky said the company was not involved in issuing the helicopter on the South Lawn.
HMX-1 does not maintain budget records for the presidential flights, and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event.
However, according to hourly rates from the U.S. Department of Defense for the 2017 financial year, the DoD refund rate for the VH-3D is $24,380 per flight hour.
Records from the unit record the plane's flight time as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Facility in Quantico in Virginia.
The White House argues that the actual cost of operating the helicopter is well below that rate.
"Setting the cost to taxpayers based on the estimates for reimbursement rates is highly misleading," Mr Walters said.
'These estimates include staff, maintenance and many other hidden costs included in the annual funds. '
According to a 2015 RAND study, reimbursement rates for DoD do not include staffing costs, but take into account the cost of fuel, maintenance and contracting.
At that time, former White House press secretary Sean Spicer defended the use of the helicopter for the event.
"The idea is to present things this week that are made in America," Spicer said.
'and I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud that they contribute to our national security, and I expect hundreds, if not thousands, of people to depend on it.
And I think like most Americans, we're all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment that so many Americans have worked tirelessly for.
It's appropriate, of course, to highlight that. '
It wasn't clear if Trump interacted with the helicopter as he entered his tour of the South Lawn for the event, but he put himself in the driver's seat of a firefighter's car.
At the White House, Trump spoke to representatives of Sikorsky and joked with the media about his own fleet of corporate products.
"I know Sikorsky very well," the president said, "I have three of them."
TC BW Neuss facing tricky task
Champions of the Second Tennis League will join the table-topping Suchsdorfer SV.
The TC Blau-Weiss Neuss will take place tomorrow from 11 o'clock in Kiel at the Tabellendritten Suchsdorfer SV.
Despite after five games of still makeshift record, the champions of the Second Tennis League have been given the sense of reality.
In any case, team leader Marius Zay has respect for the opponent.
"This is a compact team that always plays in quite a similar formation.
Especially on the back positions, I think the team is very good. ""
For class and stability at the Suchsdorfer SV, imports from the high north are particularly important.
"Their Danes and Finns can even point to stakes in the Davis Cup.
And they are also strong in doubles, "says Zay, speaking to Harri Heliovaara (Finland), Andre Göransson (Sweden), Sören and Esben Olesen, Martin Pedersen and Andreas Bjerrehus (all Denmark).
'as always, that's going to be hard for us.
You need a good dose of luck as well. '
The Neusser team for the trip to the high north is in handy.
His debut for blue and white could be Maxime Janvier.
If the Frenchman currently active at the Challenger tournament in Biella, Italy, does not make it to the Bundesliga match, the Zdenek Kolar (Czech Republic), who is playing at the tournament in the Czech Liberec, will arrive for his first assignment this season.
The so far undefeated Chilean Hans Podlipnik-Castillo was still on the ball with Belarusian Andrei Vasilevski at the ATP tournament in Kitzbühel yesterday.
But he should be in Kiel as well as Botic Van de Zandschulp, Niels Lootsma (both Netherlands) and Belgian Julien Cagnina.
After his two wins last Sunday against the club at the Alster, Máté Valkusz could also rejoin the team.
If it is not enough for 18-year-old Hungary, who was still number one in the junior world rankings in January 2016, someone from the trainee around Marius Zay will fill the caddie.
How America can harm OMV
Donald Trump was not really happy when he put his signature under the law to tighten sanctions on Russia Wednesday night.
"In its haste to enact the law," Congress wrapped up a few "unconstitutional regulations," he corroborated.
The reaction from Moscow was also as sharp as expected, and even Brussels foisted the U.S. push.
After all, the draft provides for punishing European companies that help Russians build gas pipelines into the EU.
Investors from the domestic OMV, which is co-financing the construction of the Russian Baltic pipeline Nord Stream 2, together with other European companies, have since been similarly troubled.
The drop-off is huge.
Still, it is too soon to estimate the consequences, according to the oil company's official statement.
In fact, Donald Trump himself would still have to bring the sanctions to life by executive order.
Twelve weapons are available to him.
"The press" has looked at which the group could fend off and which could really hurt it.
Narcos season 3 trailer: Without Pablo Escobar, the Cali Cartel will take center stage in Netflix's hit series
Despite the second season of Narcos unveiling Pablo Escobar's killer, Netflix's series is far from over.
Seasons three and four have already been confirmed by the streaming service, the first receiving its first trailer and showing off the show's latest villains.
With the third season, the DEA has turned its attention to the world's richest organization of drug trafficking: The Cali cartel.
Led by four powerful puns, they operate "like a Fortune 500 company" only with more government bribery and violent actions.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) is the leader of the cartel, Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) is her head, Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) commands the Mexican compound, and Chepe Santacruz Londono (Pepe Rapazote) is in New York.
In the newly released trailer, Pedro Pascal returns as Javier Peña, the guy who invites American and Colombian law enforcement officials to support the war on drugs.
Other new actors include Matias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishe and Arturo Castro.
The third season of Narcos will begin on September 1.
Role backwards: The city is providing 46 kitchen aids
The city reorganizes the Kita luncheon itself.
With permanent contact for the children and an assignment to the team.
The clock is turned back in the urban nurseries.
As of 1 September, the city of Krefeld is again taking over the food supply in the urban nursery facilities (kitchens) in its own right.
For Sonja Pommeranz, deputy director in the Department of Youth Aid, this is good news: "We were all very pleased."
Cooked continues to be out of the house: A caterer takes on this task and delivers fresh gekochtes chilled.
The city runs 46 nurseries in the Krefeld area, and in 44 the children get a warm meal at lunchtime.
Last year, 2800 children each sat at the tables, and the need is growing steadily.
"Meanwhile, not only children who are cared for 45 hours of the week are eating lunch at the Kita," explains Pommeranz.
'the offer also applies to 35-hour care when children stay until 2pm. '
46 part-time workers have kitchen service from September 1: They heat the food delivered, supplement it with salad, raw food and fruit, portioning the meal individually, giving out the food, clearing, rinsing and cleaning the kitchen.
"The employees are firmly assigned to a Kita," says Pommeranz.
The size - there are two-group as well as seven-group facilities - determines the hourly circumference.
"The kitchen helpers are now firmly part of the Kita team," says Pommeranz satisfied.
'so they're much more involved and it's easier for the citaly to implement educational concepts. '
Because that's what it's all about: Healthy eating and cooking lessons.
'the children should help prepare the food. '
The direct connection of the kitchen power to the team makes sense.
For the children, too.
'They have a well-known force in the Kita, a person familiar to them, and not constantly changing people. '
This continuity is important for the children.
The cleaning of the Kita rooms - so far also the task of the kitchen staff - will be done by specialist cleaning staff in the future.
In addition to improving the quality of the kitchen's performance, this variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - also has the charm it has turned out to be the most economical in the cost comparison between self-rule and foreign allocation for the city, the Press Office says.
And that's despite 46 part-time workers being rehired.
"But those hours don't even drop as much with around 750 people in the educational sector," says Sonja Pommeranz.
Afghan democracy depends on women's political role, says UN
Elections can only be representative if all members of society, including women, play a role, the head of the UN mission in Afghanistan said on Wednesday.
Nicholas Haysom, acting head of the United Nations mission, said hundreds of women will run in council elections in the provinces, with three women running for the role of vice president and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women.
"The role of women cannot be overestimated," he said in a statement on Wednesday.
Elections can only be truly representative and credible if women participate fully and are involved in all parts of the election process.
Afghan elections for the provincial council and presidential elections will be held on April 5.
The Taliban have released threats against an election process that coincide with the transition from international hostilities to an advisory role.
This year, for the first time, the elections will hand power peacefully from one democratically elected government to the next.
Haysom said a strong role for women will add to Afghanistan's democratic success.
The Afghan Independent Electoral Commission reports that 1.2 million women are registered out of a total registered 3.6 million voters.

Men try to rest 13-year-old girl
Two young men, aged 19 and 23, are believed to have tried to rob a 13-year-old girl on Thursday.
According to police information, the men spoke to the 13-year-old, who was staying with friends on Kolping Road, about 2.55pm because they wanted to phone the girl's mobile phone.
However, the 13-year-old refused the request and went on with her friends.
As a result, one of the offenders tried to grab the girl's mobile phone and necklace, but this failed.
Without prey, the duo escaped.
The two young men were later arrested by police.
The investigation is ongoing.
GMB concerns over investment in Glasgow's McVitie factory
A union would like to reassure executives at biscuit maker McVitie about the long-term commitment to produce at its Glasgow plant.
GMB Scotland said the company had been silent about the future of investment at the Tollcross site.
More than 500 employees work at the plant, which makes Hobnobs and Rich Tea biscuits alongside other products.
McVities owner Pladis said he had invested more than £5 million in recent years.
He added that staff and union representatives would be "the first to learn" if their activities were to change.
In a letter to the company's branch manager, GMB Scotland urged McVitie's to "raise concerns that funding for the modernisation of production lines would not be pushed forward."
GMB senior organiser Drew Duffy, said: "The fact that we cannot gain clarity from the general site manager about the business needs and investment plans for the future of Tollcross deeply affects our members.
Generations of families have worked here and the workforce is focusing heavily on the local community and the Greater Glasgow area, an important pillar of decent employment in an area of high unemployment and social disadvantage.
Therefore, from the perspective of jobs, wages and prosperity, and against a backdrop of Brexit, rising cost of living and chronic production decline, the eastern end of Glasgow desperately needs a thriving production presence at McVitie. "
A spokeswoman for Pladis said: "The branch manager at Tollcross only received a letter from GMB Scotland yesterday and the company will respond directly as we appreciate the continued engagement with staff and union representatives.
We had a regular meeting with staff and GMB representatives at Tollcross two months ago where some issues were openly discussed.
We discussed with employees that, like all companies operating in a highly competitive and uncertain economic climate, we are constantly reviewing our operations - and this applies to all of our divisions and locations - to remain competitive.
She added: "In recent years we have invested more than £5 million in our Tollcross site, particularly in production lines and operational improvements.
We fully recognise the legacy of Tollcross as a manufacturing facility and should our operations at the site change, the staff and their union representatives will be the first to know this. "
Did the PSG warn Barcelona of Neymar three years ago?
La Liga side may regret their interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain will not relent in their pursuit of Neymar after making a £189 million bid to trigger his release clause, but did they warn Barcelona of the world record three years ago?
The sensational approach has fuelled the summer transfer window, with the Ligue 1 club ready to break the world record by more than double the previous mark, with Paul Pogba returning to Manchester United for £89 million last season.
Once finished, Neymar will become the world's most expensive player and the highest paid professional athlete in the world, with PSG offering wages of more than £500,000 a week.
Barcelona are furious at the way Neymar has forced his way out, although a source close to the Catalan board insists the club has always done its best to look after him since arriving from Santos in 2013.
But was the football world warned of this prospect by the PSG president three years ago?
When Manchester City expressed an interest in signing Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi had a stern warning for any club wanting to sign one of PSG's best players.
"I'm not concerned because they know that if they touch one of our players then we will be in opposition to them, we will contact their players," Al-Khelaifi said.
"We respect all clubs.
But if they try to have one of our players sign with them, it will have consequences. '
Barcelona appear to have crossed that line, with the Spanish club expressing an interest in the PSG midfielder Marco Verratti earlier this summer.
PSG made it clear they would not allow the international from Italy to leave in any circumstances and Barcelona could feel the consequences of that interest by losing one of their prize offers for Neymar.
Scooter thrown around and damaged
On the night of Friday to Saturday, an unknown offender deliberately discarded a scooter placed in Kingsfields Street in front of the number 30 property, causing property damage of more than €200 on the disguise of the vehicle.
Schramberg police, phone 07422 / 27 01-0, are appealing for information.
Police are appealing for witnesses to an accident on the B 215 between Stolzenau and Leese.
Because he matched a car in his lane, the driver of a VW Touran had to depart, touching the guide.
On Thursday night, the 34-year-old from Rehburg-Loccum was travelling with his VW at 7.55pm on the B 215 from Stolzenau towards Leese.
In the area of the locality of Stolzenau, a car came up to him on his lane, so he had to depart to the right.
In doing so, the Touran driver touted the guide.
There was damage to the car.
The driver of the oncoming car, a Mercedes Benz, had overtaken a lorry and continued its journey without taking care of the road accident.
It may be good, according to the accident victim, that the Mercedesist had not even noticed the accident.
Police are now appealing for witnesses to the incident, as well as the driver of the "polluter pays" vehicle, to contact the commissioner's office in Stolzenau on tel. 05761 / 92060.
Interview: 'Domspatzen report relieves Pope's brother Georg Ratzing'
The Regensburg Domspatzen report into the abuses relieves Pope's brother Georg Ratzinger.
This is what author and historian Michael Hesemann means.
The final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen continues to spark debate.
Christian Weisnder, spokesman for the "We are Church" reform movement, said after publication to the German Press Agency that he expected an apology from the former Regensburg bishop and today's Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller, as well as the Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of the emeritus Pope Benedict XVI.
It would greatly serve the reputation of the Catholic Church if Müller and Ratzinger expressed their deep regret at their own omissions or their incorrect assessment of what was going on at the time.
The Vatican newspaper, "Osservatore Romano," on the other hand, criticised the use of "double standards" in the reporting of violence at the Domspatzen.
Regarding the attacks in Regensburg, no one doubts that these are "disgraceful and shameful acts" that would have to be punished and prevented in the future; but what is striking is the "degree of media manipulation," according to author Lucetta Scaraffia, a historian and member of the national Italian bioethics committee.
"The habit of describing the Catholic Church as the source of all evils is already part of everyday experience and prepares public opinion to think this is normal," Scaraffia writes.
In an interview with the Bavarian Broadcasting Corporation, Prince Gloria of Thurn and Taxis also said: "You like to go to church and this is a found fresher."
She also pointed out that in her youth "beatings were a very normal educational means" to cope with cheeky children, as I was one. "
It would be unfair to apply today's standards to previous decades, because the world has changed.
In connection with the reports of the abuses, Pope's brother, Georg Ratzinger, also often appeared.
Quite wrongly, says author and historian Michael Hesemann, who wrote the memorabilia "My Brother the Pope" with Ratzinger (translated into 12 languages).
"I have to protect Georg Ratzinger," says Hesemann, "because all this had nothing to do with him," he evaluates the results of the final report.
What exactly is in the 440-page report presented by the lawyer, Ulrich Weber, who was appointed by the Bistum Regensburg with the Enlightenment?
A total of 547 Regensburger Domspatzen were victims of assault, 67 Domspatzen sexually abused, "with high plausibility" between 1945 and the early 1990s.
In the final report, Georg Ratzinger, who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994, said: "In summary, it can be said that in many cases, forms of physical and psychological violence were used by Domkapellmeister R.
Especially with high emotionality, the punishment for the students could also be more severe in the process.
Still, unlike many other defectors, it is striking that many victims appreciated R. "s general humanity and therefore, in numerous cases, even combine positive memories with him, despite violence."
In the interview, Hesemann explains why the final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen, in his opinion, relieves Georg Ratzinger.
Mr Hesemann, the 440-page report on the "incidents of the use of force on protective orders at the Regensburger Domspatzen" gives a contradictory picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger.
For one thing, many students highlight his "humanity."
On the other hand, he also appears as a cholerian and perfectionist who was often handcuffed when a domesticity did not produce a top performance musically.
As his biographer, how do you evaluate this final report?
Michael Hesemann: If you take the trouble and read the whole 440-page report from front to back, you have to wonder why the name Georg Ratzinger is in it at all.
He is devoted to just eight pages and he is clearly acquitted of any suspicion of complicity or complicity in the horrific cases of sexual abuse.
The excesses of violence at the pre-school also occurred outside his sphere of influence.
At best, you can accuse him of learning about it too late or of not taking first hints seriously enough.
The Domspatzengymnasium, on which he acted, was seen by virtually all respondents as - so literally - "redemption," "heaven" and "better world."
For example, the vast majority of his students also provide a very excellent testimony to Georg Ratzinger, describing him as "warm-hearted," "popular," "sincere," "competent" and "understanding," as an extremely good-natured teacher who regularly provided the boys with cakes, biscuits and candies and was "always surrounded by grapes from children."
Only a minority complain about his perfectionism and high emotionality, which has also led to wreckage.
The fact that he not only knelt with chairs and threw the keyring on the floor, but also distributed earbuds and pulled all too cheeky guys on the hair or ears, he himself admitted years ago, deeply regretted and apologized for it.
It must be said, however, that such educational methods were widely used in the period in question, the 1960s and 1970s, for both parents and teachers.
Do you know any such breeding methods?
Of course, I think every one of us born before 1968.
I, too, still experienced this in a secular school, a state high school.
However, compared with what this report is actually about, namely the appalling sexual abuse and the acts of violence at pre-school, these are trivials.
One wonders if it's not more to do with his notoriety and his role as the brother of Benedict XVI, that a lot of the media just came crashing down on him.
At the Bavarian pope, many who have never understood him are still eager to work.
But the truth is that the report relieves Georg Ratzinger in every respect!
A great deal has been reported in the media in connection with the report on the issue of abuse at the Regensburger Domspatzen.
In the final report, will Georg Ratzinger also be charged with any involvement or complicity with regard to sexual abuse?
Michael Hesemann: Clearly no.
Not a single one of the 67 victims of sexual assault claims to have entrusted themselves to the Domkapellmeister.
Not even the parents were inaugurated.
"I never dared to talk to my father or mother about it," one sufferer said, representing the others, "It was all very embarrassing to me."
The real problem with the investigation of sexual abuse was, and still is, that most victims remain silent out of shame.
If they hadn't even entrusted themselves to parents and siblings, then certainly not to a choir leader who, in a sense, would have been a colleague of the perpetrators in a way.
How do the Domspatzen students rate Ratzinger's role with regard to the cases of abuse?
Michael Hesemann: A questioning student put it this way: "Regarding sexual abuse... I see... no case in which he (Georg Ratzinger) would have had timely intelligence and could have stopped the respective offender.
I think it is... also really absurd to assume that, according to him... cheers have become more intrusive, or clearer, or even more open, than towards their parents, boarding school leaders, trust teachers, etc.
That you talk to him about sex... - unthinkable. '
For example, the report comes to the very clear conclusion: "The fact that students and / or their environment were entrusted to him beforehand could not be confirmed as part of the investigation."
So as far as sexual abuse is concerned, Georg Ratzinger is free of any complicity.
Nor can he be accused of failing to prevent or display him.
There is therefore no reason to associate his good name with these odious crimes, as has unfortunately happened in some cases.
There was a lot of talk in the media of "acts of violence" at the Regensburger Domspatzen.
Former Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger is accused of "looking away" in the report.
Does he have to live with this accusation?
Michael Hesemann: That's the big problem, after all, that in reporting everything was mixed up and menaced into a huge melange of sexual abuse and violence, and somewhere, in the middle of it, Georg Ratzinger.
But that, in turn, is an abuse of the report.
It is, after all, neatly separated: Between the pre-school and the high school of the Domspatzen, between sexual abuse and acts of violence, and, let us say, other allegations.
In addition, the report deals with incidents from the period since 1945, including four decades in which Georg Ratzinger was not the choir leader of the Domspatzen.
All the terrible canon pedagogy, the cases in which boys were downright harassed and maligned by sadistic teachers and suffered horribly, all occurred at the pre-school in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where truly scandalous conditions must have prevailed.
But Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do with those, because he only got to face the boys when they were already at the Domspatzengymnasium.
On that, as the vast majority of witnesses point out, the issue of "pre-school" was taboo.
One was only happy to have escaped her and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even "paraplegic" conditions.
What was different at the Domspatzengymnasium?
Michael Hesemann: There was already discipline, but just no sadistic violence.
And the same is true of Georg Ratzinger, where the report concludes that "many victims appreciated the general humanity of R. and therefore, in numerous cases, even combine positive memories with him, despite violence."
Thus, at most, there remains the charge of having looked away.
But despite all the efforts, the report could only define two periods in which he was told of the conditions at pre-school.
The first time in 1970-71, when he just started to establish himself and didn't want to hear about the events at a school where he just didn't work and was responsible, (according to the witness), and then again around 1993.
Did Georg Ratzinger consistently close his ears before the states?
Michael Hesemann: No, because back in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Domspatzengymnasium, which the report even reproduces.
In it, he points out to them "that caning continues to be practiced in pre-school."
Even in the face of the risk of negative press releases, he recommended urgent intervention.
This was, of course, at a time when there was legal clarity, when caning had long been banned in Bavaria, too.
Before that, they occurred in a legal grey area, as any of us probably still know.
It was also difficult for him to estimate where those affected might have exaggerated or dramatised and where the allowable limit had really been exceeded.
But you also can't say he'd always looked away.
That is simply not true.
It wasn't until 1980 that caning in schools was officially abolished in Bavaria, too.
Prince Gloria of Thurn and Taxis claimed, of course, that it was unfair to apply today's educational standards to the time.
How do you see that?
Michael Hesemann: We historians talk about the "pitfall of anachronism," that is, the danger of assessing the past by today's moral standards.
The prince is right there.
But this, of course, does not apply to sexual abuse, which has been abhorrent at all times, and also not to what has been brokered in pre-school of revulsion and violence against innocent children's souls, which goes well beyond what was usual at the time.
That's all quite horrible and I'm glad it's finally being worked out.
But at the same time I have to protect Georg Ratzinger, because all this had nothing to do with him.
His means of disciplining and punishing, that is, earnest and pulling at the hair and ears, were widespread in the 1970s.
When physical punishment was then banned, he also strictly adhered to it.
What image of his Regensburg time did Georg Ratzinger play in the conversations with you for the book "My Brother the Pope"?
Was the issue of caning also mentioned?
Michael Hesemann: Well, the book is about the life of his brother Joseph, that is, Pope Benedict XVI, told from his perspective, since the Domspatzen only played a side role.
Nevertheless, I am by no means hiding the fact that he led a strict regiment there.
But that, too, has to be said: Without this perfectionism, without the demand for unconditional discipline, it would hardly have been possible for him to form a world-class institution from the hitherto more nationally known Regensburger Domspatzen, true cultural ambassadors of Europe and his musical tradition, who went on tour twice in the United States (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).
With biscuits and candies alone, you don't make great singers out of restless boys and before any success, no matter what area, you always have discipline, passion and self-overcoming.
What kind of person did you see Georg Ratzinger during the conversations on her book?
Michael Hesemann: By working on the book and beyond, I really got to know Georg Ratzinger quite well and always saw him as a wonderful, humorous, principled, deeply believer and heartfelt person who you can't imagine he could even do anything to a fly.
I regularly get to see how many former Domspatzen still make regular contact with him today, 23 years after he was emailed, visit him, read to him - he is almost blind - and treat him like a member of their family.
So those who, to this day, do not forgive him for once being strict with them are clearly in the minority.
Most Domspatzen are grateful to him today for enriching their lives and bringing them the world of music.
And that he was always a good, vexatious teacher - a strict father, certainly, that may be - but also a lovely respect person to whom they still look up today and whom they downright worship.
And please, again, let me be very clear: All you accuse him of is educational methods that were on the agenda at the time.
We can be glad that we have long since overcome this time.
But it is highly unfair to make a man, just because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother, a media scapegoat.
The evil intent behind this is all too obvious.
Because the report that has just been published relieves it.
Now the decency would be to finally leave a 93-year-old man who has earned great merit and without whom, outside of Bavaria and perhaps Germany, no one would probably know the Regensburger Domspatzen, at last in peace.
