Munich 1856: Four cards, which change your view of the city
An lunatic asylum, where today young people are to meet.
A grave chapel, where now for the rapid-transit railway tunnel one digs.
Garden plot holders manage the former ground of farmers.
The oldest official map of Munich promotes exciting stories to day.
It makes nervous, if maps are not current.
That knows everyone, which had to excite itself already, because the car Navi showed a green meadow instead of a by-pass road.
The historical maps of the digital Bavaria Atlases, an offer of the Geo portal Bavaria of the state government, are everything but up-to-date - nevertheless straight therefore very informative.
Particularly if one compares it with current online cards.
Then becomes clear, like cities and communities in the circulation area of Münchner Merkur since that 19. Century changed.
The digital Bavaria Atlas is a patch carpet, which one recognizes as such not directly.
Into the large general map for cities and communities more detailed cards, were trained so-called Urpositionsblätter.
These developed according to the Bavarian measurement administration between 1810 and 1864 and rise from the first measurement of Bavaria.
Their client: Napoleon.
The French army leader occupied Bavaria for the spring 1800 during the second coalition war with Austria.
Napoleon desired an overview of the occupied country and gave a topographic survey of Bavaria in order - natural for military purposes.
Even if the French troops with the peace finally took off from Lunéville from 9 February 1801: Were the today's neighbours, that created the idea of a surface covering Bavaria map.
Cure prince Max of IVTH Joseph continued to advance the project, created the “topographic office” - and thus the Bavarian measurement administration.
The Urpositionsblatt for Munich originates from the year 1856 and is like all different one on the web page of the Bavarian federal state library to be found.
The comparison early one/today is by the example of the state capital at the eindrücklichsten.
The city expanded in all directions and grew together.
An example of it is Untersendling, which emerges in the map in an isolated manner from 1856 still relatively.
Transmission Ling was thus suburbanized 21 years after production of the map, 1877, as Munich quarter.
Today Untersendling lies in the middle in the city.
The houses Untersendlings concentrate around 1856 along the today's Plinganserstraße, which only 1878 was designated after Georg Sebastian Plinganser, a leader of the rebellion of the Bavarian farmers against Austria 1705.
Where today the west park is, one does not see anything as fields - at first sight: With the Hineinzoomen a more compartmentalized map with dozens appears lines and numbers: handwritten numbered field parts from the so-called “Uraufnahme”, from which the real estate tax was derived.
Small plots occupy there today no more farmers - garden plot holders of the plant separate “country in sun”.
A large green area appears north of Untersendling.
The Theresienwiese, since 1810 scene of the Octoberfest, was in 19. Century actually still another meadow - and no sea of concrete.
On the other side of the Isar the historical map gives an idea of history to the psychiatric medicine.
In the Urpositionsblatt one reads the street name in the area of the today's district outer-Haidhausen not only “at the gas paste” or from the hill “on air” - but also in large letter “erring institute”.
Yes, here to the Auerfeldstraße locked up one once humans with illusion conceptions.
There 1858/59 Munich the circle lunatic asylum had developed “on the Auer air”.
Starting from 1872 Dr. Bernhard von Gudden led the facility - that psychiatrist, who is brought in connection with death by king of Ludwig II.
“It was progressive for its time and terminated for example a chaining so-called erring.
In addition it forbade to use force against the passengers”, says Hermann Wilhelm, Leiter of the museum Haidhausen, which was occupied for an exhibition with the institute to staff.
For 280 patients first place had been, later on 500 places had been extended.
Sometime also this capacity was not enough any longer to out the reason for the building of the circle lunatic asylum in hair 1905.
There the Isar Amper clinical center Munich east, one is the largest Psychiatrien Germany since 2006.
On the area of the former Auer institute now young people in Munich the Salesianum meet.
The medal acquired the building complex 1920 and converted it into a youth centre with companies that takes on trainees.
West the football field of the TSV Munich east lies, east houses from the 1980er years.
one established the child house “Casa Don Bosco” to 2015 - in architectural support to the building of origins of the lunatic asylum, which in the Second World War with bomb attacks one had destroyed.
Marienplatz was registered around 1856 as “head place”, the chewing finger route was called “chewing finger lane”.
A crucial change brought the Second World War also in the heart of Munich.
The bombs of the allied ones tore many holes in December 1944 into the city center.
A large remained until today - at the Marienhof.
The English Institut, small firms and a grave chapel from the Middle Ages stood once at the Marienhof, where these days the preliminary work take place and on 5 April 2017 the cut of the spade for the second rapid-transit railway original route.
With the slider the old Munich map can be compared with the aerial photograph today - and be filled up the hole at the Marienhof.
Civil rights group publishes travel advisory for Missouri
The national combination for the promotion of colored ones issued a warning for colored humans, who travel due to the discriminating policy and the racist attacks of the state after Missouri.
“the NAACP Travel Advisory for the Federal State Missouri, which is to go in effect by 28 August 2017, requests afro American traveler, visitor and Missourianer to bring up with travels by the state special attention and to let extreme caution reign, there a set of doubtful, race-based incidents lately in the entire state to occur and be noted here”, is called it in the statement of the group.
A recently passed law of Missouri, which make it heavier for humans to win discrimination complaints as well as the law enforcement agencies of the state, which aim at minorities disproportionately, arranged the group to publish the travel advisory said the NAACP.
“You have injuries of the civil rights, which pass humans.
They will become because of their skin color continued, them beaten up or killed”, said the president the Missouri of the NAACP, Rod Chapel, Kansas City star.
“We hear complaints in such a frequency, which we did not hear yet.”
It is first such warning, which issued the organization for a state in the USA.
The group quoted incidents like racist offences against black students at the University OF Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died under doubtful circumstances at the beginning of the year, after it had no more gasoline during the travel by the state and by the police of Missouri in safekeeping was taken, without a crime to be accused of.
The advice refers also to recent a report of the office of the prosecutor general von Missouri appeared, in whom it is shown that black drivers in the State of 75 percent are stopped more frequently than white ones.
“The recommendation is that humans are conscious and their families, friends and employee about it inform, what in Missouri happen could”, said Chapel.
“The people must be ready whether it bring along bail money or lets the relatives know that they travel by the state.”
Missouri registered 2015 100 hate crimes, after the newest numbers from the hate crime report program the FBI, in the year those the state regarding the number of such injuries on the 16. Rank of the country classify.
The travel advisory is also an answer to a new Missouri law, which would make it more difficult to sue an enterprise because of housing or occupation discrimination.
Before the American civil Liberties union (ACLU) had published travel advisories for Texas and Arizona, after the states had adopted immigration laws, which obligate local law enforcement agencies to arrest humans because of immigration offences which will contribute in opinion of the ACLU to the further race shaping.
Travel advisories are usually issued by the State Department for other countries, but lately to have groups of interests the measure as reaction to certain laws and trends within the USA assigned.
Pasture fence project is elementary
The Fischerbacher pasture fence project is a success project and in the coming year is continued.
The CDU Members of the Bundestag Peter Weiß and Kordula Kovac provided locally a picture.
With the right ditch yard of the family Schwendemann representatives of the Fischerbacher CDU Ortsverbands as well as mayor Thomas Schneider and the two delegates met.
Markus Schwendemann granted first insights of his enterprise, in which he accommodates 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares forest managed, 40 milk cows and just as many young animals supplied and in five apartments of holidays guests.
The “Black Forest milk” is for it the alternativeless marketing way for the milk of its cows, like that Schwendemann.
On the table of the holidays guests comes excluding regional.
Since he is also a BLHV chairman von Fischerbach, he called the pasture fence project “elementarily importantly”.
I cannot keep house on such steep surfaces profitably.
The grassland surface provides for much work, much must with the trimmer be worked on.
“We have here with the conditions and with topography to fight”, stressed Schwendemann.
2003 he took over and manages the parental enterprise these without chemical plant protection and fertilizer, even if he do not lead a bio enterprise.
For mayors Thomas Schneider was clear: “The municipality recognized and is glad the meaning of the pasture fence project over the Leader promotion”.
With costs from 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare the farmers would have to be supported.
One hopes that thereby the afforestation of the surfaces could be protracted still quite a while.
“The largest treasure which we, are the people, which work in the agriculture and think about it, have like it their enterprise continue to bring”, stressed the mayor.
The farmers often stand because of the promotion in the criticism
Over the pasture fence promotion in the year 2013 altogether 25 plots were enclosed of eleven participants.
The keeping open surface amounts to thereby 40 hectares, which may not to be afforested until at least 2023.
Half was promoted by the total costs at a value of 71,500 euros by means of Leader, a quarter carried the community Fischer brook.
Thus remain to the farmers 12,610 euros, which had to invest it into 16.2 kilometers pasture fence.
“The large advantage is the longevity of the fences”, explained Schwendemann.
Kordula Kovac stressed: “You do not make a correctly good job, without farmers and farmer women go it”.
Also for Peter Weiß was certain: “Here best food is produced”.
The landscape conservation guideline (LPR) Baden-Wuerttemberg makes the national promotion possible of pasture fences.
A goal is keeping the Black Forest open.
A condition is the presence of one of the LPR designated promotion backdrop.
In addition the surface which can be enclosed may be not schlepperbewirtschaftbar (slope angle over 35 percent) and must with it be threatened by the afforestation.
For the Fischerbacher pasture fence project 2018 runs at present the request from eight participants with 24 plots, which would like scarcely 16 kilometers fence to build.
The keeping open surface corresponds 35 hectare, the calculated costs lies with more than 112,000 euros.
Is more holy nothing?
Now the white house of Trump plans the Statue of Liberty
The safest indication of a regime change is it, if they begin to attack the Statuen.
The Americans estimate these just like every different one - from there the carefully produced fall Saddam Husseins on the Firdos place in Bagdad in the year 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the Trump regime, surely knew, what he did, when he took a symbolic axe in a heated controversy with Jim Acosta of CNN over the proposals of the president to the drastic restriction of the legal immigration also to the Statue of Liberty.
In order to remain fair, Miller did not attack the Statue themselves.
A horde of owners of boat and Liberty Imitatoren would have lynched it, if it had done it.
But it attacked their meaning, and in particular the meaning, which was attributed it, when the famous poem was added of Emma Lazarus's 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, its basis.
As Miller Acosta insulted: “I do not want to deal here with a complete thing over history, but the Statue of Liberty is… a symbol of American freedom, which illuminates the world.
The poem, to which you refer, was added later and not part of the original Statue of Liberty is.”
Miller lies essentially correctly, but like it formulated, not really does not go it around history.
The poorest ones go to the arms around the contemporary resonance on the arousing words from Lazarus, which only, in those a State of not only any old immigrants in-loads, but: “Your tired ones, your arms,/your pressed masses, which long themselves to breathe freely/the miserable waste of your rich coasts.”
There was never a time, in which the “miserable waste” was to be seen on our screens better.
Miller did not engage itself in literary criticism - it made clear that these people are not welcome in Trumps the USA.
This conflict because of the meaning of a Statue is part of a broader political and cultural argument: It is indeed a conflict around the meaning America.
Lazarus - and their friends, who used itself to place their words after their death at the basis - knew very well that they carried out a high-political action.
The sculpture should show the connections between French and American republic anise mash, by representing the female embodiment of the freedom in a worn out classical figurative representation.
Lazarus changed this meaning: In its poem the female figure is no longer abstract - it received a voice.
And it gives itself completely different name: Mother of the expatriates.
The connection of the poem with the picture is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on the American nativism.
And exactly like Lazarus the meaning of the Statue changed, wanted the people of the right wing this for a long time to change back.
The large squaller Rush Limbaugh, a kind Johannes of the Baptist for coming Trump, argued 2010 that the Statue of Liberty does not invite anybody, but rather an early neo-conservative one is, which brings the American flame into the umnachtete world: “Lady Liberty precedes.
It is to carry the torch of the freedom of the United States into the rest of the world.
The torch is not to illuminate the way into the United States.”
Limbaugh is rather unusually here discovered something.
The meaning of the Statue is absolutely a question of the point of view of the perception.
The large fantasyful act of Lazarus consisted of seeing it in such a way like it from the exhausted, miserable, but hopeful humans after long and often terrible travels on the deck by ships one saw.
It concerns to see the world from the perspective from humans in the truest sense to look for the refuge and an opportunity to improve their life.
Their Statue speaks the words of the hope and the welcome, which they must hear to them.
And that is naturally not the perspective, which Miller and Trump would like to ever recognize.
Their torch is to illuminate not the way, but to ignite the hate, which is their only source of power.
World championship 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish members of the team of Great Britain
Eilidh Doyle remembers a time, when only two Scots belonged to the team of Great Britain
The director of achievement of the track-and-field events of the united Kingdom of, Neil Black, says that the 16-member Scottish contingent in the world championship cadre will make “a solid contribution to the team”.
A record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017, which starts on Friday.
Black believes that “in Scotland something special must learn itself developed” and the track-and-field events of the united kingdom somewhat from it.
“We welcome it, and we try to understand it, and we become it would drive on, until we find it out,” said Black.
“I speak with people in the Scottish of institutes OF sport and her think that it has to do something with, what it did.
The Scottish athletes think that it has to do something with, what it did.
British track-and-field events: It has to do something with, what it to have done.
And also with the type at the street corner.
Whatever the combination of the circumstances is, it is absolutely brilliant.”
Several of the Scottish athletes are medal candidates, among them Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will begin against sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m distance, while Eilidh Doyle was selected from the crew to the team captain.
“Eilidh is rather modest.
Their captain speech was unbelievable”, says Black.
“A set of athletes, all the same whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train it went out of the area and felt very proudly and was very motivated.
The passion and the genuine feeling, which completely naturally brought in Eilidh, were great.”
The Commonwealth silver medal winner, who will begin with its fifth world championships with the 400-m-Hürden, says that it is “unbelievable” that 16 Scots are in the British crew.
Scotland best total number at athletes with the world championship was seven, which 1983 and 2015 were reached.
The medium range runner Muir leads this way and last year five British and two European records set up.
It will participate in the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m runs.
Chris O'Hare, which runs 1,500 m, is a further Scot, whom one should observe after a great season, which contained the victory with British the team Trials and the Anniversary Games.
Doyle remembers its first world championships, when the only other Scot was in the team Lee McConnell.
The captain says the fact that she is “enormously proud” on the fact that many of her compatriots do not only belong to the team but in some cases also with the medals and with the finals will mix together.
“The special to it team captain to be, lies in the fact that she was selected by the other members of the team, so that it was a large honour anyway to know but the fact that my team colleagues voted for me and to have selected, makes, added me it somewhat completely special one for me” her.
“Obvious am very proud I on all the Scots, who belong to the team.
It shows only, how far we came.
And they are here as established athletes, athletes, which want to rise to podiums.
What my speech as a captain concerns?
Yes, I think, her went well.
I only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation, since we have a home world championship.
It is thus really important to set on this home support and profit from it that we are again in the Olympic Stadium.
I get a second chance to go out and compete there and it simply so a great atmosphere there outside will be.”
Block from critics over Facebook: Do not apply you for a public office, if you cannot stand a heating of voters
The father of our country knew something from bad press.
The Americans loved George Washington, but it lasted not for a long time, until the newspapers struck it because of everything, from the home policy to its political principles.
It grumbled with the criticism, reliably.
But it did not hush its critics.
Because in the year 1783 Washington said: “The free speech can be taken away - and be become, stupidly and mutely we like the sheep led to the slaughtering.”
That brings me to Maryland to governor Larry Hogan, who must work to be more like Washington.
Hogans employees blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people, who expressed their opinion on its official Facebook side.
And the American civil Liberties union sued it therefore earlier this week.
The staff of the governor dismissed the complaint as frivolous, and the online comment was full from a counterreaction with “well, and?” .
“It is only Facebook”, said many people.
But it is important.
And it is particularly important, if it is a type such as Hogan.
This is a republican governor in an overwhelming democratic state, which likes amazingly is.
It has the second highest agreement of the 50 governors of the nation.
Hogan is not reactionary hothead.
It showed a firm hand with the guidance of its state and strict adherence to the principles.
He was also very skillful to use Facebook as primary means in order to connect themselves with its voters and debut easily its hairless head after chemotherapy on its side.
Therefore is blocking of people, who come on the side of the governor - which is a public forum, that as official are designated and from employees, who are paid with public tax dollars - unnecessarily and finally dangerously.
In an interview with The Washington Post defended Hogans spokeswoman Amelia Chasse the actions of the governor and argued that the blocking of the comments was nothing else as a presentation.
But it is too simple to use the picture from trolls or spammers or hater-filled people to which swing online the whip.
The post office spoke with some the real people, which were blocked by Hogan.
And those are only genuine humans, who speak with their selected leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur and a minister, no trolls.
They all said that their comments were respectfully, thoughtfully and not everyday.
The minister quoted the Bible in its post office and appealed at Hogans to catholic faith.
Woman barrister Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, MD., was not hater-filled, but her asked for hate crimes.
“I commentated politely that I was disappointed that there was, wrote no reaction to hate crimes and other last news” it within the comment range of the newscast “The post office”.
“I estimate this idea also, if a number from people takes position to the same topic, then it of some rather as a so-called collective employment am ignored and not as a large group of citizens concerned am not recognized”.
Which the employees of the governor called “concentrated Spam attack”, others would probably call “advocacy”.
The Facebook era makes it simple to cut a message by being blocked simply a critic or a negative comment is deleted.
It is many cleaner than in earlier time, if one had done the same that employees were sent, in order to collect and burn newspapers with critical editorials or demonstrators arrest and to the silence bring.
But straight happens exactly digitally.
Hogan is not the first public an official, who for the fact it is criticized that he insulted Facebook and other social media.
President Trump is sued by Twitter users, who were blocked by its Twitter feed.
One of the first milestones in this question fell last week in Virginia.
The chairman the board of the OF of supervisor of the Loudoun County injured the roofridge the Amendment, according to US-Bezirksrichter James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when she banished a voter from her Facebook side.
And in Kentucky governor Matt Bevin (R) also a visit received from the ACLU because of his use of Facebook and Twitter.
That should not be so difficult.
At present Washington had the time of affordable postage a similar effect as the Internet.
The number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letter writers hit his guidance.
And even at that time Washington had anonymous trolls.
The people, which used aliases like “Yuri cola drinks”, “Valerius”, “Belisarius” and “Portius”, wrote all letters at newspapers, which annihilated Washington's decisions.
Petitions, those its point of view over the contract of Amity, which trade and the navigation criticized with Great Britain, overwhelmed its office, according to the historical documents, which were collected of online papers of George Washington Project.
But it did not hush it.
Free speech, difference of opinion and discourses belong to the basis of our nation.
And true guidance means to accept.
Ronan Rafferty hopes for domestic comfort in Renaissance the club
The former European No. 1 Ronan Rafferty will hope in the next three days for domestic comfort, there the Renaissance club in East Lothian the 25. Edition of the Scottish senior open organizes.
The north Irish, who led last year next door in the Archerfield left up to the final round, before he lost against Paul Eales, is with the new venue connected and of the club founder and CEOs Jerry Sarvadi functions as a tournament Ambassador in the name.
“I saw, how the Renaissance club was built, and we to see, like it with this event its fame reached”, said Rafferty.
“The players will see this course from his best side, are it in a great condition.
Jerry made a great job, when he specified this place.
He is an eager advocate of this play and is proudly on his achievement here.
This is a great shop window for this course.”
The Englishman Eales looks forward to defend for the first time a championship although it won in its 32-year old career both with the European tour and with the European Challenge tour.
“”, Said in Southport resident players feel really particularly on.
“I could not defend the Extremadura open, since she was taken in the year, after I had won her, from the program.
Back to this part of the world to come is magic.
It is a wonderful place to golves.
The memories from the last year return, and it was something special for me and my Mrs. Sharon to win last year here.
It was a really special time and one, which we will always estimate.”
Gary Orr, after its 50. Birthday in former times in this year to the European senior tour came, returns to the action on homeland ground.
This event will its first Scottish appearance since the Aberdeen ate management Scottish open in the year 2013 to be.
“It means always a little more, if you play at home”, said Orr, the man from Helensburgh.
“You want to make it good, but you feel also this additional pressure.
I have to play it again really enjoyed, and I played a solid a gulf.
I am gladly over it, like it so far went.”
With the trio on the field the former Masters winner is Ian Woosnam and the senior major Champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and former Ryder Cup-Kapitän SAM Torrance belong to the six Scots on the field, the others are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.

Fewer cancer of the lungs dead by passive smoking
In the past two decades less and less humans died because of passive smoking at cancer of the lungs.
To this result scientists of the university clinic Hamburg Eppendorf (UKE) in a study come.
“According to our estimations 167 cancer of the lungs deaths are to passive smoking to attribute”, said directors of studies Heiko Becher per year.
As comparison it consulted its own study to this topic of 1994.
At that time it gave still 400 cancer of the lungs deaths because of passive smoking per year in Germany.
The new investigation is in “internationally the journal OF Public Health” published.
Annexes prove as very complex
The construction work in the Villinger road is in full course and “to some extent lies in the time”, so the director/conductor of the building yard Fred Heinze.
In the range of the annexes the situation is assumed more complicated than, since in the underground much hides itself, what not in the plans is noted.
The traffic, which obstructs the construction work again and again, represents a large problem for the construction crew of the company Stumpp.
“The ignorance of the drivers before red traffic lights and stopper grids is already enormous”, reports Heinze.
The road is closed and only the regular buses is justified to the passage.
Angelo Caruso, Marvin Kostorz and Tim Kostorz of the company Stumpp are busy for weeks with the work on the bridge.
“The hot days were already completely beautiful exerting.
But fortunately we were supplied by our friend Fritz Matt with cool mineral water”, tell Marvin Kostorz.
Poverty and death in the Indonesian gold country
If Bardina Degei cooks the dinner, she does not use a stove.
It uses a pot even only rarely.
In her timber building in Enarotali, the housewife puts normally a sweetpotato - locally called “nota” - to the capital of the Paniai regency in the jerky Indonesian province Papua directly into the fire-place.
After a half hour the charred tuber with eager, unwashed hands is taken and devoured.
Degei sits on the loamy soil - it does not have furniture - where it implements also her daily work, e.g. To wash dresses with cloudy water from that close convenient sump.
A bucket in a roofless area serves as latrine.
As youngest of the four wives of their man you were assigned no fields.
Polygamy is here usual.
Naturally can work late to be dangerous: Most village men are unemployed, and many drink heavily, and there are here the soldiers.
“Nobody dares it, after 17 o'clock in the village to run around”, says it.
It is a rare insight of the daily life in the highland of Papua, a former Dutch colony, which was taken up 1969 after a disputed referendum to Indonesia, when only 1,026 oldest ones should co-ordinate by a public hand collection before the occupation troops.
An existing movement, which stirred up for independence against the Dutch rule, turned fast against the government of Jakarta, that maintains control of the region and foreign journalists or right observer excludes from it.
In the year 2003 the province was divided officially in Papua and west Papua, whereby the independent part of Papua New Guinea covered the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is as been a long way as it desert is. The travel contains a 90-minute flight from the provincial capital Jayapura after Nabire and then a morning 5-hour drive with the rental car.
There are no public means of transport.
The city with approximately 19,000 inhabitants consists of timber buildings, which are surrounded by bamboo fences, and of corrugated iron roofs, which were converted by rust into different yellow-brown tones.
Only very few Indonesians made here their travel, let alone for journalists and practically no foreigners.
Before Christian missionaries arrived, Mee Pago Papuans admired a God named Uga Tamee.
There were also different changes.
“We were not accustomed to carry this clothes”, say Degei and point to their lively, handwoven turban, their dark shirt and their bright skirt.
“Early one we had only sheets at our bodies.”
Papua is of Indonesia poorest province, where 28% of humans under the poverty line live and some the worst child number of deaths and literacy rates in Asia have.
But it is also of Indonesia gold country.
The largest and most profitable gold mine of the world, grass mountain, in the possession of the Freeport McMoran from Phoenix, is appropriate for only 60 miles remotely from Paniai, a highland province in the size of New Jersey with 153.000 inhabitants.
However in the year 2015 Freeport in the value of 3.1 billion reduced US Dollar gold and copper.
Beyond that Papua has wood resources in the value of estimated 78 billion US Dollar.
These wealth is however a source of the misery for the Papua, which guarantee that of Indonesia retains powerful military a suffocating presence.
An investigation of 2005 in New York Times reported that Freeport local military personnel and units paid between 1998 and 2004 nearly 20 million US Dollar, among them up to 150.000 US Dollar to only one officer.
Papuani demands for larger autonomy threaten this golden goose and are merciless treated.
According to information from activists more than 500,000 Papua were killed and thousands since 1969 by the Indonesian military were raped, tortured and arrested.
Mass killings in Papuas master highland into the 1970-er years became in accordance with the Asia human rights commission the genocide.
However in the region the Indonesian police arrested last year more than 3,900 peaceful demonstrators.
“We all losing” is called it in a report of the archdiocese Brisbane from the year 2016, in which reports over atrocities of the previous year are contained, as for instance illegal executions and torture - rape and electrical impacts are according to another report particularly like - and brutal striking down of peaceful demonstrations.
“It is difficult to count the number of victims there each week of incidents passes”, says Andreas Harsono, Indonesien-Forscher for Human Rights Watch.
The screws strengthened, since Papuas bring an inflow of settlers from other parts of Indonesia to resources.
The population of 3.5 million inhabitant of the province is Christian to 83%, but the demographic development changes, since Muslim Wirtschaftsmigranten of the densely populated islands Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi comes.
Javanesi Warung cafeterias sell roasted chicken and Gado Gado, a mixed vegetable with peanut sauce served.
Local one of people fight to keep up over here.
“The Migranten began to sell chickens and vegetables on the traditional market more cheaply than the local Papua”, explains Abeth You, a 24-year old Paniai native one, which pulled into the provincial capital Jayapura to the work.
“It cost the native Papua - the mummy mummy [the women] of Papua - its market.”
The Indonesian president Joko Widodo, in the vernacular as Jokowi admits, promised during its election campaign 2014 the inequalities and the law breakings in Papua to concern.
The former Carpenter secured altogether 29 districts of Papua - including Paniai - on the way to the presidential palace in Jakarta for 27 that.
But changed little in Papua, and today the native ones feel cheated.
“Our hearts are broken, because we tuned 2014 for Jokowi, with expectation that it will fulfill our hopes that the justice is restored”, says You.
Paniai actually suffered only two months after Jokowis inauguration in October a low point.
On 7 December 2014 was a group of 11 children outside and sang Christmas carols before a campfire in Enarotali, when two Indonesian soldiers on a motorcycle broke by the darkness.
The frightened children told them that they should switch their headlights on.
One of the soldiers took impact at their tone and returned later with four soldiers, so the local minister Yavedt Tebai.
The soldiers, who had drunk, hunted and struck the group with their rifle butts, said victims and witnesses.
Then one of the soldiers fired into the group of the children.
A child, the 16-year old Yulianus Yeimo, was so heavily struck that it fell in coma.
A few hours later the building of the close convenient government commission3 was set in fire and the things escalated on the next day.
Approximately 1,000 young Papua of men, women and children met on a football field before the local police station and the military command center, in order to demand justice.
They carried ceremonial hunt sheets and demonstrated the Waita dance - in the circle constantly and a birdsong imitating - of Papuas Mee Pago trunk.
Some demonstrators began to hurl stones on police and military posts.
When the tendency was heated, the soldiers an instruction was sent over an internal radio: “If the masses more than three times resistance carry out, shoot them them dead”, are called it in an official document of TIME, which was not released to the local media.
Yeremias Kayame, 56, the director/conductor of the Kego of Koto quarter of Enarotali, saw the threatening danger and called after peace and requested the quantity to return home.
Nobody was to be listened in the tendency.
“As I turned, I suddenly into my left wrist was shot”, said he TIME on the porch of its multicolored painted timber building.
Kayame white yet, who fired, but does not say that the ball came from the numbers of the soldiers met here.
“, Many shots were overcrowded were fired”, add it.
The native man Alfius Youw was met three times, so his cousin, the witness of the shooting was.
“I ran to him and examined his body, in order to go surely that it was it”, said the Yohanes's, who carries like many Indonesians only one name TIME in dark tendency.
“I saw that he was dead… I had him kissed.”
The chief inspector of the Papua police, Yotje Mende, said Reportern that its officers “secure” their station only wanted, because them are attacked.
“We must defend ourselves, if humans threaten, us to kill”, said the spokesman of the Papua police, commissioner Pudjo Sulistiyo, in the year 2015.
“It is a matter of life and death.”
According to Human Rights Watch five young demonstrators were killed and many further were injured.
The news over the killings came only on the following day 'filtered' to Jakarta.
Jokowi in Jayapura held three weeks a passionate speech, in which he expressed and swore sympathies for the families of the victims, the historical drawbacks in Papua to concern.
“I would like that this case is solved immediately, so that it will not in the future any longer happen”, said it.
Safety Minister Wiranto said in October 2016 that he for the settlement of historical violations of human rights furnish a mechanism out of court.
But the excuses began nearly immediately.
“Most injuries arose long ago.
Some were in the 90-ern and at the beginning of the 2000-er years.
The point is that we obligated us to concern these offences but there are processes, which will go through must”, said he.
Then Wiranto did not make a retreat, when he spoke and said on 5 June in Jakarta with TIME, it has plans to furnish in Papua a complaint mechanism.
Instead “everything is regulated legally”, said it.
Wiranto, which the UN accused of “crimes against the humanity”, which claimed more than 1,000 victims in of East Timor bloody independence vote of 1999, said that 11 cases were already settled by violations of human rights in Papua, including the Paniai incident.
Families of the Paniai victims received such statements with furious incredulity.
“I was interviewed four times in the last three years, but there was no progress”, says Yohanes.
“I am tired.”
He says that he lives years later still in fear.
“I have fear”, say he.
“I have fear by the military to be arrested have fear, to be shot.”
Its brother Yacobus repeated the opinion that humans in Paniai have fear to discuss the incident.
He says that he was struck by the military, after he helped four of the victims to bury.
“After I had buried the corpses, looked for the military for me”, say he.
The shootings did not stop.
On Tuesday the Indonesian police shot at villagers in Paniais neighbourhood Deiyai.
During a confrontation between villagers and the manager of a building firm, which refused itself bringing an unconscious man in the hospital a person died and 17 other one was injured, among them also children.
The man, the 24-year old Ravianus Douw, which had drowned, when he fished into close convenient river, died on the way in the hospital.
Excited villagers protested before the location office of the enterprise.
The police said that the villagers stones threw on officers, who reacted to by firing warning shots.
But native ones say that the mobile brigade (Indonesian paramilitary police) began to shoot at the quantity and one killed.
“We were so in panic, we have fear that it will give revenge”, says the 29-year old Dominggu Badii, which in the proximity of the hospital lives and was a witness, how the injured ones were admitted here fast are so the TIME.
“I hid myself two days in my house.”
The Deiyai parliament called to pull the officers involved to the account and to withdraw the mobile brigade of the police from the area.
Paniai was always an unrest stove for the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development strengthens the discontent of the master members Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal, which live in the green highland of Papua.
Many followed the “free Papua movement” (OPM), the rebel army, which stated, to defend the rights of the Papua by activating sporadic attacks and kidnappings of Indonesian soldiers.
Some the Top OPM leader originate from Paniai, under it Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
As reaction to it in the last years thousands of humans were arrested in Paniai and taken arbitrarily in safekeeping, under the pretext of the “protection of the national sovereignty”.
Some never dip.
Among humans in Papua Paniai is well-known as “a tragic, forgotten place”.
Poverty strengthens the discontent.
Little rice, which is sold in Enarotali, is too expensive for native ones.
Bread is just as out of reach.
Humans cultivate everything here, which they eat: above all Nota and fruit and leaf vegetable.
The agriculture is the task of the women, who can work on in each case four or five fields of the sweetpotato.
They keep the majority of the harvest for the family, while the rest on the local market is sold.
Ten pieces of Nota cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
In the run economic inequalities were up to the time between the native Papua and the new Migranten, which arrived since the opening of new air lanes to the airport Nabire in larger number.
The few jobs, which there are in the region, usually go to the better trained and wealthier Migranten.
Papua have rarely the capital or the necessary abilities, in order to lead their own enterprises competitively.
“The young people are not interested in the village to remain… give it here no jobs or money”, say John Gobai, the chairman of the master advice of Paniai.
Isolation thinks the eyes of the world far of Papua.
Beyond that restrictions of the reporting remain international media tensely.
Beginning of the year the French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were deported because of a lack of co-ordination with related institutions from Papua, although rare permission for filming was given to them.
According to Phelim Kine, the deputy director of Asia of Human Rights Watch, the promises of Jokowis election campaign to waive the restrictions of the reporting in order to promote transparency and development, not realized.
“There are new dangers for foreign journalists, who try, to report of Indonesia jerky easternmost provinces from Papua and Westpapua to tries: ,” He said visa refusal and a black list in an explanation.
Press control lacking means that the international pressure remains to the Indonesian government to a large extent to the direct neighbours Papuas limited.
In March six Pacific states - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands islands - requested the UN-Menschenrechtsrat to examine the “different and wide-spread injuries” in Papua including the Paniai shooting.
The same countries supported historically seen the OPM.
The spokesman of the Indonesian State Department Arrmanatha Nasir rejected the reproaches of the group and said journalists in Jakarta: “In Indonesia a democratic system is still valid, and there are free media, so that it is difficult, to hush up the proofs for cases of human right.”
Humans locally want that more foreign governments take this to the knowledge.
When an official delegation from the Netherlands, under which line of human right Ambassador Kees Van Baar visited, Jayapura on 4 May, broke native their being silent and pressed him “we want freedom”, in accordance with a source, which participated also in the meeting, but to remain anonymous would like.
Indonesia has 2019 a further presidential election, but the Papua to say that they will not be correct probably again for Jokowi.
“Jokowi is humans, who have good intentions, but he is surrounded by the people, which are involved in the Paniai shots, say” Gobai, the chairman of the master advice.
It wants the fact that Jokowi knows that the Paniai people apart from the fact that it lives under the constant threat of a predatory military, in poor education and health services is.
Gobai says that the Paniai people, as other Papua regards, its voice for Jokowi than a “debt”, which he must pay back.
“You do not need money, it want only justice”, say it.
Despite the threats and intimidations families of the Paniai Schussopfer implemented a last symbolic act of the defiance: the corpse of a victim was buried exactly on an area in relation to the police and the military station.
They know that justice will perhaps never come to them, but at least do not let it the responsible persons their crimes not forget.
“A member of our family was killed”, says Yacobus with lowered head.
“Which we can otherwise still do?”
Fires seize the 'Torch' skyscraper of Dubai for the second time
A fire found its Durchbuch on Friday in one of the highest apartment towers of the world in Dubai and forced hundreds of inhabitants to flee from the 337-meter-high, 79-story buildings.
It is the second fire, which sweeps in only two years by the multistoried building, which one calls coincidentally the Torch Tower (torch tower).
The building was evacuated, injuries were not announced, and there was no direct word over the cause of the flame.
“We slept and we with the fire alarm and when crying the people rose.
We ran the stairs down, and it took about 10 minutes, over from the 50. Floor to come downward”, told an inhabitant, that indicated its name as George, Reuters.
Dubais civil defense authorities said that the units of the fire fighting deleted around 4.00 o'clock local time (00,00 o'clock GMT) the fire and cooled the building down.
The government said, it works on the supply of accommodation for the concerning.
The incident can revive questions for the security of materials, which are around the world used in external areas by multistoried buildings.
An investigation by the management of the Torch building after its fire in the year 2015 showed that the largest part of the damage of the lining, which external lining came to the decoration or isolation.
In Great Britain the police, it said believed that the system of the plates could have contributed to the isolation and lining at the London Grenfell tower in June to the rapid propagation of a fire, with which about 80 humans died.
No Davis Cup reform: Far Best OF five
The president of the international tennis federation (ITF) fell through with its large Davis Cup coup at the general assembly.
With the meeting in Ho-Chi-Minh-city the proposal revolutionary for this sport play Davis Cup single only on two profit rates gauzily not supported by the necessary two-thirds majority.
Those often much are enough, but remain especially also therefore very estimated five-sentence classical author to the Traditionsbewerb thus.
63.54 percent of the member countries tuned for the reform, which became a goal of ITF president David Haggerty from there only scarcely missed.
“We respect this decision, but are disappointed that our member nations did not accept the entire reform package for Davis Cup and Fed Cup.
We need a change to secure, around the long-term future of these iconic and historical competitions”, said Haggerty.
One will further work on it, applies to improve.
Not even to the vote to many objections already the proposal had come deliver the final at a neutral place.
Starting from 2018 only comparatively smaller details are new: Thus the finalists in Davis Cup and Fed Cup will in the future have the host right in the following year in the first round.
In order to reduce the costs of the organizers, the requirements in things of training places etc. will become facilitated and the players before Davis Cup less official medium dates to complete to have.
More than 1 of 5 US-travelers brings forbidden articles in the airplane, finds a survey out
A survey among flight passengers showed that more consciously or unconsciously forbidden articles at the inspection points of US Transportation Security administration smuggled than 20 percent past, among them at least 6 percent, who entered the airplane, while they carried inadvertently forbidden measurers or other articles with blade.
Maintained less than 1 percent, they would late have discovered that they had traveled erroneously with firearms, ammunition or explosive.
The survey with more than 1.000 people - of a jet charter service, which Stratos Jet charter Inc. was accomplished., - also stated that younger travelers ignore rather the rules.
Of the asked ones, the additions that they tried knowingly to fly with something which was forbidden of the TSA were 19.7 percent of Millennials, compared to less than 15 percent, which were members of the generation X.
The most frequent articles, which were intentionally smuggled through at TSA agents, were food and liquids.
More than 3 percent addition knowingly articles with blade by the security check to have carried while 2.2 percent of the female asked ones and 3.7 percent of the male asked ones confirmed also that they would have brought intentionally forbidden drugs into the airplane.
The enterprise said, it had asked travelers generally speaking country, in order to find out, how many would have brought inadvertently smuggled goods by airport security and how many would intentionally have done it.
It is not a surprise that humans, who carried earliest smuggled goods - knowing or unknowingly - by security, those were, which most frequently fly.
The enterprise points out however that the TSA guidelines are somewhat complicated and confusing.
Humans are often uncertain, who liquids may carry it forward or like much of it.
It is thus no surprise that the largest quantity of the TSA seized articles forbidden liquids are.
Long the people, the TSA thought a time could books as smuggled goods view.
Liquids are illegal on inland flights, however on international flights.
Elon Musk is all the same it: Tens of thousands teslums customers cancellation order
Electrical genious Elon Musk indicates gladly as the enormous number of advance orders for his new teslums “model 3”.
It suppressed so far that a part of the customers withdrew their noncommittal reservation already again.
Apart from the always triumphal numbers to increases in sales and still more gigantic paragraph goals teslums boss of Elon Musk betrayed another, less glossful number for the first time with the publication of the recent quarter balance: those of the cancellations with the new mass-market model 3.
Musk had promoted in the past months frequently with more than 500,000 advance orders for the new car, whose distribution straight begins.
Now Musk grants: From that altogether 518,000 advance orders 63,000 was already again withdrawn.
Critics had pointed out again and again that it concerns only noncommittal reservations.
With a cancellation teslums pay the 1000 euros (in the USA 1000 US Dollar and in Great Britain 1000 pound) to “reservation pre-payment back” completely.
At present 455,000 of such noncommittal reservations would be present, granted Musk in a telephone conference call with analysts.
That the cancellation from so far approximately twelve percent of all orders could become the problem, the teslums boss does not believe however.
Its argument: The challenge with the ambitious growth targets is not with the demand, but on the production side.
Last year teslums delivered 84,000 vehicles.
2018 should be it - all models collected - 500,000, 2020 one million.
Obviously there the demand for it is.
According to Musk at present 1800 reservations are added per day.
Who orders today a “model 3”, may count at the earliest in the second half year 2018 on the distribution - if teslums it create, its brand-new, to drive in practice production roads without larger interruptions with maximum extent of utilization, not tested ever.
Many experts doubt that is possible.
If it comes however to larger delays, then the noncommitment of the reservations could become the problem for teslums.
Because then the enterprise cannot prevent dissatisfied customers to run away in flocks.
EPA boss of Pruitt withdraws itself because of protraction RNS the rules of the Obama Era for the decrease of the emissions
One day, after he by 15 states had been sued, Scott Pruitt, the boss of the environmental protection agency, its earlier decision took back to delay the conversion of the rules of the Obama era in order to reduce the emissions smog of causing air pollutants.
Pruitt presented the change, when its agency proved to the needs of the national environmental protection authorities opposite faster-reacting than past administrations.
He did not mention the complaint, which had been raised against its previous place in a Federal Court of Appeal.
It concerns one eke out, which ran off on 1 October for states, in order to keep the standards of 2015 for near-surface ozone.
Pruitt announced the plan in June that he will delay the observance around one year to study and over avoid in order to give to his authority more time, “into local decisions to interfere or the economic growth obstruct”.
Pruitt, which was before its appointment by president Donald Trump public prosecutor of Oklahoma, was long time a reliable opponent of stricter environmental standards.
Since its arrival in Washington Pruitt is repetitive changed over to block or delay adjustments, which the chemical industry and the industry of the fossil combustibles oppose.
The sudden reversal of Wednesday is the recent legal setback for the Pruitts regulatory rollback agenda.
Last month a Federal Court of Appeal in Washington decided that the EPA manager exceeded his authority, when he tried the conversion of a rule of the Obama administration, which obligated oil and gas companies to the monitoring and reduction of methane leakages to delay.
In one at Wednesday evening suggested Pruitt published statement that its about-face strengthens the very easy readiness of the EPA for co-operation with the states with ozone standards by the complex process of the punctual fulfillment of the new standards.
“Under earlier administrations the EPA often did not keep an eking out for execution and then for did not wait by activists groups and others to be accused and in an agreement for execution to specify”, Pruitt, who sued the EPA more than one dozen mark in its previous job, said the date.
“We do not believe in an adjustment by legal proceedings, and we take an eking out seriously.
We take also the law and the authority, which give it to us, seriously.”
The statement of the EPA meant nevertheless that Pruitt will sometime use its “power for delay and all different legally the available authority”, in order to guarantee that the regulations are based “on a solid policy and the best available information”.
The republicans in the congress urge on a more comprehensive revised version of the ozone rules.
In the last month an authorized bill is to delay the conversion of the rules of 2015 around at least eight years.
The measure was not placed in the senate yet to the vote.
The New Yorker one prosecutor general Eric Schneiderman, who led the coalition of the states, which had this week sued the EPA, said, the group intends to maintain the legal pressure.
“The reversal of the EPA - after our complaints - is an important profit for the health and security of these 6.7 million new Yorkern and over 115 million the Americans, who are affected by the smog directly, which flows, said into their communities” Schneiderman.
Followed New York in this case California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvanien, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington and the District OF Columbia.
Ground ozone develops, if pollutants from cars, power stations, oil refineries, chemical plants and other sources in the atmosphere react to sunlight.
The developing smog can cause serious breathing problems at sensitive groups of humans, and contribute each year to thousands of premature deaths.
Representatives of the public health service and the environmentalist were jubilant over Pruitts surprising change of course.
“It is disturbingly, how much pressure needs it, around this reasonable step of the responsible person for the protection of air, we inhales to received”, said Lori Ann Burd of the center for Biological Diversity.
“We must fight to far against the ideological crusade of the Trump government, at polluters and their special interests to curry favour”.
Tumlingen celebrates 750 years St. Hilarius church
750 years St. Hilarius church: On the occasion of the anniversary of the mountain church on the old cemetery area into Tumlingen on Sunday, 16 July is invited, at 16.30 o'clock to a serenade.
Whether its idyllic situation and nice view on the locality the historical St. Hilarius plant are a popular place for staying.
The visitors of the sixth benefit serenade can let themselves be bewitched from this strong place.
The rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the place made the friends and promoter Tumlingens its request.
Walter Martini stresses: “It is a singular village jewel”.
In the year 1267 the St. Hilariuskapelle was mentioned documentary for the first time in the Württembergian document book: Count Hermann von Sulz sold “the mountain with the parish church present at it to Tumlingen including the Vogtei” at master degrees Eberhard von Horb and to its brother Dietrich for 20 Mark Silber.
For the wording after the document mountain stood except the former parish church also a manorial yard, to that the church or the patronage right belonged and in reverse on the Tumlinger.
Thus also humans lived there.
How from the description of the upper office Freudenstadt of 1858 follows, the “mountain” was third, the manorial settlement core of the village beside the Unterdorf and the upper village, which is to be recognized today in the view of a place of Tumlingen just.
Old cards from the time around the year 1600 support these historical conditions.
The patronage right developed from the earlymedieval self-canon law.
A gentleman, who built, equipped and with a minister occupied a church, remained further owner of this church and could also leave this self-church.
With it the right was connected to use or to the bishop a new minister suggest a minister.
Three altars gave it in the church and two bells on the tower.
The larger one of the two burst at Christmas 1673.
The again purchased bell sounded then for the first time 1692, had to be delivered however later in the Second World War in the year 1942.
In the 30-year old war (1616 to 1648) the windowpanes were hit and the bell rope was stolen.
The roof was leaky.
1796 stored French troops in the proximity of the church.
They knocked out the pulpit and church chairs and used them as firewood.
Remnants of the church threatened to collapse 1809.
Until 1869 the Tumlinger served Hilarius cemetery also as final resting place for the dead from Hörschweiler.
1823 were extended the cemetery and the Hilariuskirche was canceled.
Only one left the steeple untouched.
In the New Year's Night 1834 a storm split the steeple and half collapsed.
In order to prevent an accident, the tower was canceled.
Only the still today existing tower dwarf remained old church history as a witness of the 750 years.
Today Horst Kallenberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem of the “Schaffigen maintain pensioners” as successors of Dieter Dockhorn the Hilarius plant.
As organizers the friends and promoter invite Tumlingens on Sunday, 16 July, to the sixth serenade on the old cemetery to the St. Hilariuskapelle.
This is arranged of the Combo of the Kepler High School Freudenstadt and with oral contributions of Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis.
Local chief Hartmut Romann speaks the conclusion.
The program begins at 16.30 o'clock.
Admit is starting from 15.30 o'clock.
To the serenade takes place a drink before the cemetery ended.
A “one summer evening under the shade of old trees and with the far view over meadows to the forest”, the organizers the fantastic prospect put enjoying out you.
The serenade takes place only at dry weather.
The organizers hope for many supporters for the receipt of the historical St. Hilarius plant, which for Tumlingen and Hörschweiler is of importance.
The friends and promoter Tumlingens feel the homeland care particularly obligated, how serenade organizer affirms Walter Martini.
Club wants to let approval of windwheels check
“Boisheim does not resist” sees a legal condition for the building and has itself from there to the district administrator eloquently.
The club “Boisheim resists” district administrator Andreas Coenen (CDU) requested to take its approval back for the establishment of planned wind-power plants into the Boisheimer nice ones.
It took place illegally.
The club argues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 into the Boisheimer nice ones no wind-power plants could have been approved, since at the time in Viersen at the city boundary to Schwalmtal a wind force concentration zone had only existed.
Within this concentration zone are building and enterprise of wind energy plants in principle possible, at the same time cause the concentration zone however an exclusion of the wind power utilization for the remaining city.
Such zones are to prevent a “Verspargelung” of the landscape.
The city Viersen had decided few days before by a change of the land use plan a second wind force concentration zone into the Boisheimer nice ones - which however did not have the district government Duesseldorf approved, because of a formal defect.
“By the missing planning related condition the given notice of approval is still illegal and therefore to also take back”, said Christoph Erkens, chairman of “Boisheim resists”.
Current conditions of the things: The town councillor decided the wind concentration zone again before the summer break into the Boisheimer nice ones; an approval of the district government is still pending.
Erkens: “With it here the distribution of an approval for the establishment is excluded from wind energy plants planning related”.
The circle confirms the entrance of the request.
“The appropriate letters were received since past week at the circle Viersen”, explained a spokesman.
The circle uses it as an opportunity to check the affair again.
They do not lead however presumably to the fact that the procedure is stopped.
With view of current procedures with the Administrative Court itself the circle did not want on Thursday contentwise to the argumentation of the club “Boisheim resists” to express.
Those NEW RH, a subsidiary that NEW ONES, plans the building of four ever 200-meter-high windwheels on a surface to the Boisheimer nice ones.
Already last year the enterprise, in which the city Viersen is indirectly involved, had closed leases with the owner about 65 hectares of the large area.
With establishment of the four wind energy plants requirements of electric current are to be able to be covered by approximately 11,400 households - corresponds approximately fifth of requirements of electric current of all Viersener of households.
Those NEW RH wants approximately 20 million euros to invest.
In the past summer Viersens town councillor gave green light for to the purchase of three wind-power plants in the wind farm the Linnich with Aachen as well as a participation in a wind energy plant in Übach Palenberg in the circle Heinsberg.

City and resellers plan a “homeland shopping” - weekend
Bath Langensalzaer and humans from the region are to again discover the shopping facilities in the city center in September.
The tradesman's union and the city administration want to use the weekend on 8 and 9 September, in order to lure the inhabitants to the shopping trip into the city center.

The action does not only aim at inhabitants of the city and the closer region.
In preparation advertising spots are in the radio, an Internet video and printed on bags, which refer to the action weekend, thus Christian König.
City administration and tradesman's union cooperate thereby with the Chamber of Commerce and industrie.
Thus the tradesman's union and the city go into a further stage of the project “attractive city center”.
In addition new offers belong like the first “active day” to the Fountain Festival including Sunday opening, discussions with all manufacturing ones and landlords, in order to move it to the active participation.
Also attractive offers to Saturday and the renouncement of parking fees on this day are part of the concept.
Besides customer potentials are to be opened again or again.
In addition cure guests and tourists belong.
In addition, many native ones would have lost the city center when buying from the view.
In the end all would have to contribute to encourage the city center - up to landlords, the enterprises of the whole city and clubs.
It is valid to overcome with a network the lethargy which partly spread, king in the spring had said.
Birgit Streich, Leiterin of the IHK center in Mühlhausen communicated that itself to country wide third “homeland shopping” - day, for the first time five Thuringians of cities take part.

Trump pressurized Mexico after oozed Transkripten of telephone calls because of the payment of the border wall
Transkripte of telephone calls between US president Donald Trump and Führern of Mexico and Australia were published by Washington Post.
On 27 January Trump in a telephone call with the Mexican president requested Enrique Pena Nieto to stop to say publicly that it would not pay for a planned border wall.
The US president insulted it, because he had publicly denounced the wall. According to reports he told him: “That you cannot say to the press.”
Trump started its presidency campaign with the promise to establish at the southern border of the USA a wall and swore, to let Mexico pay for the project.
Transkripte of its first call with the Australian prime minister Malcolm Turnbull were published likewise and revealed a strained exchange.
Mr. Trump said Mr. Turnbull that a trade for the USA is ridiculously”, “badly” and “stupid” refugees, who emigrated to Australia to take over “and that insisting on the trade, which was obtained by the government Obama would let it look like a “twit”, after he had suggested a prohibition of the resettlement of refugees into the USA.
Mr. Trump terminated the call, after it had said Mr. Turnbull, “that is the most unpleasant call for all day long.”
Moorland Ford massacre: Activists lead racist lynching act as call for justice
A 1948-er Ford Mercury drove by a group from spectators in the rural Monroe, Georgia, and rumbled on the Ford bridge of moorlands too.
Before the car, which had four black passengers and a white driver, could reach the bridge, a group of white men with rifles stepped out, in order to block its way.
The leader of the Mobs - a man of middle age in a pinstripe suit - took a long course at its cigar and looked searchingly by the windshield.
Inside the passengers in fear floated.
“We want this n --- r Roger!” the man roared.
“Get it from the car!”
Cries tore the silence up, when a young black man was pulled by the passenger seat.
Fortunately this terrible scene, which was played on 22 July, is only one adjustment.
But if a loop is then thrown around the neck by “Roger”, nearly all sighs very genuine in the audience discharged.
Since 2005 civil rights activists to the Moore's Ford Bridge return, in order to copy the night, at which two black pairs - Roger and Dorothy Malcom as well as George and Mae Murray Dorsey - were lynched by the Ku Klux clan in the year 1946.
Nobody was ever accused of the murders.
“It is really incomprehensible that in all these years not one person was arrested - although we see it in our communities, although we know, who it are”, said Tyrone Brooks, who helps the adjustment at the organization.
“It is a stain on a history, but it is a load for our souls.”
Brooks is long a 71-year old former congressional representative of the State of Georgia and a life civil rights activists.
For it the adjustment serves as a dramatic call for acting and represents an annual memory to the Monroe community that injustice was never corrected.
“We want prosecution, we want the completion, we want healing, we want reconciliation, but first we must receive justice”, said it.
“We cannot arrive at healing and reconciliation, receive to we justice.”
A forensic pathologist puts a bed cloth over the corpse one of the victims of the moorland Ford lynching on 27 July 1946.
According to FBI documents, which became to receive the NBC from news, more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding counties during the lynching process were suspected.
But none was ever accused.
Although the suspects remain for decades on free foot, civil rights activists say that the double motivation for the lynching actions in the whole city always admits was: Politics and sex.
In April 1946 a decision of the highest one made the Gerichtshofs's black citizen possible in Georgia it for the first time to deliver at the preselection fight in the summer their voice.
Approximately at the same time as the choice the FBI the black farm tenant Roger Malcom stabbed a white basic owner, Barnett Hester, during a fight - allegedly because of a woman according to.
Brooks said, which is rumor in the city been that Hester with Malcoms Mrs. Dorothy slept and that the baby, who carried it came not from its man.
On 25 July 1946 Loy Harrison, a prominent white landowner, 600 dollar paid, in order to release Malcom from the prison, so the FBI.
It was accompanied by Dorothy and their cousin Mae Murray and George Dorsey to the prison.
But when they departed then from the prison and approached the Moore's Ford Bridge, a lynching mobilization surrounded the car.
“As it turns out, was it Harrison, which the murders prepared and” from this a FBI report arranged, closes.
“It is also obvious that there was a plot between the national and local prosecution, which was not only involved in the murders proofs eliminated and the identity of witnesses hushed up”.
Brooks formulates it still more concisely.
“It was a right to vote massacre”, said it.
“You were killed all, in order to send a message to black people in this community: “If you to register leave yourselves and if to co-ordinate, then that will pass here you to you.”
Nearly one decade long led Cassandra Greene the annual adjustment of the moorlands Ford Bridge lynching murders.
Their representation is descriptive, moving and is justified in a kind of deep racism, of which many would like to believe that he does not exist in America any longer.
It is difficult to watch to look away and still more with difficulty but it said Greene that is the point.
“We do not want to talk about lynching, because we are then confronted with its ugliness in all of us”, told them.
“However I cannot develop relationship with you, if you did not like to listen to me or not to hear to want, what I went through”.
The samples for production of this year began in June, and on the first day nearly 30 actors - a dozen white one and the rest black one - pushed themselves into an area and listened, when Greene started a well brought in overview of the piece.
Wade Marbaugh is here Greenes CO-director.
It played the role of the chief clan member for years, but he said, the role becomes never simpler.
“I feel dirtily, because I am not like that”, said Marbaugh.
“However I think, it am very important to receive this history alive because we would not like to return to these times.”
On the other side of the area the actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, which played Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester, rehearsed their lines.
The piece begins with Malcom, which shouts at Hester and it pressed, furiously that it slept with his Mrs. Dorothy.
“I said, n -- it, disappear from my property!”
Rascona answers the fire.
There is a break.
And then everyone (at least all black actors) breaks out in laughters.
Greene laughs loudest.
“Which?! ”, Rascona asked.
It is alarmed and confused.
Was I too hard?
“No”, Greene said, still giggling.
“I do not believe simply that white people at that time 'n -- it' said.”
“Nevertheless”, one of the other black actors joked.
“You must only meet hard 'R.'.”
And the energy in the area, a feeling of the comradeship shifts exactly there replaces the uneasiness.
Everyone is busy to manage this correctly not only because of the play, but also because of the memory of four killed humans.
The scene begins again.
This time, if Rascona says the n-word, he says it sharply and with reproduction.
Absolutely nobody laughs.
This repetition ends violent and fast.
There are cries, shots and then silence.
A woman, dressed in a mourning dress, stands over the corpses of the actors and implements Billie Holidays's mourning praise speech “strand Fruit”.
Their voice breaks with each second word.
A group of approximately four dozen spectators sweat and tears wipes itself approximately hundred meters behind it out of sight.
The audience is nearly evenly divided between black and Weis.
A pair traveled from Ithaca, New York, in order to see the performance, many comes down only the road.
They experienced all almost eight hours long Georgia's oppressive humidity, if Brooks leads them on a pilgrim travel to the burial places of the Malcoms and Dorseys.
Up to this point the murders remained an anecdote, but now, if one stands on the same country, where the lynching murders took place, feels air eeriely.
If the last notes of the song end, Greene loads the quantity in to come more near and examine the bodies.
Children squat at their heads, register the falsified blood and the quiet bodies and whisper each other too.
“You are not really dead”, murmur a small boy, as if it wants to remember.
After some minutes Greene thanks the quantity - and suddenly is it past.
The actors throw the lynching rope away and wipe their tears off.
Bradshaw embraces Marbaugh, the man in the suit, which played the clan member.
Nick Rascona embraces two its fellow player and breaks down then in their arms crying, the emotional load of the performance breaks through finally with him.
“It is okay”, whispers one of the women.
“We know that in your heart does not lie.
You did for a reason.”
Later the audience with the actors builds itself up with dinner.
At a table a white pair from Atlanta chats lively over the adjustment with a black pair, which they became acquainted with straight.
Denise Duplinski fought to find words which feeling left the performance.
“It is heavy to hear these terrible words and acts… from people to come, which look like you and which, because they look as you” in such a way, said they do that.
“Which really does with me, leaves me to believe that lynching continues still”, added it, “today only police shooting called.”
In the same area Tyrone Brooks's yard holds at his table, it eats and reminds of the civil rights.
He said, he had already begun to plan the performance in the next year.
“The adjustment is in certain way inspiring, because it describes the fright of what we bore, but it is also one moment of learning”, said it.
“It is like that, if we do not learn anything from it, then can it again pass.
Who does not study its own history, who does not know its own history, is condemned to repeat she.”
“Twilight of the gods” reconciled the Wagnerianer in Bayreuth
Also in the fourth part of Richard Wagners's monumental work director sets Frank Castorf on a multicolored-frivolous production before gigantic, six-floor backdrop.
The revolving stage (arranges from Aleksandar Denic) shows alternatively a shabby street corner including wall rest and kebab shop in Berlin, “plastics and Elaste” - a logo from GDR times or the New York Stock Exchange.
Before it an open Mercedes old timer, in which the Rhine maidens pose as Rockergirls, or alternatively a Isetta parks.
Stacked oil drums remind of Castorf leitmotiv - money, power and greed - which itself by its “ring” - production pulls.
The three Rhine maidens - sung of Stephanie Houtzeel, Wiebke Lehmkuhl and Alexandra Steiner - harmonize as already in the “Rhine gold” marvelous.
Breezly they would proceed Siegfried (Stefan Vinke), pull in Hollywood manners a corpse into the trunk and give the Krawallo clique.
Stephen Milling sings wonderful nasty Hagen, which the aura of a heavyweight boxer surrounds.
Brutally the scene, when it kills Siegfried.
Later also still Gunther (Markus Eiche) must believe to.
The audience thanks it the ensemble with strong applause.
Stormily to be celebrated Foster, Milling, Vinke and conductor Janowski, which itself modestly and which bows hands forming to the Merkel lozenge.
There is large applause for the festival orchestra, which shows up for the first time on the stage - in view of the large heat again in casual leisure wear.
With tension expected was the appearance of Frank Castorf and its direction team.
If it had had 2013 still another gellendes whistling and booing over itself be issued to let, there was five years later large jubilation, in which the isolated “Buh” - calls went down.
Festival boss Katharina Wagner might have been pleased about it.
“One notices that the audience with “the ring grew together” in certain way”, had it shortly before the performance of the DPA said.
The audience did not only make a form of peace with Castorf, but also an understanding for its aspect grew.
I make a positive summary.
Max of quantity works as a volunteer
They work in their volunteer year equal on several places.
Where everywhere?
Quantity: Normally in stone ford in the furniture stock exchange, once in the week I help out here in Greven in the furniture bridge.
And I already worked in the open complete day on the school.
How are your experiences thereby?
Quantity: It is a beautiful, broad spectrum, which I see here.
I have to do with different people, with young people, with refugees, with young adults.
They are now 26 years, thus a latedestined volunteer.
How does that come?
Quantity: I made Abitur.
And then, we say a civil engineer study times, successfully canceled.
I have for me recognized that it is the wrong for me and I want to make something else, with humans to work.
And then I asked myself, what you make.
Make a social year, there gives it an insight, there can one to see, like it locally, in the focus perhaps also, real is.
And was it like that?
Quantity: I collected great impressions.
I will start my study in the winter semester in the social matters.
I will binarily study, probably make in the youth welfare office Herne social worker training and study in Hamm at the college of further education.
Isn't it somewhat unusual to have during the volunteer service several different places of work?
Quantity: Yes, it is very variable.
It depends probably always on where one makes its FSJ.
One can make it from the old people's home up to the youth employment - in all possible facets of the social work.
With me it was very varied.
I was also partly in the OGS, thus in in the afternoon support.
For me that was exactly the correct, which provoked me.
I could recognize and see my own strengths, how it really runs off.
Differently than in the civil engineer study?
Quantity: Obviously, here it concerns not to calculate Statiken.
One has again and again different humans before the head, who have in each case completely different history behind itself.
Whether a refugee, whether a young person, who from the family got out actual one must deal always individually with it.
Very interesting.
And you did not have fears of contact?
Quantity: But I am not the type.
It is a range, which gives a much.
Much love, much friendliness.
There are also times negative moments, but so is that life just.
Pearson shortens further 3,000 jobs and shortens the dividend, in order to revive the business
The British education formation of Pearson said on Friday, it further 3,000 jobs to reduce and their interim dividend by 72 percent shorten, since a further restructuring program is started, in order to overcome the pressure, with which the enterprise is confronted.
The downsizing, which general manager John Fallon announced predominantly for at the end of 2018 and at the beginning of 2019, comes additionally to its previous restructuring, with which already 4,000 places were lost.
Pearson announced a plan in May in a third reduction of costs program for reduction of costs around further 300 million pound (394 million US Dollar), in order to encourage a business again, which was met by the fast step for digital learning.
The enterprise, which had sold its participation in Penguin Random House to the partner Bertelsmann in the past month, said that the view was unchanged for the financial year, after it obtained an increase from 1 percent to 2.05 billion pound in the first half-year.
Convoy attack of Kabul: NATO soldier with suicide attack killed
A suicide bomber attacked a military convoy in the Afghan capital Kabul, a soldier of NATO killed and several different injured, says officials.
Five soldiers and an interpreter were injured, communicated an explanation of NATO.
According to unconfirmed local reports Qarabagh also three civilians died with the incident in the quarter.
Bombardment is the last act of violence, which met Afghanistan this month - on Tuesday more than 30 humans in a mosque in Herat were killed.
On Monday a suicide bomber killed two humans in the proximity of the Iraqi message in Kabul.
In a statement of NATO it, those means explosion on Thursday evening is happened, as a common patrol with the Afghan army of “an improvised explosive device” carried of people was attacked”.
The statement means that all injured ones are in a stable condition and are treated in the US-Militärkrankenhaus on the airfield Bagram.
Correspondents say that the increasing strength the Taliban and the group, which as so-called Islamic State of (IS) in Qarabagh admits is, a great concern for the NATO troops in close convenient Bagram is.
According to the United Nations there were at least 1,662 civilian victims in Afghanistan in the first half-year 2017, of it about 20% in the capital.
At the end of July killed a suicide car bomb at least 30 humans in a mainly Shiite district of Kabul.
The Taliban said, they would have implemented this attack.
To 31. May killed an enormous bombardment in the center of the city more than 150 humans with the deadliest militant attack of the country, since the US-led troops 2001 displaced the Taliban of power.
The force underlines the precarious security situation in Afghanistan, since US president Donald Trump weighs, the number of the US-troops, which support military and police in the country to increase.
Correspondents say that the suicide attacks in Kabul caused a crisis of public trust in the last weeks also into the government, their politics and in particular into the call of president Ashraf Ghani.
EPA turns around decision for the delay of the smog rule after complaints
The US-American environmental protection agency has a decision to delay an adjustment of the government from Obama to waived, according to which the states are obligated to dam the smog-causing emissions. This taken place one day, after 15 states sued the agency because of the step.
The EPA announced late on Wednesday the decision to advance the so-called “ozone regulations 2015” and said, it shows the obligation of the agency to co-operate with states.
“We believe in the dialogue also and in it that we react to EPA boss of Scott Pruitt in an explanation to our national partners”, said.
To delay Pruitt had announced the intention of the EPA, which ozone regulations - in those in a part of the country pollutant emissions to be measured are, to keep to specify in order where cuts must be made in June, in order stricter air quality standards - around one year by October 2018.
A group of 15 to a large extent democratic states, together with which district of Colombia submitted, on Tuesday complaint and it said that the effort was illegal.
The government of president Donald Trump tried, a wide range of environmental regulations, which the former imposed president Barack Obama, as part of a broader agenda, which according to Trump the economic growth to set in motion is, to go back.
The efforts caused however the setback of the democrats and conservation groups, who worry themselves over the effects of larger emissions on the public health.
The web page of the EPA says the fact that the inhalation of air contains, ozone “the lung function to reduce and can strengthen the respiration symptoms” like for example asthma.
Local council wants common room
In the end the decision was clear: With two dissenting votes the local council of Fluorn Winzeln decides the facility of a common room in the future senior housing complex.
Before the discussion there is important information: The sales contract for the still which is missing part of an estate, reports mayor Bernhard Tjaden is signed.
It will still last, until those is so far the parish belonging surface in the community possession, but gives it now no planning obstacle for the project which can be lifted from a private investor to more.
But there is a discussion concerning a common room.
One of the two investors, who are still in the boat, offered, to come the community against.
In the ground floor it would make a living space - approximately 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace available with nevertheless 70 square meters of surface for a special price.
The administration and the majority of the local council floats forwards to plan such a common room just not as meeting place only for the inhabitants of senior-fair living but openly into the community inside.
As an example the word of the “cord café” made the round.
The decision, which was already before-before by the supply of means for the current household in the past autumn, is sweetened by promotion possibilities.
The building lies in the redevelopment area.
The facility of a common room would be, then Tjaden reports, with 60 percent of 30 percent eligibly.
The resolution proposal sees, in order to signal to the investor that one does not want to throw in this regard clubs to it between the legs, the statement forwards the fact that both saddle - which ajar against the environment land development actual and monopitch roof - which reduces height of building and which more economical building makes - would be possible.
Unnecessarily, then Wilfried Sohmer does not only mean, is this additive.
If it helps: Unanimously it passes the committee.
Not so simply it goes with the common room.
Daniela Ruf refers to the many own buildings, with which one does not come so quite in front, but leans one now with the common room from the window, says themselves her: “I have trouble thereby”.
Yvonne Staiger speaks herself absolutely for the common room out however absolutely against a local participation.
She sees behind it a covered subsidy to anyway wealthy ones or foreign investors.
That is not just like that, because with the acquisition one gives no subsidy to the surface, but gets a genuine equivalent marketable in the case of doubt, reads the counter declaration.
Staigers request to split up the resolution proposal accordingly finds three proponents.
Thus it remains with two dissenting votes with the original program, which summarizes Stefan Haller in such a way: “If we the resolution seize, make we a giant step in such a way to close a giant gap in our infrastructure”.

In the resin from star to star hike
In the resin that is to develop country widely first “star path”.
The club observatory plans these sank Andreas mountain.
There is a planet way in Goettingen - since 2003.
A “star path” comes to meet the need for information of many resin visitors, it was said.
It connect nature, science, movement and sporty achievement.
The members want to set up and whereupon about stars and constellations inform boards along the planned route.
In a first phase until 2018 the club plans “well attainable installations at five to six places” in the Upper Harz.
St. Andreas mountain, brown situation, Hohegeiß and Sieber would be applicable.
The information on the boards is to be supplemented by Internet.
Therefore a good Mobil net receipt plays a role with the location selection.
Also accessibility is a criterion.
Later the star path is to be extended step by step.
“On the star path the viewers experience much worth knowing, for example over the physics of the single stars”, explained the club.
Besides they learned, why stars would have different colors or why a star shone more strongly than another, although it continues to lie substantially remotely.
One mediate also, in which constellation is a selected star and when he is to be seen best.
The club operates already since 2014 in the mountain small town St. Andreas mountain the most highly convenient observatory of Northern Germany.
The location in the national park resin ranks in the middle according to the federal office for nature conservation among the six darkest regions in Germany.
Frequently from there the Milky Way and even the Andromeda Galaxy are to be seen with the naked eye clearly from.
In the university city there is something something similar since 2003 on initiative of aid association planetarium Goettingen as the planned star tow - the planet way.
Beginning before Gebhards hotel in the Goethe avenue, which forms the inside of our solar system, leads the planet way with its Stelen to up to the shark mountain and to the observatory - as well as a “extraterrestial” location in Diemarden (community resembling) with the planet Sedna.
The Stelen with the individual planets - inclusive the Pluto at the terminal, degraded to the dwarf planet - are accurately in the distance and standard from one set up to two billion.
The earth shrinks in such a way on a ball of 6,5 millimeters of diameters, while those removes accurately 75 meters standing sun nevertheless 70 centimeters does without.
The entire distance of the planet way amounts to well four kilometers.
While the light from sun to the Pluto needs about eight hours, pedestrians need a good hour up to the Stele with Pluto.
Pedestrians are thus faster than the light in the universe.
The march to the next fixed star however would take still another half year.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for the first time, discuss a possible showdown
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, which should be located in a collision course, in order to produce the most exciting boxing match in the near future under 147 pound, met for the first time on Thursday.
They were to be welcomed in separate areas in ESPN offices in Los Angeles, until Garcia, the unbeaten World Boxing Council lightweight category champion, the corridor went down, in order Lomachenko, the World Boxing organization superfeatherweight champion.
After Garcias victory by unanimous resolution over the former four-division world champion Adrien Broner on Saturday on show time both fighters of members of the Top five are Pound for Pound list.

I wish you much luck.”
Lomachenko defends its belt against Miguel Marriaga on Saturday evening at 19 o'clock on ESPN.
When the pair for photos posed, Lomachenko manager noticed Egis climate that a possible showdown between the fighters would be the “perfect order of magnitude”.
“I am a former featherweight”, reminded Garcia.
“I ascended for Broner [on 140 pound], but I am not so large.
I am small for 140.
I would like to come down on lightweight category.
And it must move on Leichtgewichtler [135 pound] and fight then we.
The fans require.
Let us them that give.”
Lomachenko agreed.
“Boxes needs this fight.”
Climates, whether it should be on Pay by View, part of a strategy, which must fight to Lomachenko with a 135-Pfund-Debüt in this year, asked in order in the next summer with Garcia a date to agree (37-0, 30 Knockouts) also the interests in the fight against the winner from Jorge Linares-Luke Campbell for their lightweight category title fight in the forum on 23 September has.
“This fight could take place in the Pay by View mode, because all fans asked Garcia for it”, said and expressed itself later openly to fight with the network which offers the best financial package.
We are the best ones.
No other names can produce this kind of attention.
Whenever they are ready… “
Garcia said, he estimated Lomachenko as “an enormous fighter”, and he will possibly participate in his Saturday fight.
But Lomachenko stopped with that generous praise for Garcia and said that he think, the three-combat champion from Riverside looks very slow ", I'm sorry Mikey… you wanted the Ko-from”.
Garcia said, the focus is to show impact strength then boxes.

Fortunas Hoffmann: “Straight three-man backfield works better”
Andre Hoffmann hopes after the 2:2 to the season opener against Braunschweig that the optimization brings in Aue points to the defense formation.
With the first game of the season Andre Hoffmann was contently, with the result also, not the two goals for the other side with the 2:2 against Braunschweig would have been there.
“That were two goals for the other side too much, and we must watch out in Aue still better”, say the defender of Fortuna Duesseldorf.
In the Erzgebirge the straight three-man backfield is to be also further optimized.
And the Fortunen wants to catch itself a gate after a free kick also not more.
“For the future it will like that be that none places itself to more beside Michael (Rensing) on the line.”
Hoffmann is convinced that its crew gets along also after the experiences in the preparation with the straight three-man backfield better, as with the back four.
“Still white I as we in Aue will not act”, says his coach Friedhelm Funkel, but Hoffmann is safe itself of its thing, “because we straight in the straight three-man backfield on the half positions in Kaan Ayhan and Niko Gießelmann player have, who can develop well”, said Hoffmann.
A “condition is, but that we harmonize still better and we do not afford in the structure so many playing errors.”
Naturally also Hoffmann drives to Aue, in order to win the play.
“Whether one cannot speak however after a standoff of a failed start, white.
The achievement could be quite okay”, meant Hoffmann.
“Case we however on Sunday with four points to stand there and us on the cup to concentrate can be able to speak, become we surely of a tidy season opener.”
Of it coach did not want to be anything to know.
“The start into the season I judge only after six to eight play days”, said to Friedhelm Funkel, who would not like to speak of an advantage opposite Aue, only because the play of Saxony in Heidenheim because of a tempest be canceled prematurely had.
“Now they can begin the season quasi with a home game”, said Funkel and Hoffmann believe that the players from Aue could be perhaps even somewhat fresher, since they would not have a heavy and complete play such as Fortuna against an ascent favorite in the bones.
“However they do not know so 100-percent where it stand at present”, say the interior defender of the Fortuna.
The guests go out of the Rhineland as more easily favorite on Sunday into the meeting into finite (nearly) manufacture stadium of Aue.
“That we sweep it away, only because we have the requirement to come under the first six are nonsense”, say let us sparkle, whose balance is quite positive with only one defeat against Aue from nine plays.
“There is no crew in the 2nd Bundesliga, which one must strike from the beginning”, explains Fortunas chief coach.
“Such a statement to meet would be arrogant and practice substantial”.
And in such a way sparkle its players want on Sunday in no case to experience.
New results of the Swedish asylum age evaluation tests publishes
The recent results of tests for asylum-seekers in Sweden, who were submitted of a new method for the medical evaluation of their age, show that more are older as 80 percent of tested people than 18 years. But everyone does not believe in the accuracy of these results.
The Swedish authority for forensic medicine (Rättsmedicinalverket) began with the execution of the tests last year.
They are to make the estimate of the age more exact during the asylum proceeding, after the Swedish migration authority (Migrationsverket) was criticized because of errors with the evaluation of the correct age of some refugees, who were under age.
Until today Migrationsverket sent 6,880 cases away which can be tested and published forum SIC Medicine Agency now the results of altogether 2,481 tests from the time of in the middle of March by 31 July 2017.
Eighty percent (2002) as 18 or it was older judged while in further 25 cases judged forum SIC Medicine Agency that the person was older possibly “18 years or”.
In 432 cases was the conclusion that the person is old possibly “under 18 years”.
The tests are accomplished only in cases, in which the age of the person is placed in question.
According to Johan Göransson of forum SIC Medicine Agency, are steady the results at the past months.
“We do not see a big difference in the statistics of the past months, the numbers are rather constant”, said it to the magazine The local one.
The high portion of cases, in which the person was judged as over 18 years, does not mean necessarily that the asylum seeker lied over his age.
In May the agency published the results of 581 tests and said that it gives 442 cases, which suggest “that the examined person is older 18 years or”.
When Svenska Dagbladet the 581 published the newspaper results examined, them stated that in 243 of these cases the person had openly said that them become 18 years old in this year.
The method of the medical age evaluation, with which radiographs by wisdom teeth and MRT photographs of knee joints are made, which are then analyzed by dentists and radiologists, became also within some ranges criticized.
A sceptic is the Endokrinologe Claude Marcus of the Karolinska institute, whose work covers the evaluation the biological ripe one of humans, in order to see whether they went sooner or later as usual through puberty.
“I had reason to think about it and I did not believe that the kind of the measurement should be used.
The biological age to judge in this way, is very uncertain.
If we cannot say it surely, we should not do in such a way, as if we could do, said it” it the newspaper Metro.
Göransson of forum SIC Medicine Agency defended however the accuracy of the tests: “Generally you can say that the risk is small to judge a child as adults incorrectly.
The largest risk is appropriate in it, if the person is scarce under 18, in this case is this for approximately 10 percent.”
Fully in the plan
The work on the three bridges of the highway 108 between Lauterbach and Schramberg advances well.
On Wednesday seven tons a heavy concrete part at the bridge at the eastern local entrance was installed by Lauterbach.
“We are very well in the time, it run super”, say Reinhold Leicht, Bauleiter at the department of roads and traffic in the district administration Freiburg.
In April the work began at the same time at all three bridges in need of rehabilitation between Schramberg and Lauterbach.
The building is intended for Octobers and easy is sure itself that the schedule is kept.
The first bridge, coming from Schramberg, leads across the Trombach.
It is a vault arch bridge from concrete, that with red new red sandstone is disguised and has an overall length of 4.80 meters.
She was built in the year 1900.
Like the two other bridges also, it came meanwhile into the years.
In order to ensure the stability and the road safety, the three buildings are now thoroughly reorganized.
The two other bridges lead across Lauterbach.
They are built from red new red sandstone.
Both were established in the year 1939 and are twelve, and/or 10.60 meters long.
The bridge at the local entrance of Lauterbach received a heavy so-called bridge cap to 1,30-meter-wide and seven tons now on Wednesday morning on the north side.
That is an edge attachment, which is used also as operating way.
At the southern part of the bridge a 2,20-meter-wide bridge cap is to be used on Friday.
Whereupon the footpath is to then run.
The special to it is that it concerns thereby finished parts, a patent of the Schramberger company Dizwo.

Prince Henrik does not want a grave beside his wife
The man of the Danish queen Margrethe (77), prince Henrik (83), wants to be buried after his death not beside his wife.
That communicated the royal house on Thursday.
Traditionally the Danish pair of kings is buried in the cathedral church by Roskilde.
The sculptor Bjørn Nørgaard already made a sarcophagus for the two.
The queen agrees with the decision of their man, continued to be called it in the report.
Where prince Henrik will bury, is still unclear.
It does not have however the intention in its French homeland to be buried.
Prince Henrik had never made a secret from the fact that he was not happy with its title.
After the accession of his Mrs. Margrethe in the year 1972 he would have become gladly king.
it went to 2016 into the retirement and puts down thereby also the title “prince consort”.
Since Henrik in Denmark did not get the title and the function, which he wanted, do not see himself he opposite his wife as equivalently on also not after death, explained Lene Balleby, the chief spokeswoman of the Danish royal house.
Where the final resting place of the 83-year old will finally be, is still unclear.
It has however not the intention in its French homeland to be buried but in Denmark.

On the Thames he worked in the French message.
While its later wife the expressions of sympathy of the people always zuflogen, prince Henrik in its scarcely 50-year old regency had heavy conditions with the Danes.
In an autobiography Henrik expressed over the first years in Denmark: “Few months after my arrival everything that I did, was criticized.
My Danish was varying, I preferred wine instead of beer, silk stockings instead of cord socks, Citroën instead of Volvo, Tennis instead of football.
Even for the Gauloises, which I smoked in place of Virginia tobacco and which had in this country the call to be the brand of society-critical intellectual I could not hope for indulgence.
I was different.
I seemed to be content with this position and not be ashamed me.
That were equivalent two errors!”
Prime Minister Weil wants rapid new election
CDU and FDP before possible majority in Lower Saxony
Of Lower Saxony Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) government majority for a rapid new election of the federal state parliament is, to withdraw wants it however not after the loss of the Red-Greens.
Because expressed itself on Friday for the dissolution of the parliament.
Before the surprising withdrawal had fallen Green Members of Parliament from its parliamentary group in the Landtag into Lower Saxony the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) into a heavy crisis.
The Red-Green coalition in Hanover thereby lost five months before the official date of the election of the federal parliament their limited joining in majority in the parliament to the opposition from CDU and FDP.
The past Green Member of Parliament Elke Twesten justified its step with the non--nomination for the choice 2018 in their constituency in Rotenburg (Wümme).
“I see my political future in the CDU”, explained her on Friday in Hanover.
Chairperson of the CDU parliamentary group Björn Thümler wants to recommend to its parliamentary group to take up it.
Thus CDU and FDP would have together 69-seat to the federal state parliament, SPD and country of Lower Saxony 68-seat.
So far the relationship had turned around.
The new federal state parliament is regularly selected on 14 January of coming year.
Thümler said, the Red-Green federal state government had to now decide whether it can govern in this situation without majority further.
Stephan Weil holds it however for indispensable that the federal state parliament decides as rapidly as possible its voluntary disbanding.
The CDU parliamentary group will presumably decide on Tuesday on its further action.
The state constitution plans also the possibility that the federal state parliament withdraws the confidence from the Prime Minister and selects a successor.
“Our condition offers several options.
These possibilities must be checked legally cleanly”, said Thümler.
“One will discuss all questions in peace, if they are legally reasonably checked.”
Thümler called Twestens step “nevertheless somewhat strange”.
The politician stressed: “I am not a woman traitor.
I feel very well”.
It called itself as a follower of blackgreen.
The Greens requested the disloyal delegate for the return of their Landtag mandate.
“We assume naturally them return, communicated their Landtag mandate, which received her over the green national list with immediate effect” the regional chairmen Meta Janssen Kucz and Stefan Körner.
The leaders of the parliamentary group of the Greens Anja Piel said: “We regret the decision of Elke Twesten extraordinarily”.
It decided consciously to lead no discussion in the parliamentary group.
“Also against the background that there were no contentwise differences, we cannot reconstruct this step.”
SPD candidate for the chancellorship Martin Schulz condemns the crossing of the Green Members of Parliament of Lower Saxony Elke Twesten to the CDU as betrayal.
“The behavior of the former Green Members of Parliament in Lower Saxony is not only betrayal of the voters and voters, but also betrayal on red-green”, wrote the federal boss of the Social Democrats on Friday on Facebook.
It support the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD), to let the federal state parliament select fast again.
The withdrawal Twestens costs red-green in Lower Saxony the majority.
The politician places “in her injured vanity and into their frustration their personal interests before the well-being of the country”, criticized General Secretary of the SPD Hubertus Heil.
“It is a scandal that the CDU in Lower Saxony takes part in and tries this dirty plot play, from this political capital to strike”.
Of Lower Saxony Chairperson of the CDU parliamentary group Björn Thümler wants its delegates to recommend to take up Elke Twesten to the CDU.
The party head of the SPD in the Bundestag, Thomas Oppermann, accused Twesten to falsify with personal career thinking the result of the election of the federal parliament 2013.
The CDU was at that time before the SPD strongest strength, SPD and Green had in the federal state parliament however a gauzy majority of a voice.
Secretary of Agriculture in the interview - as we protect ourselves against poison eggs, Mr. Schmidt?
Germany discusses contaminated eggs.
How could the scandal happen?
As the consumers can protect themselves.
Secretary of Agriculture Christian Schmidt (CSU) stands for speech and answer in the interview with the editorship network Germany (RND).
Mr. Schmidt, how the consumer can itself protect against poisoned eggs?
I can encourage only all consumption gutters and consumers to exactly view the eggs in your refrigerator and examine the stamp print.
On the consumer protection portal www.Lebensmittelwarnung.de adjust the Federal states the newest in each case information about the calibrationbad concerned.
Eggs concerned should be destroyed or returned.
Also, if after everything which we at present know, a health endangerment is practically impossible.
Now does Aldi take over the optimum crisis reaction - all eggs out from the offer -, because the central role of the reconnaissance aircraft is not really noticed by the Federal Minister of Agriculture?
The food inspection is task of the Federal states.
Nevertheless my house locked itself on immediately and is since becoming known the embarrassment of Germany in the close exchange with the authorities of the countries.
All information and the risk evaluation are callable for the consumers.
The trade has to carry exactly the same as the manufacturers ensuring that the sold products are tradeably and healthwise harmless.
If with eggs that is exceeded by 0,005mg/kg residue maximum salary, are not this tradeably.
Unloaded eggs can however sold and consume to become.
This time the enterprises are not debt.
Do production enterprises and consumers sit in the same boat?
After present level of knowledge no direct debt meets the production enterprises.
Rather they must count due to presumed illegal practices of service enterprise on economic damage.
Like always there are in case of emergency too few testers.
Is it missing only at staff or also at the conclusive responsibility?
Were nevertheless straight official controls, which uncovered the procedure.
To the truth it belongs however also that food fraud and criminal energy can be never excluded to 100 percent.
Straight ones therefore are a consistent clearing-up of such happenings and the delivery to the public prosecutor's offices in the cases, in which criminal offences can be present, of crucial importance.
I made already several times clear that I expect a complete clearing-up from the responsible persons authorities.
Is the regular alarmism really necessary with food scandals?
The consumption gutters and consumer have the right to get excluding safe and tradeable food.
If a not certified insecticide is used in the food economy, are consumption gutters and consumer rightfully infuriates.
By adulterated the means manufacturers, into a situation, are guessed resellers and consumers which is absolutely not necessary.
In principle must be clear: The illegal employment of the insecticide Fipronil with the attitude of food-supplying animals is not acceptable and must be terminated immediately.
On it must be worked on all levels consistently and with high pressure.
I expect from all responsible authorities that circumstances are cleared up briskly and completely.
As the financial regulations of the football Neymars move to Paris affect
The rules, which aim at, to prevent unhindered expenditures of the European soccer associations do not become Neymars world record transfer of Spanish Barcelona the French Paris Saint the Germain to disturb.
Any consequences supervised power for Paris Saint Germain of the UEFA to still come, because the leading organization, those the European play to forbid crews of the entrance to the prestigious championsleague tournament.
Financial fair Play rules, which were brought 2011 of the UEFA into being, mean that PSG must prove sometime that the transfer was financed by Neymar without large losses.
Barcelona paid 222 million euro (262 million $), in order to out-buy to go with the Brazilian from its contract, and Neymar a content will receive, which will amount to several ten million dollar per year.
Here are some the financial aspects of Neymars move to France.
PSG can make the money with security loosely, so that Neymar signs and brings it into a galaxy other star, in view of the financing of the team by the ruling family of Qatar, rich by the energy.
Clubs may on the acquisition of players much money spend, must however with legitimate sources of income steer in the opposite direction, which make the BREAK Even for them possible point in their business referred to the football.
FFP was conceived by Michel Platini after its choice to the UEFA president in the year 2007.
Former French players believed that clubs, which in their striving for success enormous debts on itself had taken to ruin itself would amount to effective and risked, if banks or owners withdrew their support.
In the year 2011 FFP of the concentration shifted on the debts of the clubs on the monitoring of its losses.
The change meant the fact that the business model to improve, which originally used Roman Abramovich 2003 in Chelsea - bought a club with potential and invested then strongly, in order the crew and develop a global brand - for a harder affair will should.
While the current three-year FFP assessment period, which runs until 2018, can clubs of losses at a value of 30 million euros accept.
And although Platini is fallen 2015 of the presidency in disgrace, his UEFA successor Aleksander Ceferin supports further to deter from excessive expenditures.
“Surely FFP is not dead and we the rules for the future to intended still strengthen”, said Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for FFP with the UEFA, opposite The Associated Press in the past week.
Although the PSG paid the Buy out clause of Neymar in a lump sum, she can distribute the amount for accounting over the duration of its contract.
Neymar signed a five-annual contract, so that the transfer fee can be proven for the next five years at a value of 44.4 million euros in the end-of-year procedure.
The first wave of FFP sanctions in the year 2014 met the PSG as well as Abu Dhabi, which is in the possession of Manchester town center, with the heaviest sanctions.
The PSG received a fine from 60 million euro (at that time 82 million dollar), which was lowered later on 20 million euros - and it was arranged that the crew members for the championsleague of the season 2014/15 on 21 players instead of the otherwise normal 25 players remains limited.
The UEFA is in the search for clubs, which could try to outwit their financial control by blowing up their incomes by enterprises, which are connected with the owners of a club.
While an enterprise of Qatar the PSG could to sponsor, if the value of sponsoring standard-market-corrodes exceed should, the UEFA would not let this be considered as legitimate income.
2014 happened exactly, when the UEFA decided that the value of the sponsoring of the PSA of the Qatar Tourism Authority was blown up.
It was reported that a part of the PSG payments at Neymar over payments of the organizing committee of the WM could come 2022 into Qatar.
But PSG and Qatar 2022 denied that Neymar WM-Ambassador will become and a such maneuver for the UEFA regulatory authorities to find out be simple could.
The past sanctions against PSG mean that the UEFA will be still more attentive, to consider each attempt the rules to go around.
The UEFA did not have preparing discussions with PSG over Neymars transfer, sagtem on Thursday the people, which are familiar with the situation.
They spoke on the condition of anonymity with The Associated Press, since they were not authorized to discuss the PSG situation.
The last published reports show that PSG obtained 2015/16 with a revenue of 542.4 million euro a profit of more than 10 million euros.
The accounts for the last financial year must be still published.
PSG expects that Neymars arrival is a benediction for sponsoring deal, merchandising and tricot sales.
The club assumes the revenue will rise after the signing around at least 30 percent.
The Spanish league was clearly irritated to see going one of the best football players and it tried to prevent Neymars way course by stating that PSG would injure the FFP.
“It is a clear case of” financial doping” with the club and the state”, said the president of the La league, Javier Tebas, the Spanish daily paper AS regarding of Qatar final owner shank at PSG.
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, whose club is in the possession of an American sport Tycoons, divides the reservations of La league against a state, which finances a club.
“It is the consequence the owner shank and that the entire landscape of the football in the last 15 years completely changed”, said Wenger on Thursday.
“As soon as a country possesses a club, is everything possible.
It will very difficult to respect financial fair play because one goes different ways or can different interests have, if a country has a so large participant, around a country to represent.”
Swiss is in the search for a new Schoggilieferanten
In the past years Chocolat Frey Bord-Schokolade for the Swiss manufactured.
Now sweet co-operation before a possible end stands: The airline writes the order out again.
Swiss spokeswoman Meike Fuhlrott confirmed an appropriate report of the newspaper “northwest Switzerland” on request of the press agency sda from Friday.
In accordance with current planning the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half-year 2018.
The products were examined all two to three years and submitted of a quality control.
“With the current supplier Chocolat Frey we are very content”, said the spokeswoman.
Approximately 17 million small of red Weis packed Schoggitafeln to 14 gram distribute the flight attendants before the landing per year to the passengers.
Over the costs the Swiss did not want to provide information.
Branch insiders estimate the quantity of orders in accordance with “northwest Switzerland” on 1,5 to 2 million francs - the Migros daughter obtains an annual turnover of approximately a billion franc.
But more importantly always is the advertising effect: For a Schoggihersteller it is a prestigious order.
How there are many applicants with the new announcement, the Swiss does not want to betray.
However only Swiss manufacturers are applicable.
According to the newspaper report Chocolat Frey wants to strive around a renewal of the contract over spring 2018 outside.
For sda largest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not attainable for a statement.
The Swiss distributes chocolate boards since 2006 on board its flights.

The possibility of placing the logo introduced Swiss before two and a half years with the start of co-operation with Chocolat Frey.

Track-and-field events - discus olympia winner Robert Harting reaches WM-final

Likewise with the first attempt the Polish titleholder Piotr Malachowski, who threw 65.13 meters far, for the final fight qualified itself.
Nostalgia goes into “Wet Hot American buzzer” and “Comrade Detective” into the niche
This repetition of history is at the same time nostalgic because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80's, for the 90-er-Jahre-Grunge-Ära (as the progressive thinkers David Wain and Michael Showalter the sketch comedy “The State” for MTV turned), and for itself - that is, for 2001, before their star, as Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd went to larger things.
As cultural artifact it is equally a parody and an embodiment of our Facebook-able era of permanent memories.
But as franchise it feels, as if the time became limited.
“Roofridge Day OF Camp” functioned surprisingly well, not only because of its absurd humor (it an original history for a speaking box vegetable, which was spoken of H. Jon Benjamin) contained.
By insisting on the core of the gimmick - actors of middle age played cool children, who will arise - created it nevertheless the impossibility to win the last part of the joke back.
“Ten Years Later”, with its adults, who play adults now, is less emotional rooted and its parody goes more to the watering can principle, under it a reef on the stalker films of the 90's like “The hand That of skirt the Cradle” (“the hand, those the cradle swings”).
At one point a character browses by a Apple Powerbook, some Inline skat and “a number of other things from the year 1991”.
Many of central stories are the same.
The kind Coop (Mr. Showalter), now novelist, did not forget Katie (Marguerite Moreau) yet.
Victor (Ken Marino) did not lose its virginity yet.
And there is still further crazy-malicious plot, to Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter) is included, who by George H.W. Bush (a well successful impression of Michael Ian Black) is supported now.
Like always the excursions are the best part of the franchise.
It makes particularly much joke, for the eternally young Mr. Rudd to see, the Matt Dillons's lower lip beard of “singles” shows, whose former Big one on Camp Andy feels now like an old breaker.
There is the moments of coincidental insanity, which could heat this franchise like a kind itself repeating “Seven up UP!” Series, until it reaches, what I as its logical conclusion accept: “Wet Hot American buzzer: Twenty Years Later”, whose last scene will show the gang, how it will visit the film premiere of “Wet Hot American buzzer”.
“Comrade Detective” on Amazon reminds in the meantime of another kind of nostalgia: to the revival of the cold war of “The Americans”, to the film “Atomic blond one” and even at “GLOW” with its east counter west wrestling iconography.
The comedy with Rhys Thomas as a director, created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka, indicates to be a found TV-series: a Romanian drama of the eighties with the two policemen as friends, two officers from Bucharest, who fight for truth, atheism and the way of the Marxism-Leninism.
The leading role - a hard simmered Gregor and a idealistic Iosef - by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Ulici are played, whose dialogues are synchronized by Channing Tatum (likewise an implementing producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt on English.
It is an ingenious idea.
But it is not much more than one idea.
There are some beautiful gimmicks for viewing (the police the time spends to view itself chess on TV like Americans it with football perhaps does).
And the list of the famous spokesmen - under it Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny - provides for a decent play 'finds the voice out'.
But “Comrade Detective” engages itself so much for the truthfulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a murderer, who carries a Reagan mask, is included - that it often plays like only one.
With six long episodes it moves along itself, and the comedy is not fast or frequent enough.
“Comrade Detective”, which was drawn up on a smaller length, could supply its Agitprop satire better, since Gregor and Iosef again and again visit the American embassy, whose lobby is occupied by two fat men always, who devour a heap of Hamburgers.
The message for imagined communist audience is that the western culture can make everything the fodder for a binge.
The fictitious Romanian creators did not lie wrongly: We make it even with our own recent history and with the their.
Impact against drug mafia in the country
An impact succeeded to the police against the Italian mafia in Baden-Wuerttemberg.
On Wednesday morning in the Black Forest Baar circle, in Rottweil, Konstanz, and Stuttgart numerous objects were scanned Esslingen, as the public prosecutor's office communicated Konstanz on Friday.
15 accused of arrested at the age between 25 years and 77 years and already issued warrants of arrest against these.
In addition the officials guaranteed larger quantities marijuana and cocaine, firearms as well as several hundred thousand euros.
With contemporaneous raids in Italy two people were arrested.
Against the two suspects Italian gave it German warrants of arrest.
The two are therefore probably delivered to Germany.
At the action Italian and Bavarian investigators were involved.
Altogether were over 300 police in the use.
Organized drug-related crime, heavy acts of violence, tried murder as well as robbery and extortion are accused to the members of the mafia.
Already for summer the public prosecutor's office Konstanz determines 2016 against the organized drug trade in Southern Germany.
Between the public prosecutor's offices in Konstanz and Palermo an active exchange and the investigators the criminal investigation department Rottweil existed had almost daily contact with its colleagues on Sicily.
Therefore the extensive use was accompanied on Wednesday morning also by four officials from Palermo.
In its sights the investigations moved thereby above all Italian citizens with close purchase to the Italian mafia.
Also an incident to 27. May in Hüfingen, with which several shots were fired early in the morning into a restaurant, might go on the account of the gang.
Way deplores large gaps in the foreigner register
“Data of citizens, who should not emerge there”: According to a report the foreigner register in Germany exhibits substantial lack.
That leads too partly serious wrong decisions with asylum proceedings.
The assigned one for the refugee management of the Federal Government, Frank-Jürgen Weise, drew attention to a media report according to on large gaps in the foreigner central register.
Lack with the data registered there could lead too partly serious wrong decisions” with asylum proceedings and deportation “, warned way in an analysis, which is present the “newspaper Süddeutsche”.
In the register reports the according to ten millions of people with foreign nationality is seized, among them about 5.7 million from non--European Union member states.
The data are therefore administered by approximately 600 foreigner authorities in Germany.
Because the data were not sufficiently maintained, the data quality was not good in parts so far.
In individual cases data were found of 1921, “by humans, who for a long time any longer alive are not, or by citizens, who became German citizens and in the register actually any longer emerge should not”.
“Incorrect data inputs can slow return processes down substantially”, are called it the report after further.
In the statistics over leave the country-requiring humans besides European Union-citizens are seized, who would not have at all to leave the country.
Such wrong allocations led however “to a distorted debate across handling departure-requiring”, are called therefore it in the analysis.
Meanwhile the Federal Government began obviously to send back refugee families among 16-year old children again to Italy if they entered from there.
That comes out from an internal paper of the Federal Office for migration and refugees (BAMF), reports the “new of Osnabrück newspaper”.
In the paper it is called therefore, the BAMF leads such procedures “concerning families with children - with exception of babies and infants - to Italy since 1 June 2017 again through”.
Since at the end of 2014 that was practically no longer possible, so the newspaper under reference to the difficult situation locally.
After the Dublin agreement the European Union member state is responsible for refugees, which they reach first.
If a migrant further-travels to another EU country, this state can send back it into the entry country.
For reason write the office now: “In the meantime acceptance capacity for families with minor children increased in Italy substantially”.
Italy delivered warranties for the admission and accommodation of families.
Even the European Court of Human Rights (EGMR) these promises hold for sufficient.
Also different European Union member states would send back refugees in the context of the Dublin agreement there.
The domestic spokeswoman of the left-wing faction in the Bundestag, Ulla Jelpke, criticized this decision: “Families with children threaten because of the lack in the Italian asylum system human right-adverse terms of admission and an endangerment of the child well-being”.
Second-best result obtains
Altogether the blood bank service already made 220 litres available blood of people living in upper Reichenbach for other humans.
At least of the twelve citizens, who were distinguished on Friday.
Everything in front Jürgen Greule, who divided 100 donations with its in the meantime in the meantime 50 litres blood.
Traditionally the community in the meeting appreciates the local council the repeated readiness to donate blood.
“It is ingenious, how our body for it is put on and we tribute the donors respect, who make their blood available for foreigner, still in addition unselfishly”, underlined mayors Karlheinz Kistner.
“Only one donation of blood helps several humans”, described the circle readiness leader of the German red cross (DRK), Holger Maisenbacher, because tinned food is decomposed into their components.
So already three people could profit from a donation of blood.
At the same time Maisenbacher reported of the actions, which are accomplished in the spring in upper Reichenbach.
“In this year we obtained the second-best result” with 114 donors, said the DRK Kreisbereitschaftsleiter.
Obviously the change led a few years ago into the theatre house to higher numbers of participants.
Before it already ranked Thomas Bockstadt, Susanne Reichle, Sandra Schöck, Thomas Reichle and Meta Umbeer among the multiple donors and for in each case 50 carried out donations of blood were distinguished.
Half so many book Herbert Mair and Dorothee Riexinger, while Tamara Pfrommer, Petra Schleeh, Stefanie Stoll and Uwe cousin ten times delivered ever 500 millilitres of her lifeblood.
The bank OF England will hold the interest rates with 0,25%
The bank OF England will announce presumably later that the interest rates will remain unchanged, after the weak economic growth and the weakening of the inflation absorbed the speculations over a rise.
The bank OF England warned that the economic growth will remain “slow-acting”, when it in the middle maintained the interest rates on family incomes in an increasing pressure.
The political decision makers of the Monetary Committee (MPC) of the bank voted with 6 to 2 to hold the interest rates 0,25% whereby in this month of fewer members aimed at a rise, since the weak economic growth weakened the support for an increase.
In its quarterly inflation report the bank reduced her growth prognoses for 2017 to 1,7% and for 2018 on 1,6% and warned of the fact that the pressure would continue on the household incomes, whereby the inflation might rise in the autumn presumably still to scarcely 3%.
But it signaled that in the next years increases in interest would become necessary, around which of the Brexit heated up inflation to curb and it said that the credit costs would have to rise possibly more than expected at the financial markets.
The members voted also to withdraw a part of the giant economic situation package which was published one year ago after the Brexit.
It will demand time for the financial programme, in order to make starting from coming February cheaper moneys available for banks, although it was said that now one expects that it 15 billion pound more in the context of this system will make available - with 115 billion pound of Sterling.
The bank said minutes after the decision over the interest rate: “In the central prognosis of the MPC the gross domestic product (Gross Domestic Product) remains at short notice weakly, there the pressure on the real income of the households further the consumption burdening.”
To the interest rates it repeated that “a certain rationalisation of the monetary policy” would be necessary for the cooling of the inflation and “somewhat a larger” extent, than the markets expect.
The markets prognosticate at present the first rise in the third quarter of the next year and a further in the year 2020.
The bank stressed however that increases would take place “gradually” and “limited”.
The growth prognoses of the bank corrected downward for this and next year stand compared with in May prognosticated 1.9% and 1.7%.
It maintained its growth prognosis on 1,8% in the year 2018.
The pound fell after these news in relation to the dollar and the euro.
The pound fell around 0,5% on 1,31 US Dollar and fell around 0,4% on 1.11 euros.
The decision to no change comes, after the recent disappointing growth numbers absorbed rising expectations on an increase in interest and the Gross Domestic Product in the second quarter of 0,2% in the preceding three months to 0,3% rose.
Growth will presumably be in the third quarter about 0,3%, although it will easily recover after the bank toward end of the year.
The recent inflation report offered little enthusiasm for households, which are affected by a rising inflation and slight salary increases, since the aggravation becomes first still worse, before it will then improve.
It added that the monetary policy cannot “prevent” the income break-down in the next years, but it added that the wages will recover for the end of their three-year forecast “clearly”.
The economy is strengthened also by the rising demand for British goods, which is to due to the weak pound, which will compensate a part of the lower consumer spending.
The decision comes one year to the lowering of the interest rates on 0,25% in last August to the shocking European Union-vote, which caused a sinking of the pound.
The bank estimates that it will take probably four years, until this will completely reach the prices and the economy.
Before the last judgement of the bank to the interest rates the call had risen after an increase in interest, since the inflation increased the pressure on hard pressed households, whereby three political decision makers demanded a rise on 0,5% in July.
The inflation sank in the past month of 2,9% in June on 2,6%, although the bank said that this was expected and it in the coming months will again tighten.
The bank said, the excess in relation to its goal of 2% was to be attributed “completely” to the weak pound.
Andrew Montlake, director with Coreco Mortgage of broker, said: “In view of the recent decrease of the swap rates the mortgage market might become more strongly competitive again, since the creditors would like to look loudly for business and to terminate the year in positive way.
The market sees particularly well out for those, with which existing deal run out and which new mortgages lock, and many with options free of charge and low rates become ever more popular.”
NHS (the national health service) is to use up disputed HIV drug 10,000 humans
Patients will receive starting from September after a fight before the High Court against the financing of the medicine in of NHS the entrance to a “transformative” HIV Präventionsbehandlung.
Of NHS England it announced that a Präexpositionsprophylaxe (PrEP), taken before the sexual intercourse, which can reduce the infection risk with high risk patients by approximately 86 percent, now by the health service over a first three-yearly study for estimated 10,000 humans is supplied.
He explained himself ready, the process for financiers, after the court of appeal had confirmed last year a judgement of highest Gerichtshofs, according to which of NHS had the power to pay for the PrEP despite the statement that the local authorities it should financiers.
On Thursday the announced chess move was welcomed of NHS England boss of Simon Stevens as “important new intervention”, during which national AIDS Trust (NAT) called this “crucial moment”.
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will belong to first, which will make the registration possible of humans, and further hospitals will follow in October, before it will be introduced in April 2018 into all of England.
Präexpositionsprophylaxe (PrEP) is a consequence of HIV preparations, which are taken before the sex, in order to reduce the risk of an HIV infection.
Studies showed that PrEP reduces the HIV transmission with infection-threatened ones significantly.
PrEP before the sexual intercourse to take means that straight enough medicines are present in the body of a person, in order to prevent an HIV infection.
Such medicines can be taken each day or so already two hours before the sexual intercourse.
To those, which are applicable for the treatment, belong gay or bisexual men, transsexual one and people with HIV positive partners, which were not successfully treated.
In hospitals suitable participants are identified, who agree the study, including to men, women, Transgendern and individuals, who have a partner, whose did not well-known-measure HIV status by anti-retroviral treatment one controls.
Humans, who live in England and are registered with a family doctor, can register themselves also for a possible participation in their local participating sexual hospital.
The program becomes £ 10 million and NHS England signed a contract the delivery of the medicines this week after an international competitive procurement.
The study is to judge the entire potential of PrEP, as clinical proofs are collected, like it in large standard is purposefully used, taken up and converted.
Stevens said: “This large new intervention should supplement and overhaul the extensive and increasingly successful efforts for preventing of HIV.
It is a further milestone in that more than three decades continuous progress during the management of one of the largest health challenges of mankind.”
Deborah Gold, Chief Executive with NAT (national AIDS Trust), said: “This is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV.
PrEP, if it is aligned to needy and endangered humans purposefully, offers the possibility of changing the English HIV epidemic.
From September on humans with high HIV risk will have entrance to this NHS-financed attempt in England, in order to develop a new instrument, which is really individually controlled and not with a negotiation with a partner is subject, which leads to the improvement of many, many lives.
We welcome this announcement completely cordially.”
Ian Green, chairman of the board the Terrence Higgins's Trust, said: “The priority must lie now on the fact that the study is accomplished fast generally speaking country and that nobody, which has a risk for HIV is left.
Now, since the PrEP Testmedizin was procured, we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV infected humans.”
Sharon Hodgson, Schatten-Gesundheitsministerin, said: “The beginning of the PrEP process is welcome and overdue after months-long delays and hesitant conversion by the government.
The proofs show, how transformative this drug can be as part of our approach for HIV prevention and the transmission of this life-changing infection can terminate.
This attempt brings us a step more near to understand the advantages of PrEP.
Now it is important that this study is accomplished as fast as possible generally speaking country, in order to protect people, who are HIV infected, and that them will contribute to the fact that we the completion of the spreading of HIV in the society a step more near kommen'.
The large life live: Intermediate projectile and smarter designer-cheat these small Earls Court apartment into a generous home transformed
Joanne Leigh, a former Bankerin with a passion for real estate, became smaller 2014 of a large house in Knightsbridge to Earls Court an apartment.
It is appropriate for elegant Queen in the first stick of an Anne Terrasse - and it is a proof for the new design that Joanne did not pack and did not sell its bags.
“Before it I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger area”, say Joanne.
“I looked for something, which was comparable to my price.
Me this apartment was shown in Earls Court, and it had the same high covers.
I fell in love with it and on this day an offer made.”
Since the first inspection the 1,000 square foot large apartment was completely overhauled.
Originally an in room property with an interlocked layout - one had to go through the kitchen, in order to arrive into the bedroom - wanted to add Joanne Stauraum and an intermediate projectile, in order to use generous ceiling height optimally.
“I wanted high covers, large windows, much light.
That was my requirement”, says it.
For this purpose it did not only assign architecture and design studio ducks & Shed of Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill to use and a home create the 12,5-foot-high covers, that a development, but also a place to the life for Joanne was.
The cover was not largely enough, in order to place two areas one above the other, so that the architectural challenge consisted of creating an intermediate projectile in which one stand could.
Erfan had to think creatively, in order to solve the default.
“The steel plant is rather complicated”, explains it.
“We had to arrange the areas in such a way that they were one above the other stacked, without we had to bend.
It concerned not only to build a simple platform to put on but the steel in such a way that it had the correct height for the function above or down.”
This arrangement made it for Erfan possible to place two areas in full height one above the other - with much additional drama.
For the intermediate projectile a classical copper light window of Retrouvius looks over the glamorous living area down.
Reflected gold furniture, silver accents and Vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program.
The use of mirrors plays a role when adding theatre, area and light.
At both ends a short passage is reflected, in order to let it work longer.
In the kitchen the reflection feels like a window into another room.
At the entrance reflected units offer place for all cutleries and glasses of Joanne.
By the perception of a more glamorous area the beauty of the living room can lock the kitchen, if it is not used.
Collapsible kitchens are not anything new.
The special at this is that it concerns a garage door.
“A little engineer art went there inside”, explains Erfan of the steal-strengthened, veneered MDF door.
“It is against weighty, so that it, if you raise the door, slides very easily.”
Owing to the smarter use of area and reservoir Joanne could win additional 16 m ², an additional bedroom and an improved layout.
“In the end the day you will sell the surface area - or as your real estate becomes estimated”, says Erfan.
“In a rudimentary form a real estate agent will enter and a calculation based on the ground size would drive through.”
Here they created it to increase the floor space and to use at the same time high-quality materials, which provide for the area its luxurious advantage.
“The materials are the things, which affect you and which help from there, an emotional connection in a home to create”, say Erfan.
“You do not fall in love with the electrical plug sockets in the walls.
These are important, but they do not play with your heart.”
It shows that a apartment can transform by good design and increased square meter number of something according to standard into somewhat completely amazing.
Indeed, like Joanne, you could decide not to leave these.
Brothers fight because of 500 million US Dollar of real estate empire
Two brothers are four decades, after their Italian family created the dynasty, in an argument because of one of the largest real estate empires of Victoria in the value from over 500 million dollar.
The former director 'Carl tone football club' and developer of Colin De Lutis lives only three doors in a mansion in Toorak, remotely from his younger brother Paul. This brought it to highest Gerichtshof, in order to let clarify, how their property and their trading assets are to be divided.
Paul wanted to withdraw itself since 2014 from the family business, but a sharp argument over the separation takes place in highest Gerichtshof.
Together with their mother the brothers 38 real estate possess Anna collected in the value of more than a half billion dollar, bought since then the family 1973 a business in Smith Street, Collingwood.
There the family Westco jeans based and grew to a chain of 160 retail businesses.
It was sold to 1999 for 85 million US Dollar.
This money was invested in real estate, and the portfolio of De Lutis covers now offices in the Stadtzenrum, the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento, the apartments in gold Coast and Mt Buller as well as shopping centres in the suburb.
According to an agreement with their deceased father possesses Colin - described by Paul as “main operators and the dominating personality” in the family De Lutis - of about two thirds of the enterprise ability and Paul for instance a third.
A court record means that this means that Colin Eigentum in the value of 316 million dollar and Paul in the value of 176 million dollar possesses.
The allocation of real estate and cash proved for Paul as point of problem.
“Of Colin suggested allocations left it with, which I regarded, wrote as the best objects” he 2015 in a first affidavit.
On past Friday the first hearing of highest Gerichtshofs took place after several failed switchings.
The brothers fight now also for control of the existing business - about which Colin, as Paul states, excluded it.
Colin argued, this is not true, but accuses Paul to administer some possessions incompetently.
In an early affidavit, which was submitted by Colin, he, it says hopes, to settle the controversy.
“My Italian inheritance prescribes that the family is the most important priority”, wrote it.
The costs rise in the case, with hundreds on the part of with affidavits, emails and reports of enterprises, under it Deloitte, Pitcher of partner and charter saucily CRA MER, and with prominent attorneys, among them Allan Myers, QC, and from both sides law firms held.
Mrs. De Lutis and her deceased husband Luigi were Italian immigrants, who operated milk bar and delicacy business from the late 1950-er years and bought in the early seventies a business in Brunswick.
They used security, in order to buy the Collingwood real estate, into the Colin the first jeans shop of the family opened.
Colin says that he began Westco there, when he was “in my last years of the High School, when Paul was still another small child (approximately 10 years old).”
Anna De Lutis says that they and Luigi, which died in the year 2012 hoped, to pass their property on in a friendly way to its sons.
“Luigi often told me that he wanted never that the brothers land in court”, wrote them.
Two other brothers, Marks and hatch, are not any more part De Lutis Entrepreneurial group, whereby Colin states that Marks were paid when leaving the enterprise 10 million dollar and hatch 26 million dollar.
Both Lukas and Marks are, then Paul says “about the conditions of their financial separation embittered become”.
Colin held back itself very much, although it was a former AFL member of the board and after a biography from the year 2015 of Eddie McGuire the best friend of the television star.
Fair fax Media took up contact with Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers.
Only Colin did not answer by SMS, over to say “I can really much say”, because the case before the courts was.
“It is much to sue and pull our surnames by the courts very sadly that my brother Paul decided, me”, wrote it.
In the middle of 2016 wrote Colin in a letter the court that he had tried to fulfill the demands of its brother.
“Our father would not have wanted the fact that Paul and I would end in our current controversy”, said he and added that he “still for a solution hope”.
On Friday this hope seemed to be past.
“Our affair will be solved in the near future from the courts”, wrote Colin.
Trumps new chief of staff plans to limit the medium abstinence of the president.
Others tried it and failed.
Perhaps John F. Kelly can actually do it.
If yes, he will be first.
Politico reports that the new chief of staff of the white house plans, the information flow to president Trump to limit - including the reports of the news media - in hope to hold the boss on an even course.
Here a piece of reporter is Josh Dawsey:
“As John F. Kelly, who met new chief of staff of the white house, on its first working day with leading employees, it represented a main problem in president Donald Trumps to white house, which he wanted to repair: bad information, which comes into the hands of the president.
Kelly said to the employees that information should flow over him - whether on paper or in briefings - because the president better decisions would meet, if he would receive good information.”
Kellys diagnosis makes sense, but others tried to tame Trump by supervising its medium diet.
President Trumps relationship with the television hands back decades - and now, where it is in the white house, its television commercial is still strong.
“If candidate Trump was annoyed because of an unfair reporting, was productive it to show it that it received a fair reporting from places, which were to be convinced”, said the former election campaign advisor SAM now mountain in February opposite Politico.
Politicos Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that “the key consists to hold Trumps Twitter habit under control according to six former election campaign officials of ensuring that his personal medium consumption contains a constant praise price.”
Okay.
But the idea that Trumps was ever Twitter habit “under control”, is ridiculous.
Perhaps these campaign officials know somewhat, which we others do not know - that Trumps Tweets without its interventions still more explosive would have contained.
We are probably never experienced something over the Tweets, which did not send Trump.
If its employees it already created it several times to keep annoyance away from it then their efforts were worthwhile themselves.
But nobody could prevent it consistently that Trump causes controversies.
A part of the problem consists of the fact that humans in a white house, which consists of competitive parties try again and again to make progress with their own agenda by presenting Trump material, which possibly promotes their opinions of the world.
Politico - completely employed with this history - reported in May on the preference of the advisors to supply to the president for strategic reasons doubtful information.
This was an example, which was described by reporter Shane Goldmacher:
“Say current ones and former Trump officials that Trump can react like a volcano to negative press cuttings, above all such with damaging leakages, and that it insists on to find out from where these come.
Exactly happened at the end of February, when someone accused the president bad-willingly a printed copy of an article of GotNews.com, which gave website of the Internet troublemaker Charles C. Johnson, deputy chief of staff Katie Walsh to be “the source behind a heap to be from leakages” in the white house.
Although Johnson was banished because of harassment permanently from Twitter or that he did not offer concrete proofs or that he expressed wrong reproaches in the past and recalled her.
Trump read the article and began to ask employees over Walsh.”
Gold doer added that chief of staff at that time Reince Priebus and the Secretary-General of the white house, tried Rob Porter, “to implement a system in order the paper stuff to administer and document, which Trump receives”.
How did that fold?
Kelly tries three months later to do the same.
Perhaps it will prove itself as more effective managers than Priebus, but Trump is still its impulsive, and its advisors strive still for influence.
These constant factors make Kellys mission very difficult.
Most wanted criminals get post office of Europol

Travelers negotiate about digging and turn back to the 'millionaire row'
Some the wealthiest home-owners West Midlands stands again with some determined travelers on war foot, who negotiated a ditch pulled by the community, in order to back-demand a field before their manor houses.
The travelers parked their 20 campers on a field outside of a wealthy road of Solihull, which is called the “millionaire row”.
They bring along horses babies and an army from transporters, after they were only thrown out in May, without however by a ditch excavated by the advice to have been deterred in order to prevent their ideas.
The tactful group found a gap in the defenses and pressed its vehicles by a section, which remained unhindered, in order to find a way.
Furious inhabitants pressed the advice of Solihull, which said that it was useless “, with the problem to be concerned”.
An anonymous inhabitant said: “You pulled on Monday evening there, after they were forwarded by Bentley Heath, where they threw stones on the passerbies.
The advice must be forced by shame to the conversion to the act, since it was useless while handling the problem.
There the travelers were in May, were moved on and are now again back.
More arrived last night, probably still today more.”
It added: “The advice of Birmingham knows, how one deals with by holding long instructions, in order to protect their parks.
I live on the Streetsbrook Road and I am not happy to pay moreover my local rate if the advice cannot even stop that.”
An adjacent resident, who did not want to be called, said: “It is ridiculous, we just the last round of this travelers saw in order by another round to be only pillaged.
The numbers increased this time and one even a horse within the park range saw.”
A spokeswoman of the advice of Solihull said: “We are conscious of an unauthorized camp on the country us beyond the Streetsbrook Road and co-operate with the police of Solihulls. We seize the necessary legal steps, so that they move on as fast as possible.
In order to support our proof collection, it is very important that a anti-social or criminal behavior to as many as possible adjacent resident at the police announce, by calling 101.
This contributes to create a picture from the situation to in which the court must check, when we submit our case.”
From birch yard forest hotel becomes Luise
From the former hotel birch yard becomes the forest hotel Luise.
The house before the gates of Freudenstadt is reconditioned at present and is to be opened on 1 March of next year again.
Those are good news for the city.
Because with the locking of the hotel birch yard by the ambience at that time operating company ltd. to 13 April 2014 at that time approximately 30,000 overnight accomodation per year was lost and also to incomes by the cure tax.
In the autumn 2014 became in view of dramatically rising numbers of refugees, who came into the district, which hotel building the district administration office as collective accommodation offered, which provided for controversy discussions.
The city prevented the accommodation of asylum seekers by the list of a development plan, in order to secure the area as hotel location.
The decision was not at that time in the local council undisputed.
But above all of Freudenstadt mayor Julian Osswald defended the hotel location and spoke already at that time of serious prospective customers at the house.
It should keep right.
The group of Luisenhotels with managing director Birgit Scherer with seat in bath Bergzabern acquired and wants the former hotel birch yard with a voluntary auction in Berlin it again a house of the three-star plus category under the name forest hotel Luise to make.
The group has four houses with the joy townsperson object.
Two of it in bath Bergzabern and one in bath Herrenalb.
They are called hotel Luise, Luisenpark, Parkhotel Luise and now forest hotel Luise.
At the earlier hotel birch yard already for a long time building debris container before the entrance stands, and if one enters the house, clearly, what extensive renovation work one will make.
The grounds were partially reduced pulled out, covers, old bath tubs from the rooms were removed.
The entire hotel building is only one building site.
Until March it gives to do still much.
“It is actually a beautiful hotel”, says Thomas Scherer in the discussion with our newspaper.
Everything is to be renewed in the Black Forest style.
The rooms will become equipped with large accessible showers, which input area transformed, it new windows inserted.
Everything is to become later “beautifully people-oriented”, as Thomas Scherer expresses himself.
“We want to make a piece of jewellery from it.”
Swimming pool, wellness range and a conference area belong to the equipment.
One does not want to position oneself on the high level of the hotels in loud bath, but already on an elevated city center level, Scherer stresses.
The forest hotel Luise with its about 60 rooms wants to set up itself broadly, continues to describe Scherer.
Both individual holiday-makers, groups or businessmen are to probably-feel in the hotel.
Discussions with WHETHER Julian Osswald and director of tourism Michael Krause he has already led, so Scherer.
The conceptions of the city are congruent with those the hotel group.
“We are on the same line.”
In demand for the height of the investments, Thomas Scherer wants to commit himself not exactly.
Scarcely under one million euro, he counts.
Also the outside facilities are brought on preceding endorser, that are already clearly visible.
In an inner court a large develops terrace, which will be accessible from the restaurant, which is public.
Thomas Scherer is optimistic: “Freudenstadt is a good market”.
Russia affair: US-special prosecutor uses Grand jury
In the Russia affair around US president Donald Trump is to have used special prosecutors Robert Mueller according to a report a so-called Grand jury.
The committee took up, wrote the work in the past weeks “Wall Street Journal” with reference to people trusted with the thing.
The newspaper rated the step as indication that Müller had expanded and had intensified its investigations.
The transmitter CNN reported, it gives already first summonses of the committee in connection with a meeting between Trumps to oldest son and a Russian attorney.
U.S. secret services accuse the Kremlin of since longer purposefully into the presidential election campaign 2016 to have interfered.
Müller examines whether there were thereby arrangements between Trumps election campaign team and Moscow.
In the focus of the investigations several men are to be located, who acted in the election campaign as advisors of the republican.
According to reports Müller also more and more Trumps took private and business environment under the magnifying glass.
“Washington Post” wrote several weeks ago that the special prosecutor Trump had moved the reproach personally in the center and examines, whether the president possibly obstructed the law in the course of the affair.
The main task of Grand juries is it to check and decide these proofs in possible cases of crime whether accusation is to be raised.
Grand juries are called from there also accusation chambers.
Mostly they are switched on, if it concerns larger and controversy of cases.
The procedure takes place always behind closed doors.
The committee can besides by the public prosecutor's office is switched on, in order to cite people for hearing under oath.
According to the transmitter CNN summonses were already issued, which turn around the meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian attorney.
People, who were involved in the meeting, were requested to a statement, were called it in the report.
Besides they should make documents available.
Beside Trump Jr. also Trumps participated advisors and son-in-law Jared Kushner as well as its election campaign boss at that time of Paul Manafort in the discussion.
Legal experts said on Thursday evening on the US-television that the installation shows that Müller cannot be intimidated in its work and that it, if it should be necessary wants to act fast.
It does not have to mean inevitable however that the Grand jury is in the end switched on, in order to decide on the collection of an accusation.
The installation of the committee is nevertheless the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new reason to the concern for president Trump.
In the midst of the new exposures the president used a speech in West Virginia on Thursday evening, in order to represent the Russia affair as campaign of its political opponents.
“Russia history is a total invention”, said Trump.
The topic gives to the democrats a possibility of feeling “well because they have nothing else, over which it talk can”.
Its special advisor Ty Cobb explained in a statement, it did not know anything from the installation of a Grand jury.
This works in addition, usually on the sly, stressed it.
The white house endorses any measures, which accelerated the work of the special prosecutor in “fair” way.
The former FBI boss of James Comey said three times that against the president one do not determine.
One does not have a reason to accept that in it somewhat changed, continued to be called it in the explanation.
Müller had been however only used, after Trump Comey had fired.
Because of this expulsion reproaches had become against Trump loud, he wanted to obstruct the law.
Comey stated in June before a senate committee, Trump it for an attitude of the investigations against the national security advisor at that time Michael Flynn asked.
The president stands because of the investigation under large pressure.
After representation of US mediums the white house material collected against the special prosecutor and its employees.
That released speculations over it whether Trump Müller wanted to dismiss.
Differently than an independent special prosecutor of the congress as for instance in the Watergate affair around president Richard Nixon withdrawn later, Müller has a position, in which it could be fired theoretically on urge of the president by the Ministry of Justice.
Several senators of both parties want to prevent such a step however.
Two groups of republican and democratic senators presented on Thursday bills, after which the special prosecutor any longer will not so simply dismiss could.
Antarctic: Gigantic iceberg floats in the Antarctic
In the West Antarctica a gigantic iceberg separated from the scarcely sevenfold size of Berlin from the shelf ice.
That communicated the Bremerhavener to institute for Alfred way he for polar and exploration of the sea on Wednesday.
Large over one trillion tons the jumbo heavy and 5800 square kilometers drive now northward and two, three years will probably need, until it melted.
It is at 175 kilometers of length and a width of up to 50 kilometers a one of the largest ice giants, which registered researchers in the past three decades.
A danger for humans does not proceed from it.
To what extent the climate change played a role in the case of the abort of the iceberg, is unclear according to information of researcher.
Altogether give it however since approximately 30 years a series of unusual collapses of ice shelves in the region, write the US-research center for snow and ice (NSIDC) in a fact background.
According to opinion of many researchers that can be connected with global warming.
The jumbo broken off now was so far some of the Larsen C Schelfeis.
Shelf ice swims on the sea and by large glaciers is fed.
It continues to grow thus ever in the sea and cancels regularly.
The Larsen C Schelfeis is south of South America nearly because of the point of the Antarctic peninsula.
North this shelf ice was some years ago disturbed the balance of waxes and terminations.
A complete shelf ice disintegrated there, writes AWI researcher Daniela Jansen.
It speaks some for the fact that also the Larsen C Schelfeis is in danger, because the front edge withdrew itself never as far as at present.
Besides be energized the ice plate and can disintegrate, if in a key place a piece cancels.
Melting shelf ice and iceberg does not increase the sea level, since they swim on the water and so much water displaces ice, as it shows after melting.
However the loss of the shelf ice leads to the fact that the glaciers can flow directly into the sea and flow off many faster than before.
That could possibly increase the sea level, however only in the small measure, writes the British research project for the observation of the Antarctic (Midas).
The Larsen C Schelfeis is according to AWI information with nearly 50,000 square kilometers the fourth largest the shelf ice of the Antarctic.
At the transition from the mainland it is meters thick up to 700, at the front edge to the free ocean of approximately 200 meters.
There it cancels regularly.
“Although it is a natural happening and is conscious, comes, said us no direct connection to the climate change the ice sheet now into a more endangered position” Martin O'Leary of the British Swansea University.
“That is the furthest retreat since beginning of the recordings”, confirmed also it.
Among scientists disputed, whether the Larsen C Schelfeis will again grow now or decreases on a long-term basis and possibly collapses, said its colleague is Adrian Luckman and added: “Our models say that it will be less stable”.
But this development will take decades.
Even if these researchers do not attribute the abort of this gigantic iceberg to the climate change, then in the past decades a great many ice shelves of the Antarctic peninsula disintegrated nevertheless.
This long corner of the Antarctic extends direction South America.
After data of the research program British Antarctic Survey the ice surface of the Antarctic peninsula decreased for the 1950er years around 28,000 square kilometers.
To the decrease the temperature rise contributed.
The Antarctic peninsula passed in the 50 years around approximately three degrees warmed up and ranks thereby among the areas in which the temperature rises fastest.
CDU wants house tariff with staff
Because it ever more with difficulty will to occupy freely becoming places the CDU demands to withdraw from the employers' association in order to become more attractive.
Only shortly before the summer break the district assembly waved through to 41 new places in the administration.
More than 1100 employees and official work for the district administration in Mettmann.
Now again 17 training have their first working day behind itself.
The training places at the circle are obviously very in demand.
Approximately 620 applications were to be registered for in this year the places which can be assigned.
Is missing to the circle of far staff nevertheless, in order to be able to master the increased requirements and tasks.
At present there are still 50 not occupied places at the circle Mettmann.
Are looked for among other things physicians and engineers as well as forces of the general administration.
The CDU would like in the district assembly now together with the FDP and the UWG the initiative to seize and to the lack of specialist in the administration advance toward.
The administration is to compile a concept according to the desire of the parties “to the staff production and human resources development”.
A goal is it to cover not only short term Bedarfe at specialists but future-oriented the applicant scarceness to work against, it means.
The total concept should orient itself inward and outside, point out concrete measures for specialists from beyond and contain a training offensive, demands CDU, FDP and UWG.
That sounds already after a good approach.
Because the circle has to do it with staff problems, which one could not do in former times in such a way.
Other cities entice good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions.
The speech is from a proper “competition of the public employers”.
In addition comes a high number of employees, who separate disease or age-related from the service.
High time to acting thus, so that still do not remain vacant for more places.
But Klaus-Dieter Völker, Fraktionschef of the CDU, still goes with his party beyond the common request.
It provided recently already in the district assembly for a fist-thick surprise, when he questioned the personnel expenditure covering publicly and astonished the remaining parties.
It would like peoples that all possibilities are examined, which make a withdrawal possible from the local employers' association.
“Case we to a satisfying solution come not at short notice here, should the district administration with the trade unions - perhaps also in co-operation with the cities circle-belonging - a house tariff aim at”, thus peoples.
The CDU tries to pay the employees and officials better than it actually plans the collective contract for the public service.
The salaries are prescribed accurately, to increases or more funds give it at present only, if one changes into a high level, which orients itself on professional years.
But the tasks of the circle grew in the past years more and more.
Only few weeks ago new areas had to be furnished, in which employees worry about the regulations of the new prostitute law for the protection.
Last by the rising number of asylum seekers Thomas Hendele and director of circle Martin Richter a problem do not have district administrator: They have too little staff.
Italy intensifies the tone to NGO Migranten life rafts
Italy has NGOs, which life rafts for Migranten in the Mediterranean to begin, warned that they may not continue this, if they do not adhere to new rules for their operations.
“If NGOs no new code of conduct sign, are difficult it to see, like them continue working can”, said Ministers of the Interior Marco Minniti in an interview with the Turiner daily paper La Stampa.
Minnitis warning came one day, after the Italian authorities a boat of the German relief organization 'youth saves' had seized, because their crew had co-operated effectively with human being resellers in a way, the illegal immigration facilitated.
The relief organization, which operates only for one year, rejected it to express itself to detailed reproaches of the Italian public prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.
“For us and remains the rescue of the human life is our highest priority. It does thus much suffering to us that we can operate the organization in a statement for the moment not in the search and rescue zone”, said to the social media.
“We can judge all accusations, which are raised at present, only after we can all information have collected and the situation judge.”
The Italian authorities had the boat of 'youth save', the Iuventa, since October supervises.
It is assumed that its crew takes life boat Migranten on board, which are supplied with to them directly by human being resellers, and that the smugglers can drive off, so that the ships can be used again.
At least such a meeting took place allegedly only 1.3 miles before the Libyan coast, according to the document of the public prosecutor, whose contents of Italian media were published.
The crew is suspected, itself over the authority of the Italian coast guard, that supervises rescue missions in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives to jump over.
Under the code of conduct boats must have like the Iuventa above all an Italian police officer on board, their activities supervised.
Only three of the nine NGOs, which are involved in search and rescue missions, explained themselves so far ready to adhere to the code: Save the Children, MOAS from Malta and pro Activa open of arm from Spain.
The latter said on Thursday that the new rules were acceptable viewed as unnecessary, but, since they would not bring “substantial changes or handicaps” of their rescue operations with itself.
Under those, itself, is the Nobel Prize sponsor organization refuses signing physicians without borders (MSF).
Minniti said meanwhile that the number of the Migranten, which arrived after the rescue measures at Italy, into which last weeks had strongly decreased, which points to the fact that carried the efforts around the stabilization of the Libyan coast guard and co-operation with the local mayors Früchte.
“In the last days we began to see light in the end the tunnel”, said the Minister.
It gave plans for further discussions with Libyan mayors in this month over economic development initiatives admits and with Chad to be able to reach the Niger and Mali over measures for the reduction of the number of the Migranten, which leave these countries in hope, Europe.
Rises and Trials
Nine Weilermer Biker, the “citizen of Berlin outguard” and two guest drivers met in guard home in the north Palatinat, in order to enjoy four days long Trials and attractions.
But were available three got used to Guides.
The accommodation in the Wachenheimer valley proved as good starting point for to the tours.
The castle and wine festival of guard home was a welcome extra.
The first tour led at hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Michaelskapelle above Deidesheim.
Lookout points, partly on towers, followed from which one could look the far over Pfälzer forest and the pre-aged levels.
Between them there were again and again longer rises, for which long Trials rewarded.
On the second day it went to bath Dürkheim to the saltworks and to the folk festival sausage market.
Again lookout point lined up at lookout point, connected by “flowige” Trials and moderate rises.
On the last two days again many elevator meters were announced.
Caves, rock, towers, castles, ruins and contemplation huts brought welcome breaks.
In bath Dürkheim inhaled the Biker in the Freiluftinhalatorium healing brine.
Also Neustadt was headed for.
After 173 kilometers and nearly 4500 elevator meters the group had become acquainted with the Pfälzer forest from its best side - sporty and cultural -.
Console instead of lawns - Bundesliga prepares for it haven
Do those of sport star sit in the future before computer consoles, instead of fighting itself through-sweated in wind and weather over the stadium lawns?
Fact is: It haven became for a long time a serious industry, a lucrative business - large of star, millions fans and enormous tournaments with high fees including.
Also the first federal league associations recognized that, which engage themselves increasingly in this range.
2015 the VfL Wolfsburg made the beginning, later followed last the FC Schalke 04 and the VfB Stuttgart, which created in the middle of July an it haven department and FIFA 17 under contract took two professionals for the computer game.
“We hope to inspire thereby completely new young target audiences for the VfB”, say executive committee Jochen Röttgermann.
It is safe, “that on this course still some clubs ascends”.
On the coming weekend organize the football world union FIFA in London the first “Interactive club World Cup”, with which the Gamer of different clubs begins against each other.
Beside Schalke and Wolfsburg for example town center, Paris Saint Germain or the PSV Eindhoven qualified themselves Manchester.
Also Robin Dutt sees large potential in the it haven.
The ex-coach of Bayer Leverkusen and Werder Bremen advises in the meantime an agency for virtual football players.
“The material football must argue in particular with the 14 to 30-year old that the young people go to the 52-year old also in the future still into the stadium”, say.
And: The clubs tried, all possible markets, above all the Asian to conquer.
With prominent it-haven-learn under contract could one online by far more frequently on these markets present be, than only once in the year the Bundesliga crew to Asia fancy.
About what does it go exactly?
With the it haven computer games are fought out like “League OF Legends”, “Dota 2”, “Counterstrike” or just football simulation FIFA on competition level.
For a long time, as in the normal sport, leagues were also established, in which the professionals begin against each other.
And with the Asia plays 2022 it haven is already part of the official program.
But it concerns at all a correct kind of sport?
For many the conception is surely habituation needy.
Also Ingo Froböse argued for a long time with the question.
For the professor at the German sport university in Cologne it haven is a sport, because it is competitively and many biological and physical reactions show, which one finds also in the classical sport - for example increased heart rates, stress reactions, hormoneal changes.
In addition need it cognitive abilities, a technical and tactical understanding and a fast reactivity.
Professional Gamer should not only at the console, but also its body to train and to the nutrition pay attention.
“The fitte player is a good player.”
In addition, Froböse sees problems: “Doping becomes more and more a topic”.
Controls are with difficulty feasible with online plays, and in the scene the structures of the classical sport were missing.
The scientist positively out lifts the high integrative effect of the it haven.
The players are not internationally on the way, that are like a large global family, there give it intercultural obstacles.
A study of the management consultation Deloitte and the Federal association interactive entertainment software (BIU) forecasts the it haven a rapid growth.
2016 was converted thereby in Germany 50 million euros, mainly over advertisement, sponsoring and large tournaments.
In three years the revenue is to be with 130 million.
Against those scarcely 2.4 billion euros of the soccer federal league is that few.
However the it haven is “no longer far from the other established kinds of sport such as handball, basketball or ice hockey”, writes the Deloitte advisors.
Internationally many countries are already further.
Large markets are Asia and the USA, where ex-Basketballspieler Shaquille O take part ` Neal and baseball star Alex Rodriguez in US the team NRG eSports.
Hollywood actor Ashton Kutcher invests in the eSport Wettanbieter Unikrn.
Also in Europe some does.
To a Norwegian school it haven was introduced as subject of instruction, says Froböse.
In the Netherlands and in France the football first league clubs are in the meantime obligated according to Dutt to furnish an it haven department.
“In the European comparison Germany limps”, explained afterwards to VfB executive committee Röttgermann.
To purge only into nostalgia, and the old times to transfigure, today is not sufficient.
It concerns to retain the tradition of the club to align but the enterprise at the same time at the modern market.
“We live in a digitized world”, mean also Dutt.
“There one cannot note to it that only with the football everything remains in such a way, like it always was.”
Poison eggs ade - the egg alternatives to cooking and baking
By the scandal around poison-loaded eggs in the meantime nearly all Federal states are concerned.
Aldi south and Aldi north reacted and in all over Germany all eggs from the sale took.
Into the shelves eggs are to be only taken, as can be prove no Fipronil be contained.
Michelle Carter because of the texts, which Conrad Roy condemns to the suicide urge,
A woman from Massachusetts was condemned to two and a half years, because she encouraged her friend by texts and calls to the suicide.
Michelle Carter, now 20, was suspended 15 months of their condemnation behind the bars to spend and five year on probation.
Carter was condemned in June because of negligent homicide by Conrad Roy, who took himself on 13 July 2014 the life.
The father of Roy said on Thursday with the hearing: “My family is grief-stricken.
My son was my best friend.”
Carter was allowed to remain free up to the appointment.
It had been confronted with a maximum penalty by 20 years, but their legal representatives argued that both they and Mr Roy at a psychological illness suffered.
In red trousers and a creme blouse dressed, Carter was located there with tears in the eyes, with folded hands and downward directed eyes, when she was condemned.
“Your actions killed Conrad Roy”, said the public prosecutor to the court.
“Its life terminated you, in order to make their own better.
She took, said no responsibility” her.
“No regret showed you”.
But Carters attorney said, it was a “terrible circumstance, which it regrets completely”.
Judge Lawrence Moniz said however, it had not found out that you have “age or stage of maturity or its mental disorder a significant influence on their actions”.
A public prosecutor read an explanation of Roys mother Lynn Roy, that meant that there is “no day, at whom I the loss of my loved son does not mourn for.
I would like that he is proud on me and deals as I with everything. I try, despite all my pain, which we will carry for the eternity with us, for its sisters to be there”, am called it therein.
Roys sister, Camdyn Roy, stated that she becomes “pursued” by the realization that it will never participate in the wedding of her brother or an aunt for its children would be.
“No more this only person to have, with whom I was since my birth each day together, is a pain, which I will always keep for the rest of my life with me”, said her.
The case seems to set a legal precedent, since there is no law in Massachusetts, who makes it a crime, to request another suicide to commit.
Carter was 17 years old, when Roy was found dead in the year 2014 of a carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle.
The case drew national attention on itself, after Carters revealed reports of text that them had encouraged it to terminate its life.
“Hang you up, jump from a building, stab you, I white not, it gives many ways”, did not say it in several news, which it had sent in the two weeks before its death, while he was with his family on vacation.
In the instants before its suicide it wrote: “You must do it, Conrad” and “everything that you must do, are the generator to be switched on and you free and happy will be.”
Judge Moniz said the fact that Carter Aufmerksamkeit searched by the death of Roy and arranged that she was to profit by any press from the case.
The case divided the legal opinion.
To the few, which defended Carter, belonged Amanda Knox, which 2007 because of murder at her British co-inhabitant in Italy one condemned, before she was acquitted before two years.
Mrs. Knox, 30 years old, published a comment in the lots Angeles Times: “Michelle Carter earns sympathy and assistance, not prison.”
Joshua Kimmich: Learn from the new minilamely of the FC Bavaria
That Joshua Kimmich was allowed to accumulate with Audi Cup as a captain, is no coincidence.
The FC Bavaria does not trust the Confed Cup winner a large season extra motivation harms there.
Something was there differently at his place in the cab, saw Joshua Kimmich immediately, even if the additional article of clothing were very much, very small.
But since far and wide on the second day Audi Cups's naturally no Philipp Lahm and also no Manuel Neuer were to be seen, it made for it assigned commits itself stop to the arm.
“The coach did not announce, told it” the Confed Cup winner afterwards, after its first employment as a Bavaria captain.
Well, the beginning could have better run than with the 0:2 against SSC Naples.
But the indication of the coach could interpret Kimmich also in such a way.
Not the eight years older Arturo Vidal had been chosen in the C-eleven than play leaders, consisting of youth players, beginners and straight from the vacation professionals come, but he.
One distributes Zuckerl most of all to those, to which one thinks capable of much, which one wants to hold with mood.
Who thus chosen became to begin the inheritance of lame a small extra motivation can use only well.
Kimmich confirmed: “That is what one would like as a player: Responsibility take”.
On Wednesday the 22-year old tore as minilame over the field.
Right in the back, that is now its position, the white binds at the arm did its remaining.
And at all Kimmich in this starting formation worked like that, which can take the rudder also best into the hand.
It gave instructions, tried, to steer the uneingespielte troop.
It had the view for the whole, while many different were busy with itself.
Vidal to overact its missing fitness (hardly folded); Renato Sanches thereby, on devil come out to the achievements of the Asia travel to tie (folded only conditionally); and Sebastian Rudy and Niklas Süle not to be noticeable into their first appearance in the Bavaria tricot negatively.
That nevertheless folded completely well.
Süle accumulated beside Kimmich, Rudy before the defense, both sovereign acted.
The considerably occupied Napoli storm did frequently heavily, besides Süle tried itself also successfully in the structure of play a few marks.
Its colleague Rudy admitted that the result “like that was not, as we expected”.
In addition, it showed a tidy achievement with the debut.
Play shift, speed change: “For this style I was also gotten yes”.
How unusual this Bavaria world is still for the new acquisitions, one saw following the portion.
Rudy for example entered two in the catacombs not or, but determines six or seven interviews.
Kimmich said good-bye after a few crisp statements in the back of its new fellow players.
There he heard an interesting sentence of Süle: “Which goes off here, has I now already noticed.
With Bavaria you must win simply each play”.
Nevertheless that does not have he the new ones to no more to teach.
Alaba motivates ÖFB ladies
David Alaba believes in the success of our ÖFB ladies
Of Austria of most well-known soccer players shortly before the play over Twitter announced themselves and the ÖFB ladies all to property wished.
The Bavaria legionnaire is quasi club colleague of ÖFB captain Schnaderbeck and has a temperature with our Ladys also.
The Tweet of the Austrian soccer player of the year and championsleague winner should be a special motivation syringe.
Our ladies could need the famous Bavaria Dusel perhaps also well.
Enterprise contently with Rhineland-Palatinian Minister: Economy praises Wissings speed
, The relationship between the country and the regional economy, as Eveline Lemke (the Green) still minister of economics of Rhineland-Palatinate became often irreconcilable was.
That points itself to more than one year, in which the new minister of economics Volker Wissing (FDP) is in the office.
Chambers and enterprises from the region speak on T V-request of a change in the economic policy - and blames at the same time the old minister.
Frank Natus, chairman of the combination Trierer enterprise (VTU), says: “Wissing takes up the desires of the economy, which blocked Lemke all together”.
The largest about-face sees Natus in the infrastructure policy: The gap conclusion of the motorway 1 between Kelberg and Adenau is located in the priority list of the country now right at the top.
Still in this year the Ministry hopes for a plan approval procedure, until 2021 are to stand the building law.
A role in the plans of the country plays also the western bypass Trier, which stands in the urgent need of the Plan for Federal Traffic Routes.
A goal is it to take the distance in December 2020 in enterprise says Ministry spokeswoman Cornelia Holtmann.
Natus sees in a guide in order supporting regional, but internationally competing enterprises.
Trier, as from Wissing lively, with the wine a Rhineland-Palatinate label aims at the Chamber of Commerce and industrie (IHK), in order to increase the paragraph in supermarkets and to stop the trend for ten years of the sagging German wine export.
Besides Wissing has an open ear for humans, who want to create their own company, praises the IHK.
The chamber of trade Trier sees an additional incentive for young training in the new master bonus, says managing director Matthias Schwalbach.
A premium of 1000 euros for the existed mastership examination and 2500 euros is intended, if graduates make themselves independent after the master training within ten years.
The homework list for the country remains however long.
With planned road construction fast facts are to be created, at the same time are missing it to the country at necessary staff, say January Glockauer, managing director of the IHK Trier.
By 56 new engineers, whom Wissing wants to adjust with the national enterprise mobility, so far only 29 places are occupied.
The IHK demands to assign more orders to external offices.
CDU vice-chairperson of a parliamentary group Christian Baldauf refers in addition to calculations of the Court of Auditors, the country invests 2017 and 2018 more as 20 million euro less into the receipt of national roads than suggested.
In addition Frank Natus expects still another concept of the country, how it wants to repair the lack of specialist in the region.
The past broadband development furthermore is sobering up in the country.
In the year 2016 regional enterprises had evaluated mains supply in a IHK survey only with the note 3.4.
They weighted about coming to a hold Internet connections and aborts.
Ex-minister of economics Eveline Lemke is against it momentarily out from the policy and still sits in the supervisory board of the wind force enterprise pro wind.
The Green parliamentary group left Lemke to April, in order to become president of a private university in Karlsruhe - where it vacated the field after four months because of discrepancies already again.
Audi is to change 850,000 diesel engined vehicles - automakers see themselves confronted with a counterreaction
BMW said one day before the announcement of Audi that it would offer to update the software in more than 350,000 vehicles.
The BMW chairman said, the enterprise was the opinion that “there are and referred more intelligent options than driving restrictions”, thereby to European cities - under it Munich to forbid or limit where BMW resident actual of diesel engined vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe, in order to reduce its Diesel emissions.
None of the enterprises described the enterprises as callback.
European car manufacturers promoted the use of diesel engined vehicles in Europe and the United States strongly, in order to support the observance of rules for carbon dioxide emissions.
But the nitrogen oxides, which emit diesel engines, are considered as carcinogenic agents and can cause asthma.
The costs of the car manufacturers to install plants for the neutralization of the exhaust gases discharged by diesel engined vehicles increase likewise, which makes it difficult to keep the price of the cars competitive.
The German Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel is accused likewise to mollycoddle the powerful automobile companies and to ignore signs of the problem.
The enterprises try to avoid the errors from Volkswagen to keep that the use of so-called switching off devices, which could adjust emissions, in order the regulations if a car were tested, but go back with normal driving conditions.
In the United States several employees of Volkswagen were accused, others are examined on both sides of the Atlantic.
In the past month the former director/conductor of thermodynamics in the engine development was arrested by Audi in Germany.
The former manager, Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio, is Italian and is protected from there against extradition and could not in the United States in court be placed.
To go around beginning of this year Audi included into German criminal investigations with Volkswagen, after the authorities accused Audi of a system to have installed in order the emission regulations in Europe, and a request, which concentrated on the United States, was extended.
The inclusion of Audi into the investigation could load Volkswagen with difficulty: The luxury car manufacturer contributes superproportionally to the profit of Volkswagen.
This message has the raft on Saturday on the Isar
The city wants to protect the Isar.
So that also the Isar visitors join, a raft drives by Munich on tomorrow's Saturday, which has a special message.
Whom it pulls on Saturday again to the Isar, which will see between Flaucher and Reichenbach bridge a large raft there.
And that is not a usual raft, with Isar tourists.
Separate the building paper wants to clear up.
On the raft one sees a large info transparency.
It shows a garbage mountain.
The prelude to a public campaign, in order to appeal to the Isar visitors.
With the slogan “true love is…” the understanding for the Isar is to sharpen as worth of protection game river.
The raft drove already last summer over the Isar and also in this year gives it further actions and measures, in order to achieve a considerate and environmentally conscious behavior.
Mordillos tuber noses and the laughter against the suffering
Mordillo was occasionally one of the usually-published cartoon draughtsmen, the tuber noses of its figures is its brand name.
Also with 85 the Argentinean draws still and works on a film.
Its message: Laugh, “gives too much suffering in the world”.
Guillermo Mordillo was born on 4 August 1932 as a son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires.
In the first years as artists it pierced itself among other things as a draughtsman for greetings cards - which frustrated it.
“The happiest day in my vocational life was the day, as into my job lost”, said it once.
At stations in Lima, New York and Paris end of the 60's the break-through succeeded to it: with the publication of its Cartoons in “Paris Match” and then also in the “star” and other prominent magazines approximately around the world.
Even in China Mordillo found many fans.
Again and again the artist of cities let himself be inspired.
Large, roundish Mordillo figures cavort in designs with the inclined tower of Pisa, Big Ben in London and Red Square in Moscow.
Early in the morning it also still today sits reports own according to at the drawing board, works daily nearly ten hours.
Over calendars, puzzles, books for large and small, T-shirts, stuffed animals and watches its quaint figures find further to much spreading world-wide.
For six years he works in addition on a cartoon and a TV-series with his figures.
The main person in the film “Crazy Iceland” is a giraffe - Mordillos popular animal in his designs -, which has a millipede as opponent.
For the first time speak its figures in the 3D-Film, which is to come 2019 on the cinema canvas.
“I do not know exactly, what they will say, it is strangely for me”, says Mordillo.
The film script is not written by it.
Therefore it sets rather on the TV-series, which, as is wordless produced its original designs.
Lavender from Provence of the climate change threatens
It became a symbol of Provence in Southern France, but there is a warning that he is threatened by the climate change.
The lavender is declining because of reminding the conditions drought and because of the diseases transferring insects, which prepares large headache for scientists and farmers, who try, to find solutions.
Eric Chaisse, Experte of the institute for agricultural research CRIEPPAM in Provence, said: “The lavender in Provence is effectively endangered, because the plant was exposed in the past years to the effects of the climate change, that in the spring much less rains brought and in the autumn much more.
This has effects on the lifetime of lavender.
There is also a small cicada, a micro bacterium, which transfers dwarf cicadas, and in very dry weather there are a great many of it.”
And it stands much on the play.
Lavender oil does not only attract for holiday-makers, it is very in demand also for perfume and cosmetics.
Eric Chaisse said: “Instead of very long plant ears with a large number from flowers to have, we have smaller, underdeveloped and either missing or weakened.
Thus we have fewer parts with ethereal oil.”
To the solutions, which are considered, belong a better water distribution and the slowing down of the evaporation from the ground, in addition, spraying the plants with a protecting mixture from tone and water and the development sorts, which are more resistant in relation to dryness.
The small town Geisa in the Thuringian Rhön celebrates this year its 1200-year old existence.
Fixed high point is this Saturday and Sunday with a Middle Ages celebration.
Shopkeepers, guilds, resellers, Vaganten or a land farmhand camp are to have to be experienced on these days in the city center.
The murder of a journalist the increasing threat in Mexico underlines
The employees of the weekly paper Riodoce meet normally on Wednesdays, in order to examine their plans for the reporting over the recent chaos in the State of Sinaloa by the organized crime, corrupt officials and ceaseless drug wars.
But on this day, in the shade of their own tragedy, they met, in order to speak about security.
It was communicated to them that it is important to change their routines.
Two high-ranking journalists discuss, what feels more reliably: They are to also leave their children in the office to take, who were 2009 the goal of an attack with shells, or them at home.
Security experts wrote three words on a board at the front of the area: Opponent, neutral one, allied one.
They ask the reporters to suggest names for each column - no proof is necessary, perceptions and gut feelings is enough.
There are drug smugglers to stand for politician, businessmen, journalists, who are suspected, on the pay roll the government or the trusts a catalog of criminals, who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous.
There is no respite of the force, and during itself generally speaking country the corpses accumulate, participate more and more journalists: at least 25, since then president Enrique Pena Nieto in December 2012 his office began. 589 stands after attacks and threats under federal protection and gave it up to now in this year at least seven dead in seven states.
Under the latters are their publisher and its Inspirator of Riodoce, the joint founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.
“The largest error is it to live and journalist be in Mexico”, wrote Valdez in one of its numerous books concerning force in connection with drugs.
Its absence becomes heartfelt, although its presence hangs everywhere available actual a large photo of Valdez, which shows its middle finger with the word “Justice”, on the front of the Riodoce building. Two reporters in the thirties years, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, carry T-shirts, which show its smiling face with glasses or its typical Panama hat.
The workshop takes place less than two months after its death, and the reporters discuss trauma, its nightmares, sleeplessness, paranoia their divided topics.
Although 2010 a special Federal Prosecutor's Office were established, in order to work on the cases from journalists to, this introduced only two criminal procedures according to the committee to the protection of journalists.
As is the case for most thousands of murders, which are connected with drug trade and organized crime each year, the murderers are in court placed only rarely by journalists.
With Riodoce they insist still on treating the force from Sinaloa to although they are grief-stricken and although the terrain is now still traitorous.
Without information about the murderers, without justice, the meeting has little benefit for the discussion of security, says Ibarra.
“It is very stupid to waste my time in this workshop”, says it.
“So long we not the why know, distrust we all.”
In the morning the 15. May left Valdez the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the state capital of Culiacan.
It created it only to drive a few block far before its red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men. It was forced from its car and shot 12 times at it, probably because of the name of the newspaper - which with “twelfth is translated river”.
The contactors drove in its car and damaged it in the proximity.
Valdez was 50 years old.
It left one woman and two adults of children.
Rumors are inclined to fly around in Culiacan freely.
But to the topic Valdez gives it to practically nothing as silence.
Since Guzmans arrest last year and the extradition into the United States in January had become Sinaloa one of the bloodiest battlegrounds of the country, since rival factions fought here, in order to fill the vacuum.
It does not constitute anything that in Sinaloa each day someone or several humans on the road are shot or that the cemetery is full from decorated, two-story mausoleums for drug kings, who are larger than many houses for the living persons.
Forget for one minute that there is a condition of the “peace”, if only one trust has control of the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trade routes into the United States.
Nevertheless and despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of its work it broke, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a joint founder and a director von Riodoce, with the debt by the fact that he could not protect its friend.
He believes that two misunderstandings contributed to the murder.
First it gave in February the publication of an interview with Damaso Lopez, to a leader of one of the rivaling trust parliamentary groups in the war with Guzmans sons.
This publication may have annoyed the sons, assumed course members bought up each copy of the edition, as soon as it was delivered to news stands.
The second error lay not to force Valdez to it to leave after the seizure of another newspaper, which had published the same history, the country to its own security.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and its killing is viewed as a milestone in the Mexican force against journalists.
It had so for a long time survived that its friends and colleague assumed that it would be always there.
It was 2003 as experienced reporters for Noroeste actively, when he united with five colleagues for the establishment of Riodoce and US Dollar participation sold 50.
In Sinaloa, “it was impossible to operate journalism without on the drug problem to push”, said Bojorquez.
With the time the newspaper a call earned itself because of the courageous and honest reporting, and the revenue and the advertisement increased.
Reporters loved it to be able to publish hard meeting investigations without fear of censorship and the readers were fascinated of a publication, in which they could read stories, which nobody dared to treat otherwise.
It received eight years after the establishment of Riodoce the prestigious “Maria moorland Cabot price” for her reporting in Latin America.
In the same year Valdez won 'internationally presses Freedom Award' of the committee to the protection of journalists for its courage with the pursuit of Mexican drug history, wherever she led.
It admitted voluntarily that he had fear.
“I would like to live on”, said he at present to the CPJ honor.
Drug trade in Sinaloa “is a way of life”, said it in past October in an interview with Rompeviento TV.
“You must take over the task, which is given to you as a journalist - either that or you play the stupid one.
I would not like to be asked: “You have in view of so many dead done… why have you not said which, what took place?”
The Riodoce team misses Valdez, the funster, which could swear like a dock labourer, the friend, who was generous with embraces and pieces of advice, a teacher, who knew, how one survives.
They trusted in its routine.
It would always carry its hat.
It will always to El Guayabo, the bar in relation to the office, go and always at the same table sitting there.
Now they ask: Was its love for the routine its spoiling?
Its death forced also it to question their own assumptions over it how they settle and alive remain can their work best.
“You do not like it, if them itself with their wives, their children, their clean business, their secret starting and runways”, in order to move drugs, to employ.
“These things were illegal”, said Bojorquez.
The result is, even in the best times, a high degree of self-censorship and self-preservation.
Trust its own instincts.
If it smells wrongly, stay away of it.
Annoyance is, said the publisher of the Riodoce Andres Villarreal the fact that “smell a sense can be deceived,… and then is the thing with Javier happened.”
The old rules, as it and others say, are not valid in Sinaloa any longer - just as not as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states, in which a poisonous mixture from lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home.
The landscape constantly changes.
In the area, in which the employees from Riodoce met to safety training, suddenly no mobile phones were permitted. Days before it became admits that Spyware, which is sold exclusively at governments was used for the monitoring of journalists and activists in Mexico.
Outside two policemen looked for protection from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shade of a tree.
They were assigned of the federal state government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-floor building in a middle class quarter from Culiacan to.
Half in jest, it asked itself some the reporter whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of the policemen, who the governor as trustworthily not designated.
It is months ago, since the reporters went into the mountain landscape, where the drug gangs stand de facto under control.
For the edition of this week Riodoce looked on three main stories.
It gave the murder of the brother of the former well-known boxer to Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.
They had also a Exposé to the public expenditures, which concentrated on the hometown of the governor.
And there was a group, which removes a block of the office of the state lawyer in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a kidnapping accomplished.
There was no official word over it, who was kidnapped or like it happened, therefore was offered caution, as it time became to write, what knows everyone in the city: that the restaurant is a favourite restaurant of drug dealers and authorities.
A reporter experienced from public recordings that the restaurant under the name of a politician was registered, the governing Institutional revolution party (PRI) belonged, nearly the whole century all political levels controlled.
Recently several PRI governors were accused of because of high-carat cases by corruption.
Villarreal asked the reporter to write over preceding incidents in this restaurant under it one, in which a son of “El Chapo” Guzman escaped a military assault.
Only few months before would have viewed the readers the column of Valdez as the best informed source over kidnapping.
“Early one we would have already known, what passed”, said Villarreal, 46, with the nickname “El Flaco” because of its slim body stature.
“Now all channels of communication with our sources broke.”
The office of Valdez was rededicated to the depository for indications and stickers, which protest against the murders of journalists, because the employees became something, which they would have never expected: Activists in the name of the press.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez snatched herself a few indications and went on the next morning to a demonstration because of a further journalist to the office of the state lawyer.
Salvador Adame disappeared three days, after Valdez had been killed, in the western Federal State Michoacan.
A burned body was discovered and officials to say, based on DNA tests that it is its.
Generally speaking country journalists became more lautstärker, by her in organized protests “SOSs press” on sidewalks and buildings wrote down.
On this day the director is Bojorquez away in Washington and tried there to collect international support for the law in the case Valdez.
With a meeting with the governor on the day after the murder of Valdez Ramirez the authorities accused von of Sinaloa to spy journalists and let it kill, because they said the truth.
She asked since then for the fact that she is again divided by the government, because she is anxious that her rage injured their objectivity.
Valdez had repetitive said that journalists in Mexico of organized crime took part, in it government officials and an indifferent society were “surrounded”.
In its last book “Narco Journalism” it that reporters are killed not only by drug gangs, wrote but also on instruction of politicians and safety forces, who were with the organized crime under a cover.
The medium guard group of “Articulo 19” assigned last year more than half of the attacks on journalists to the police and the official.
“In Mexico you die, because they would like that you hold, said the mouth” for Ramirez.
Obviously the murders have a deterring effect.
Nobody forgets the death of the Bloggerin Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state Tamaulipas before six years.
Their body was found together with a note, which was signed allegedly by the Zetas trust: “Here am I because of my reports.”
A computer keyboard and headphones lay beside its separated head.
Some branches have to close selected, like the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state Chihuahua after the murder of the correspondent Miroslava Breach in March.
Others continue to make, how it did El Manana of Nuevo Laredo after the murder of its director in the year 2004.
2010 addressed itself the Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly to the drug trusts with a editorial on the title page with the heading “which want you from us?”
Some journalists fled from their mother countries or even from the country.
It is a painful decision.
It is heavy to find work in the exile and they observe still the roads and look for dangers.
And sometimes they are hunted, as it obviously the photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered 2015 together with four women in a apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Veracruz.
For those, which stay and which continue work, it is a daily dance with risky decisions.
Ibarra, which wanted to be once poets, admits that the drug trade frightens him.
“Mexico goes to hell, and therefore I became a reporter”, said he.
Over midnight on last Friday, when the last edition was already terminated, the editors of Riodoce sat on the sidewalk before the office and drank beer, when at once all began to hum their telephones.
A set of shootings with gang rivals and safety forces in the proximity of the bathing resort Mazatlan had left 19 confirmed dead.
The war continued to escalate, as it was promised by a set of trust messages in the region.
From the pavement they published the news on the website of Riodoce over mobile phone.
The title page had to be changed on the next day.
Sirens howled in the proximity of up a further shooting in the area.
Bojorquez threw a view of the policemen, who held guard, in order to see whether they were in readiness.
If they had at all fear, they did not show it.
Under the enormous portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper, whose middle finger for completely Sinaloa was visible, the employees of Riodoce followed his traces.
“As you can only remember close”, said Bojorquez, “if on the same day, on which Javier was murdered, the trainee me at it asked, them for reporting on the road fancy.”
Dinosaur used camouflage, in order to evade to its enemies
At first sight it looks although a frightening like a Statue.
Now researchers found out that the first realizations of the unbelievable rhinoceros of a Canadian miner became to receive so well that experts described it as “Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs”.
It was so well received that they could even determine that its flaky skin was from reddish brown - and they said, it something from a “jerky past” would have had.
The report in the magazine “Current Biology” called it “the besterhaltenen armored dinosaur, which were ever found, and one of the best dinosaur copies of the world”.
The fossil is a again discovered kind of Nodosaurier, which lived in the center of the chalk time forwards between 110 million and 112 million years.
Its unbelievably well received condition astonished researchers, who describe it as “really remarkably”,
According to reports in National Geographic the armored herbivore is the best received fossil of its art.
It was found by Shawn Funk, as it to 21. March 2011 in the Suncor Millennium mine in close proximity to away McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada, dug.
It met on something that by the surrounding rock seemed wrongly at the place, and decided, to look more exact.
The fossil discovered by him was sent into the Royal Tyrrell museum OF Paläontology.
They spent the next six years to it to uncover the wild animal within 2,500 pound (1,100 kg) the heavy earth lump.
After all this hard work the finished result is now ready to be revealed.
“If you only a little with the eyes blink, could believe you nearly that it slept, said” the main author Caleb Brown, Wissenschaftler in the Royal Tyrrell museum, where the creature is to be seen.
“It will be received into the History of Science as one of the most beautiful and best received dinosaur copies - the Mona Lisa of the Dinosauriere.”
Researchers found out that this herbivore, although it is covered with an armament and resembles a changing tank was threatened probably by meat eating dinosaurs.
The strongly armored dinosaur used a red and white camouflage, in order to hide itself before predators, and used a screen technology, which admits as Gegenbeschattung is, which is used also by many modern animals.
This would have permitted it to mix and its enemies evade better into its environment, says experts, what points to the fact that it was threatened by larger dinosaurs.
The 110million-year-old creature from the family of the Nodosaurier made headlines for the first time in May and is now in the Royal Tyrrell museum OF Palaeontology to be seen.
Researchers studied now the wild animal and it Borealopelta markmitchelli after the museum technician Mark Mitchell called, one of a team, which spent more than 7,000 hours to uncover it carefully.
The amazing preservation of the copy made it for Dr. possible Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the sample and the form of sheds and arms over its body.
They discovered the countering shade, a common defense method in the animal kingdom, which meant that the point of the creature was darker than their bottom.
Although the countering shade is usual, are the results surprising, since the size of Borealopelta exceeds by far those of the today living animals.
It points to the fact that the dinosaur was hunted by sufficient pressure by meat eating dinosaur that the evolution favoured the concealment of the confrontation as means of surviving.
But most contemporary animals, which use the countering shade - you think of deer, zebras or armadillos - are many smaller and more vulnerable than booty, which signals that this Nodosaurier was exposed to a genuine fight around surviving.
“Strong predator behavior on a solid, strongly armored dinosaur, the dinosaur predators of the chalk time show to have been as dangerous must”, said Brown.
The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales shows also that the skin of the dinosaur was red-brown.
Scientists examine further the animal for references over his life, including his conserved intestine contents, in order to find out, what ate it as his last meal.
They believe that the dinosaur, when it died, turned out into a river and was floated in the sea outside, where he sank on the back to the sea-bottom.
At this time was Alberta as warmly as south Florida today, and rivers and oceans probably many far than them it today are inland common.
“This Nodosaurier is really remarkable, because it is covered with conserved flaky skin completely, in addition, receive in three dimensions remains and” Brown maintains, said the original form of the animal.
“The result is that the animal looks today nearly exactly the same as in the early chalk time.
They do not need to use much fantasy, in order to reconstruct it. If you only a little squint with the eyes, you could believe nearly that it is at sleeping.”
The chalk time was a time, when enormous Theropoden, carnivorous Dinosauriere through, pulled which stood on two legs, the earth.
Although the king of them, who lived Tyrannosaurus Rex, millions years after Borealopelta, became the armored dinosaur of some its terrifying ancestors hunted.
In addition the Acrocanthosaurus, a foot belongs to 38 (11.5 m) long, six tons heavy monster.
The scientists, whose newest realizations in the technical periodical appear Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta sank after death in the sea and was mummified in the mud.
The creature was found by Shawn Funk, as he to 21. March 2011 in the Suncor Millennium mine in close proximity to away McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada, dug.
According to the museum it is the besterhaltene armored dinosaur of the world, including skin and armament, and is complete from the lip to the hip.
The creatures were on the average about 18 foot (5 meters) long and up to 3,000 pound (1,300 kg) weighed.
It contained two 20 duty for a long time points, which rose up from its shoulders.
The researchers believe that the armored herbivore was washed by western Canada, until a flooded river flooded it in the open sea.
But the underwater funeral of the dinosaur retained its armament in exquisite detail.
The petrified remnants of this special copy are so well received that the skin remains cover still bumpy armour-plates along the dinosaur
As Michael Greshko for National Geographic wrote, such a level of preservation is as 'rare as a profit in the Lotto.
The more I it view, the more confusing become it.
Petrified remains of the skin cover still the bumpy armour-plates, which carry the head of the animal.
Its right front foot is because of its side, its five fingers is upward spread.
I know the sheds at its sole zählen'.
In the thunderstorm: Mass freeway pileup on A8: Many injured ones
Violent accident on Thursday evening on the A8: Scarcely 30 vehicles are complicated into a mass freeway pileup.
There are numerous injured ones, kilometer-long of back-up - and Gaffer.
On the motorway Stuttgart Munich (A8) on the late thursday afternoon with a mass freeway pileup about 20 humans were injured.
According to first information of the police around 17.00 o'clock between the connection points Adelzhausen and Odelzhausen (district Aichach Friedberg) had into one another-crashed during a thunderstorm of scarcely 30 vehicles, under it probably also trucks.
Over the exact number of the injured ones first no information was present.
A police spokesman concerns easy to moderately severe injuries, said.
A large quantity at rescue vehicles was at the accident scene.
The A8 became direction Munich completely closed.
In driving direction Munich formed a approximately ten kilometer long back pressure.
As a AZ-reporter reports, it came also on the oncoming carriageway to substantial handicaps - by numerous Gaffer.
The fire-brigade noted the characteristics of the vehicle steering wheels, which have to count now on sensitive punishments.
Shortly after 18:45 clock occurred then still another second accident on the A8, this time between Augsburg and Dasing.
It had come to a collision between a car carrier and a passenger car.
An emergency rescue helicopter was on the way to the accident scene.
German Railways: Company tests “comfort check in”
It is one moment, which nearly everyone experienced already: Nothing suspecting one sits in the course and sleeps.
Or one is absorbed into its work and has a straight ingenious thought.
And then: pufff.
The conductor comes and wakes one roughly or tears the passenger in the middle from the Workflow.
Ticket control.
But the times of the interruptions are soon past.
The German Railways tests at present the conductorless ticket control.
One confirms simply by mobile phone that one cancels its place taken and thereby the ticket.
At present a test operation runs on two distances.
“The offer arrives, expands we it.
It will be then presumably at the beginning of coming year on many further long-distance traffic distances in Germany available”, said a railway spokesman.
“Comfort check in” calls the course the ticket cancellation without conductors.
In order to be able to use, however some conditions must be fulfilled: One needs smartphones or a Tablet.
And one must have booked an online ticket - which anyway already most passengers do.
One must it in addition over the app of the course, which bought railways navigator, which anyway the most comfortable kind of the ticket reservation is.
And one needs a seat reservation last.
Because the “comfort check in” functions in such a way: One rises into the course, calls its ticket under “my tickets”.
At the test customers then a button appears for electronic cancellation.
The course companions get a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is in the course and took the booked seat Y.
The course companion comes with the ticket control at place Y white it that a passenger with online ticket already cancelled sits there.
One can sleep on thus, continues working, further to be silent.
“Check in” has two advantages: one for the customer, one for the course - which is to use again the passengers.
“Who would like to travel relaxed without ticket control by our Zugbegleitpersonal, checks in railways the navigator simply.
This makes for the passengers possible to arrange their travel time in the course more personal”, says Michael Peterson, Marketing-Vorstand of railways long-distance traffic.
Second plus: “And our employees have more time than today, over with the individual customer needs to deal”.
Who often drives course, it knows that apart from delays and missed courses the ticket controls belong to the largest annoyances.
Because often one, in each case however one of the travelings not all documents, has which one needs for the cancellation of online tickets.
Either are missing the credit card or the identity card or otherwise a document, which one must show.
The result are endless discussions between course companions and passenger, which leads to bad tendency in the compartment or region and delays with control of the own ticket and which conductor takes in the end the time to worry about other requests.
Still only a small number of test customers can use the new service.
And only on the connections the ICE 915 Dortmund Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart meals.
Further course numbers on the same distance are not de-energized yet.
Like activists came to learn the answer to the question: “Whose Streets?”
On 9 August 2014 Brittany Ferrell up to its core was shaken.
Only one day, after she had arrived at New York town center, sat in St. Louis Geborene on the bed of a Airbnb apartment, it rented and scrolled by Facebook on its telephone.
It tripped over a post office from someone the High School.
“The police killed a straight 18-year old child, and it lies still on the road”, was called it there.
Confused, since nobody had gepostet otherwise on their feed the information, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
A user with acts @TheePharoah on its time LINE was constantly retweetet.
The rapper from the area of St. Louis participated, the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year old, who was killed by a white policeman in Ferguson, Mo., live to tweeten.
It postete a picture of Browns liveless body, which was stretched on the road and there four hours would remain.
“That is wild”, thought Ferrell with itself.
But death was not anything new for it and their community.
She put her mobile phone down, in order to return later in the evening to Tweets over humans on the Canfield drive.
There were photos of the police volume and people, which cried, and of a man, who stated, to be Browns father who carried a sign with the label: “Fergusons police killed straight to mean unarmed son!”
She observed a live feed, with which a policeman before a group of demonstrators with a barking dog stood.
In another video, it said, released another policeman its rifle and cried: “I become you… Animals all kill.”
“That is not usual”, remembered Ferrell its statement.
“That is not the kind of murder, to which we to have gotten accustomed and which we typically to call to be able.”
In this moment I felt vibration frost.
I was furious and cried.”
It booked a return flight and went on the next day home.
After the landing at 23 o'clock fetched it their 6-year old daughter from the house of their father and decided that the two would drive on the next morning to Ferguson.
What in the following three years with Ferrell and Ferguson, is did the topic of a new documentary film, “Whose Streets happen? ”, in the cinemas starting from that 11.
It is a history of surviving and the protest, which love and the loss, which strength and the strength, which consist of the view of humans, who live in the community and which roads filled, in order to demand answers.
When Ferrell with its daughter, who carried a flower dress and a suitable crown, drove to Ferguson, the two discussed a discussion, which they had innumerable marks this morning ago “over the black experience and the black condition “.
“You remember, how I taught you, when black people must fight for, that they believe?” remembered it what said her.
“We go now to Ferguson, because the police killed a 18-year old boy and that was not correct.
I could not carry it forward”, said Ferrell later.
“What happened today, is a high point whose… which in the past happened.
It must be seen it be known and it and drawn up therein.
It must be fully-fledged, know not only activism and organization, but also the different layers of the black experience and the black condition and which we to do to have, in order to become free, in order to free us.
Even if I have the luck to give her an experience with it personally no striking racism deeply felt, is it not different than the next black woman child.
I have the feeling, I it a bad service would render to think it far of it.”
The first station, when they arrived at Ferguson, was to the South Florissant Road, a place opposite the Police Department, which became a Campgebiet, when the activists waited for the possible non--accusation of Officer Darren Wilson.
There Ferrell and their daughter connected themselves with a local business owner, who made the lunch.
They prepared bags and helped to pass it on at demonstrators.
Slowly a new kind of activism for Ferrell Gestalt began to assume.
“My activism changed after 9 August totally”, said it and noticed that it as a student at the university of Missouri St. Louis Präsidentin of the Minority student Nurses Association was and on meal justice and health inequalities in black communities concentrated.
“I did not have experience in organizing.
It came everything.”
Later Ferrell met weeks during an evening demonstration Sabaah Folayan, one of the CO-directors of the film.
Folayan said, it and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar wanted only “to document”, what happened.
A question came Ferrell into the sense: “Want you to document or tries it to find a history use it can?”
This skepticism was fed by innumerable cases by humans, often of white ones - in a community, which profited from its pain and its ruggedness.
As Folayan recently in an interview explained: “We had heard that humans, who grew up in Ferguson born and did not center their voting and we wanted to make it differently.”
Folayan had already co-operated with the CO-director at that time Damon Davis, an artist from the range, which admits rum for its activism around death row passengers is.
Its commitment brought home the project to Ferrell, together with six other native ones followed the team of “Whose Streets?” in the years after Browns shooting.
“This documentary film is not someone, which speaks for us or speaks with us. We talk”, said Davis.
“That was the main thing for me, as these people are explained, because I will be in such a way represented.”
The goal was not it to concentrate on Ferrells experience - to show over that it concerns with the movement “not around a Messiah leader, but a community, which accumulates, said” Folayan - it proved as the open participant of the film.
Consequently documents of “Whose Streets show?” surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrells life, as it falls in love and marries their wife.
“I felt as naked”, said Ferrell and laughed, when she saw the finished product for the first time.
“However I understood that there must be a certain vulnerableness with this work and with humanizing of black people.”
Beyond that Ferrells history repeats the role of the black gay women in the broader Black Lives matte movement.
Two of the three founders of the movement, who coined the film “BlacklivesMatter” after the killing of the black teenager Trayvon Martin in the year 2012 in social media, identify themselves as gay.
“Black one, gay women in leading positions the movement altogether carried”, said Ferrell, “and from there constantly fight we at different fronts.
Black, gay women must carry the main load of everything.”
Folayan agreed to notice that “the movement is thought really of black women and many black women upright”.
It insists however on the fact that “this no affirmative type is from action”, was selected with the Ferrell due to its identity as heart of the film.
“You was the person, who aroused, said this energy” her.
“It is not coincidence, although it was at foremost front, because with a life at these crossings as a black, gay woman so much stands on the play.
You can feel their energy by the screen.”
In the meantime the news cameras in Ferguson disappeared for a long time, but the racial connections between the community and the police exist further.
Ferrell is on probation for 2 ½ years because of the blocking of a motorway with a demonstration.
It describes the socio-political atmosphere of the area, which calls her it home: “A chaos”.
It nevertheless clasps to a singing and it feels this memory obligated, since then it before three years in Ferguson on the road went.
“It is our obligation to fight for our freedom.
Our obligation is to be won.
We must love and support each other.
We do not have anything to lose - except our chains.”
Of “dream” to “megalomania”: TV-readers discuss bit gallery
The bit gallery moves humans, although it is not yet built.
But the idea of a shopping centre at the south end of the pedestrian precinct splits the population since the first presentation 2009 into proponents and opponents.
The topic hardly leaves cold to one.
Also on our Facebook side “people friend Bitburg” is discussed the topic.
While the one to the bit gallery say: “That would be a dream” (Anja Becker) or “that would genuinly be class” (Nicole Schausten), comes from the other side: “No humans” (Siggi Betzen) need or completely simply: “Megalomania!” (Lars Scholz).
While the proponents build on the fact that a gallery of more customers pulls into the city, about which also the remaining business profits, fears the opponents that then the pedestrian precinct bleeds to death.
In addition comes: The gallery is planned exactly on the property, on which the farmer's market hall stands, in which 13 directmarked out their products offers.
With beginning of the construction work thereby conclusion will be.
The gallery doers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - to the Beda place with possibility, to outside seats.
Simone Zimmer: “We buy already for many years nearly weekly in the farmer's market hall.
Mainly our eggs, in addition, the delicious cakes of the farmer women again and again very gladly.
Also we discovered the butcher's shop for us.
We would desire that also during and particularly after the building of the gallery an opportunity exists, this offer upright to receive.
In other cities it gives also.
Above all the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting.”
Gerd Densing: “Whether directmarked out settle, arrive in a market hall in the gallery on the height of the rent.
Those might however probably not be low with the new project straight.”
Eva Kilic: “To which purchase palaces in Bitburg?
Whether clothing, shoes, drugstore or supermarkets: I find that redundant.
Of it gives already enough in our city.
One sees nevertheless, like many shop business here empty - some since months and years.
Since there is not here however even a tidy weekly market, it is all the more important that at least the market hall us remains.
Because the commodity offered there is fresh nevertheless, to a large extent directly by the producer is offered and is in addition inexpensive.
As one sees, shop business in a purchase center is rented only by larger companies, because the local rents are often not portable for a retailer.
Unfortunate, there are special firms nearly no longer and what of it is still remaining, probably will then still disappear.”
Wolf Fandel: “A shopping centre with a market hall does not fit for me.
And the gallery does not fit after Bitburg.
Above all: Where is the farmer's market hall during the construction period?
The old Edeka would be the solution - also in the long term, if the bit gallery actually comes sometime.
Or does it create the ghost bit gallery already before to drive all business out from Bitburg?”
George Marquet: “That will simply not function.
And a shopping center, which stands empty, needs also nobody.
In my opinion it would have been better to promote times a correct farmer's market instead of this gallery.
But for a farmer's market hall give it owing to that to madly many - how I find - senseless building projects in Bitburg no more place.
If the farmer's market hall is broken, piece culture will disappear.”
A suitable similarity: Artist creates portrait with Chelsea Mannings's DNA
In the center of the area of the Fridman Gallery in New York many faces are to see - white, black and brown, which resemble themselves nearly imperceptibly - at cables of the cover hang.
The 30 of portrait was created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from cheek Tupfern and crops, which were sent it by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent the cutouts from the prison away to Leavenworth, where the former secret service analyst served a 35-year old detention, after she made WikiLeaks public as secretly classified diplomatic messages over the website.
The new exhibition, which was opened on 2 August, is called A Becoming Resemblance (a suitable similarity).
It is the product of two years correspondence between Dewey Hagborg, whose discipline united its professional expertise in technology, computer sciences and art, and Manning, a Transfrau and trailblazing Dissidentin, whose condemnation was converted from Barack Obama, when it had only three days in its office.
Dewey Hagborg created by the algorithmic analysis of the DNA, which was extracted by Manning and from the 30 portraits was created, like someone with these genomic data to look could, a sharp, although somewhat intellectual comment not only to the mouldability of DNA data - the many ways, like it to be interpreted to be able and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also to the identity.
Manning, which was born as Bradley Edward, already spoke but since their puberty openly about the identification as a woman, 2013 because of 20 accusations was condemned, among them six offences against the espionage law, computer fraud and theft.
By the prison their picture was suppressed, so much the fact that there was only one photo - a granular, black-and-white Selfie, in which Manning sits obviously uneasily on a driver's seat and carries a platinum-blond wig - with that it was associated.
In the year 2015 Dewey Hagborg straight of the large success of its 2012-Projekts 'Stranger came vision'.
Therein the artist portrait of strangers from forensic artifacts produced such as cigarette stubs and chewing gum, by extracting the DNA from the waste, in order to manufacture a picture of it how these people could look.
That was the time, on which she received an email from a newspaper magazine.
“You led an interview with Chelsea Manning, while them were in the prison, and they wanted a kind portrait, around this article of accompanying”, explained Dewey-Hagborg with a press preview of the new exhibition.
And it could do it at this time visited and could not be photographed, therefore you took up contact with Chelsea and asked them whether them wanted to make a DNA portrait.
The artist and its arrested MUSE became unequal pen pals, who exchanged several letters in the course of two years.
They even created one of Shoili Kanungo illustrated comic “Suppressed image”, which foresaw a future, in which president Chelseas judgement would convert and her would be capable to see the exhibition personally.
That Obama would demand actually only few days, after the book was published Mannings release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas, was a welcome kind of happy meeting.
There are new, tweetfähige ways to find still with the opening of the exhibition something deep and strong, since Donald Trump leads a war against informants from the government and against transgenic the troops, in order, in order to inflame the rigid splitting, which he actually repair should, further.
When Dewey Hagborg was asked for strange timing of all these things, she said that “things for a certain reason happen”.
In an artistic statement written down on the wall of the gallery Manning with its extra large signature demanded under it (the “i” in its surname is provided with a heart) an end of “automatic splintering, their basis sex, race, sexuality and culture was.”
On the opposite wall its mitochondriale DNA sequence is written - a millipede of Cs and gs and As, in pencil.
Dewey Hagborg hoped to show by the inclusion of the 200 letters (or nucleotides after the highly developed scientific lexicon of the artist) as amazingly similarly, at least in biological regard, we all is.
“Which humans of it will hopefully carry forward, are that our genome does not worry about who we are and like openly genetic data for an interpretation and they are as subjective”, said Dewey-Hagborg, their video work of 2007, Spurious MEMORies, to be likewise seen are.
“DNA data can tell so many different stories, therefore that is 30 of these stories.”
The last piece in the exhibition, which is kept in its own area, is a side from the comic novella mentioned above.
It shows Manning, how she emerges with a free speech telephone in the hand from the disciplinary barracks of the United States such as King Kong.
“If they your speech chill, then they won”, it are said.
“Thus stop never the mouth”.
“It came directly from a letter, which it wrote, said me” the artist, who greets from Philadelphia.
“I get still goose bumps, if I talk about it.”
Manning not yet personally saw the exhibition - as it with regard to the future in the comic book was anticipated - however if she should do it, then it in the center of the area by the masks will be welcomed, by her own genomic Simulakren, which together-flock themselves like hordes of protesting.
That was also purposeful, like everything in the exhibition, up to size (5 “2, Mannings stature), with which its genetic Haplogruppen with pencil was written.
“In the past I had it at the wall, but I wanted that they feel, said like a crowd” Dewey-Hagborg of the portraits.
“I wanted that it feels like a mass movement, which was formed with Chelsea like the movement, also behind its liberation put.”
Professor of the University of Northwestern and an employee of the University of Oxford because of killing searched
A country-wide manhunt is under way for a professor to the Northwestern University and an employee of the university Oxford, which are looked for as suspects, after a man in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with fatal injuries had been stabbed.

Alan K. Cubbage, the vice-president for university relations, said in an email explanation that Lathem had been excluded now in given time off its and from entering the campus of the Northwestern University.
“This is now a criminal affair, which is examined by the responsible authorities, and which Northwestern University said cooperated when this investigation”, to Cubbage.
Warren is senior Treasury Assistant at the University of Oxford.
A spokesman of the university and the Somerville college said to the user averaging authorities in an email explanation that “we are ready with the police in Great Britain in contact and, in each conceivable way to help.”
The statement added that Warrens colleagues were shocked and want that it placed itself.
Chief Communications Officer of the Police Department of Chicago, Anthony Guglielmi, said, it requests the suspects seriously to place itself to the authorities.
“The police has a conception of its place of residence, and our efforts to locate it strengthen”, said Guglielmi.
Guglielmi said that local, regional and national authorities help to find the suspects.
Guglielmi said, which received police a call from the building manager of the Grand Plaza building, that had received a straight puzzling hint, that meant that in apartment 1008 something had happened.
The police described the scene as very cruel.

It was confirmed by safety cameras that Lathem and Warren were in the building.
“We believe that professor Latham and the victim had a relationship”, said Guglielmi.
The management team of Grand Plaza published an explanation to the inhabitants: “The police works at present on the timeline and the background of the victim and investigates a variety of motives, including a possible domestic incident.”
“We will in the near future conclude the WADA timetable” - the Russian vice-Prime Minister Mutko
The Russian vice-Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said, it will not for a long time last, until the remaining criteria of the world Anti-doping agency (WADA) for the recovery of the Russian Anti-doping agency (RUSADA) are converted.
“In a certain stage of the fulfillment of the criteria of the timetable RUSADA received the right to plan and test in co-operation with UKAD (UK anti-doping).
The WADA timetable was updated in this regard”, explained Mutko on Thursday.
The PM commentated the second part of the timetable of the WADA for adherence to the code, which describes the criteria for the re-instatement of RUSADA and recently on the website of the organization one published.
According to Mutko it does not contain anything that could give cause for concern for Russia.
“Everything was announced, everything is converted.
And the results become the international olympic committee (IOC) and the WADA to be in the near future submitted”, he added.
One of the criteria specified in the list states however that the Russian anti-doping authorities must accept the announced results of the WADA approved investigation by the Canadian attorney Richard McLaren to alleged by the state promoted doping in the Russian sport publicly.
Regarding the affair Mutko said: “We would drive through the investigation, since our anti-doping system admitted an error has.
All measures were converted.
But there were no national programs, and we will not admit something, what does not exist.”
Mutkos of words agreed with those from Vitaly Smirnov, the director/conductor of the independent Russian anti-doping commission.
In the discussion with the Russian sales office RSport at the beginning of the day admitted Smirnov of problems of the past in Russian anti-doping organizations, added then however: “We said repetitive that the report contains disputed positions and regulations.
Nobody intends unconditionally to accept this report”, added Smirnov.
RUSADA was excluded in November 2015 in the course of the doping scandal from the WADA from execution from doping controls in Russia.
Their was however permitted to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK anti-doping (UKAD).
After a visit of the headquarters of the organization in Moscow in July WADA general manager Olivier Niggli that RUSADA moves “into the right direction”, explained to be replaced in order.

To become starting UPS, which will help your enterprise, not the next over
Amy Errett wanted with its employee the luck with your e-Commerce-start-UP to measure, but the surveys did not function.
Answers were often vaguely, a little helpful or - still more badly - fraudulent.
And even if anonymity promised you, some workers did not trust the process.
“There was simply never consistency and objectivity”, said Errett, who operates the 75-Person San Francisco e-Commerce Hair Care society Madison Reed.
She called people from the outside for assistance.
A new race that Resources starting UPS is human at growing, in order to help enterprises to find out how its employees feel.
By the production and licensing of software, which has the specific purpose of the measurement the employee commitment, it makes it for enterprises possible to accomplish surveys special groups and demographic groups to respond, employees anonymity and complaint hotlines to offer, and in some cases Whistleblowern permit to go around the C-suite of executive personnel and contact directly the board of directors.
“You have now tools such as Strava and fit bits for the pursuit of their health, but where is the fit bit for your enterprise?” Jim said bar-nicely, joint founders and Chief Executive of Redwood town center start UP Glint, whose software Analytics tools by enterprises is used, in order to measure employee commitment.
Errett said the fact that her a better insight of what your employees think and feels in the three years with Glint won.
Additionally for Snap surveys and surveys of intended teams, offers it heat map company, which shows at a glance, which units have most complaints and which executive personnel low agreement results to exhibit - so that you can counerbore, why.
Enterprises are added to see the fact that at the point of the job culture must remain, so that you do not become the next over, which into scandals was entangled, since then a former employee a blog post office published, which an environment of annoyances describes, with whom those, which spoke, were punished.
For starting UPS such as Glint this desire for an overview is a lucrative business possibility.
Global the Governance, adjustment and Compliance industry could 2020 more than $ 118.7 billion value possess, after the financial website Let's talc Payments.
Denver, Colorado, start UP Convercent, which helps enterprises to prevent and recognize bad behavior, saw a rising interest and activity at the beginning of this year in the midst of the assault in discredit.
Convercent has nearly 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Over recently as a client registered itself.
Like Glint, Convercent enterprise lets custom-made “pulse” surveys send, to collect confidential answers in real time and to view the heat distribution maps of your problem areas.
It offers also an anonymous SMS hotline, with which employees can announce bad behavior.
And if the managing director is included, complaints go directly to the supervisory board.
“The court of the public opinion seized the modulators”, said Patrick Quinlan, the founder and managing director of Convercent.
If an enterprise is found, which treats its employees badly or unethical behaves, it knows costly consequences by consumer boycott, employee fluctuation and to experience, Quinlan said complaints.
Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more as 25,000 employees and over 500 locations, used Convercent for more than one year, in order to guarantee that employees are aware of the policy and procedure and a simple possibility, have, of reaching their enterprise center.
In former times, if an employee wanted to announce a problem, he or she had to find a telephone number or an email for the enterprise center, submit and hope a formal complaint that he was seriously taken.
It was not often an intimidation and an uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesdays's general Counsel, who said, it gave a good possibility of pursuing the complaints from employees to.
Now, since the enterprise Convercent begins, can problems, which were hidden before by executive personnel, who sat in offices in cities or states, - like discrimination, annoyance or unfair practice to be faster identified and addressed.
“I can more near to this holistic, 360-Grad-Sicht into the experience with occupation approach”, said Vitrano, who leads the risk management Group of Ruby Tuesday.
“And we protect our shareholders against occupation law cases.”
Enterprises began, ethics, to take values and employee commitment in 2002 more seriously after the bookkeeping company Arthur Andersen broke down because of ethical offences by the Enron scandal, said Quinlan.
But it lasted, until the “social media came to their right” that enterprises recognized that you could not prevent that their dirty laundry went online.
“Before the use from technology to the monitoring of the ethics, he said used humans hope as a strategy”.
Both Glint and Convercent offer your software and service, and load the enterprises with recurring fees for the use of their products.
It is a business model and an opportunity, which meet the agreement of venture Capital investor, who supported both starting UPS.
Convercent received 10 million to $ with the financing in February von Firmen such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, with which the entire capital on $ 47 million was raised.
Glitter secured themselves $ 10 million in November von Bessemer venture of partner and brought its entire financing on $ 60 million.
These investments come hardly surprisingly, in view of the interlaced nature of enterprises, culture and venture Capital.
There is an increasing complex at research, which it shows that the today's employees of its jobs expect more than so far.
In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley high salaries and interesting projects are only employments.
The employees want to have the feeling the fact that her accepted and becomes estimated and that it its time an enterprise with a positive mission to give.
“If humans are glad to be in an enterprise feel, their voting belong, and that the work, which you do is worthwhile itself, then they feel more strongly obligated to make this enterprise successful”, said Nina McQueen, Vice President of global Benefits and Employee Experience with LinkedIn, which uses both Convercent and Glint.
Investors reach net yields, if their portfolio enterprises run well. Enterprises run well, if employees exert themselves and are committed.
If the Analytics tools third promise to increase commitment and the employment of the employees it is not a miracle that you find support.
The data over the employee commitment after the experts of the job culture importantly.
But the data are useless, if the managers of an enterprise do not seize measures.
Indeed, if an enterprise asks employees for your feedback, it can have an expectation that change on the way is.
And if the change does not come fast enough, or not at all, this and discourage employee can breed disappointments.
“If you after 4.000 suggestions ask, must you be ready to have 4,000 discussions”, said Russell Raath, President OF consulting at the Businesses management company Kotter international, the enterprises saw, which relied too much on collecting data.
“If you will not follow employees to ask, “have their me really heard?
Do you worry about it?
And whom you do not worry about it, why I should? “
Madison Reed, who accomplishes now monthly employee surveys, was able to introduce measures on the same day if a problem is reported on Glint, so Errett.
And after collecting feedback of frustrated employees it was capable by the speed of decision making and the quality of communication, of organizing several teams again within the enterprise and of adding a communication training, in order to concern the problems.
With Ruby Tuesday the enterprise receives always new insights over the employees, and it hopes that in the long run, this leads to a better connection of employees in an industry, admits is for high sales.
“If you are not obligated to create a culture of transparency you humans will lose”, said Vitrano.
“And if you lose humans, lose also customers.
And if you lose customers, then you will lose enterprises.
The NCAA eliminates the two-conference practices and makes a long day for the Bruins
It goes toward 23 o'clock, when a quantity of UCLA Footballspieler on a side of the new exercise fields of the team on the campus converses.
Some their tricot tops took off and to show the back full sweat from the first day of the training camp.
For a good part of the team these dormant minutes represent a lunch time.
Players, who are written to the summer courses, will return to the three-hour exercise to their final examinations, before they return on the next morning around 6:30 clock to Wasserman football center.
“That is for the boys the next three days a genuine treadmill”, said Bruins coach Jim Mora briefly before Monday to Tuesday became.
The NCAA eliminates two-conference exercises, in order to facilitate the load of the players, and she actually extended her days - at least up to the final on Friday.
Therefore the first three trainings of the UCLA should around 19:15 clock begin, in order to become that already crammed schedules of the players fairly.
The compromise away of the two days is more than one day, on which the Bruins shifted the beginning of the Camps nearly one week after the last season and accomplished during the summer school for the first time during Moras six play times in Westwood practical exercises.
They are to hold 18 exercises in the course of August. 20 before beginning of the formal play preparations for their prelude against Texas A & M in September.
Mora said that he support the change of rule of the NCAA, even if it the very busy routes of the players a further point adds.
“We put this enormous load three or four days on them, and it is very provocative”, said Mora.
“And they pushed it through simply, placken themselves them, them are great people.
I think, as soon as we come up to Saturday and we have more time, become it really greatly.”
UCLA will their practices to terminate, as soon as Camp terminated is, which in view of the clear lines of sight of its fields of the elevated of the class by an adjacent parking lot and the adjacent Luskin center, a hotel, which was already not thrown with footballs, which vacated a protective net behind a goalpost, an easy task will be.
Bruins players are to occupy the hotel starting from this weekend, but it granted Mora that there could be a problem, as soon as these rooms are free during the season.
“We will use, said our security” Mora.
“That is a genuine problem, and it is to be thought not far fetched that the people rent themselves there a room and adjust themselves there then to it, to note an exercise.
If you have the videotape of an exercise, it is a rather good business.
But we have security forces there, and we have security forces on parking lot 8.
We will do the best, with which, what we have.
I do not worry myself therefore too great concerns.
We have a plan.”
Facebook wants to intensify fact examination in the fight against falsified news
Facebook wants to then show more potential articles with false reports to fact revisors of third fancy and their results under the original contribution, said the world-wide largest online Social network on Thursday. It is one of its efforts to fight so-called fake news.
The enterprise said in a statement on its website that it will begin with the use of updated machine learning methods, in order to recognize possible false reports and to send it by fact revisors, who will possibly show results to the fact examination from the original article.
Facebook was criticized as one of the points of main distribution board for so-called fake news, of which many believed that they affected also the US president shank elections 2016.
The problem became also in Europe a large political issue, whereby the French voters were flooded before the presidential elections in May with wrong stories, and Germany supports a plan, after which social medium networks are to be punished, if they do not succeed, hater-filled Postings as before the elections in September fast to eliminate there.
On Thursday Facebook in a separate explanation said on German that in the USA, France, which the Netherlands and Germany a test of the new fact examination is started.
“Apart from the realization, which stories are contested by fact revisors of third parties, humans more context want, in order to make well-founded decisions over it, which they read and divide, said” Sara Su, Produktmanagerin for Facebook news in a blog.
It added that Facebook will test further its feature to “the article” in connection and on other changes on its news feed works, in order to reduce wrong news.
Provide a comic novel: A lock in the history of England
In its recent past the small Scotney Castle in a Squeeze video clip was to be seen and was for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970-er and 1980-er years a loophole.
But Scotney experienced 700 years of turbulent history of its cosy seat in the Bewl River valley in Kent and became now the inspiration for a graphic novel of Jamie Rhodes, a mop-hairy Yorkshireman with a preference for historical documents.
“I find it so beautiful to look on the handwriting from someone to which is dead for 300 years”, says it melancholically.
“Which for a personal relationship to hold this letter in my hand.”
'A Castle in England' re-clamps the time of the Middle Ages up to the age of Edward and documents the families, which lived in Scotney. Each history was illustrated by another, arising British artist - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
It is not the first book of Rhodes, which is based on archives: It wrote 2014 'DEAD Men's Teeth and to Other Stories', a collection, which was inspired by documents in that British LIBRARY - a project, which unexpectedly emotional he found.
“I reacted in such a way only to the thumb print on the side of a letter, which was written by a double agent into the 1700-er years, which worked, says for the Jacobins” it.
“That is its thumb print!
And letters always smell after smoke, because one ignited a fire at that time because of the light.
For someone, which lives 300 years later, the smell has an effect, as if would also participate it.
Oh, I love archives!”
For someone, which is struck with old papers like that it is supported by national the Trust and the kinds the Council England and nearly four months in a lock lived to be over honest (“: I have mean welcome greeting a little overestimated”) seem all of this too beautifully, in order to be true.
Rhodos spent its days with exploring the Victorian “new” lock to examine archives and to study the many treasures and curiosities of the lock, as for instance the installed hyena heads at the walls and the bottles, which had spent centuries in the ditch.
It hiked by the area and the ruins of the old castle and spoke with landscape male nurses, gardners and sometimes also with the artists, who worked on the illustrations of its book.
Then, at night he drank “Whiskey and caught to write on”.
The intimate history of Scotney is relatively unknown, since that received national Trust only 2006 the full entrance, when the last heiress, died Elizabeth Hussey.
When Rhodes arrived one decade later, the employees began just to worry about archives which he as “hundreds of years, in which aristocrats said, throw “Oh it on the attic” described.
Diaries, letters from the time of the English Empires, cards, which represent, who which it possessed: “One could mean that land conflicts would be boring”, say Rhodes, “were however there a birch, for which two families fought.
Young ones, let everything its course go!”
Some stories in the collection use the castle as starting point, in order to dive in on broader basis into English history to follow under it 'The Labourer', which follows a man, who leaves the again built castle, in order the farmer rebellion from 1381.
“There is a recording of a riot, which arose to 1380 in the lock, in this book with the title 'Knightly Families OF Kent and Sussex'”, says Rhodes.
“The farmer rebellion began in this area and I thought, a rebellion was a good beginning.
Perhaps are the two connected?”
Other stories are firmly in the history of the lock rooted - how 'The praised', the history of the Jesuitenpaters told, which the family Darrell hid seven years long during the English reformation.
Or 'The Smuggler', in that the smuggler Arthur Darrell from that 18. Century is represented, its own funeral produced, by filling a coffin with stones (a discovery, which only years was made later, was excavated as its coffin).
The Darrells is Rhodes'Lieblingsfamilie of Scotney: “The gentlemen seemed to be considerable slickers, debts make again and again and money for things spend, which could not afford her.
Other generations of Darrell men solved their debt crises, by marrying rich old women - I present them to me as a heap of handsome boys, with a talent to promote around heiresses.”
After the end of its employment in the lock Rhodes is in the search for other singular writer driving
It brought a two-week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel over Elämänmäki behind itself, the area of a sanatorium from early 20. Century, which was again back-demanded since then by nature.
But Scotney has a special place for it.
“I was sad to go again” say it.
It was how: “Oh, now I must become finished again with the condemned life.”
Campaign started: Over 300 years old Marienkapelle in Rhöndorf veils
With veiling the 301 years the city bath Honnef started old Marienkapelle in Rhöndorf on Friday their campaign for the introduction of a new umbrella brand (review of Thursday).
Still until Thursday mayors Otto Neuhoff and its marketing team want to keep the logo and the slogan secret around Nelson Artz.
At the end of August is it as high point of the campaign a celebration on the island Grafenwerth to give.
“Too beautifully for us.
Or? ”, the doers of the action ask since yesterday on the posters at the Rhöndorfer chapel.
“We not really think (naturally!)”, write them on their web page de-energized yesterday.
“However we use this measure, in order to win your attention.
And in order to make clear that some is better, than it seems.
In the reason are we the firm conviction that we very probably know as bath Honnefer citizen around the beauty and attractiveness of our city.”
With the action go it around more than “only” a logo and a slogan, continue to be called it.
“It is valid to formulate a unmarried promise one, which gives an unmistakable unique selling proposition to the city”.
Finally stand it in the competition with other municipalities.
On a middle amount of five figures the city bath Honnef its new umbrella brand and the campaign spends.
Military reforms in Turkey - Erdogans fear of the army
Each year at the beginning of August advises in Ankara of highest Militärrat (YAS) over retirements and transports in the officer corps.
So also this week.
At first sight a normal procedure.
But nothing is routine at the Turkish armed forces one year after the putsch attempt.
The meeting took place no more in the building of the general staff, like in former times, but in the seat of the Prime Minister.
In the consultation now also the five vice-Prime Ministers as well as the Ministers for defense, inside, law and foreign participated under the presidency of the head of government.
Thus the civilians were in the YAS in the majority.
The government tightens the reins in the military.
General chief of staff Hulusi Akar remains in the office, but the commanders of the army, air forces and the navy were set off.
Since the failed coup head of state Erdogan 169 of the 326 generals and admirals fired.
Over 10.000 soldiers from the numbers of the army were removed - usually because of alleged connections to the movement of the exile preacher Fethullah Guls, which Erdogan sees as wire-puller of the putsch attempt.
Against 486 people, who are to have been directly involved in the putsch attempt, in for this week in Ankara one negotiates.
Already on day after the putsch Erdogan had the revolution attempt as “God gift” designated, since he him the opportunity give, the armed forces “completely to clean”.
But Erdogan has the army really in the grasp?
At the end of February published the newspaper “Hürriyet” an article with the heading “uneasiness in military headquarters”.
In the general staff give it concerns because of an increasing “islamisation” to the army, which manifests itself among other things in the abolition of the ban of the Islamic veil for soldiers, wrote the newspaper.
Large cleaning with the army and the safety forces continues anyhow.
In the middle of July let further 7395 public servants fire to Erdogan by decree, among them 2303 police and 546 soldiers.
It seemed, as if Erdogan the military had tamed.
The generals were considered in former times than the actual masters of the country.
Three times they revolted with reference to their role as guards of the worldly state order.
After its election victory 2002 Erdogan pushed back power that of military step by step, not least with reference to the reform defaults of the European union.
Former officers say, to Erdogan advance aimed an islamisation of the armed forces.
In the magazine “Vocal Europe” warned an officer mentioned by name, who looked for asylum for the putsch attempt from fear of pursuit abroad, the Turkish army in a few years of “full extremists and Salafisten” will be.
Applies, such a development could not leave NATO cold.
Anyway it gives in the alliance after the cleanings doubts about the readiness of application to the Turkish army.
The management structures and operational abilities are “weakened”, say NATO diplomats.
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
It a new US-immigration-plan to give, in order to change the rules of the Green Card, said president Donald Trump, quoted of the media.
It plans to lower the legal immigrants on 50.000 per year stricter regulations for the acquisition of visas for a limited work permit and restrictions for family-oriented visas.
The new rules are suggested of the republican and supported by the president.
The bill is to be discussed in the two chambers of the congress.
“This law will reduce the poverty, which wages increase and save billions dollar for the taxpayers and this will do, as the USA will change the way, like the citizens from other countries Green Cards is spent.”
The law will prevent the chain migration and will replace the present system.
This new application procedure will benefit the candidates, the English will speak, which have the financial means, around itself to support and knowledge show, which will benefit our economy”, said Trump, quoted of the American media.
Ministry wants to reorganize distance for running climbing shuttles
In the past months about the future of the running climbing shuttle one had argued again and again - now it was to go completely fast.
Still before end of the year is to be built at the ailing distance, on which the tourist course drives.
In order to secure the future of the running climbing shuttle on a long-term basis, construction work at the distance is to begin according to the Ministry of Transport still in this year.
“With the decision to order and reorganize the distance Ilmenau Rennsteig further, the country admits itself too of these particularly for the tourism important connection”, explained traffic Secretary of State Klaus Sühl on Friday in Erfurt.
It numbered the costs of the repair of the distance on approximately 2.5 million euros.
From this sum take over the country 75 percent.
The contract, on whose basis the shuttle is to be ordered also in the future by the country, is at present finally co-ordinated, explained Sühl.
The Ministry and the south Thuringia course as operators are itself over the technical details already united.
“With it are negotiated the timetable, the assigned vehicles and the quality standards”, said Sühl.
The planned contract between the Ministry and the course company is closed for one duration of eleven years.
Thus that is regularly to be ordered running climbing shuttles on December 2017.
The running climbing shuttle is a railway connection between the stations Ilmenau, particularly popular with tourists, and run-rises.
In the past months in the course of a pilot enterprise it had been tested whether the distance is used by sufficiently many humans, in order to again regularly order them in the future.
The distance is besides in parts strongly ramshackle.
The ascent of sex robots is material, and we should us worrying
Straight ones as you thought that it cannot become still crazier 2017, come a new report of the technological developments within the range of the sex robots.
Yes, actually.
Sex robots are momentarily a big deal.
Recently the Foundation published for Responsible Robotics (foundation for responsible robotics) (FRR) a report over the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years.
According to Noel Sharkey, emeritus professor for robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and joint founder of the FRR, we must begin to take their ascent seriously.
Customers can select the color of eyes of the robot, its form of the nipple and the type of fingernail.
“The people make themselves over it hilariously, but the enterprises deliver a lot of it, and we will see, told them still many more frequently get” Mr. Sharkey with the publication of its new report.
Modern sex dolls developed from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin, which feels warmly - with consciously human reactions, which are reached by artificial intelligence.
The user can its robot also according to his convictions “adapt” and everything select, of the color of eyes of the robot over the form of the nipples up to the type or the color of its fingernails.
But it becomes still more disturbing, since many robots possess the “personalities”, that would let a step Ford woman progressive look.
Modern sex dolls developed to robots with a silicone skin.
The RealBotix robot makes it for example for its users possible to adapt their robots to the characteristics it finds as for example shyness responding.
And then there is there still the Roxxxy gold sex robot with preprogramed personalities, developed by True Companion, like “Frigid Farrah”, those the impression of shyness mediated and “game Wendy” with a “adventurous” personality.
“Roxxxy gold has a personality, that is adapted, swarms to your personality as well as possible” the website of True Companion.
So she likes, what does not like you to like, and it, what it not to like, etc.
It has its tendencies in the course of the day also - whole like real people!
It can be tired, on conversation be fixed or it can “in tendency” be!”
There are many disturbing aspects with this ascent of sex robots - not least, because they replace genuine human relations - however the submissive female characteristics, the allusions on rape, if one a step on Frigid (is called here: disputing) Farrah happens, worries one at most.
On its website True Companion Roxxxy compared with a vibrator, but for men.
“If women (sic) a vibrator to have can, why men can have then no Roxxxy?” it means on the website.
However these sex robots are not only a fetish or a stop just only another sex toy.
Their emergence and their increasing refinement refer something darker and deeper in our culture, to a retreat of the ideal of the gender equality to a desire for sex with submission than optional addition.
Most men will hold naturally no sex robots, and during which FRR its rising popularity marks, they remain nevertheless provisional at the edge of the consumer culture.
But which from the edge zones oozes, can regarding the spirit of the time, in which we live, very instructively its.
And many people are not strange or insulting, until the free market gives them for this permission.
There is nevertheless a certain overlap that these sophisticated sex robots emerge in a time, in which the rights are threatened by women world-wide, in which it in the white house a president give, who boasted women sexual to have attacked.
The most deterring aspect of the TV serial 'The Handmaid's Tale' ('the report of the farm servant') are not the graphic pictures, which works devoured body and the outdone eyes, but like realistically this vision.
The republic of Gilead is a leap, but at this moment this does not feel like a large leap.
The goal behind these sex robots consists of manufacturing a physical similarity to actual women as realistically as technically possible (although with porn star proportions).
Their designers want that they feel humanly that they copy the movement of a material body.
But, brought on the point, if it concerns its “personalities”, the robots do not represent real women.
They cannot separate from their companion or leave simply.
They do not have switching or a background history, nothing that points to independence or something, what the fantasy of total submission disturb could.
Differently expressed: They are pleasing slaves.
Or in order to express it in the manner of speaking of 2017: Housemaid
Trumps large achievement?
It makes Mitt Romney the epitome of the common sense
It became a truism of the Trump era that the political splitting, which polarized the US-constituency split also families in the tabloid.
Approximately around Christmas and Thanksgiving there were newspapers with pieces of advice in the USA over it how one should deal with the horror of Trump selecting relatives.
We exert to burst all allegedly, around our filter blisters leave.
Noticed power Trumps is less to bring families together.
I mention this, because my cousin, a left-wing oriented poetess, visited which lives in Chicago and itself for a long time busily with the republicans in our family, me this week in New York.
It reminded me of the fact that the unit can have a powerful effect against a common enemy.
With Trump in the white house is everyone, which she knows, including which republican relationship, with which she had fought for many decades because of the policy, suddenly and completely strangely on the same side.
Around the dining table that is surely a good thing, but it is noticeable to me in a further connection that this with itself brings also substantial risks.
The left one was strengthened by Trump, but the disfiguring effect of its presidency has the strength for pushing for us all to the right.
If we speak of “normalization” and Trump, we refer to the gruesome possibility that its hokums of one day will repel us no longer.
There is however a still more frightening long-term scenario, in which Trump “normalizes” republicans of the right wing, who appear sudden compared with its standards at once as epitome of reasonability.
I am nowadays by an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's hilarious version of the crazy person stricken - the dog on the autoroof, which 14% income tax (however at least we knew, how its tax declaration looked) - the two compared with Trump indeed to one as very mild criminal offences occur.
If Trump goes, the next candidate of the republicans must be only mentally healthy, around itself as immeasurable improvement too qualify.
As if my cousin in the city was, brought we our children to the roundabout in the Central Park, the largest roundabouts of the New Yorker park department, and the best three dollar, which one can spend in the city, if one does not need caffeine.
The horses are enormously large, the fibre glass designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are knurrig and the animals rotate, in order to look full fear over their own shoulders - extremely darkly and those jingling music obtain this in strange way.
So many plates of a city disappoint: The opinions of high buildings old, the Skylines are too trusted, in order to offer much excitement, and the reality of the city does not become fair the dream.
Thirty-five years later, and I am not yet completely over the day, when I found out that Swiss Cottage counts indeed no Swiss Cottage actual the topic pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage non separates a large roundabout in the north of London.
The cent ral the park roundabout is however still a strangely magic experience, there here two two-year ones, one 11-year old and two women in the 40's after to go can and all a great time have.
If I had been able to evaluate, had I him the full score given the roundabout, but fortunately has nobody for it asked.
On the other hand I was forced this week in a department store to evaluate my “experience” with transactions on a scale from one to five stars before I mean credit card pull through could.
In the coffee house at the corner of my road it is the same to adjust plus the option, the evaluation with one 15% tip - this, in order to buy something over the counter.
This does not only lead to a slowing down its that actually a neutral exchange should be, separates exerts also pressure on the server, in order to bring personality into a situation, in which none is necessary.
The poor woman in the department store stood excusing grinning, while I made tiredly the experience, for it my credit card with five stars to be enough.
Oscar Pistorius with chest pain from the prison in the hospital moves
Pistorius left for the second time the prison for a hospital visit.
Last year it was brought because of the treatment by cuts at its wrists in the hospital, which he suffered the prison authorities according to after a case in his cell.
Pistorius was condemned because of murder after an appeal of the state lawyers against a first homicide judgement.
It killed Steenkamp in the early morning hours of the Valentine's Day 2013, by shooting her several times by a door of the toilet cab in its house in Pretoria at her.
Pistorius stated that he regarded his friend as a night intruder, who hid itself in the cab.
The state lawyers announced their intention of inserting this time against the six-year detention of Pistorius appeal of which they say, it are too indulgent.
The national law enforcement agency said that it will raise objection with highest Gerichtshof from South Africa, and the objection can be heard in this year.
Pistorius runs the risk that its punishment is increased to 15 years, if the state lawyers are successful.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
As a farmer Arnold a strange egg finds
As the last Blumberger schools became the Viertklässler from Fützen and Epfenhofen into holidays and into the resuming schools to dismiss.
Three the dismissal pupil go in the future on the High School, four on the six-form high school.
Head mistress Angelika Sitte welcomed parents and representatives of the public in the community centre Biesental in Epfenhofen on Tuesday evening.
When the 29 pupils of the four classes under the direction of Sophia Schumacher selected symbol for the school dismissal and Regine Meder an eaglet, which grows up in the chicken yard, will dismiss however nevertheless then into the freedom.
In addition the lively crowd specified a musical with the title “the eagle in the chicken yard”.
Farmer Arnold found a strange egg, and let it from its chickens hatch.
Instead of a chicken chicken a small eagle came out.
But the hope to make from it a chicken smashed itself, to which eagle spread its wings on a high mountain and disappeared.
Afterwards the classes three and four showed a chicken dance in rehearsing of Yvonne Frank.
The hens danced with the young Gockeln, which carried cylinders, around the bet.
The eagle stands for the integration, said head mistress Angelika Sitte.
The young animal is different than the other young animals (chickens), belongs to however.
It will however never be like a chicken.
Its regulation is it to be free.
It wished each Viertklässler that he feels in his new school accepted.
Thank word followed to the colleagues, the former head master Michael Müller, who substitutes again and again with instruction bottlenecks, and which parents representatives.
The chicken time is, explained chief instructor Sophia Schumacher now past.
It dismisses its pupils after two years instruction only very reluctantly, because it was a really great time.
Finally it could itself leave on the Viertklässler.
To the conclusion all pupils let a song of daylight saving time and vacation time ring out.
Large joy broke out with the children.
For the new school year already eight first graders are registered.
Two Bulgarian because of illegal camping in Greece arrested
Two Bulgarian because of illegal camping in Greece were arrested, communicated the Ministry for foreign affairs, quoted from the television.
In the morning 1 of August in Sithonia by the police a group was arrested by illegaly camping humans, among them both Bulgarian.
On the same day they were released, while an investigation runs at present.
The State Department reported bTV that the Bulgarian were released later.
The Greek authorities intensified control of the free Campen and to put to everyone, which is found, to remain at a place which is not meant for this purpose, substantial fines.
Controls are continued during the entire season.
The Ministry said that the court can impose a fine.
Software update for diesel engined vehicles: Which the concerning to now know must
Does the software update take place how exactly?
Do Diesel drivers have to take part in the action?
The most important questions and answers in the overview.
With the Diesel summit BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW group software update for altogether approximately 5.3 million cars offered.
They are to improve the exhaust behavior of cars of the emission classes euro 5 and partial euros 6.
Euro-4-Diesel or more badly are exceptional from it.
Anja Smetanin of ACE car club Europe gives estimates:
Is the new action obligating?
No, the negotiated software updates are voluntary.
“The obligating updates are valid before only for the vehicles, which have Schummelsoftware”, say Anja Smetanin.
Their retrofit arranged the strength trip Federal Office (KBA).
How and starting from when are customers informed about updates?
The manufacturers announced but still no exact date called a brisk conversion in the next months.
Daimler communicated to write each concerning down.
If an inspection is due anyway, within their frameworks one settle.
How long might the re-equipment drag on altogether?
“Heavy to say”, means Smetanin.
That hangs of the commitment of the manufacturers starting from as well as of the political pressure.
“We do not have seen, voluntarily act the automakers with the topic environment so far.”
How long is the update to last?
The re-equipment could last in the workshop only three to four hours.
More time-consuming it can be to get a date.
What do drivers, who do not drive a car from BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW group, make?
ACE guesses/advises to awaiting.
Probably foreign manufacturers would pull, so Smetanin tight.
Now does a substantial price deterioration of Euro-4-Autos threaten?
ACE fears that.
But especially in the regions, where driving bans threaten.
In the rural area give it so far no depreciations for older Diesels.
ACE guesses/advises to still await with a sale.
LL coolly J receives Kennedy Center-Auszeichnung
The Kennedy Awards's gala is one the most glamorous event in the Washington.
The first award of the prize under president Trump promises to become political.
One the winner does not want to come - from protest.
LL coolly J (49) gets as first rappers one of the awards in demand of renowned Kennedy Center.
How the cultural facility announced on Thursday, also singer Gloria Estefan (59), Lionel Richie (68) as well as the choreographer Carmen de Lavallade in this year (86) belongs and the TV-producer Norman Lear (95) to the honours.
The awards at the beginning of are handed over to Decembers.
Traditionally US president Donald Trump will organize a receipt and together with his Mrs. Melania in the award will participate.
The winner Lear become known with progressive TV-series announced therefore already to do without the participation in the gala.
He said to “New York Times”: “This presidency decided to neglect the arts and human rights completely - to withdraw them even the means - and loads me”.
The 59-year old Estonian fan stressed, her the discussion with Trump will use, in order to make their aspect clear.
The Kennedy center designated after the former president John F. Kennedy is the largest cultural facility in the US-capital.
Among the former winners rank Meryl Streep, Aretha Franklin, Robert De Niro, George Lucas, Tom Hanks and Sting.
We make the city worth living
Roland Wacker, Haslachs architect-general, goes in the coming year into pension.
The place is already publicized - suitable applicants are however RSR.
For 31 years is upright architect-general.
And the work makes still large for it joke, how it in the press conference mediate.
It reports of varied, in addition, demanding tasks, which wait for its successor.
At the same time it surprises it that so far no application fulfills the requirement profile.
The city looks for an architect or a civil engineer at the next possible time.
So - considering the regular terms of notice - still enough time for a training is to be.
Since Haslach for the central administrative body functions as lower legal board of construction, the applicant must show appropriate conclusions.
Because this function wants to keep the city in any case.
If it could not fill out these no more, the citizens would have for consultation until open castle to drive.
But public-friendliness is important to the city and it, says upright ones, which reports of a good working climate as well as in a good mood between authority and citizen.
In more than 30 years in the office some important projects collected, on which upright one with pride looks back.
“We make ourselves the city worth living”, are safe it over the board of works and its employees.
In addition, in the future varied projects stand on the agenda: The transformation of the former Hukla area and the Niederhofenparkplatzes about activated.
The Kinzigbrücke between Bollenbach and stone oh is renewed, also the Stadionsanierung is still topic.
However the latter will strike with approximately 1.5 million euros to beech, “if we it correct makes”, estimates upright.
“All in all great tasks wait for my successor.
The work makes here joke.”
Formatively large clearance is present for an architect-general.
With Haslachs can be quite flexibly reacted to own building yard and market garden to much.
“One can move much”, so upright ones, and those organization of the green belts is often praising mentioned by citizens and visitors.
Since the old part of town stands as an ensemble under monument protection, it is important to have “an eye for it which stresses clean-fit”, if new buildings are approved, the separating architect-general.
Anyway the architect-general carries high responsibility.
He is owner, “in the end runs everything here over my table”.
With support and co-ordination he can count on employees of many years: Markus Neumaier (above ground construction) already participates for ten years, Manfred Schöner (foundation engineering) for 15 years.
Also that its successor remains for a long time, it desires upright ones: “We look for someone, which itself with the place really identified and would like to remain”.
Because continuity is not only important for a good working climate, but also for the further organization of the city.
Who would like to be heir to Roland Wacker, Haslach should be able to show a final study as engineering graduate or Bachelor's degrees with field architecture and good specialized knowledge within the ranges building regulation and building design right have after information of the city.
To the municipal planning and building office are subordinate high and foundation engineering, zoning, purchase of land affairs, administration of the urban real estate properties, urban operating yard with building yard and city market garden as well as lower legal board of construction including monument protection.
Bicycle on lines thrown: South railroad line closed
According to police the unknown perpetrators had thrown the blue bicycle of the railway line transfer within the range of the Leobener road (B116) on the lines.
These were so strongly damaged with the fact that the approaching goods train had to be stopped.
The investigators proceed from two male perpetrators and to search since the night hours after them.
Near the scene by a witness a rose-pink scooter and a bicycle driver had been observed.
“A far ÖBB spokesman Christoph Posch goes to the APA beyond scallywag caper”, said.
That or the perpetrators would have brought themselves into large danger and also the train service would have endangered.
Apart from the damage to the locomotive and the plant as well as the delay minutes and the costs of the replacement buses also still Pönalen of the course customers could come to the perpetrators.
Altogether is to be proceeded from a “substantial” sum, said the spokesman.
The damage was again repaired on Friday afternoon, the railway traffic on the south railroad line could without handicaps be led.
Scarcely ten passenger trains had failed Friday morning, two of it concerned long-distance traffic.
Goods trains did not fail, them had however delay.
According to ÖBB spokesman Christoph Posch approximately 200 meters of overhead lines had to be exchanged.
Insulators and masts were damaged likewise.
Red meat, milk products and chocolate could help to alleviate IBD (inflammatory bowel disease)
Red meat and chocolate can sound for your digesting system like a nightmare.
But a new study maintains exactly the opposite: A diet, which is rich at meat-based proteins and milk products, could alleviate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel diseases.
The incurable condition, which concerns approximately 1.3 million in the USA and in Great Britain 300,000, causes gastrospasms and flatulence, recurring or bloody diarrheas, decrease in weight and extreme tiredness.
While it will normally turn out for the concerning to avoid meat and milk products in order their symptoms to alleviate, found researchers out at that Washington university that the essential amino acid Tryptophan from proteins contributes to develop immune cells which promote a tolerant intestine.
The leading researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells in the intestine patrol, in order to guarantee that harmful microbes, which hide themselves in the meal penetrate not into the body.
Cells, which are capable to release inflammations which become the tolerance promote of cells balanced, and which bodies protect, without sensitive fabrics to damage.
If the balance bends too far toward inflammation, from it an inflammatory bowel disease can result.
In experiments it was stated that a kind of tolerance promoting immune cell occurs with mice, which carry a certain bacterium in their entrails.
And the bacterium needs Tryptophan - one of the components of proteins - around the appearance of the cells to release.
Professor Colonna said: “We have a connection between a type of bacteria - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the intestine Mikrobioms, and which development of a population manufactured by cells, which promote the tolerance.
The more Tryptophan the mice in their food had, the more had them from these immune cells”.
He suggested that the combination of L promotes. reuteri and a nutrition more tolerant, less inflammatory intestine environments rich at Tryptophan, even if the same system works with humans.
The post office graduate student Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan examined a kind immune cell, which promotes the tolerance, when it found out that a group of study mice had such cells, but another group of the same trunk, which was however separately accommodated did not have this.
She assumed that the difference with the Darmmikrobiomen of the mice had to do - to the community of bacteria, viruses and mushrooms, which normally live in the gastro-intestinal tract.
The intestines of the mice DNA were sequenced and six types of bacteria were found, which were present in the mice with the immune cells, but were missing without them with the mice.
Mice were drawn up in a sterile environment, so that a Darmmikrobiom was missing to them and it did not develop this kind of immune cells, and they received L. reuteri and the immune cells developed.
In order to understand, how the bacteria affected the immune system, the researchers L let grow. reuteri in a liquid and transferred then small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - on unripe immune cells, which were isolated from the mice.
The immune cells developed to the tolerance-promoting cells.
When the active component from the liquid was cleaned, it proved as a by-product of the Tryptophan metabolism, which admits as Indol-3-Milchsäure is.
If the researchers doubled the quantity of Tryptophan in the fodder of the mice, the number of such cells rose around approximately 50 percent, but if the Tryptophanwerte were halved, the number of cells sank around half.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that humans have the same tolerance-promoting cells as mice, and that most of us protect L. reuteri in our gastro-intestinal tracts.
It is not well-known whether Tryptophan by-products from L develop. reuteri the cells in such a way with humans as with mice, but defects in genes in relationship on Tryptophan were found with humans with inflammatory bowel disease.
She said: “The development of these cells is probably something, which we would like to promote, since these cells inflammations on the internal surface of the intestine steer.
Potentially high Tryptophanwerte in presence of L can lead. reuteri to an expansion of this population.”
Jose Mourinho believes that Manchester United with Nemanja Matic obligated a “genius”
With Manchester United with Nemanja Matic a “genius” signed, believes Jose Mourinho, after the midfield player at Wednesday evening had his debut against Sampdoria.
The 40 million pound of signature of Chelsea victory in Dublin, the last preseason play, before the UEFA super Cup begins against Real Madrid on Tuesday, began and impressed in the owner role with a 2:1, when people before-marched such as Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira as desired.
Matic had been excluded however from the preparation Asia tour of the blues and created only 45 minutes, which admitted Mourinho that he before beginning the Prime Minister had to improve League season.
“It needs time, but its experience, intelligence, a genius in the kind, as it thinks - it thinks football”, said Mourinho.
“We will help it to be in former times than later ready.”
Beside Matic also Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku started in the Aviva stadium, when Mourinho formed its start XI for the beginning of the season.
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho wished still three further new obligations, but he insisted on the fact that the club had already carried a “fantastic work out” to fulfill three of its four priority new obligations.
To get “three from four to, but I thank the club”, added he.
“I will be happier, if they receive four of four for me, but they tried hard large.”
Boeing “paints” Dreamliner into the sky
The US-aircraft manufacturer Boeing painted the silhouette of a Dreamliner into the sky.
The pilots flew off from Seattle in the U.S. state Washington, the design began however in Marquette in U.S. state Michigan and pulled themselves in the form of a Dreamliner via the USA, that are several thousand kilometers.
The action took 18 hours and one minute.
On the radar display screens was to be been the form of a Dreamliner.
The whole was persevered for new engines.
Boeing had made already in former times such advertisement.
Thus the number of “787” and the Boeing logo were painted into the sky.
New deep hit for Martin Schulz - Hanover, we have a problem
As the wind turns nevertheless: When Sigmar Gabriel was still SPD head, social-democratic Prime Ministers before elections always looked with a certain concern to Berlin.
Only no breakdown fires from the party headquarters, only no head wind from the federation - in such a way the most important desire of the election campaigners read.
Since Martin Schulz leads the party, that changed basically.
The employees from the Willy Brandt house with increasing frightening since then observe the events in the SPD governed state capitals.
Which got Schulz from there since the beginning of the year, would not be times in the approach descriptive with head wind.
Were deep hits.
One by one.
The federal CDU sees a general signal after the surprising end of the Red-Greens majority in Lower Saxony against coalitions of SPD and the Green.
“Once more shows: Red-green simply not reliably”, said General Secretary of the CDU can govern Peter Tauber the editorship network Germany (RND).
The surprising parliamentary group withdrawal the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) fell Green Members of Parliament into a heavy crisis.
Its Red-Green coalition thereby lost five months before the election of the federal parliament their joining in majority to the opposition from CDU and FDP.
Green Federal business manager Michael Kellner requested the disloyal Green Member of Parliament of Lower Saxony Elke Twesten to return their mandate.
The crossing to the CDU means a clear falsification of the voter will.
Elke Twesten must return immediately their mandate”, said the Federal business manager and campaign manager of the Greens to the editorship network Germany (RND).
“That may nevertheless be not at all true everything”, sighs an SPD election campaigner, when in the Friday morning the new bad news reaches the party headquarters.
Stephan Weil, SPD-Ministerpräsident of Lower Saxony, stands after the crossing of the green delegates Elke Twesten to the CDU without own government majority there.
It is the provisional high point whole series of large and small crises in SPD state federations.
And nobody knows, what comes next.
The misery began with the unexpectedly clear defeat with the Saarland choice in March.
The comrades calmed a blue eye down, more not, at that time.
After the elections of the federal parliament in Schleswig-Holstein and North Rhine-Westphalia everything will different be.
That became it then also - became clearly worse all.
The defeat in Kiel brought the SPD in tumbling, the Duesseldorf failure struck the party smoothly over.
Laboriously the comrades rattled themselves in the weeks after.
Then, when they had drawn straight new courage, the G-20-Gipfel of Hamburg came.
And with it the next deep hit came.
Mayor Olaf Scholz, the last strong SPD state boss, lost his nimbus on that weekend, because he sat in the Elbphilharmonie, while its city burned.
And because it made everything wrong in crisis communication thereafter so quite, what wrong one can make.
Since then Scholz fights for its political surviving.
Now thus also still Stephan Weil.
Because of the Volkswagen exhaust affair and its role in the supervisory board the Prime Minister of Lower Saxony already stood since longer in the criticism.
Bad poll ratings were added.
Nevertheless, or perhaps straight, tried because in the past weeks ever more strongly to set in the federation accents.
The tendency of the former mayor von Hannover to develop its power in Berlin did not remain also comrade in environment by Martin Schulz hidden.
They let it grant, since they promised themselves from because a stabilization the party.
Now the exact opposite could enter.
Meets because at the internal party discord of the Greens of Lower Saxony in the reason no debt.
And Schulz already not at all.
Meanwhile the comrades strive therefore to keep the own rows closed.
Their anger is directed toward the Greens, and here particularly on the disloyal parliamentarian Twesten.
“Is intolerable and democracy-damaging, like Mrs. Twesten their own interests of career over the interests of all different places”, says Matthias Miersch, Chef of the left wings of the party in the SPD Bundestag faction, the editorship network Germany (RND).
Mrs. Twesten was selected not because of their person as direct candidate, but over the national list of the Greens of Lower Saxony in the parliament, so the delegate of Lower Saxony further.
The logical consequence would be it that it returns her mandate.
Thomas Oppermann, Chef of the SPD Bundestag faction, deplores a “undemocratic maneuver”.
“The voter will before four years was clear: Humans made, say Stephan Weil the Prime Minister” Oppermann, which leads the SPD of Lower Saxony as a leading candidate into the election to the Bundestag, to the RND.
“Now falsify the personal career thinking of a future CDU delegate the election result”, shared Oppermann.
It demanded to clear the background up.
I want to know whether more was there or it gave large promises of the CDU Lower Saxony.
Aid money for local centre III
Who would like to reorganize its into the years house come, support of the country can get shortly.
About it mayors Albert Schindler and three representatives informed BAR town development on Wednesday in received.
At the beginning Schindler gave again a review to the roadshow on so far the event.
Since 1991 give it in received redevelopment areas.
At that time, in the redevelopment area I from 1991 to 2004, the country Baden-Wuerttemberg took over still two thirds of the promotion sum.
In the redevelopment area II from 2005 to 2016 the subsidy nevertheless still was about 60 percent.
For Schindler the past redevelopments are a “success project” - it is finally important to promote also the internal development to open and not only new construction sites.
On 4 April one received the information from the district administration Karlsruhe that it will give a redevelopment area to III.
The promotion sum amounts to 833,333 euros, of it would come 500,000 euro of the country, which received rest from the community.
How now does a redevelopment area develop?
One become, so Schindler further, examine, where the “really old” houses are.
In addition, it plays a role whether in the planned area at all interest consists to reorganize.
If necessary the area borders could shift then also again.
Represented the BAR at Wednesday evening Martin Keller, Gaby Pietzschmann and Sarah Gotzel.
Cellar presented contents of the federal land program “social city”, in whose framework the redevelopments would then be accomplished.
Core of the program are the revitalization of city centers, the improvement of the apartment and employer-employee relationships and receipt and development of the infrastructure.
The measures were accomplished subject-related, i.e. per property.
The redevelopment area was specified then finally than statute.
The grant period for the conveyances still runs since 1 January 2017 until 30 April 2026.
Still until Septembers this year however for a start the stocktaking would be accomplished, in the context of those at the redevelopment area took part a questionnaire to completion to get.
In November or December if possible the statute resolution is to take place, so that in the coming year with the redevelopments can be begun.
Pietzschmann explained afterwards that the mentioned first investigations would drive through each municipality had.
It concerns to evaluate and decide the drawbacks concerning town construction, when one reorganizes and to which extent.
For respective property also a redevelopment note is then entered in the land register.
Pietzschmann will after received even again come and a picture of the situation to make, promised themselves it.
Gotzel stressed, a substantial success factor for the project is the co-operation of the involved ones.
Therefore it will give questionnaires, which are sent in the coming weeks postal to the citizens and until end of summer holidays to be filled out to be able.
The yellow questionnaire is the “building and property sheet”, with which it concerns among other things the structural condition and the redevelopment intentions.
In the grey questionnaire, the “household and housing sheet”, information can be made on size, allocation and inhabitants of a dwelling.
The blue “spreadsheet” is to be filled out only if in the building business premises are operated.
However, referred Gotzel is to be considered on the fact that a filled out questionnaire is not at the same time a request for conveyances.
Besides are not new building measures eligibly.
Schindler stressed still that the distribution of the conveyances functions according to the “wind dog principle” - who comes first grinds first.
One cannot “reserve” aid money for later.
To the conclusion still photos of the project “local centre II” were pointed, in order to make for the present ones a redevelopment “tasty”.
British inventor sits down a Microchip, in order to come with a hand movement into house and car
A British inventor is first in the country, who is equipped with a microchip, so that he open, its office enter and even with a hand movement its car start can his doorstep.
Steven Northam, 33, had implanted the tiny chip between thumbs and index fingers and offers now the service for enterprises and individuals, which want to simplify their life with technology by his company BioTeq.
It united with Dr. Geoff Watson, to an advisory Anaesthesisten in the Royal Hampshire County hospital in Winchester, Hants, in order to guarantee that the implant procedure is accomplished after medical standard.

Publicity expenses of the white house cost the taxpayer thousands
The decision of the white house to fly a navy helicopter to the South Lawn for an event which emphasizes the American manufacturing in the last month, costs taxpayers according to the information of the military, which became to leave magazine to the TIME, up to 24.000 US Dollar.
The green-white Sikorsky VH-3D, admits One, if the president on board is, as navy was the heart of the event on 17 July in the white house with American schedules of work.
President Donald Trump, Vizepräsident Mike Pence and leading officials of the white house made a tour by products of all 50 states.
The helicopter manufactured in Connecticut was issued beside a yacht from Maine, a fire engine from Wisconsin and a fork-lift truck from Mississippi.
The military office of the white house required the presence of the helicopter in a fragmentary order or FRAGO, hardly 36 hours before the helicopter on the South Lawn landed, for the recordings the navy of the Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit, which is responsible for the enterprise of the helicopter.
“I wanted only that you are aware of it, because it is a so unusual event with high visibility”, wrote the commander of the HMX-1 on eve of the event his superior, the deputy naval commander for aviation.
The message showed that the helicopter arrived around 7 o'clock in the morning on 17 July on the South Lawn for the event at 15 o'clock, and so is enough remained, until the lawn was vacated between 18:00 and 21:00 clock in this evening.
The note adds that, if the takeoff from the white house should be delayed, due to which restriction of the office-hours a second crew was needed for the return flight.
The original flight crew was during the event with the helicopter, while the security staff of the unit remained during the time on the ground with the airplane.
From that the TIME provided recordings it did not follow clearly whether in the long run a second flight crew was necessary.
The Hatch act forbids federal employees using national property for political purposes.
Data records show that HMX-1 asked, whether the event could injure the regulation.
“A question, which we asked, was whether it concerned an injury of the Hatch Acts and we became informed about the fact that this was not the case”, wrote the commander.
“Sounds, as if you are locked, answered” the deputy commander.
The event “larva in America” was called by the white house official event and would not have been taken off by the Hatch act.
In addition, official events have political overtones.
On the event the president gave an impact for the reform to the health reform, which was in the senate under way, and he publicised the efforts for the containment of the government regulations.
The use of the airplane, which admits One or Air Force One as navy is, from politically favorable purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.
Presidents are obligated to use it for the travel.
But their use only for a photo OI to request, is unusual.
Trump accomplished an investigation in February, when the president airplane carried against the background for its first campaign rally out in Melbourne, Florida, Taxidienste, and its Twitter account is full from messages, which weighted about the use of the president airplane by its predecessor.
“The white house is enthusiastic by the show “larva in America” - which shows products of all 50 states, which are manufactured by American workers with American materials”, said the deputy press secretary of the white house, Lindsay Walters.
HMX-1-Besatzungen would frequently drive through training flights in the area around Washington and in the South Lawn, in order to set the US president off in the white house with precise centimeter sets.
When Trump was at the beginning of July on the G20-Gipfel in Germany, HMX-1 accomplished 58 exercise landings in the white house.
The flight for the “larva in America” - event counted with the training need of the flight crew for the month, said an official.
Helicopter units flew additionally 11 hours on this day for “non--presidency support missions”.
The white house said that the taxpayers the load for none of the other props, which were introduced on the event took over.
A spokesman of Sikorsky said, the enterprise had not been involved to issue the helicopter on the South Lawn.
HMX-1 does not maintain budget recordings for the president flights, and it is difficult to determine the exact costs of the event.
According to hourly wages of the US Department of Defense for the financial year 2017 the DoD rate of reimbursement for the VH-3D amounts to however 24,380 USD per flying hour.
Recordings of the unit register the flying time of the airplane as 30 minutes of the homeland basis of the navy Corps air Facility in Quantico in Virginia.
The white house argues that the actual costs of the enterprise of the helicopter are far under this rate.
“The costs of the taxpayers on the basis of the estimations for the rates of reimbursement to specify,”, said Walters is most misleading.
“These estimations contain staff, maintenance and many other hidden costs, those are contained in the annual means.”
According to an edge study from the year 2015 the rates of reimbursement for DoD contain not the personnel expenditure, but consider the costs of fuel, maintenance and conclusion of a contract.
At this time the former press spokesman of the white house, defended Sean Spicer, the employment of the helicopter for the event.
“The idea is to present this week things which are manufactured in America”, said Spicer.
“And I know that Sikorsky and the Federal State are very proud Connecticut on the fact that they contribute to our national security, and I assume hundreds, if not even thousands of humans are dependent on it.
And I think, how most Americans are we all proudly on the helicopter and other military equipment, for which so many Americans worked untiringly.
It is naturally appropriate for emphasizing.”
It was not clear whether Trump interacted with the helicopter, when he entered his tour over the South Lawn for the event, but he sat down into the driver's seat of a fire engine.
In the white house Trump at representatives spoke of Sikorsky and joked with the media at its own fleet of firm products.
“I know Sikorsky very well”, said the president, “I have three of it.”
TC BW Neuss before tricky task
Front runner of second tennis Bundesliga start with the table third Suchsdorfer SV.
The TC blue Weis Neuss start tomorrow starting from 11 o'clock in Kiel with the table third Suchsdorfer SV.
Despite balance still immaculate after five portions the front runner of second tennis Bundesliga kept the sense for the reality.
Team head Marius Zay has anyhow respect for the opponent.
“That is a compact team, which always plays in quite similar formation.
Straight ones on the rear positions I find the crew very good.”
For class and stability with the Suchsdorfer SV above all the imported goods from the high north provide.
“Their Dane and Finn can refer even to employments in the Davis Cup.
And they are also strong in the double”, say Zay with view of Harri Heliovaara (Finland), Andre Göransson (Sweden), Soren and Esben Olesen, Martin Pedersen as well as Andreas Bjerrehus (all Denmark).
“That becomes as always heavy for us.
There you need also a good portion luck.”
The Neusser crew for the trip into the high north stands practically.
Its debut for blue Weis could give Maxime Janvier.
If it does not create momentarily still the Frenchman active with the Challenger tournament in the Italian Biella to the Bundesliga portion, Zdenek Kolar (Czech Republic), playing with the tournament in the Czech Liberec, comes to his first employment in this season.
The so far undefeated Chilean Hans Podlipnik-Castillo was yesterday with the Belarusian Andrei Vasilevski still with the ATP tournament in Kitzbühel at the ball.
It should be in Kiel however likewise thereby like Botic Van de Zandschulp, Niels Lootsma (both Netherlands) and the Belgian Julien Cagnina.
After his two victories on past Sunday against the club against the Alster could also Máté Valkusz in the team move again.
If it is enough for the 18-year old Hungary, which was in January 2016 still the number one of the junior world rankings, not, someone fills up the cadre from the training staff around Marius Zay.
As America of the OMV can harm
Really happy Donald Trump did not work, when he set Wednesday evening its signature under the law for the aggravation of the sanctions against Russia.
“In its haste to issue the law”, the congress in-packed, corroded a few “unconstitutional regulations” it.
Also the reaction from Moscow was as sharp as expected, and even Brussels foamed against the US-raid.
The draft nevertheless plans to punish European enterprises which help the Russian to build gas pipelines into the European Union.
Accordingly concerned are since then investors of the domestic OMV, which together with other European companies the building of the Russian Baltic Sea line north stream 2 co-financed.
The threatening scenery is enormous.
It is too early nevertheless for an estimation of the consequences, so the official statement of the oil company.
Actually Donald Trump would have to arouse the sanctions still by Executive order to the life.
Twelve weapons are available to it thereby.
“Die Presse” viewed itself, which could repel the company and really hurt which it could.

Role backwards: The city stops 46 kitchen assistance
The city organizes the day-care center lunch table again.
With firm contacts for the children and an allocation to the team.
In the urban children's day places the clock is turned back.
To 1 September the city Krefeld transfers the meal supply in the urban children's day facilities (day-care centers) again autonomously.
For Sonja Pommeranz, deputy chief in the specialist area juvenile welfare service, is a good message: “We were pleased all very much”.
One cooks further except house: A Caterer takes over this task and delivers freshly cooking cooled.
The city operates in the Krefelder area 46 children's day places, in 44 gets the children at midday a hot meal.
In past the day-care center year in each case 2800 children sat against the tables, and the need constantly grows.
“Meanwhile children, who are cared for 45 weekly hours, in the day-care center do not only eat to noon”, describe Pommeranz.
“The offer is valid also in the 35-Stunden-Betreuung, if children to 14 o'clock remain.”
46 part-time forces have kitchen service starting from 1 September: They warm up the delivered meals, supplement them around salad, raw food and fruit, portionieren the meal individually, spend the meal, clear, rinse and clean the kitchen.
“The persons employed are assigned firmly to a day-care center”, say Pommeranz.
The size - there are branch-rough just like filter-narrow-rough facilities - decides on the hourly extent.
“The kitchen aids belong now firmly to the day-care center team”, say Pommeranz contently.
“Like that they are merged much more strongly and it are simpler for the day-care center line to convert educational concepts”.
Because around it also goes: healthy eating and cook instruction.
“The children are to help to prepare the meal”.
The direct binding of the kitchen strength to the team is there meaningful.
Also for the children.
“You have a well-known strength in the day-care center, a person, which are familiar them, and not constantly changing humans”.
This continuity is important for the children.
The cleaning of the day-care center areas - so far likewise task of the kitchen forces - is settled in the future by special cleaning staff.
This variant - the separation from cleaning and kitchen service - has apart from the quality improvement of the kitchen achievement also the charm, which turned out it in the cost comparison between self-direction and foreign assignment for the city as the most economical, is called it from the press office.
And that, although 46 part-time forces are again stopped.
“However these hours fall with approximately 750 people within the education range not at all so strongly important”, say Sonja Pommeranz.

GMB concern over investments in the McVitie factory in Glasgow
A trade union would like with managers the Biskuit manufacturer McVitie over the long-term obligation for production in its work in Glasgow to make sure.
GMB Scotland said, the enterprise had been silent over the future of investments at the great CROSS location.
More than 500 employees work in the work, which manufactures Hobnobs and Rich Tea cookies beside other products.
McVities owner Pladis said, he had invested in the last years more than 5 million pound.
It added that employees and union representatives became “as first experienced”, if their activities would change.
In a letter to the branch manager of the enterprise GMB Scotland McVitie's requested to express “doubts that the financing for the modernization of production lines is not advanced”.
GMB senior organizer Drew Duffy, said: “The fact that we cannot win clarity over the business needs and investment plans for the future of great CROSSes from the general site manager, concerns our members deeply.
Generations of families worked here and the workers to concentrate itself strongly on the local community and the region Glasgow, an important column for humane occupation in an area with high unemployment and social disadvantage.
Therefore the eastern end of Glasgow needs urgently a flourishing production presence with McVitie” under the perspective of jobs, the wages and the prosperity, and against the background the Brexit, the rising cost of living and the chronic falling off in production.
A spokeswoman von Pladis said: “The branch manager with great CROSSes received a letter only yesterday from GMB Scotland, and the enterprise will react directly to since we estimate the continuous commitment with employees and union representatives.
We had two months ago a regular meeting with employees and GMB representatives with great CROSSes, with which some questions were openly discussed.
We discussed with the employees the fact that we like all enterprises, which are active in an extremely competition-intensive and uncertain economic climate, examine our business constantly - and is valid for all our divisions and locations - to remain over competitive.
It added: “In the last years we invested, in particular into our great CROSS location more than 5 million pound in production lines and operational improvements.
We recognize the inheritance of great CROSSes as manufacturing plant completely on. If our flow charts should change in the location, the employees become and their union representatives first to be to experience this.”
Did the PSG warn Barcelona of three years before Neymar?
The side of La league may repent their interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint Germain did not warn it in their pursuit of Neymar to diminish, after it delivered an offer of £ 189 million, in order to release its release clause, but Barcelona of three years before the world record assault?
The sensational approach heated the transfer window up in the summer, because the Ligue 1-club is ready to break the world record around more than the double to the past brand whereby Paul Pogba returned in the past season for 89 million pound to Manchester United.
After the completion Neymar becomes the most expensive player of the world and the maximumpaid professional sportsman of the world. PSG offers wages of more than 500,000 GBP per week.
Barcelona is furious over the way, how Neymar forced its way after outside, although a source insists in the proximity of the Catalan executive committee on the fact that the club always gave its best, in order to worry since its arrival from Santos in the year 2013 about it.
But the football world was warned of three years by the PSG president before this prospect?
When Manchester stated town center 2014 interest in the signing of Blaise Matuidi, Nasser Al-Khelaifi had a strict warning for each club, which wanted to let one of the best players of PSG sign.
“I am not anxious, because they know that if they affect one of our players, then we in opposition to them will stand, we become their players contact”, said Al-Khelaifi.
“We respect all clubs.
But if they try to let one of our players sign with itself then this will have consequences.”
Barcelona seems to have crossed this line, whereby the Spanish club expressed earlier this summer interest in the PSG midfield player Marco Verratti.
PSG made clear that they would not permit it to the international one from Italy to leave under any circumstances and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest, by losing one of its quotations for Neymar.

Interview: “Cathedral sparrow report relieves Pope brother Georg Ratzinger”
That Regensburg cathedral sparrow report to the cases of abuse relieves Pope brother Georg Ratzinger.
That means author and historian Michael Hesemann.
The final report to the abuse scandal with Regensburg the cathedral sparrows continues to provide for discussions.
Christian Weisnder, Sprecher of the reform movement “we are church”, explained after publication in relation to the German press agency, it expect from the former Regensburg bishop and today's cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as from the cathedral conductor Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year old brother of the emeritus Pope Benedict XVI, an apology.
It would serve viewing the catholic church much, if Müller and Ratzinger would express their deep regret over own omissions or their at that time wrong estimate of the procedures.
The Vatican newspaper “Osservatore Romano” however criticized that during the reporting over force with the cathedral sparrows with “two different measure” one measure.
Regarding the encroachments in Regensburg doubt nobody that it concerns “infamous and shameful acts”, which would have to be punished and prevented in the future; remarkably however the “degree of medial manipulation” is, so an authoress Lucetta Scaraffia, Historikerin and Mitglied of the national Italian bioethics committee.
“The habit to call the catholic church source of all evils is already part of the everyday life experience and prepares the public opinion to consider normal”, writes Scaraffia.
Also princess Gloria of Thurn and taxis meant in the interview with the Bavarian broadcast: “One starts gladly on the church and that is a found food”.
In addition it pointed out that in their youth “impacts had been a completely normal educational means”, “over with impudent children, like I one was, to become finished”.
She would find it unfair to use today's standards on earlier decades because the world had changed.
In connection with the reports on the cases of abuse often also Pope brother Georg Ratzinger emerged.
Completely to injustice, means author and historian Michael Hesemann, who with Ratzinger “my brother the Pope” wrote the memory volume (into 12 languages translates).
“I must take Georg Ratzinger in protection”, say Hesemann, “all that had nothing with him to do”, rate he the results of the final report.
What is located exactly in the 440-page statement, which the attorney Ulrich Weber assigned by the diocese Regensburg the clearing-up submitted?
Altogether 547 Regensburg cathedral sparrows were abused between 1945 and at the beginning of the 1990er years “with high plausibility” victim by encroachment, 67 cathedral sparrows sexual.
In the final report it means to Georg Ratzinger, who was active from 1964 to 1994 in Regensburg: “Recapitulatory can be noted thus that by cathedral conductor R. in many cases forms of physical and psychological force were used.
Straight one with high emotionality could fail the punishment for the pupils thereby also more violently.
Nevertheless it is noticeable contrary to numerous other accused one of that many victims estimated the general humanity of R. and therefore in numerous cases despite force with it connects even positive memories”.
In the interview Hesemann explains, why the final report relieves Georg Ratzinger to the abuse scandal with Regensburg the cathedral sparrows according to its opinion.
Mr. Hesemann, the 440-Seiten-Bericht over the “incidents of force practice at wards with Regensburg the cathedral sparrows” gives a contradictory picture of cathedral conductor to Georg Ratzinger.
On the one hand many pupils emphasize his “humanity”.
On the other hand it appears also as Choleriker and a perfectionist, which became quite often palpable, if a cathedral sparrow brought no Top achievement in music.
How do you rate this final report as its biographer?
Michael Hesemann: If one makes oneself the trouble and the whole 440 pages from the front to in the back it reads long report one must ask oneself nevertheless rather, why the name seems to Georg Ratzinger at all therein.
Straight once eight sides are dedicated to him clearly and it by each suspicion of the accomplice or connivance with the terrible cases of sexual abuse are acquitted.
Also the force excesses at the preparatory school occurred outside of its sphere of operation.
One can have accused to him if necessary, experience too late of it or not have taken first suggestions seriously enough.
The cathedral sparrow High School, which it affected, of practically all asked ones felt as - so literally - “salvation”, “skies” and “improves world”.
Thus also the broad majority of his pupils Georg Ratzinger issues a completely excellent certification, describes it as “caringly”, “likes”, “sincerely”, “competently” and “understanding”, when extremely good-natured teacher, who supplied the boys regularly with cakes, cookies and drops and “always from clusters of children besieges” was.
Only a minority weights about its perfectionism and its high emotionality, which led already to rage outbreaks.
That it did not only slam thereby with chairs and threw the key federation on the ground, but also distributed slaps and all too impudent boys at the hair or ears, he pulled years ago already admitted, deeply regretted and for it apologized.
Said to its rehabilitation must however that such education methods in the questionable time, which 1960er and 1970's were far common, with parents as with teachers.
Do you know also still such corporal punishment methods?
Naturally, I think everyone of us, which was born 1968 ago.
Also I experienced still in a worldly school, a national High School.
Compared to that, for which it actually goes in this report, i.e. the terrible sexual abuse and the force excesses on the preparatory school, those are certainly trifles.
There one already asks oneself whether it not rather with its fame and its role as a brother of Benedict XVI to do it has that many media straight fell themselves on it.
At the Bavarian Pope yes many, which never understood it, process still eagerly.
The truth however is: The report relieves Georg Ratzinger in every sense!
In the media in connection with the report very much was reported on the topic abuse at Regensburg the cathedral sparrows.
Is Georg Ratzinger in the final report also any involvement or connivance put regarding sexual abuse to the load?
Michael Hesemann: Completely clearly no.
None of the 67 victims of sexual assaults maintained the cathedral conductor to have entrusted itself.
Parents were not even inaugurated.
“I never dared, with my father or my mother about it to speak”, stated a concerning representatively of the others, “it was to me yes everything very embarrassingly”.
The true problem with the clearing-up from sexual abuse was and is nevertheless that most victims from shame are silent.
If they did not even entrust themselves parents and brothers and sisters, then completely certainly not a choir leader, that would have been nevertheless vocationally to a certain extent a colleague of the perpetrators.
How do the cathedral sparrow pupils evaluate Ratzingers role regarding the cases of abuse?
Michael Hesemann: An asked pupil formulated it in such a way: “Concerning sexual abuse… I do not see… a case, in which calculated he (Georg Ratzinger) would have had punctual realizations and which could have stopped respective perpetrator.
I consider it… also really absurd to assume that calculated him… boys more urgently and/or more clearly or also rather opened, as opposite their parents, boarding school leaders, confidence teachers etc.
That one with him over sex speaks… - inconceivablily.”
Thus the report comes to the completely clear result: “That to it before pupils concerned and/or their environment entrusted themselves, could in the context of the investigation are not confirmed”.
Which concerns sexual abuse, Georg Ratzinger is to be acquitted thus by each connivance.
So cannot have been accused to him also, not prevented it or not brought to the announcement.
Therefore also no reason exists to bring its good names with these repugnant crimes in connection as it unfortunately happened in some cases.
In the media much of “force excesses” was to be read with Regensburg the cathedral sparrows.
In the report “looking away” is accused to the former cathedral conductor Georg Ratzinger.
Does it have to live with this reproach?
Michael Hesemann: That is the large problem that in the reporting everything was mixed and blended to an enormous blend from sexual abuse and force excesses and somewhere, in the middle in it, Georg Ratzinger.
But exactly that is again an abuse of the report.
There one separates cleanly: Between the preparatory school and the High School of the cathedral sparrows, between sexual abuse and force excesses as well as, we say once, to other reproaches.
Besides the report treats incidents from the time since 1945, thus also from four decades, in which Georg Ratzinger was not choir leader of the cathedral sparrows.
Whole terrible flogging pedagogy, which cases, in which boys were proper chicaned by sadistic teachers and were abused and among them terribly suffered, occurred all together on the preparatory school in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where really scandalous conditions must have prevailed.
But with those cathedral conductor Georg Ratzinger did not have to do anything, because it got the boys only to face, when they already were on the cathedral sparrow High School.
On that, like the most witnesses stresses, the topic was “preparatory school” taboo.
One was only happy, it escapes to be and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even “paradisiacal” conditions.
What was different on the cathedral sparrow High School?
Michael Hesemann: There of course discipline prevailed, but especially no sadistic force.
And it is valid just also for Georg Ratzinger with whom the report comes at the conclusion that “many victims estimated the general humanity of R. and therefore in numerous cases despite force with it connects even positive memories”.
Thus at the most still the reproach remains to have looked away.
But despite all efforts the report could define only two periods, in which by the conditions on the preparatory school one reported to it.
First times 1970/71, when it began to be established straight and from the procedures at a school, at which he did not work just and was responsible, (so the witness) nothing wanted to hear, and only then 1993.
Did Georg Ratzinger before the conditions lock consistently the ears?
Michael Hesemann: No, because he already wrote a letter to the director of the cathedral sparrow High School, whom the report even reproduces to 1989.
Therein it refers these, “that in the preparatory school further fustigation is practiced”.
Already in view of the danger of negative press publications it recommended urgent intervening.
That was natural at one time, when legal clarity existed, when fustigations were forbidden also in Bavaria for a long time.
Before it they occurred in a legal gray area, how everyone of us probably still knows.
There was difficult also for it to measure, where the concerning perhaps exaggerated or dramatized and where the permissible border had been really exceeded.
In addition, one can not say, he would have always looked away.
That is not correct simply.
Only in the year 1980 fustigation at schools was officially abolished also in Bavaria.
Princess Gloria of Thurn and taxis stated, it was unfair to use the today's educational standards on the time at that time.
How do you see that?
Michael Hesemann: We historians talk there about the “pitfall of the anachronism”, thus the danger to evaluate offence after today's moral standards.
There the princess has all right.
But is not valid naturally for sexual abuse, which was horrible at all times and also not for what was committed a crime in the preparatory school at obnoxiousness and force at innocent child souls, goes already far beyond at that time usual.
That is completely terrible everything and I am glad that it is finally regenerated.
But at the same time I must take Georg Ratzinger in protection, because all that did not have to do anything with him.
Its means for disciplining and punishment to thus draw slaps and at the hair and ears were far common into the 1970ern.
When physical punishment was then forbidden, it adhered also strict to it.
Which picture of its Regensburg time showed Georg Ratzinger in the discussions with you for the book “my brother the Pope”?
Did the topic fustigation come thereby also to the language?
Michael Hesemann: Now, in the book it concerns to Pope of Benedict XVI the life of its brother Joseph, thus., told out of its perspective, there nevertheless played the cathedral sparrows only a featured part.
Nevertheless I do not conceal by any means that he led a strict regiment there.
But also that must be said once: Without this perfectionism, without calling absolute discipline in, it would have been it probably hardly possible, from by then rather national admitted Regensburg cathedral sparrow an institution from world rank to form, true cultural Ambassadors Europas and its musical tradition, who went equivalent twice into the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991) on tour.
With cookies and drops alone one makes from stubborn boys just no large singers and before each success, equivalent on which area, but always discipline, passion and self-conquest.
As what for humans did you experience Georg Ratzinger with the discussions to their book?
Michael Hesemann: By the work on the book and I became acquainted with Georg Ratzinger beyond that really completely well and experienced always as marvelous, humorous, basicgood-natured, deeply religious and heart-good humans, from whom one cannot imagine that he could do only somewhat zuleide to a fly.
I receive regularly, like many former cathedral sparrows this very day, 23 years after its retirement, regularly contact to him hold, him visit, to him read out - he is nearly blind - and him like a member of its family treat.
Those, until today that it to them was once strict, are not assigned which to him thus clearly in the minority.
Most cathedral sparrows are today grateful for the fact that it enriched their life and them the world of the music brought home.
And that it always a good, paternal teacher - a strict father, certainly, that - however nevertheless also an amiable person to be respected may be was, to which they still look up today and which they almost admire.
And ask, again completely clearly: Everything that one accuses it, are education methods, which at that time were at the agenda.
We can be glad that we overcame this time for a long time.
But it is most unfair, a man, only because it is prominent and a still more prominent brother has to make a medial scapegoat.
There the bad intention, which stands behind it, is only too obvious.
Because the report, which was published straight, relieves it.
Now the behaviour would order, a 93-year old man, who rendered large services and without outside of Bavaria and perhaps still of Germany would probably know nobody Regensburg the cathedral sparrows to leave finite in peace.
