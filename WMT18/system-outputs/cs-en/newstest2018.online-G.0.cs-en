The movement for civil rights issued a travel warning for Missouri
The national association for the advantaging of colored people (NAACP) issued a warning for people of color traveling to Missouri on the basis of the discriminatory policies of the state and racist attacks.
"The travel recommendations of the NAACP for the state of Missouri, with effect from 28. August 2017, calls on african-american passengers, visitors and residents of Missouri to travel across the state with increased attention due to a series of contentious, racially motivated incidents, which currently occurs throughout the state,“ says the statement of the association.
The NAACP stated that this step has acceded on the basis of the current laws of the state of Missouri, that makes it more difficult defence of racist motivated offences before the court, as well as due to the actions of law enforcement that disproportionately targets minorities.
"Violations of civil rights.
People are stopped a police officer just because of the color of their skin, are attacked or killed,“ said the Kansas City Star the president of the NAACP of Missouri Genus Chapel.
"The piling we have the largest number of complaints."
This is the first warning of its kind that the organization issued for the state of the USA.
Among the incidents, which the organization cited were racially motivated slurs directed toward students of color at the University of Missouri and the death of tory's Sanders, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died in disputed circumstances at the beginning of this year after him when traveling across the state ran out of gas and the police forced him into custody without accusation of committing a crime.
Travel recommendations also draws attention to the recent statement of the supreme public prosecutor's office of the state of Missouri which states that the driver of the black skin have a 75% higher chance that is stopped by the police.
"The purpose of the recommendations is to warn people and to warn their families, friends, and coworkers before, what could happen in Missouri," said Chapel.
"People must be ready - they should carry with them money for the potential repayment of the deposit or to draw the attention of your relatives that are going to travel the state."
According to current numbers the program the FBI to report hate crimes occurred in 2015 in Missouri to a hundred cases of hateful behavior, which puts the state on the sixteenth place among all the states.
A travel warning is also a response to the new law of Missouri, which makes it difficult to suing the company for discrimination in the provision of accommodation or employment.
American union for a civil freedom (ACLU) issued a travel advisory for the Texas and Arizona after the states approved the immigration law, which allows state officials to detain people on the basis of the violation of this law, which has according to the ACLU improve racial profiling.
Travel recommendations usually issued by the ministry of foreign affairs for foreign countries, but recently, advocacy groups have resorted to these measures in response to the specific laws and trends within the united states.
A model was killed by the chef.
Her family even after 12 years of no peace!
Murdered is a model Sally Anne Bowman.
A girl originally from Croydon in 2005 was murdered chef Mark Dixie directly in the restaurant in which she worked, that she inflicted the stab wounds.
The victim and the killer together should have sex and smoke marijuana, eventually killed her.
The killer then sat in a nearby cafe and watched the careful forensic work with crime scenes.
Dixie, the former chef, was sentenced in 2008 to a imprisonment of 34 years for the murder and rape babes Sally.
The court admitted only to assaulting the juvenile and the lawyer argued that his client found the girl dead lying in the street.
After three years the police convicted.
Dixie claimed that Sally and her ex-boyfriend Lewis Sprotson the night of the fight.
The killer said: "He was seriously angry, and after his attack, the girl started to scream."
"Even attracted the attention of even the taxi driver," he claimed falsely.
The girl according to his testimony had to defend the best she could, but in vain.
Lewis had her stabbed on the street.
The dixie version was proven as a lie and accused him.
After admitting Dixie talked about his horniness and the taste of the girl.
When after sex he dressed, he felt happy and had to smoke marijuana.
Before the incident with Sally was at his ex-girlfriends, drank alcohol and took cocaine, said the police alone, Dexie.
He said that he felt the adrenaline.
Sally began to scream for help, therefore, attacked her from behind and put a hand over her mouth," she added to the Mirror Linda.
And after twelve years, the family faced further attacks from the vandals destroying her grave.
For the last half year damaged him four times.
At large are so cruel people, who these the graves they're digging up.
"So our daughter isn't there anymore," she revealed to the Mirror the mother of the deceased girls Linda information about the disappearance of the urn with the ashes.
Linda on the attackers waited, but had to always attack when she left the cemetery.
Design vibrators are worth tens of thousands.
"The czechs are not prudish at all not even conservative," says Martin Ráž, which operates the prague boutique Intimacy.
In it you will find designer and luxury sex toys.
Including those from the Czech designer Anna Marešové.
It started subtly, about twelve years ago.
Martin Ráž with friends set off on a bicycle trip to the Moravia.
One of them didn't bring only round, but also a box full of think outside the box-looking vibrators.
"Different krtečků and delfínků and it was all green and yellow and just completely different," he tells me over lunch.
His friend is still with one companion has decided to cooperate with the German manufacturer of designer sex toys Fun Factory, which Martin was intrigued, and so he volunteered to help out with marketing.
When the companion left, to devote himself to other profession, replaced him.
Today it operates in prague Benediktské street boutique Intimacy, where selling sex toys in a way, they are usually offered by the luxury handbags or shoes.
And why not?
It is also about designer items.
Wait, wait, you're talking at lunch, you say?
But come on, don't be such puritans!
Just berlin shop Fun Factory, who designed the acclaimed designer Karim Rashid, has served for boutique Intimacy as inspiration.
Opened it in 2010 and it was a completely different concept of erotic shop, than on what are all accustomed to.
No covered expenses, all done in a beautiful, unobtrusive style, the products exposed like in perfumery.
Martin and his business partner Zdeněk Šebelkou began to consider how to accommodate a prague shop, where he should be and how he should appoint.
The name of Intimacy with a liked both of them.
"With intimacy, incidentally, is related and is even, we can say fairer," he says.
Followed by a purchase of the internet domain name and finding a suitable space, which went in parallel with different visualizations of the interior.
Eventually prevailed variant, which decomposes trade into the garden of pleasure and the bedroom, which is dominated by the bed.
Prepared us Dagmar Stepanova from the studio FormaFatal.
The space we found 2013.
First, we didn't feel completely perfect, because it is not on the main street, but again thanks to the fact he was sitting to the name of Intimacy.
It is intimate.
It is in the alley next to the main, so no one customers he's not checking for," praises Martin Ráž.
We wanted to be first.
We wanted to make a trade that is going to be different with branded nice goods, in an environment where women who are mostly our customers, feel good.
And not ashamed for being in such trade at all entered.
When I'm in the boutique Intimacy before a half hour passed, the streets empty.
Plus, I didn't even feel like I went to the store with erotic toys.
Right at the door surprised me the pure elegance of the interior, that I know of boutiques with fashion.
Even if it is in the store only a female attendant, that make women neostýchaly to ask for help, it doesn't mean that here's a man's leg;.
Mostly here, gentlemen goes shopping for gifts for your girlfriend.
"Men usually can't guess the correct size and choose more," smiles Martin over a common mistake.
Are those prejudices, the conventional cliché that women need some big equipment, and it's not true.
So the man in good faith chooses to be unnecessarily large vibrator.
Similarly, men are choosing predominantly black lingerie, whereas woman as a rule, gravitating more to the pink color.
The absolute bestseller is currently the product aptly called Satisfyer.
From the expression on my face must be clear that I don't know which end is up, because Martin immediately explains how it works.
This is such a non-contact clitoral stimulator.
She fights in me, the adolescent need uchechtnout with admiration over it, with what tone of voice is my interpretation of the given.
As though nothing had happened.
And it actually nechumelí.
It's for a good price and has the perfect user testimonials.
We didn't think would be so well accepted.
It is a latest revolutionary innovation.
The first revolution caused a vibrator in the shape of a sea horse.
Take care of it, that women began to be more concerned about the design of such products.
Then the second one was a vibrator for couples We-Vibe.
Completely broke the taboo, that for some men it may persist, and that in the adult aids sees competition.
"They do have different variants," he continues.
With one engine, two engines, with remote control.
This is a favorite category.
When a love connection a woman can have in hand control and determine the intensity of the vibration.
On the contrary, a failure is a category of přikládacích shakers.
At least in the us.
Czech women seem to prefer multi-purpose tools and buy classic vibrators, although it then should be used only externally.
While in western Europe, especially among younger customers, is very popular.
And what about the men?
It's hard to say whether a similar concept would work exclusively for men.
It would probably accommodate a little bit differently.
The question is, what men offer," thinks Martin.
"And we for them we have aids, but to a limited extent." The most sold primarily masturbator, in this case from the manufacturer Tenga.
Doesn't look like an anatomical replica of the vagina, but "more like a shower gel or as an egg or futuristic object.
A lot of focus on functionality and on the experiences when using.
In Japan it's completely different.
It makes me wonder.
I had considered that Japanese women on sex toys a lot of likes, I object.
"This is the internet reality," I explained.
The mundane is completely different.
Here in Europe there are sex toys more associated with the fact that it is used by women.
In Japan are perfectly normal for a man and vice versa are taboo for women." Just for the record - what the japanese brand Tenga, which is in the boutique Intimacy represented, sold worldwide still make up roughly half of what it sells only in Japan.
In our waters
The czechs and the Czechs are not prudish at all.
On the contrary, we are quite the nation.
Definitely unlike countries like catholic Poland, or Italy.
A typical client trade is between 35 and 50 years old and "already has some experience both with your sex life, both with some tools.
He will come for something nice, better, what would complement the affiliate's life, or for yourself." About it, to come back, Martin Ráž with my business partner Zdeněk Šebelkou care so that for each product ascertains whether it is perfectly functional.
Also we don't want to go into specialties of the type of bondage and latex, because, first, there is the space, both it downright not good.
Such things might deter you, which we are trying to target.
Which are the people who always have shyness to a sex shop to go because they were afraid that something like this pops out.
A lot of products exposed on the shelves is really appealing.
This is the also the choice represented by renowned brands.
Some of them even have won design prizes including the Red Dot Design Award.
The first ever award was the aforementioned sea horse ", and it triggered a change in the whole industry.
It started dropping from cheap materials and vice versa work with disabled nezávadnými, started to produce other designs, various colors...
Nice is that the design of some stands of Czech, namely, the popular interior designer Anna Marešová.
I have to say that I'm quite pleasantly surprised how many people with us those design things Whoop.de.doo from Anna Marešové buys, even though they are relatively more expensive.
There are customers who go directly to ben wa balls from Anna Marešové.
She did a really huge piece of work to the fact that in the Czech republic and abroad presented exactly what we're trying to present to us - that sex toys can do otherwise, nicely, with the story.
Anna's story began as a school work.
Now it's about the finished product, which is also produced by us.
I wanted to have the production process under control, and I also wanted to know what materials and how to Whoop.de.doo products produced.
Because it is not a large-scale production, but a small series, it is definitely more expensive than a large series.
Maybe I'm going a little contrarian, but it seems to me important to maintain the development in the Czech republic.
It could well be that in a few years we won't be able to nothing to produce," describes me later situation, Anna, who with Martin agree in the fact that our society is increasingly more open.
With a negative or dismissive attitude is not given.
Maximum are said to be people confused by it.
"But even those will then begin to smile." Currently has Anna Marešová in the menu of the vibrator, on which you can let them make out a personal message, and this year is also planning its own lube.
In the center of the next should be vibrating eggs and other news.
The boundaries of healthy sex
I wonder where lies the border of what is ok.
It is something, what would Martin Ráž did not sell?
It's very hard to define.
What one comes to normal, to another may seem totally abnormal, so the more we are forecasting an assortment of brand-name manufacturers.
None of them worked for some include increasingly extreme.
Before we go, I have one last question: What was the craziest demand you've got?
Right now, in the week got an e-mail in which a lady asked around a masturbatory prop for your friend with an appendage long, twenty eight inches.
So that we had to write, that nothing like this unfortunately we don't have.
There is still the question, if one of us wasn't kidding," measured me Martin suspicious look.
And it happens from time to time...

The chilean parliament abolished the ban on abortion, the law will assess the ÚS.
In Chile still is an absolute prohibition of artificial interruption of pregnancy shall not be performed or for health reasons.
"I'm sorry, that lawmakers have submitted a complaint to the Constitutional court, and that now will be ten people to decide on what we argued in parliament for more than two years," about you, the socialist senator Isabel Allendeová.
The constitutional court in Chile has ten members and at the end of August he should get a new president, which, according to the AFP close to the opposition.
The law abolishing the absolute ban on abortion, initiated by the current president Michelle Bacheletovou, the Senate approved 19. July.
The right-wing of the opposition then announced that the law attacked in court, because according to her, violates the unborn child's right to life.
Mps vote on the bill last month was postponed until nezanalyzuje mixed parliamentary commission.
On Wednesday, members of the proposal to approve and post them so again he made the Senate.
According to the new legislation should cease to be a criminal abortion in three cases: if he threatened the life of the woman, if the fetus will not have a hope of survival, or if the pregnancy arose from rape.
Similar exemptions existed under the Spanish newspaper El País in Chile since 1931, even before women were given in the 1949 electoral law.
The absolute prohibition of abortion in 1989 introduced a right-wing dictator Augusto Pinochet, only a few months before he left the office of president.
Chile is one of the few countries in the world, where there is an absolute ban on abortion.
The others are Nicaragua, Dominican republic, el Salvador, Haiti, Malta, and Honduras.
For example, in el Salvador is now behind bars about 20 women, which for the interruption of pregnancy are serving up to thirty years ' jail sentences.
In many cases, according to human rights defenders about the spontaneous abortion, which the court called for the murder of.
Is there still anything sacred?
Target Trumpova the White house is now the Statue of Liberty
Unmistakable sign of the change of regime is a criticism of the statues.
The americans would tell the tale as well as all the others - see a carefully orchestrated overthrow of the statue of Saddam Hussein in a baghdad square Firdos in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the key supporters of the Trumpova mode, certainly knew what was about to happen, when in passionate debate with the correspondent of CNN Jim Acosta on the topic of the president's proposals to a drastic restriction of legal immigrants set off with a symbolic axe to the Statue of Liberty.
I should say that Miller attacked the statue as such.
For him was almost lynched by an mob of the owners of cruise ships and impersonators of the Statue of Liberty.
He attacked, however, on its importance, namely the fact that in 1903 it was on a pedestal is placed a plaque with the famous poem of Emma Lazarus, up 17 years after the completion of the monument.
Miller rebuked Acosta words: "I don't Want to go into history, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of american liberty, which sheds light on the whole world.
The poem, which was on a pedestal placed additionally, on which you refer, is not part of it.“
Miller has a de facto right, but as you said, this isn't about history.
It is mainly about the striking words of Emma Lazarus that resonate today - inviting them not only to immigrants, but the poorest of the poor:"Let to me, who fell,who poor, who breathe freely barely may, who miserable worm in the midst of full cities."
And just in modern times we can better than ever watch these "wretched worms" on our screens.
Miller wasn't the criticism of poetry - he wanted to clarify that these people are not in the US welcome.
This conflict about the meaning of the statue is part of a broad political and cultural war: it's basically a conflict about the meaning of America.
Emma Lazarus, as well as her friends, who after her death sought to contextualize the plaques with the poem on the pedestal of the statue, well enough to know that getting into high political games.
The statue had to express the connection of the French and american republican government that would represent the classic theme, i.e., the female embodiment of freedom.
Emma Lazarus this meaning amended: in her poem is not the woman figure abstract, but it has its own voice.
It also has a very different name: Mother of exiles.
The merger of the poem with the imagery of the women is a brilliant feminist tensile and devastating attack on the american nativismus.
And in the same way that Emma Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, the followers of the right wing a long time trying to reverse this meaning.
Well-known commentator Rush Limbaugh - John the Baptist in the matter of Trumpova coming to power in 2010, argued that the Statue of Liberty in fact anyone invite me to the country, but it represents the early neokonstruktivismus, bringing american flame retarded to the world: "the Statue of Liberty walks forward.
Brings the torch of freedom from the United states and offers her the rest of the world.
The torch doesn't illuminate the way to the United states.“
Limbaugh, oddly enough, is hitting on an important thing.
The importance of the statues depends on the angle of view.
Emma Lazarus describes the statue from the perspective of the exhausted and bloody to the passenger, who often after a long and terrifying voyage across the ocean arrives with hope in your heart in a new country.
It is literally a view of the world through the eyes of people who are looking for refuge and a chance at a better life.
From this point of view expresses a statue of hope and listening to their needs.
And it is, of course, the prospect that Miller even Trump definitely not be accepted.
Their torch does illuminate the way, but to incite hatred, which is their only source of power.
World athletics championships 2017: Neil Black is singing the praises of the scottish members of the british team
Mean eilidh Doyle remembers a time when he had the british team only two scottish members of the
The director of the athletic federation of the United kingdom, Neil Black stated that a strong entourage of 16 Scots in the team Championship of the world will be "a huge asset for the team."
For the world championships in London 2017, which starts on Friday, was chosen a record number of scottish athletes.
Black believes that in Scotland "something strange is happening" and the british athletics from Scots could ledasčemu learn.
"We are trying to understand and adapt to - we'll work on that," said Black.
"I spoke with people from the Scottish sports institute and they think it has to do with what they did.
The leaders of the scottish athletics thinks that it has something to do with it what they did.
British athletics: it has to do with what they did.
He thinks it's also the people on the streets.
Whatever it is, it's absolutely amazing.“
Several scottish athletes will strive for medals, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butcharta - who will compete with Sir Mo Farahem in the race to 5000 m, while the mean eilidh Doyle was elected captain of the team.
"Mean eilidh is modest.
Her introductory speech was amazing,“ said Black.
"A few athletes, whether Scots or athletes of other nationalities, coming out of the room with a sense of immense pride and motivation.
Passion and undisguised feelings, with such mean eilidh spoke were unique.“
Silver medalist of the Commonwealth, which will compete in a run through the obstacles on the 400 m at its fifth championship of the world said that it is "unbelievable" that in the british team's 16 scottish athletes.
The previous record from the year 1983 and 2015 is seven.
Jogger on medium-haul Muir established just last year, five british and two european records.
The MS will participate in run on 1500 m and 5000 m.
Another of the great Scots Chris O'hare, who will run track in the 1500 m. In the season won the British team competitions and the Annual games.
Doyle recalls his first championship, which was the only other scottish member of the team of Lee Mcconnell.
The team captain led, that he is "very proud" of the fact that the team not only received a large number of her female colleagues, but in many cases will be at the same time attack to participate in the finals, and medals.
"Extraordinary on a post of the captain of the team is that I was elected the other members of the team. It was a great honor for me, but note that I have chosen the team members is gratifying,“ she added.
"Obviously I'm very proud of all the Scots, who got into the team.
It proves that where I have moved.
They are the athletes, who will think on the front places on the stage.
And my opening statement?
Yes, I think that went well.
I merely draw attention to the fact that we could be at this year's world cup proud, because it takes place on home soil.
It is important to take advantage of the support of the home fans and rejoice in the fact that we are back at the olympic stadium.
I got a second chance to race and enjoy the incredible atmosphere.“
Blocking critics on Facebook: do not apply for a public office, if you can't stand criticism of voters
The father of our country knew about the criticism.
Americans George Washington loved, but the newspaper did not take long that it started to criticize for anything, starting from the domestic policy and ending with his political views.
Yes, this criticism to leave the cold.
But he didn't take criticism to silence.
Because in 1783, Washington said: "Freedom of expression can be repossessed - and stupid and dumb we will be guided like a sheep to the slaughter."
This brings me to Maryland's governor Larry Hogan, he needs to work on it, to start acting like a Washington.
Hogan employees have blocked and deleted the posts of at least 450 people, who freely expressed their views on its official Facebook page.
This week, it for these actions, sued the American civil liberties union.
The staff of the governor's lawsuit dismissed as unreasonable, and in the comments on the internet there are many views of the type "who cares".
"It's just Facebook," said many users.
Yet it matters.
Especially at the moment when it comes to people like Hogan.
In absolutely a democratic state this is an immensely popular republican governor.
It can boast the second highest popularity of all 50 governors.
Hogan is not popudivý.
As you can see, their state manages to confidently own and strictly adheres to the principles.
It turns out he's also adroit in the use of Facebook as the main means of connection with their voters - is no exception the publication of the first photo with the bald head after undergoing chemotherapy.
Blocking people who come to the governor's page - which is a public forum, marked as official and managed his employees pay from taxpayers ' money - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
In an interview with the Washington Post Hoganova spokesperson Amelia Chasseová defended the governor, saying that the blocking of the comments was from a position of moderation of the contributions.
Use however, the image of the trolls, spammers or angry people is too easy.
The Washington Post interviewed several real people have been deleted posts.
And that's exactly what they are - real people who speak to their elected leaders; teacher, businessman and pastor, no trolls.
As you all have said, their comments were polite and respectful, no profane.
The Pastor, in his commentary quoted from the Bible, apelujíc on Hoganovu the catholic faith.
Attorney company Bowie Lakshmi Sarma Ramaniová, Md. asked on hate crimes, her comment was not hateful.
"I politely noted that I am disappointed by his inadequate response to hate crimes and other topical news," she wrote in the section with the comments of the daily newspaper the Washington Post.
"I don't like the idea that once a certain number of people comments on the same topic, are some people branded as the promotion of the so-called collective efforts, instead, to be recognized as a larger group of interested citizens."
What the staff of the governor called "a focused spam interest" others would probably call "defense".
The modern Facebook era allows us to easily manage contributions by block criticism, or we delete negative comments.
It is much more convenient than in the past, when the same procedure demanded deployment of personnel to the streets, where they collected and burned all the copies with the criticism or would be arrested or silenced protestants.
And that's exactly what's happening, only in digital form.
Hogan is not the last public figure who will be criticized for defamation of Facebook and other social media.
President Trump facing lawsuit from the side of the Twitter users, who were denied access to his account.
One of the first important regulation was born last week in Virginia.
Chair of the Loudoun County Board of Supervisors violated by district judge James C. Cacherise the first amendment in Alexandria, where prevent access to one of the voters on her Facebook page.
Governor Matt Bevin (R) of Kentucky also received a visit from the ACLU because of his use of Facebook and Twitter.
It should not be so difficult.
In the times Washington had a low postage price virtually the same impact as the internet.
Between the years 1776 and 1800, the number of daily newspapers quadrupled and his position as leader made me question a lot of anonymous blog posters.
And even in those days, Washington had to deal with anonymous trolls.
The people writing under pseudonyms such as "Juricola", "Valerius", "Belisarius" and "Portius", wrote letters to newspapers and calling into question Washington's decision.
According to historical documents, which gathered people in the context of online project Papers of George Washington Project in his office piled a petition criticizing his opinion against the agreement of the Treaty of Amity, Commerce, and Navigation with Britain.
He is, however, not.
Freedom of expression, dissent and the intimidation lies in the very foundation of our nation.
And a true leader must take.
The czechs quickly took advantage of the free roaming, abroad, consume more data than at home.
Abroad, the Czechs consume more of their fare than at home.
Most often range in Austria, but the consumption data in the summer season dominated by Croatia.
On vacation on the one hand, they have more time to browse on the web, under a parasol, moreover, often do not have the ability to connect to Wi-Fi.
Beach, swimming and a smart phone in hand.
So it looks like a typical Czech holiday in Croatia after the customers can use the services of the local operators for domestic prices.
It appears from the fresh statistics of O2.
Thanks to the new roaming rules, has most of the travelers in abroad more available data in the context of flat-rate than at home.
It is therefore not surprising that in Croatia, where over the winter he drives a minimum of "uses," has risen in this year's summer season, consumption data even padesátinásobně.
On the second place in the ranking of the consumed data is then ranked Italy.
The most minutes the Czechs provolají from Germany, where many of them heading out on business even during the summer.
Croatia according to data of the Association of Czech travel office annually visited by 800 thousand Czechs, is our most popular vacation destinations.
People here, however, exchanged the book for sharing the experiences of using a mobile phone.
A record was this year's 7. July.
"Into the transmitted data would fit dozens of million photos," specifying the details of the director of the mobile segment in the O2 Silvia Cieslarová.
Even though Croatia is in the lead in the volume of data, the highest number of Czech users is moving in the neighbouring countries.
In the first place is Austria, followed by Germany and Slovakia.
Croatia is up to fourth, and Italy the sixth.
To Austria we go for hiking and active holidays on which we don't have as much time to browse on the internet.
"Through Austria in addition, the Czechs are heading to the Adriatic," she explained Cieslarová.
While the data recorded by the operator after release of the roaming fees, high annual growths, for telephony growth is much lower.
The number of minutes of voice roaming has increased compared to last year doubled.
With a huge lead before the other countries are dominated by Germany.
"Call in roaming using more corporate customers on business trips," she added Cieslarová.

When Bardina Degeiová cooks dinner, does not use while the stove.
In fact, rarely used the pan.
In his wooden shack, which is located in the capital of Paniai Enarotali, in indonesian province of Papua, a woman usually simply throw a sweet potato - in the speech of the local "nota" - directly into the fire.
After half an hour the potato removed, and with the taste of you on her will devour with nemytýma hands.
Bardina sitting on the muddy ground - a house is not equipped with furniture -where at the same time performing their everyday work such as washing clothes in the muddy water of a nearby marsh.
A bucket in a room without a roof supplants the toilet.
As the youngest of the four wives of her husband, she was assigned no field for cultivation.
Polygamy is here normal.
Work into the late hours of the night, constitutes a danger: most of the men from the village are unemployed and often drinking alcohol. In the village, moreover, housed the soldiers.
"In the afternoon after five o'clock no one will not allow to roam around the village," says Bardina.
It's a rare glimpse into everyday life in the highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony, which was announced as part of Indonesia in 1969 after a controversial referendum, when it was only 1026 of elderly forced to a vote in the form of public upheaval, the hands from an occupying army.
The current movement of protest against the Dutch rules quickly turned their anger against jakartské government, which dominated the entire region with the exception of the foreign journalists or the guardian of civil rights.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua - independent Papua New Guinea occupied the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is so remote and ravaged the city, where you get after a ninety minute flight from the provincial capital Jayapura to Nabire, and then rode five hours so the stomach-wrenching ride.
Public transport at this place does not work.
Town with 19 000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses gated bamboo fences, roofs made of woolen sheets in shades of gray and rusty colors.
This place looked very, very few Indonesians, let alone journalists, and virtually no foreigners.
Before the arrival of the christians, the locals worshiped god on behalf of the Uga Tamee.
And that's not all.
"We were not accustomed to wearing these clothes," said Bardina, pointing to her colorful, hand-knitted turban, a dark shirt and a bright skirt.
"Before, we wore only leaves."
Papua is the poorest province of Indonesia - 28 % of the population lives below the poverty line and the infant mortality rate and literacy is one of the worst in the whole of Asia.
At the same time, however, indonesian land of gold.
The largest and most profitable gold mine in the world Grasberg, owned by Freeport McMoran of the us Phoeenixu, is located only 60 miles from Paniai - rocky province approximately the size of New Jersey, which is home to about 153 000 inhabitants.
Just in 2015 here at the Freeport mine gold and copper, worth $ 3.1 billion.
In addition, Papua supports the extraction of wood in the estimated value of $ 78 billion.
This wealth, however, for the Papuans the source of suffering and the guarantee of the tyranny of the powerful indonesian military.
From the investigation, which in 2005 did the New York Times shows that Freeport had paid local army officials and units about $ 20 million between 1998 and 2004, including the amount of 150 000 dollars for one officer.
Papuans calling for self-government threaten the golden goose and are therefore hard to suppression.
According to human rights activists was from 1969 killed more than 500 000 Papuánců and thousands of others were raped, trýzněno and imprisoned by the indonesian army.
Mass murder in the tribal areas of Papua during the 70's. years of the last century amounted to genocide, as stated by the Asian human rights commission.
Just in the past year arrested by the indonesian police in the region more than 3900 peaceful protestors.
We Will Lose Everything, the report brisbaneské the archdiocese of 2016, describes the atrocities that occurred last year, such as extrajudicial executions, torture - according to another report, it is particularly popular rape and execution of electric shock - and the brutal suppression of peaceful demonstrators.
"It is difficult to count the number of victims, because of the incidents occurring every week," said Andreas Harsono, indonesia researcher at Human Rights Watch.
The entire situation aggravated the fact that be papuan resources are attracted to Indonesia by the colonists.
Of the 3.5 million population of the province is 83 % according to christianity, but the demographics are changing with the influx of muslim immigrants from the indonesian islands - Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Javanese canteen selling fried chicken and gado-gado, or a mixture of vegetables with peanut sauce.
The local people are fighting for survival.
"Immigrants have started to sell chickens and vegetables to traditional markets for lower prices than the local Papuans," explains unsociable Abeth You, who was born in Paniai and moved to work in the provincial capital Jayapura.
"The original inhabitants of Papua - mama-mama (women's) - then lost my job."
Indonesian president Joko Widodo, who goes by the nickname Jokowi, in the context of my presidential campaign in 2014, promised a solution to the inequality and violations of rights.
The former carpenter secured his trip to the presidential palace in jakarta on 27 of the 29 districts of Papua, including Paniai.
But in Papua has changed very little and the local people feel betrayed.
"Our hearts were broken, because in 2014 we voted for Jokpwiho with the hope that he will answer our call for justice," said You.
The reality is that just two months after the October inauguration of the Jakowiho experienced Paniai a big shock.
7. December 2014, she sang a group of 11 children christmas songs by the camp fire in the town of Enarotali, when from the gloom of the night emerged two indonesian soldiers on a motorcycle.
Two of the surprised children told them that they should turn on the lights.
One of the soldiers with this complaint, and tone, which were spoken touched and later returned with four other soldiers, said local priest Yavedt Tebai.
Two of the soldiers in an inebriated state chased a group of kids and beat them with rifle butts of their weapons, said the victims and witnesses of the event.
One of the soldiers then opened fire on a group of children.
One of the children, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo was beaten so severely that he fell into a coma.
A few hours later someone set fire to the nearby building of the election commission and the next day things escalated.
About 1000 young papua men and women gathered on the football field in front of the local police station and the army headquarters and asked for justice.
They came up with the ceremonial hunting bows and have done dance waita - in which runs in a circle and imitates the singing of birds - papuánského of the tribe Mee Pago.
A few protesters began to throw on the building stones.
With the escalation of tensions was the soldiers issued the order over the radio: "If the crowd tries to at least three times the resistance, you have permission to shoot," said according to the weekly TIME in an official document, whose contents have never been made public in the local media.
Yeremias Kayame (56), the head of the district of Enarotali Kego Koto, recognized the impending danger and urged residents to split up to their homes.
No one, however, didn't have his words heeded.
"When I turned around, someone shot me in the left wrist," he said of the weekly TIME on the porch of his brightly painted wooden house.
Kayame not yet know who the shooter was, but in his words belonged to the bullet to one of the present soldiers.
"All around was a lot of people and a lot of shooting," he added.
One of the locals, Alfius Youw, was in the words of his cousin, who was a witness to the shooting, hit three times.
"I ran to the body, to make sure that it's really him," she said of the weekly TIME zasmušilým voice Yohanesová, who like many Indonesians uses only one name.
"I saw that he was dead... I Kissed him."
Papuánský police inspector, general Yotje Mende, told reporters that his officers only "organized" station, which was under attack.
"We need to defend ourselves, when people get death threats," he said in 2015, the press secretary be papuan police, commissioner Pudjo Sulistiyo.
"It's a matter of life and death."
According to the organization Human Rights Watch, were killed five protesters and many escaped with injuries.
Report on the murders prošuměla jakartskými the media the following day.
About three weeks later delivered a Jokowi in Jayapuře a passionate speech and expressed his sympathy for the families of the victims and promised that the will deal with the violence in Papua.
"I demand an immediate solution to this problem, that could never happen again," he said.
The minister of national security Wiranto in October 2016 announced that it will introduce out-of-court mechanism to resolve the violent acts that have occurred in the past.
Almost immediately but began to reverberate excuses.
"Most of the violent crimes occurred a long time ago.
Some of them took place in the 90's. years of the last century, and some at the beginning of the 21. century.
I mean, that we resolve these violent acts to punish, but it won't be a simple task,“ he said.
In an interview of 5. June for weekly TIME, which was held in Jakarta, however, Wiranto argued that planning in Papua to implement any measures.
Instead, it said that "all cases will be předstoupeny court".
Wiranto, whom the UN has accused of "crimes against humanity" on the basis of more than one thousand dead during the independent elections of 1999 in East Timor, said he has not yet been settled 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua, including the incident in Paniai.
The families of the victims of the shooting in Paniai welcomed his claims with skepticism.
"In the past three years, I was interviewed by a total of four times, but now I'm nothing was forthcoming," said Yohanes.
"I'm tired."
As he says, a few years after still live in fear.
"I'm scared," as he says.
"I'm afraid that me will arrest the army or someone's gonna shoot me."
His brother Yacobus confirmed the view of many inhabitants of Paniai, who have fear about the incident to speak.
According to him he was beaten up by members of the military after he helped bury four of the victims.
"After burying the bodies, I began to search for the army," he said.
And the shooting still continues.
On Tuesday she was shooting indonesian police on the villagers in the neighboring Deiyai.
A scuffle, in which died one person and another 17 were injured, occurred between the villagers and the manager of the construction company, who refused to provide assistance in transporting the unconscious man to the hospital.
Ravianus Douw (24), who drowned while fishing in the nearby river, died on the way to the hospital.
Angry villagers protested before the building of the company.
According to the observations of the police, the villagers pelted after members of the stones and the responses to them have been a warning shot.
Local residents, however, argue that the mobile brigade (indonesian paramilitaristická police) began to shoot into the crowd and killed one person.
"There was panic, we were afraid of retaliation," said for the TIME 29-year-old Dominggu Badii, who lives near the hospital and witnessed the arrival of the injured.
"Two days ago, I came out of the house."
Deiyaiský parliament demanded the punishment of the involved police officers and the download of the mobile brigade of the area.
Paniai was for the indonesian government is always a thorn in the side.
The lack of meaningful development only deepens the separation of the indigenous people of the tribes Mee, Moni, Dani and the Damal who live in the central highlands.
Many of them have joined the Movement for the liberation of Papuai (OPM) - the army of the rebels, which protects the rights of Papuánců by attacking and kidnapping the indonesian police.
Some of the leaders of the OPM come from Paniai. Among the not Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
As a result of attacks by the army in recent years, arrested and arbitrarily detained thousands of residents Paniai, all under the pretext of "safeguarding national sovereignty".
Some of them already nobody will never see.
Paniai is among the residents of Papuai known as "the tragic and the forgotten place".
Oil into the fire of poverty.
This little rice, which is sold in Enarotali, it is for the local too expensive.
And the bread is just as unattainable.
Local residents get their groceries are grown: mainly sweet potatoes, fruit and wheatgrass.
On the fields of working women; each of them doing four or five fields with sweet potatoes.
Most of the harvest is intended for the needs of the family, and the rest sold on the local market.
Ten pieces of sweet potatoes costs only 10 000 indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Since the airport of Nabire opened up more air routes and the country started to flow new immigrants, there is an increase in economic inequality between native Papuans and immigrants.
Already so few jobs usually occupy the better educated and wealthier immigrants.
Papuans have rarely needed capital and education to be able to get down to business.
"Young people are moving from villages due to lack of job opportunities and money," said John Gobai, the chairman of the tribal council Paniai.
Thanks to the isolation is the province of Papua hidden from the world.
Contribute to the fact also strict rules for foreign journalists.
At the beginning of this year were from papua expelled two French journalists - Franck Escudie and Balsille Longchamp - due to "lack of cooperation with the authorities", all this despite the fact that they got so rare permission to film.
Phelim Kine, deputy director of the asian branch of the organization Human Rights Watch, Jokowi in his election campaign he promised the abolition of the strict rules for journalists and the achievement of transparency and development. However, it never happened.
"Foreign journalists who work in the wayward nejvýchodnějších areas of Papua and West Papua, there is a great risk: non-recognition of visas and the inclusion on the blacklist," said in a statement.
The lack of news from the pens of foreign journalists means that the international pressure on indonesia in Papua is largely limited.
In march urgovalo six pacific nations of Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, Marshall islands and Solomon islands - the human rights Council of the UN on the investigation into the "various and widespread acts of violence" in Papua, including the shooting in Paniai.
These countries in the past also supported the OPM.
A spokesman of the indonesian foreign ministry Arrmanatha Nasir shrugged off the accusations, when he said to reporters in Jakarta: "Indonesia still applies a democratic system and the media are free, it is therefore difficult to disguise the evidence of cases of human rights violations."
Local people are calling for the participation of foreign governments.
When the official delegation from Netherlands, headed by ambassador for human rights Keesem Van Baarem, visited 4. may Jayapurau, the local people applauded according to the source, who also attended the meeting, but wanted to remain anonymous, password "we want freedom".
For the year 2019 are in Indonesia, scheduled the next elections, but the papuans say they will not vote for Jokowi.
"Jokowi is a man who has good intentions, but is surrounded by people associated with the shooting in Paniai," said Gobau, the chairman of the tribal council.
He wants to Jokowi knew that the inhabitants of the Paniai - in addition, they live in constant fear of the marauding army - rolling in poverty, crappy education and health system.
Gobai claim that the inhabitants of Paniai, as well as other Papuans, consider your vote for the "debt", which must Jokowi pay off.
"They don't want money, they demand justice," he added.
Despite the threats and intimidation of the families of the victims paniaiské shooting continued in the last symbolic act of defiance: they bury the bodies of the victims on the land opposite the police and army station.
With the knowledge that justice will never be done, at least allow those responsible to forget your crimes.
"He was killed by a member of our family," said Yacobus with my head down.
"What can we do?"
The French navy intercepted a huge shipment of cocaine into Australia.
The French navy kept the Pacific yacht carrying 1,46 tons of cocaine worth about $ 256 million.
The shipment went to Australia.
When the intervention was arrested a four-man crew of the ship, which consists of probably the people from Lithuania and from Latvia.
The yacht, named as Afalina, set sail from South America and the police after the detention, drew back to the harbor in the town of Nouméa, the capital of the French overseas territory of New Caledonia in the Pacific ocean.
The australian intelligence service reported that in cooperation with its international partners strive to accurately determine how and where the drugs were, and to reveal "the Lithuanian syndicate".
"We are grateful to the French authorities for the measures, which stop large quantities of drugs bound for Australia," said its executive director, Col Blanch.
The drugs were this week in Noumée destroyed.
Australia is due to the high street prices of drugs an attractive target for their smugglers.
The country is also faced with the problem of rostoucícho the number of people suffering from drug addiction.
The current crackdown is not the last time first.
Last month three men were charged with transportation of a large quantity of drugs from the United states to Australia, which tried to smuggle across the pacific ocean in a small plane.
Seniors do not feel thirsty, drink it is them necessary to remind.
The problem it can be in homes for the elderly, the solution, according to doctors from the Geriatric clinic of the General university hospital in Prague, Pavla Mádlové could be the infusion of saline solution, which poke a thin needle under the skin.
But so far applied only in health care facilities.
The older they are, the more decreases the amount of water in his body.
"And, moreover, loses the sense of thirst, so seniors generally receive less fluid and very quickly get dehydrated," she said Mádlová.
Two liters should drink for sure.
"But to get to the old man so much fluids is a big problem," she added.
In homes for the elderly that according to her, often no doctor's watching.
In hospitals solves the dehydration commonly infusions.
"I think that there should be gradually put in place, to be able to receive subcutaneous infusion," she said.
Per day, according to her, can old people to deliver up to two half-liter bottles of saline solution.
Lack of fluids may cause malaise, headache and reduced performance.
Dehydration will manifest itself as a complete loss of self-sufficiency.
"One day the old man says he can't get out of bed, talking confusedly," she added.
In case of neglect can result in stroke.
The blood thickens and clogs the blood vessel in the brain, there is also the risk of kidney failure.
Recumbent patients should not be covering the duvet, a maximum of a cotton bed sheet.
The problem can also be disposable diapers.
"It's ošetřovatelsky more challenging, but the ideal would be the patient occasionally uncover and let the skin air out," said the doctor.
In Dubai burned for the second time a skyscraper The Torch
In Dubai on Friday found himself in the flames of one of the largest residential skyscrapers in the world. Firefighters had to evacuate all the inhabitants of the 337 meters high and 79 storey building.
For the last two years this is already the second fire of this high-rise building, which bears the appropriate name of The Torch (the Torch).
Evacuated were all residents of the building and there were no injuries. The cause of the fire is not known.
"We slept and woke us up the alarm. We heard a scream.
It took us ten minutes before we ran down from 50. floor,“ said for Reuters George, one of the residents of the skyscraper.
The dubai civil defense said that firefighters managed to get the fire under control around four hours in the morning (0:00 GMT), whereupon the continued cooling of the building.
Government officials have supplied, to provide alternative accommodation for the affected residents.
The Incident could once again trigger debate about the safety of the materials used for lining high-rise buildings around the world.
From the results of the investigation, which launched the leadership of the skyscraper Torch after the fire in 2015 showed that most were damaged trim and external panels used for decoration or insulation.
British police said that a system of insulation and lining london's Grenfell Tower could contribute to the rapid spread of fire during the June fire, which killed almost 80 people.
The results of the survey showed that more than one out of five passengers to the US pronounces the prohibited items on board an aircraft
A survey among passengers showed that more than twenty percent of them consciously or unconsciously give the prohibited items through the checkpoints of the u.s. government agency, the Transportation Security Administration to board a plane. At least six percent of the passengers came on board the plane with a knife or other sharp object.
Less than one percent of the passengers says he belatedly discovered that traveling with a firearm, ammunition or explosives.
From the results of a survey conducted by the airline Stratos Jet Charters Inc. - and the on who answered more than 1000 dotazujících - revealed that younger passengers are more likely to breach the rules.
Of the respondents who admitted that they tried to consciously travel with the subject, which is prohibited by the TSA, it was 19.7 percent of passengers, with several thousand flight hours, compared with less than 15 percent of the members of the Generation X.
Among the most common items that escaped the attention of the TSA, include food and alcohol.
More than three percent of the respondents consciously invoked through security sharp object, while 2.2 percent of surveyed women and 3.7 percent of men surveyed also admitted that they intentionally made on board the aircraft forbidden drugs.
The company said it conducted research among the travelers around the world to find out how many of them randomly give the illegal items through airport security and how much did so on purpose.
It is no surprise that most of the people who have brought illegal items - whether consciously or unconsciously - he travels by plane very often.
As the company underlined, the directive of the TSA are somewhat complicated and confusing.
People often do not know what liquids and in what quantity can the plane uttering.
No surprise, then, that the TSA confiscated in the largest quantity is forbidden fluid.
Some time people thought that the TSA will dispose of the books in the same way as contraband.
Movement of fluids is permitted in the framework of the domestic flights, not international.
The head of the EPA, Scott Pruitt of the postponement of the planned directives to reduce emissions the Obama administration
Then, what was the environmental protection Agency sued fifteen states, appealed to her boss Scott Pruitt its earlier decision to delay the implementation of the plan of the former Obama administration to reduce carbon dioxide emissions.
Pruitt introduced the changes as part of its plan. It responds more rapidly than the previous government on the needs of the state environmental regulators.
He didn't mention, however, about the legal challenge filed against his previous position at the federal court of appeal.
This concerns the last term, which was set at 1. October, when should states begin to implement the regulation from the year 2015 to reduce the amount of ground-level ozone.
Pruitt announced in June that the deal is delayed by one year and order the more detailed the study plan, in order to avoid "interference with local decisions, or the impending economic growth".
Pruitt, who before substituting into the role of chief of the EPA president Donald Trump held the position of state attorney general of Oklahoma, a long time served as a reliable opponent of stricter environmental regulation.
Since settling in Washington, Pruitt repeatedly moving or stall the regulation of the proposed chemical and fossil fuel industry.
Sudden Wednesday's turnover is the largest legal failure for Pruittovu regulatory agenda.
Last month, the federal appeals court in Washington ruled that the executor of the EPA overstepped its authority in an effort to delay the inclusion of the plan of the Obama administration, which required that oil and gas companies reduce methane losses.
In a statement issued on Wednesday night, Pruitt suggested their version of the ozone standards and strengthened the commitment of the EPA to work with states using complex processes and the implementation of the new standards in a given timeframe.
"During the reign of the previous administration, the EPA often failed to comply with the terms and waiting to be sued activist groups and others, souhlasíc with the settlement and further setting plans," said Pruitt, who in his previous position he handed to the EPA more than a dozen lawsuits.
"We don't believe in regulation by litigation and the performance of the term we take seriously.
We never joke about their status and authority, resulting from it.“
In a statement, the EPA states, however, that Pruitt may at some point use the "possibility of delay and all other legally available authority" to ensure that the regulation "will be based on sound policy and the most accessible information".
Republicans in congress pushing for a comprehensive transliteration of the ozone rules.
The budget the White house approved last month, seeks to delay implementation of the rules of 2015 at least eight years.
The measure still did not pass the senate.
New york attorney general Eric Schneiderman, who headed the coalition of states, which žalovaly this week, the EPA said that the group does not intend to allow in legal coercion.
"The turnaround in the views of the EPA - following our lawsuit - is an important victory for the health and safety of the 6.7 million new yorkers, and more than 115 million Americans, which directly affects air pollution," added Schneiderman.
New York joined California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington and Washington, D.C.
Ground-level ozone is formed when ordinary harmful substances emitted by automobiles, power plants, oil refineries, chemical plants and other sources react in the atmosphere with sunlight.
The resulting smog can cause serious respiratory problems in sensitive people and every year thousands of premature deaths.
Public health advocates and environmentalists have Pruittovu sudden change acknowledged with gratitude.
"It is worrying, what pressure is need to develop, to change the mindset of the responsible persons and to protect the air we breathe," said Lori Ann Burdová from the Center of biological diversity.
"We must continue to wrestle with the ideological drag Trumpovy administration, which seeks to assist the polluters and special interests."
He doused the man with acid, yet not according to the court threat.
You never know what can happen to you.
In one minute you're at home with the family laughing and smiling, in the second you suddenly change your entire life from the ground up.
And the worst part is that there's nothing you can do.
A similar fate befell Andreas Christopherose of Great Britain, whose face was burned with acid by an unknown assailant, who was eventually acquitted.
Information, said web Reuters.
In December 2014 someone in Christopherosových knocked on the door.
Andreas picked up that will open.
He considered that behind the door is probably a courier who had to deliver that day christmas gifts for the family.
Instead of waiting for him a cruel surprise.
Man never in my life seen him right after the opening, without warning, poured acid over with the words: "It's for you, buddy."
The pain was indescribable.
Clothes for me fell apart like nothing, and I felt just a tremendous amount of pain on the skin," said Andreas.
The family urgently transported to the hospital, there is, however, his loved ones learned the terrible news - according to doctors had a chance to survive.
A few weeks since the incident had doctors constantly fear that their patient will succumb to an infection that threatened to break into his wounds.
His injury was very serious.
Ninety percent of the was hit the face, which the doctors tried to put together using skin from other parts of the patient's body.
Great complications for Christopherose become a loss of the eyelids.
This is probably the nejmučivější thing I experienced.
"You can't hide from the unexpected light, you can't close your eyes," he described his torment.
Today has Christopheros behind twelve operations, which are far from the last.
Injuries incurred by the victims of acid attacks, can according to plastic surgeons require hundreds of surgeries and years of healing.
Even after a challenging and long-term treatment they have the victim's tissue scarred for life.
"Sometimes people don't recover and after a whole life of fighting against deformation and mutilation," said professor Peter Dziewulski, a spokesman for the british association of plastic and aesthetic surgeons.
The attacker made a mistake.
As for the attack, Christopheros is sure that the unknown man must have confused with someone else.
The perpetrator actually believed that to seek revenge on the man who sexually abused his close person.
The police the whole case is properly investigated and the assailant subsequently tracked.
The man was originally sentenced to a minimum of eight years in prison.
However, later the verdict to the astonishment of Christopherosovy families fundamentally changed.
"The three judges finally came to the conclusion that the punishment should be revoked because a man is not considered a threat to the public," said Christopheros.
For the past few years the numbers of assault corrosive substances increased significantly.
The ministry of interior on the issue expressed so, that it plans to establish new guidelines to prosecutors regarding the classification of corrosives.
These should be included among the dangerous weapons.
Victims of similar attacks but they are not going to give up.
Demand that the Uk government pushed through stricter and longer prison sentences to people who attack your surroundings with acid or other corrosive substances.
Also require that tightened control of the sale of dangerous substances, which are often widely available in different stores, as it is a different cleaners.

China's missing tourists.
Beijing due to visa policy comes about billion.
China, after decades of trying to exert its influence without the use of power resources.
A year, spends ten billion dollars to support the language schools and the construction of the universities abroad, pushing your entertainment industry to foreign markets and trying to attract western tourists.
But Beijing is failing.
The state media talks about the plan to make tourism the driving force of economic transformation and upgrading.
The number of arrivals last year rose only about 3.8 percent and about 80 percent of tourists to China came from hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan.
Due to it by, inter alia, that despite all its global aspirations to meet China foreigners with open arms, assesses the situation in the most populous country in the world professor of economics of peking university Christopher Balding in an article for Bloomberg.
An example that speaks for all, is the chinese visa policy.
Only 13 countries have with China visa-free travel, citizens of those others must have a visa to settle with the advance.
The chinese offices in the united states, therefore, are the crowds comparable with the celebrations of the chinese new year.
Visa costs $ 140, but if a person doesn't want to wait long hours in line, he must pay extra 100 dollars and more for additional services.
Such restrictions are building significant economic obstacles.
Studies Journal of Economics and Finance showed that the need for visas reduces a given country, the number of visitors by 70 percent.
In 2015 visited mainland China only two million Americans, while hong Kong, which is the gross domestic product of China accounts for less than three percent and have been living there less than one percent of all inhabitants, was visited by 1.8 million Americans.
China often the problem itself deepens, when tourism uses to achieve its political objectives, for example in disputes with Taiwan and South Korea.
If China in the spring limited the service to South Korea in the context of disputes around the south Korean anti-missile system, the south koreans pay her back and China is shunned.
In may, the number of visits fell year on year by 42 percent, while Japan recorded a increase by 85 percent.
It all affects the macroeconomic stability.
According to a recently published report of the american central bank Fed could China due to the foreign trips the Chinese to leave up to $ 190 billion, while China in the context of sale of currency the incoming tourists a year will receive about $ 35 billion.
According to official figures about the development of the balance of payments then China last year had a tourism deficit of 217 billion dollars, which is equal to 44 percent of the entire chinese surplus in trade in goods.
A small number of tourists a country that scrupulously precludes the outflow of capital, advocates a very painful blow.
The above-listed factors, however, are only one manifestation of the more general restraint towards strangers.
In many places of China because of the immigrants virtually no one heard.
In 2013 lived in China less than a million foreigners.
More of them are in the United states and some individual cities.
Even Japan, which is not exactly the crossroads of immigration, has a double.
A number of scientific works shows that immigrants usually revive economic growth, entrepreneurship and innovation.
In China it is, however, practically you will not find.
To solve these problems will be politically challenging, but the step that offers, is the simplification of the visa system.
Other asian states, especially India and Vietnam, recently develop a big effort to simplify and become cheaper procedures in issuing visas.
If China wants to more foreign tourists and their hard currency, it should be for them to be easier to get there.

Trump as part of his campaign promised to build a wall along the southern border, and declaring that to pay for it Mexico.
A leaked transcript of his first conversation with the australian prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, revealing a tense exchange of views.
President Trump said Turnbull, that the agreement on supervision of the U.S. over the refugees, pointing to Australia's "ridiculous" and "stupid" and insisted that if he would agree to such an agreement - which ushered in the Obama administration - it would look like a "drugged" after he proposed a ban on the entry of refugees into the united states.

Tusk again testified for the prosecution because of Smolensk.
"He has nothing to fear," he said at the Tuskovu address of the brother of the dead president, the chairman of the ruling party Law and justice Jaroslaw Kaczynski.
"I don't have to worry, Kaczynski doesn't intimidate me," he replied, Tusk and read the current leadership of the country that is trying to justice to abuse against political opponents.
When leaving from the office of the prosecutor waiting for the Tusk according to the television TVN 24 the crowd, which chanted, Donald Tusk! and wished the politician a Hundred years!.
Tusk thanked for the support and make sure he has a clean conscience: "I have nothing to fear and Kaczynski doesn't intimidate me."
Prosecutors, according to his words without finding fault, but doubts that justice has the present Polish rulers to serve as a tool against opponents, the opposition or the people that do not like, and I'm afraid that in this group I belong to.
The questioning was already the second time.
Expremiér was interrogated in the da's office for the second time, this time he had a questioning concern misconduct during the autopsies of the victims located disaster.
Additionally they came on a confusion of bodies in the coffins.
The families of the disabled to open the coffin, and this had to be some reasons.

He added that any conflict with Russia would Divide thwarted the chances of getting the most important office in the union, from which, however, Poland absolutely nothing.
Kaczyński also stated that he warned the German chancellor Angela Merkel with Donald Tusk, it may turn out differently, but didn't take note of that.
Tusk underwent an eight-hour interrogation in the da's office for 19. April.
Even then testify as a suspect, only as a witness.
However, many of his summons for questioning was considered a part of the obvious efforts of the Polish government and the head of PiS Kaczyński discredit the Tusk as a political opponent by linking with various scandals.
The prosecutor's office is in Poland, subordinated to the minister of justice, who fulfils the role of the attorney general.
A summons for questioning came soon after the election of Tusk to head the European council, which Kaczynski strenuously, but in vain tried to prevent, inter alia during the visit of Merkel in Warsaw.

Massacre on the bridge of the Moore's Ford: activists remind yourself of racist lynching
Ford Mercury 1948 ran around the onlookers residents of Monroe, Georgia and kodrcal towards the bridge of Moore's Ford.
However, before the car with four passengers, black and white the driver managed to bridge to arrive, way to him to have a group of white guys with guns.
The leader of the group - a middle-aged man in a striped suit - long hit of a cigarette and peered out the windshield of the car.
Inside the passengers were shaking with fear.
"We want that n---and Roger!" yelled the man.
"Bring him to me!"
The silence is interrupted by the roar of a young black man, which is pulled out from the passenger seat.
This scene is fortunately a mere reconstruction of the events that occurred 22. July.
But when one of the men flips through "Roger's" neck in a noose, the audience sighs with excitement.
From 2005 to bridge the Moore's Ford returns regularly to a group of activists, who are retracing the fateful night of the year 1946, when there were two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcomová and George and Mae Murra Dorsey - killed by members of the ku klux Klan.
For the murders have not been judged.
"It is curious that in all the years she was arrested only one person - yet that is still seen in our community; even if we know their identities," let's hear Tyrone Brooks, who helps reconstruct the events to organize.
"It's a stain on our history and a burden in our souls."
Brooks is a 71-year-old former congressman for the state of Georgia and a lifelong warrior for civil rights.
In his eyes represents a reconstruction of the events of a dramatic challenge to the venue. Every year the community of the city of Monroe recalls that justice was not done.
"We demand the prosecution and closure of the case, we want peace of mind and reconciliation, but justice above all," said Brooks.
"In the meantime can not be started the process of healing and reconciliation."
The medical examiner covers the 27. July, 1946 one of the bodies of victims of a lynching at Moore's Ford.
According to the files of the FBI, which received coverage by NBC News, the lynching should participate up to 50 men from Monroe and surrounding counties.
No one, however, has not yet been prosecuted.
Yet, the suspects remain after decades of freedom, the adherents of civil rights claims, that both the reasons for the lynching - politics and sex - were known to all the inhabitants of the city.
In April 1946 acquired on the basis of the decision of the supreme court, the inhabitants of the black skin of the state of Georgia for the first time, the right to participate in elections, which were scheduled for the summer.
And just in the period of the summer of the election had according to the FBI, a farmer of black complexion, Roger Malcom in the scuffle, stabbed the owner of the land, white Barnett Hester - allegedly because of his wife.
In the city, according to Brooks, the rumours that Hester consort with Malcomovou wife, Dorothy, and brought her to another state.
According to the statement, the FBI passed the 25. July 1946, then a significant owner of land, white Loy Harrison for Malcolm bail in the amount of 600 $.
To the prison he was accompanied by Dorothy and cousin Mae Murray and George Dorsey.
When returning from prison, just before entering the bridge, Moore's Ford, they way have a group of suspects.
"As it turned out, the murder planned and organized a Harrison," concluded the FBI.
"It is also clear that there was a secret agreement between the federal, state, and local law enforcement, who not only participated in the lynching, but they got rid of whether or not the evidence and conceal the identity of witnesses."
Brooks is the matter expressed more succinctly.
"It was a massacre due to the electoral law," he said.
"The murder had a clear subtext for all the local residents of the black skin tone: 'what you get if you register and go to vote'."
The annual reconstruction of the events at the bridge of the Moore's Ford organizes for nearly ten years, Cassandra Greene.
Her show is graphic, eye-catching and concise. It shows the deep-rooted racism, which many would like to thought in modern America to be extinct.
Follow this reconstruction is not easy, and even harder to look away, but Greene says it makes sense.
"No one wants to talk about lynching, because when we have to face the unpleasant feelings that are hiding in each of us," said Greene.
"Between us however can't have a relationship, if you listen to what I had to go through."
The main test of this year's renovation began in June and the first day with about 30 actors - a dozen whites, the rest blacks - rushed into the room, where Greene met with a very carefully planned show.
Wade Marbaugh performs the position of assistant director.
For many years he played the leader of the ku klux Klan, but according to his words is the role exhausting.
"I have a bad feeling about this, because it contradicts who I am," he said Marbaugh.
"I think it is very important to this part of history regularly to remind, because in such a time we never want to go back."
Actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, who play the role of Roger Malcom, by extension, Barnett Hester, they are rehearsing their roles.
The show starts an altercation - Malcom arguing with Hesterem and blames him, he slept with his wife.
"Get the fuck off my property n---e!"
Rascona can't.
Occurs to fight.
In that moment, everyone (at least every actor of the black skin) to erupt in laughter.
Greene is laughing most of all.
"What happened?" otáže the Rascona.
Is confused.
Was I too rough?
"No," says Greene cheerfully.
"I just don't think when white people say 'n--r' in such a tone."
"Exactly," blurts out one of the actors black.
"You have to put more emphasis on the R."
The energy in the room is suddenly better; hostility will replace the feeling of alignment.
We all want to make a performance authentic. Only for it to be done to the four victims of the massacre.
Actors scene repeated.
Rascona this time puts the emphasis on the right pronouncing words at N.
Now no one laughs at.
The show ends violently and quickly.
The roar, the shots and the ensuing silence.
A woman dressed in black standing over the bodies of the actors and he sings the mournful song Billie Holidayové "Strange Fruit".
With every word there is in the room to feel sadness.
On the background of all of about a dozen onlookers wipes sweat and tears from his eyes.
In the audience is located practically the same number of blacks and whites.
One couple traveled all the way from new york's Ithaca, a lot of onlookers from the surrounding area.
Each of them tolerates the local humid climate almost eight hours, and Brooks is in a crowd of leads to the graves of Malcolm and Dorsey.
Up to this point could be at a murder seen from a distance, but now, standing in the same place, where there was a lynching, is the atmosphere scary.
With the last words of the song prompts the Greene the crowd of onlookers to inspect the bodies.
Children klekají to the heads of the victims, watching the fake blood and the motionless body and whisper something in my ear.
"They're not dead," has a little boy.
Passes a few minutes, and Greene will thank the audience. It's the end.
The actors cleaned the rope and wipe your tears.
Bradshaw embraces Marbaugha, the man in the suit, who played the leader of the ku klux Klan.
Nick Rascona hugs his two friends-actors and broke down in tears in their arms; finally on him suffering the emotions.
"It's okay," whispers one of the women.
"We know that the role of the abhorrent.
But you had a reason for it.“
Later the same day shall meet the audience along with the actors to dinner.
At one table a young mighty white of a couple eagerly talks about the show with a black couple, who today met.
Denise Duplinskiová hardly were the words that would express her sense of tonight's show.
"It is difficult to listen to the ugly words and looking at those hideous deeds... which are people who look like you and they do it because they look like you," she said of the reconstruction.
"It makes me realize that lynching is still a current topic," she added, "only he says police skirmishes".
On the other side of the room sits Tyrone Brooks in the courtroom. Enjoying dinner and talking about civil rights.
According to his own words I began planning the show for another year.
"The reconstruction of these events is inspiring, since it describes the fear we had to live - however, it is also a moment for reflection," he said.
"If we don't learn, who knows... it could happen again.
People who do not know and do not study the history of their country are doomed to repeat it.“
I love the instructions for use.
One of my friend says that the instruction manuals reads just a coward.
I disagree, on the contrary.
This is one of the modern forms of art, often pure surrealism.
With nostalgia I remember the time long past, where the instructions for use of whatever was rather speciality: phenomenon.
So maybe my first record player contained only one paper, on which were hieroglyphics showing the involvement of some of the components, they all have some secret brand.
When I after years of to go wrong of something inside, I offered the charter of the shaman, who wasn't afraid to unscrew the back plate.
With a grin, advised me what is the paper with a maze of lines suitable.
Yes, it was about who's used an aid in chronic depletion of toilet paper.
Playfully he found an open wire and allowed me to once again listen to the expensive vinyl pancakes.
New times have brought new tutorials.
Even a relatively simple juicer fruit, where you just hold překrojený grep, required about ten images.
Especially hilarious was a sketch with a description of how to insert one part into another.
Kit has two-piece and a different procedure simply was not possible.
To put it the other way round would require a significant effort with the necessity of breaking off some plastic part.
My contempt for the tutorials over at my samohybu brand Seat Leon.
Year of manufacture 2003 still had a book with instructions, minor repairs, among which belonged, inter alia, the replacement of incandescent turn signals.
It was so easy.
A total of three steps and work had to be done.
Unfortunately, the author of the instructions neglected to state that while the bulb on the right went change really just in three steps.
1. take off the cover.
2. remove a broken light bulb and screwed on a new one.
3. nasuň cover.
The bulb on the left had a problem in the form of the location of the battery cover.
At first I thought that inserting the right upper limb into the bowels of the car našmátrám a spring, the screw fixing the cover of the easy displacement and then I'll follow points 1-3 saving the author of the service books.
Make no mistake.
The cover had no place, no space even for a slim little hand Cinderella, let alone obese Slezana.
I lost half an hour of your life, and it's completely without any success.
The condition was compounded by the entry of my wife in the garage, which brought the sound and the words which from my mouth hear the quite exceptionally.
"What are you doing here?" she asked innocently.
My response lasted about 90 seconds, however if I skip the vulgar terms, that left only two publishable words.
I'm changing a light bulb.
"And why is it taking so long?" took a risk phrase, which in the long-term bundle may be her last.
I slowly explained to her the problem, and I am the main emphasis placed on the process of torture of the author of the manual, where požehování a red-hot iron on the hands, which instructions she wrote, then her utětím, so he can never write anything down, it was just an introduction to a wide range of guides of the Hammer on the witches, including his komisionálního burning on the top of Losinským lock.
"What about remove that box?" mean woman removed the battery.
In a fit of despair it happened and then was step 1-3 as well easy and quick, like on the side of right.
I thought that nothing can surprise you.
And the day I called a colleague, who is just regaining kolapsového condition after checking the two clerks of the State service for drug control.
I know him as a colleague balanced, which in the field experienced the possible and impossible and which can interpret even the wild stories nevzrušeným voice.
"Imagine that I got a ticket for it, I have posted instructions on washing hands," he told me in a weak voice.
Gradually I tore the whole problem, which was that above the sink in the bathroom patients have a screenshot guide of how to wash hands.
His argument agency officer that adults wash their hands as a rule, and that needless to pictograms, to handle the accustomed to relegating the activity of the decent people shouldn't have a healing effect and it cost him a lot of money.
"It's not just," she informed him.
Understand that a simple rinsing namydlených the palm of the running water is a primitive act at the level of the cro-magnon man to modern Homo sapiens sapiens, carried out this ceremony in ten steps.
So it is necessary to tell, that it is necessary to let go of the tap water.
The entire process has a total of eleven points, but in the end is the joyful discovery that the person washed his hands exactly as he commands it hosudar of SÚKLu.
In the end I have to say that I left inspired and I'm preparing a detailed plan for the activity in the bathroom.
In the matter of defecation is the procedure of the single, there the problem does not arise, for urination, due to certain differences of both sexes, it will be necessary to put up tutorials two.
The problem remain, they pictograms, as to create the perfect procedure means a precise drawing of all anatomical details, which could arouse the prudish visitor toilets some outrage, despite the fact that he could finally learn that after all the time of my life mopping the corresponding hole completely erroneous procedure.

The latest results of tests to determine the age of asylum applications in Sweden
The latest test results of asylum-seekers in Sweden who have been subjected to a new method of assessing their age show that over 80 percent of the people were interviewed as 18 years or older, but not everyone believes their accuracy.
The Swedish Forensic medical agency (RÃ¤ttsmedicinalverket) began new tests carried out at the beginning of this year.
The aim of the method is a more accurate assessment of the candidates in the context of the assessment of asylum applications. The measure was introduced after the Swedish migration agency (Migrationsverket) criticized for the failure in determining the correct age of some of the refugees, who lied about his age.
To date, forwarded to the Swedish migration agency to investigate the 6880 cases and the Forensic medical agency now released the results of a total of 2481 tests, carried out from mid-march to 31. July 2017.
80 percent (2002) was assessed as over 18 years of age, while in other 25 cases, the Forensic medical agency concluded that the interviewee is "maybe over the age of 18 years".
In a further 423 cases it was decided that the interviewee is "maybe under the age of 18 years".
The tests are accessed only in the case if the age of the interviewee disputed.
According to Johan GÃ¶ranssona of the Forensic medical agency results correspond with the previous month.
"Compared to the previous month, the statistics holds in a rut and the numbers are very similar," said The Local.
A higher number of candidates, whose age was estimated to be 18 years or older does not necessarily mean that asylum seekers are lying about their age.
In may, the agency published the results of 581 tests and stated that in 442 cases, it was found that the "person is 18 years of age or older".
The newspaper Svenska Dagbladet investigated 581 published cases and found that in 243 cases the polled said that the will have this for 18 years.
Criticism came also the medical method of determining age, which includes an x-ray of wisdom teeth and an MRI scan of the knee joints, which were then assessed by the dentist and rentgenologové.
One of the skeptics is Claude Marcus at Karolinska Institute, which deals among other things with assessing the biological maturity of the people to determine the age when the person concerned went through puberty.
"I had a reason to about this issue think and I don't think that these types of measurements to assess the age are correct.
Assessment of biological age in a sense, is very uncertain.
If we can't age to determine with accuracy, we should not pretend otherwise,“ said for the newspaper Metro.
The forensic medical agency Agency's GÃ¶ransson defended the decision by saying: "in General we can say that the risk of an incorrect assessment of the child as an adult is small.
The highest risk is the fact that the person is close to, but below 18 years, which in this case corresponds to 10% of all those surveyed.“
Trump threatened over the phone to the president of Mexico.
American president Donald Trump in a January phone call to the mexican president Enrique Peña Nieto threatened to meet him, if he will publicly say that his country will not pay for the construction of a wall between the US and Mexico.

The wall while he called the least important thing about which we are talking, but politically it is perhaps the most important.

To such conclusion it has forced the exchange of views on the agreement under which Australia will provide asylum středoamerickým refugees in exchange for it, that the United states shall take the person from the detention facilities in the pacific island states.
Trump a deal at first thought was stupid, later at her but walked over.
"You can certainly say that this is not the deal that you created, but you will have to hold her down," said Trump Turnbull.
In certain passages was a telephone conversation with Turnbull almost jovial, for example, when Trump praised as a good idea the australian refusal to accept refugees arriving in boats.

How the financial rules of football will affect the movement Skill to Paris
Rules limiting the financing of european football clubs, does not violate the Neymarův record a transfer from the Spanish of Barcelona to the French Paris-Saint Germain.
Any penalty for Paris Saint-Germain will be implemented organisation EUFA, which oversees european soccer teams and has the authority to prohibit teams to participate in the prestigious champions League.
The rules of financial fair play (FFP) , which introduced by UEFA in 2011, stipulate that PSG will have to prove that Neymarův the transition was financed without large losses.
Barcelona paid the equivalent of 222 million EUROS just to bought out the Skill of his contract, and Neymar will demand a salary in the amount of several tens of millions of dollars a year.
The following are a few of the financial terms Neymarova transfer to France.
Due to the fact that the team of PSG is funded by the rich cathar family, which got rich on the sale of energy, can afford to bring a Skill to the already stellar football family.
Clubs can spend for purchase of players a huge amount, but on the other hand, must prove lawful source of income, which allows them to cover the overhead costs of business activities related to soccer.
FFP led Michel Platini after induction into the chair of director of UEFA in 2007.
Former French player believed that the clubs that are in the hunt for the new reinforcements go into debt, ultimately, they cheat and they risk bankruptcy if the bank or the owners refuse to ensure.
In 2011, shifting the rules of FFP his attention from the club's debt to the monitoring of their losses.
This change meant that the business model, which used Roman Abramovich with Chelsea in 2003 - buy a club with potential and spent exorbitant sums of money for a player y to build a global brand - suddenly wasn't so convenient.
In the framework of the current three-year trial period which ends in 2018, clubs reported a loss in the amount of 30 million EUROS.
And despite the fact that Platini had in 2015 to leave his post, his successor Aleksander Čeferin is committed to advocating a ban on excessive spending.
"The rules of the FFP is still valid and we resolve it in the future to strengthen," said last week for the Associated Press Andrea Traverso, who oversees compliance with the rules of FFP.
Although PSG paid the amount for the redemption of the Skill in a one-off payment, it may, for accounting purposes, the amount of spread on the entire length of the term of the contract.
Neymar signed a five-year contract, so the transfer can be transferred to 44.4 million EUROS annually for a period of five years.
The first wave of the highest sanctions of the FFP hit in 2014, the PSG, along with Manchester City, who owns a group of Abu Dhabi.
PSG took a penalty in the amount of 60 million EUROS (82 million dollars) - which was later reduced to 20 million EUROS - and the command to reduce the squad of the champions League on 21 players in the 2014-2015 season, instead of 25 players.
UEFA looking out for teams that may attempt to circumvent the financial regulators raising their income through companies associated with the owners of the clubs.
Therefore, even if the qatar company is sponsoring the PSG as soon as the financing exceeds the value of the standard market rates, the UEFA has the right to prohibit the bill amount.
Similar measures agreed by UEFA in 2014 having decided that the amount of funding provided by the Qatar Tourism Authority team PSG was too high.
Part Neymarových income in the PSG could be according to some reports, paid from the organizing committee of the world cup 2022 in Qatar.
PSG and representatives of the MS 2022 in Qatar, however, denied the fat, that would Neymat had become an ambassador of the world cup and that such a maneuver would be doers of the UEFA easily uncovered.
Previous sanctions into the PSG mean that UEFA will closely monitor any attempt to circumvent the rules,
According to Tuesday's voiced by insiders of the UEFA has not opened in the matter of transfer of Skill to the PSG no investigation.
The source of this report wished to remain anonymous, because he is not authorized to the situation with the PSG comment, the agency reported The Associated Press.
The last published accounts show that PSG has concluded the 2015-2016 year with a net profit of 10 million EUROS and a turnover of 542,4 million.
Financial statements for the current financial year have not yet been disclosed.
PSG is expected that the arrival of the Skill will be a great opportunity for sponsors, merchandising and the sale of the jerseys.
The club of the signing of the contract promises to increase turnover by up to 30 percent.
The leaders of the Spanish league, obviously concerned with the departure of one of the biggest stars, sought to thwart Neymarova leaving, argumentujíc that PSG breaks the rules of FFP.
"This is a clear case of 'financial doping' of the club and the state," said the president of la liga Javier Need for Spanish newspaper AS, and referring to the ownership of the club PSG katarským syndicate.
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, whose club is owned by american sports tycoon, shares the same position of the La liga on the financing of the club.
"This is a result of the ownership of that from the ground up has changed the football world in the last 15 years," let Wenger hear it on Thursday.
"As soon as the owner of the club happens to happen, everything is possible.
Compliance with the financial fair play rules is very difficult, because the state may have different interests in the participation of such players in your club.“

This iteration of the story is nostalgic for the characters from famous 80. years; as for the dirty 90. summer (when genius David Wain and Michael Showalter have said on the MTV comedy sketch "The State"); and, of course, for the modern period, namely the year 2001, before stars like Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehlerová and Paul Rudd run away to larger projects.
As a cultural artifact it's a light parody and at the same time also the embodiment of our modern facebook era lasting memories.
From the perspective of the franchise but it looks like someone out of breath.
Series "First Day of Camp" it worked surprisingly well - not only because of the absurd humor (an example might be the story of the creation of the talking cans of vegetables, that pronunciation of H. Jon Benjamin).
The authors have deviated from the main funny punchlines - actors of middle age, who play teenage horny kids - and they couldn't do so to make fun of the previous events.
The sequel to "Ten Years Later", in which adults play adults do not press so much on the emotional plane and the satire is at times sporadic, including a parody of the thrillers of the 90. years as a "Hand on the cradle".
At one point the character finds on a pile of junk Apple Powerbook, roller skates, and "a lot of other things from the year 1991".
Many of the main story line is repeated.
Kind-hearted Coop (mr. Showalter), now a writer, is still not over his love for Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) is still a virgin.
Not to mention the crazy plot, which includes Ronald Reagan (also, mr. Showalter), which encourages George H. W. Bush (very well occupied by Michael Ian Black).
As always are the best part of the franchise's many side stories.
Especially fun is to watch the forever young Rudd with long hair, aka the figure of Matt Dillon from the movie Youth, which once was respektuhodná character Andy is now for the old broad.
The franchise could start moments of random madness, such as returning series "Seven Up", until it reaches what I assume to be the logical denouement: "Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later," when in the last scene, the whole group shall, at the premiere of "Years to live".
"Comrade Detective" on Amazon, meanwhile, appeals to a different type of nostalgia: revivalismus the cold war series "the way normal Americans", the film "the Atomic Blonde: Without regret" and even the tv series "GLOW", in which the clash of the icons of east and west wrestling scene.
Comedy creators Brian Gatewooda and Alessandro Tanaka directed by Rhys Thomas has to act as television productions: a drama about two bukurešťských police officers from Romania 80. years of the last century, who are fighting for the truth, and the atheism after the manner of marxism-leninism.
The main role - tenacious Gregor and idealistic Iosefa - starring Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Street, that dub it into English Channing Tatum (executive producer of the series) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
It's an amazing idea.
Unfortunately, but not much more.
Some jokes to laugh (like police officers watching chess on tv - parody on the american football).
The series has derived its voice of many well-known actors - among them Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali, and Chloë Sevigny.
"Comrade Detective" but focus too much on inept propaganda drama - which also includes a killer with a mask of Reagan - and it also looks.
Six long episodes is too lengthy and comedic moments is not enough.
When a shorter length could propaganda satire in "Comrade Detective" work, such as in the scene where Gregor and Iosef repeatedly visited the US Embassy, in whose hall the two fatties devouring hamburgers stacked in a big pile.
A clear message for the imaginary communist audience is the fact that western culture can transform everything in the food and orgies.
Fictional Romanian creators weren't wrong: we are doing so with their own culture, as well as with their.
Russian athletes are the lifting of the ban starts from the IAAF not to have.
The international athletics federation IAAF at the congress in London confirmed the extension of the international ban on launches of Russian competitors due to state-sponsored dopingovém program.
Vote at the scene of the world championship, which will start on Friday, turn out according to expectations very clearly.
For the extension of the ban is supported by 166 delegates, with only 21 votes.
The main reason for rejection is mainly due to the fact that Russia fails to meet all of the requirements for the introduction of the anti-doping system, as has been stated before congress the head of the special investigation group of the IAAF Rune Andersen.
His group recommended that the prohibition of further insisted.
Some of the older doping cases remain unresolved, a number of suspected athletes has not yet been heard and in the country still are working coaches with a ruined reputation.
Fully functional yet it is not even the Russian anti-doping agency RUSADA, which does not meet the standards of the World anti-doping agency.
RUSADA I may, however, under the supervision of foreign experts and the British anti-doping agency conduct the testing.
"Although there has been progress, still need to do a lot of work," said the president of the IAAF Sebastian Coe.
The Russian athletic federation was suspended in November 2015, the Russian athletes so they came, inter alia, of last year's olympic games in Rio de Janeiro.
Despite the prohibition of the upcoming MS attend the 19 Russians, who've previously demonstrated, that they were long time being tested outside the Russian anti-doping system.
At the championship but will not be able to compete in the national colors and in case of victory they won't play the Russian national anthem.
Bank of England holds interest rate at 0.25 %
The bank of England is expected to announce that interest rate will remain unchanged, following the lackluster economic growth and weakening inflation, which choked speculation of a sharp rise.
The bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain "in the background" in connection with the maintenance of interest rates - despite squeezing family budgets.
Policy makers of the monetary policy committee (MPC) of the Bank of England voted six to two to maintain interest rates at 0,25 %. The results of the vote for an increase in interest rates supported by lackluster economic growth, supported by a weak increase.
In its annual inflation report, the bank predicted growth at 1.7 % in 2017, and 1.6 % in 2018 and warned that reducing family budgets will continue. The bank expects that inflation will rise to fall to 3 %.
The bank also indicated that during the next few years should lead to growth due to inflation caused by Brexitem and it also stated that the rent of the property should the financial markets rise more than expected.
Committee members also voted for the withdrawal of part of the mammoth package, whose task was to support the economy, and which was introduced into practice about a year ago as a response to the Brexit.
As a result of the above, should from next February to start the pay Plan of a term financing, which will offer cheap subsidies to the banks, although the Bank of England said that compared to the planned 115 billion £ will now offer about 15 billion less.
Just before the decision, the bank said: "MPC predicts that the gross domestic product (GDP) will in the short term, stagnate together with the pressure on the real incomes of households and the burden of consumption."
On the subject of rates, the bank stated that it will be necessary to "tighten their belts monetary policy" to calm inflation, "at a higher rate" than markets expect.
Markets currently predict the first increase in the third quarter of next year and a further increase in 2020.
However, the bank stressed that any increase will be "gradual" and "limited".
The bank has lowered the forecast growth for this year and next, compared with 1.9 % and 1.7 % of successful predictions in may.
The projected growth in 2018 to the tune of 1.8 % remained unchanged.
After the publication of the estimates has fallen the pound against the dollar and the euro.
The pound fell 0.5% to 1.31 to the dollar and by 0.4 % to 1.11 euros.
The decision on maintaining the current condition came after zklamavší increase of buried hopes on further growth - GDP has stalled at 0.3 % in the second quarter, compared to 0.2 % from the previous three months.
Growth likely to remain at 0.3 % in the third quarter, although towards the end of the year should be according to the statement of the bank to slightly increase.
The latest report on inflation is small consolation for households affected by soaring inflation and a raising of salaries. The bank said that the situation before the surge gets worse.
The report further states that monetary policy "can prevent the" reduction of income in the coming years, but it is expected that wages will "significantly" rise towards the end of the three-year forecast.
Economics should also rise due to the great interest of british goods, thanks to the weak pound, which would offset a lower percentage of consumer spending.
This decision came a year after they were last year in August rates reduced to 0,025 % in response to the shocking vote on the EU referendum, which has caused the decline of the pound.
The bank estimates that the complete unification of prices and the economy will take at least four years.
Before the decision of the banks on the latest rates, many demanded an increase in rates, together with rising inflation, which has developed increasingly greater pressure on the household. Three political figures have demanded in June, increasing to 0.5 %.
Inflation last month fell back to 2.6 % from June's 2.9 %, even though the bank said that such a change was expected, and in the course of the next month should inflation climb again.
The bank said that the excess relative to the 2 % target was "entirely" due to the weak pound.
Andrew Montlake, director of Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: "Due to the recent fall in swap rates it seems that competition in the mortgage market will only rise, once they start lenders compete for contracts with a look at a good view to the end of the year.
The market looks especially good for those who end the existing contract and re-mortgages - in menu are options without fees, as well as low rates, which are gaining in popularity.“
The NHS will prescribe a controversial HIV drug 10 000 patients
Patients will be offered from September access to the 'transformative' treatment for the prevention of HIV on the basis of the decision of the supreme court on funding the drug NHS.
The English National health service (NSH) announced that the pill of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) taken before sex and reduces the risk of infection in high-risk patients by up to 86 percent, will be offered through the health services to approximately 10 000 patients in the context of a three-year trial period.
NSH has agreed to finance a trial period, after the appeal court supported the decision of the supreme court from last year with the statement that the NHS has the financial means to pay for PrEP despite the statement that the drug should be financed by the local authorities.
The decision, which was announced on Thursday, adopted by NHS England from the mouth of ceo Simon Stevens as a 'major intervention', while the National Aids Trust (NAT) decision described as 'the decisive moment'.
Clinic sexual health London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to begin to receive patients. Other clinics will join in October and by April 2018 there will be a full implementation across the whole of England.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is an HIV medicine given before having sex to reduce the risk of HIV disease.
Tests have shown that PrEP significantly reduces the risk of HIV transmission among vulnerable patients.
Application PrEP before sex means in the body of the patient is located a sufficient amount of specific drugs to prevent infection.
These medications can be taken every day or at least two hours before sex.
Among the tested patients include homosexual or bisexual men, transgender people and people with HIV-positive partners, who have successfully left untreated.
The clinic shall designate the eligible participants who sign the consent to participate in the testing, including men, women, transgender people and individuals with a partner whose HIV status is not yet checked by the appropriate treatment.
People living and registered with GP's in the Uk can also sign up at your local clinic sexual health and apply for potential participation in the testing.
The Program costing the taxpayers for the £ 10 million and NHS England have signed this week a contract to distribute the drugs after obtaining the international public tender.
The trial period is designed to gather the clinical evidence and an assessment of the full potential of PrEP, targeting, use and implementation on a large scale.
Simon Stevens added: 'This important intervention should complement and fully utilize the ever expanding and increasingly successful efforts on the prevention of HIV.
This is another milestone in the more than thirty years trying to stop one of the greatest challenges to human health.'
Deborah Gold, chief executive of NAT (National Aids Trust) said: 'We are witnessing a crucial moment in the fight against HIV.
If the PrEP is administered properly and patients at risk, offer the possibility of transformations of the English HIV epidemic.
NSH will offer from September to patients that are at high risk for HIV infection, a new powerful tool that is individually controlled and not subject to having to cajole a partner, which will lead to the improvement of the quality of many lives.
This statement we accept with pleasure.'
Ian Green, the executive director of the Terrence Higgins Trust said: 'the number one Priority must be the rapid deployment of tests in the whole country; we must ensure its availability to each patient.
We now have available drug test PrEP and we are on track to protect more than 10 000 people who are at risk of HIV infection.'
Shadow health minister Sharon Hodgson said: 'the Beginning of the test period PrEP is a welcome and long awaited change, after months of delay and stalling by the government.
Evidence suggests, how transformative can this drug be the as part of our approach to HIV prevention and termination of the transmission of this life-threatening infection.
Subsequent tests will bring us a step closer to a full understanding of the benefits of PrEP.
It is now important to test started as soon as possible in the whole country, and to protect such persons who are exposed to HIV and together so end the spread of HIV in society.'
The high life: a mezzanine and smart design transformed this small flat on Earls Court in a spacious home
Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, traded in 2014 a large house in Knightsbridge for an apartment in Earls Cour.
Located on the first floor of a smart terrace of Queen Anne - and is a vivid example of modern design, which uses the maximum available space.
"Before, I lived with my ex-husband in a much larger house in Knightsbridge," said Joanne.
"I was looking for something for a more reasonable price.
I ran into this apartment in Earls Court and had the same height of the ceiling.
I immediately fell in love with him and the same day I said yes.“
Since then passed an apartment about the size of 1000 square meters, complete renovation.
One-room apartment with a complicated layout - to get to the bedroom, you had to go through the kitchen - she wanted Joanne to add storage space and a mezzanine to take advantage of the high ceiling.
"I wanted a high ceiling, large windows and lots of light.
These were my requirements,“ she said.
For this purpose, employed Erfana Azadiho of design and design studio Duck & Shed is based in Notting Hill and used almost čtyřmetrový the ceiling to create a home that was not merely a project, but also a place to live.
The ceiling did not reach such a height that it is above you get two spaces - a challenge for the architects was to create a mezzanine, on which one could walk erect.
Erfan had to engage their creative thinking.
"The steel structure is quite complicated," he explained.
"We had to both spaces to organize, so that we can walk upright.
It wasn't just to build a simple platform, but at the same time bend the steel structure so as to make the right height above and below the ceiling.“
This arrangement allowed Erfanovi construct two full room to itself - and at the same time add to the drama.
The mezzanine overlooks the gorgeous living room of the old copper window frames in the design of Retrouvius.
Mirror furniture in gold color, silver line and retro chandelier Serge Mouille creates a unique style.
The use of mirrors plays an important role in the dramatic space and lighting.
A short hallway is fitted with mirrors on both sides and looks so long.
Mirror trim in the kitchen looks like a window into another room.
At the front door are storage areas equipped with mirrors for the storage of cutlery and glasses.
The advantage of the living room, the whole apartment gives the impression of a significantly larger space, is the ability to separate it from the kitchen, if it is not used.
Foldable kitchen are nothing new.
However, what is unique to this solution, are the car door.
"We had to solve the technical side," speaks Erfan on reinforced veneered door.
"The door is equipped with a counterweight, in order to odhrnovala very easily."
Thanks to a clever use of space and storage spaces won Joanne the other 16 square meters, the second room and a better overall layout of the apartment.
"When it comes down to it, so that what you sell is a residential area, or valuation of your property," said Erfan.
"A real estate broker in essence, when entering into the apartment calculates the estimate of its price on the basis of residential area."
In this case, managed to increase the living area while maintaining quality materials, which lend the space a luxurious look.
"The material is very important, because it is touching and creates an emotional connection with home," said Erfan.
"You don't get attached to wiring in the walls.
Yes, they are important, but your heart will not receive.“
As it turned out, quality design and an increase in living space can transform an ordinary apartment on an exceptional work of art.
And, like Joanne, even you, eventually, you can decide to stay.
The united states rozpojují.
The cultural and political divide between the states, blue and red deepens.
California has declared a ban on travel of its citizens to the state of Tennessee and seven other states.
The state of Tennessee pay her back and announced a retaliatory ban on the travel of its citizens to California.
Of course, this is not a ban in the full sense of the word, citizens of the united states may, after all fifty states to travel freely.
This is about it, that California has banned the spending of state money on the travel of their citizens in eight other states, which are Alabama, South Dakota, Kansas, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, Tennessee and Texas.
Who will stop this madness?
California is strongly pro LGBT, and any manifestation of disagreement with the lifestyle of the LGBT be deemed to be discrimination.
Tennessee, however, adopted a law on reservation of conscience, according to which a psychotherapist who has a moral problem with therapy patients from the LGBT community, does not have an obligation to them to provide, however, has an obligation to these patients to ensure another therapist, that no such problem.
Texas and other states have adopted laws under which religious charities, which from the mothers were given children after birth for adoption, not have an obligation to these children to adoptions provide stejnopohlavním couples.
Because of these laws on a reservation of conscience California banned the financing of trips of their citizens in eight states of the union out of its funds.
In practice, this means that california's professors may not have the path to the scientific symposium, for example, in Texas to be reimbursed from their universities, because those are co-financed by the state of California.
Similarly, school sports teams can't travel to a tournament or competition for example into Tennessee with the financial support of their schools.
On the road you must obtain either of the federal grants, but it is absurd that the federal government has funded the travel of citizens from state a to state B, or private sponsorship.
Tennessee state ran out of patience and his parliament adopted the law with a resolution to that him too don't like california's policy of high taxes, high government spending, high deficits, and tolerance of illegal immigrants, but still on California because of travel restrictions impose.
Imposes it as a retaliation for the california travel embargo on the Tennessee.
And the same occurs to each state of the union, which would on the other state a similar travel ban ordered for any reason.
At the same time called on the parliaments of all the states, let this madness stop.
That's the facts, now comment.
The situation is toxic.
First of all, all of it is constitutional, nothing is unconstitutional.
States have the right to adopt laws on a reservation of conscience, as well as to decide on what their money will go and what may not.
Secondly, what's wrong with a reservation of conscience?
When is a butcher a religious problem to sell pork, why not offer beef, lamb, poultry and fish?
Why him under the sanctions of the punishment force to sell pork, when butchers offering pork is enough?
In the state of Colorado, one a baker is facing a discrimination lawsuit and a high fine, because he refused to bake a cake for a gay wedding.
Rejects but I also bake cakes for Halloween or containing alcohol.
Why punish him and not let alone and the respective cakes you don't order in hundreds of bakers the other?
Third, the beauty of a federal system is that the constitutional rights of all citizens of the federation are guaranteed, but the individual states can be internal, domestic politics in powers, which are not federal, adjusted according to his, i.e. according to the preferences of its inhabitants.
Then there are the diversity, diversity, diversity.
California may be the California and Texas can be Texas.
But California wants to make California be California and Texas and seven other states were California!
Fourth, members of the LGBT community, once rightly sought tolerance for their lifestyle.
Today, many members of this community governed by the rule of live and let live, which should abide by all reasonable people, but some activists seek not about tolerance towards yourself and others, but extreme intolerance towards others.
According to them no one must ever manifest the moral, religious, or philosophical opposition to the LGBT lifestyle, and if they do so, it has to be criminalized.
The mentality of these activists is totalitarian.
They are the modern enemies of freedom.
Fifth, I don't know the situation in american history where states due to the political issues such a hard time doing, except in the case of a single.
Even in the days of the struggle for the civil rights of blacks, where the North and west were on the side of integration and the South on the side of segregation, states to sanction neuvalovaly.
The only case was 50. years of the 19th. century, the political cause was slavery and it was the war of the North against the South.
Of course nothing like this now does not occur, but the situation is still toxic.
The cultural and political divide between the states of the blue democratic states red republican deepens and the US are mentally internally rozpojují.
Illegal agitation.
Critic of Putin got oily fine.
Russian opposition politician Alexei Navalny was fined 300 thousand rubles for violation of the rules of the campaign before the presidential election, which will take place next year.
Court fine imposed for it, that called on people to attend illegal demonstrations.

Get him a ticket granted for that called people to demonstrations through videos placed on the internet portal YouTube.
The fine is three hundred thousand.
"The later it is deducted from the salary of the judge," joked on twitter critic of the Kremlin.
The Russian electoral commission has recently concluded that Navalny is a presidential election can not participate, because he was previously convicted of embezzlement.
Navalny, who is considered a fighter against corruption, however, the judgment considers it politically motivated.
Fines in the amount of 300 thousand rubles, or 25 thousand rubles court on Thursday ordered also two members of Navalny's electoral team, Leonid Volkovovi and Nikolai Ljaskinovi.
Navalny joined the Russian policy as anti-corruption blogger and gradually the fragmented opposition scene become the dominant personality.
Authorities are trying to funds to navalny's campaign strongly defend.
In February, he was sentenced to a five-year suspended sentence because he stole from a forestry undertaking from kirovles.
In may, a verdict confirmed by the court of appeal.
The judgment is then final, allowing funds to navalny's according to Russian laws preventing the run.
Brothers are fighting for an empire worth over 500 million dollars
The two brothers are now, more than four decades after the founding of the empire to their Italian family, fighting over one of the most expensive victorian real estate worth in excess of $ 500 million.
Former director of Carlton Football Club and the developer of the Colin De Lutis dwells on the estate of Toorak, just three rooms from his younger brother, Paul, who caught up with the dispute about common property and the business assets up to the supreme court.
Paul wanted the family business to leave in 2014, but a sharp dispute is always tried before the supreme court.
Together with his mother Anna own brothers a total of 38 real estate worth more than half a billion dollars. The first shop they bought in 1973 on Smith Street in Collingwoodu.
At this place, founded the family company Westco Jeans, which has grown into a chain of 160 stone shops.
In 1999, she sold the family the entire company in the conversion for $ 85 million.
For money to buy more real estate and a portfolio of family De Lutis now includes offices, building plots of land in Brunswick, and the center of Sorrento, the apartments on the Gold Coast and Mt Buller and business centers in the suburbs.
Paul owns approximately one-third of the assets of the company, while his father Colin, who is, in paul's words, "a major driving force and dominant personality," the family De Lutis, private less than two-thirds of the assets.
Court files stated that Colin owns real estate worth $ 316 million, while Paul manages the property for $ 176 million.
For Paul the problem happened just the division of property and financial resources.
"Colin's proposal was in my eyes greatly in his favor," Paul wrote in an affidavit in court in 2015.
Last Friday, after several unsuccessful attempts at reconciliation, held the first session of the supreme court.
The brothers are now fighting about who will control the existing business - from which Paul, according to his statement, Colin cut himself off.
Colin contradicts the fact that it's not true and accuses Paul of to improper dealing with some of the real estate market.
In a previous sworn statement, Colin said that he believes in the successful resolution of the conflict.
"My Italian origins dictates that the family is the most important of all," he wrote.
The cost of legal standing are up. Hundreds of pages of sworn statements, e-mails and messages from companies including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer are flooding attorneys, including Allan Myers, QC, and the defenders of both sides.
Mrs. De Lutisová and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who ran a dairy bars and treats from the 50. years 20. century and in the 70's. years bought the shop in Brunswick.
With the money raised zastavěním of the property purchased the property in Collingwoodu, where Colin opened the first family business with jeans.
Colin said that when he founded Westco "in the last year of high school, Paul was still small, about 10-year-old boy."
Anna De Lutisová said that, along with Luigi, who died in 2012, had hoped that the transfer of assets to the sons will be after a good.
"Luigi often said that he never wanted his sons to end up in court," she wrote.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke are no longer part of the group of companies of the family De Lutis. Colin said that the Mark was upon his retirement compensated the amount of $ 10 million and Luke the amount of 26 million dollars.
As stated by Paul, Luke and Mark "were not satisfied with the terms of its financial compensation".
Colin has since been holding you back, despite the fact that he's a former member of the board of directors of the club of the AFL, as he stated in his autobiography of the year 2015 Eddie McGuire, well-known television personality and best friend Colin.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul de Lutisovy and their lawyers on Friday.
He answered only Colin via text message, in which he stated that, due to the fact that the dispute is solved before the court, "I have nothing to add".
"It is very sad that my brother Paul decided the whole matter to court," he wrote.
In mid-2016 in one of the statement in court Colin said he tried to adapt to the requirements of his brother.
"Our father would be very displeased if he saw our current situation," he heard and added to the fact that "still hopes for a successful solution".
On Friday, all the hope in sight.
"Our disputes resolved in a speedy time of the court hearing," wrote Colin.

Trump's new chief of staff, plans to limit the president's media diet
Before him have tried many and always failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly's can really do.
If yes, it will be the first.
Portal Politico reported that the new chief of staff in the White House plans to restrict the flow of information to the president of Trump - including coverage in television news - in the hope that it will keep Trump on the surface.
Here is part of the news reporter Josh Dawseye:
"When a new chief of staff of the White House John F. Kelly met the first day in the new role of staff, outlined the key problem Trumpova the White House, which intends to correct: incorrect information, which get the president into the hands of.
Kelly announced to the employees that they must personally approve all information - whether on paper or mluvné the word - because the president can on the basis of the right information to make a better choice.“
Kelly's diagnosis makes actually sense, but many of his predecessors on the control of Trump and its presentation in the media vylámala teeth.
Trump's relationship with the media dates back several decades back - and now, as he sits in the White House, his habit of watching television news is even stronger.
"If it was Trump as a candidate perturbed honest reports, it was fitting to show him that about him in a positive light speaks lots of other media that were easier to convince," said in a February Politico Sam Nunberg, a former campaign adviser.
Tara Palmeriová from the portal Politico then wrote that "the key to maintaining Trumps tweets in check - at least according to the words of six of the former organizers of his campaign - is to ensure that the Trump regularly monitor the media, which to him sing praise."
Good.
However, the idea that Trumpova a tendency to publish their views on Twitter was when "under control", is ridiculous.
Perhaps, these organizers of the campaign knows something the other doesn't know - that Trumpovy tweets would have been more outrageous, if someone is out of control.
About tweets, that Trump never sent, with high probability we'll never know.
If his staff managed to keep him at least a few times at bay, then their effort wasn't in vain.
However, no one has yet been able to regularly prevent Trumpovy, to encourage controversial topics.
Part of the problem lies in the fact that in the White House, which consists of warring factions, people regularly try to strengthen your agenda by Trumpovy podsunují materials - which may or may not be reliable - which support their view of the world.
Portal Politico that the issue covered from all sides, in may published a report about the propensity of advisers to the submission of questionable information to the head of state.
This is an example of such information from the pen of a reporter Shane Goldmacherové:
"Current and former officials of the Trump claim that the president often responds very angrily to negative messages from the media, especially the news about the leak of information, and seeks to find their origin.
This situation occurred at the end of February, when someone slipped the president a copy of the article from GotNews.com - website provocateur Charles C. Johnson - who has accused the deputy chief of staff Katie Walsh from the fact that it is 'the source of many leaks' from the White House.
No matter that Johnson was forever banned from Twitter for harassment; or that their claim did not provide any evidence; or that in the past has posted false accusations and later recanted.
Trump article I read and started to Walsh asking.“
Goldmacher added that the then chief of staff of Reince Priebus and the secretary of the White House, Rob Porter "tried to implement a system for managing and documenting information that president Trump will receive".
Would it work?
Kelly now, three months later trying to enforce the same strategy.
You need to show that it is more effective manager than Priebus, but Trumpova impulsiveness is just not dim and his helpers still vying for power.
These immutable factors of Kelly's mission certainly makes it worse.
Tourists negotiate the ditch and return to the 'millionaires ' row'
A few affluent home owners in the English county of West Midlands is once again getting into quarrels with determined tourists, who are negotiating with the local authorities about the law on re-acquisition of the field for their abodes.
Tourists parked 20 caravans on the field at the flourishing street in the town of Solihull, which has been dubbed the 'millionaires quarter'.
Bringing horses, children and an army of campers, tourists are back after they were banned in may. Survived even the ditch, which was on the site dug on the basis of the regulation authorities in order to prevent their invasion.

Angry residents of the district attacked the administrative council of the city of Solihull with the fact that 'is not able to solve the problem'.
One of the inhabitants, who wished to remain anonymous said: 'Took place on Monday evening after they were moved on the street Bentley Heath, where they threw stones at other people.
The administrative council should be ashamed of their inability to solve the problem.
All the tourists were moved to another place and now they are back.
Last night arrived next, and now he gets probably even more.'
She added that : 'Birmingham management board knows how to solve this problem. To protect the parks uses court orders.
I live at Streetsbrook, and I'm not going to continue to pay taxes until the administrative council with the tourists does not come to grips.'

And this time there's even more and this time they brought with them horses.'

Italians they're beefing up in the fight against the rescue ships NGO with immigrants on board
Italy announced that it will prevent the arrival of rescue ships NGO, which arrive on the coast of Italy with immigrants from the Mediterranean, if the NGO does not sign the new rules regulating their operation.
"If the NGO does not sign the new rules behavior, it will be hard for us to imagine how they could continue in their operations," said interior minister Marco Minniti in an interview with the Turin daily La Stampa.
Minnitiho warning came a day after Italian authorities seized the boat of the German rescue organization Jugend Rettet because of suspected trafficking in human beings, which greatly facilitates illegal immigration.
A rescue organization that works the first year, she rejected the whole thing to comment on because of the accusations of the Italian prosecutor Ambrogia Cartosiose.
"For us it is and always will be the number one priority to save human lives. We therefore regret that we cannot currently operate in the rescue zones,“ said the organization in a statement on social networks.
"All the current allegations, we can comment only after gathering all the information and appreciation of the whole situation."
Italian authorities monitored the ship Iuventa organization Jugend Rettet since October.
Her crew is suspected of being on a ship carrying immigrants that was imparted to them directly by traffickers, and to do it repeatedly.
At least one meeting was held according to the file, the plaintiff claims only 1.3 miles from the coast of Libya. The course of the meeting published by the Italian media.
The crew of the ship is suspected of being violated the law and circumvented the Italian coast guard, which oversees the rescue operations in this area - from a humanitarian enthusiasm, rather than anything else.
The code of conduct establishes the presence of the Italian police officer on board ships, such as Iuventa to monitoring activities.
Only three of the nine non-governmental non-profit organizations, which are involved in the rescue operations, has not yet agreed to abide by the code of: Save The Children, the maltese MOAS and the Spanish Pro-Activa Open Arms.
The latter organization on Thursday said that the new rules are not necessary, but acceptable, since they do not constitute any "material change or an obstacle to" what rescue operations are concerned.
The adoption of a new code of conduct, refusing, for example, and the organization Doctors without borders (MSF), which is the holder of the Nobel prize.
Minniti, meanwhile, let you hear that the sharp drop in immigrants in recent weeks, who go ashore in Italy in the framework of rescue operations, suggests that efforts to increase patrols off the coast of Libya and cooperation with the local mayor has borne fruit.
"In recent days we're starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel," said the minister.
Also revealed plans for further negotiations, which will take place this month with the mayors of Libya on the subject of economic development initiatives, as well as with representatives of Chad, Niger and Mali on the measures to reduce the number of migrants that are leaving these countries in the hope of reaching Europe.

Michelle Carter sentenced for sending text messages pobízejících suicidal Conrad Roy
A woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to imprisonment in the amount of two years for inciting his friend to commit suicide through text messages and telephone calls.
A twenty year-old Michelle Carter he's served 15 months of a two-year sentence behind bars and then spend five years on parole.
Carter was convicted in June of involuntary manslaughter Conrad Roy, who took his own life 13. July 2014.
Roy's father on Thursday he testified at the trial: "the Whole family is devastated.
My son was my best friend.“
Carter was left at liberty until the decision.
She was facing up to 20 years in prison, her lawyers, however, argued that she and Roy have suffered mental illness.
Dressed in red trousers and a cream blouse, Carter stood during the announcement of the judgment on the spot with tears in his eyes, clasped hands, and eyes rotated to the ground.
"Her actions killed Conrad Roy," she told the applicant to the judge.
"End his life to relieve the pain.
Couldn't accept their own responsibility,“ she said.
"Showed no remorse."
The legal representative of Carter, however, said that it was "an unfortunate circumstance, which enormously regrets".
Judge Lawrence Moniz added that "her age or level of maturity or even mental disorder do not have a significant impact on its performance".
The applicant read a statement of Roy's mother Lynn Royové: "there's Not a single day to grieve over the loss of his son.
I want to be proud of me - I take care of his sisters and together we will endure the immense pain that you carry we will carry forever,“ it said in a statement.
Roy's sister Camdyn Royová testified that her "chasing" of consciousness that is never not attend my brother's wedding and will never be auntie to his children.
"The loss of the person I was seeing, from its birth is the pain that you carry for life," she said.
The state of Massachusetts does not have a valid law that would postihoval the person assisting the suicide of a second person. This case constitutes, therefore, a legal precedent.
Carter was 17 years old when he was Roy found in 2014 in the seat of a car, poisoned by carbon dioxide.
The case drew the attention of the entire nation after they were published text messages to Carter, which encourage suicide.
"You need to hang yourself, jump off a building or stab yourself, I don't care," it said in text messages, which Carter sent just two weeks before his death, when he was Roy on a family vacation.
A few minutes before the suicide he wrote: "You have to do Conrad" and "you just need to crank up the generator and you'll be free and happy".
Judge Moniz said that Carter wanted attention through Roy's death and ordered to refrain from any comments in the press.
The case has caused many questions.
One of the people who lined up on the side of Carter's, was Amanda Knox, who was convicted for the murder of her british roommate in Italy in 2007. Two years ago she was exonerated of the charges.
Miss Knox (30) published a statement in the Los Angeles Times: "Michelle Carter deserves understanding and help, not prison."
Audi adjusted up to 850 000 diesel vehicles in response to the fierce backlash
Just a day before the announcement of the Audi car manufacturer BMW said that it will offer its customers a software update in more than 350 000 vehicles.
The chairman of BMW said that the company believes, that "there are more intelligent options than driving restrictions" in response to european cities - including Munich, which is the seat of a BMW - which are considering a ban or restrictions on diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that adjusts to three million cars a Mercedes across Europe to reduce diesel emissions.
None of the companies wouldn't call this decision as a download.
European car manufacturers promote to a large extent the use of diesel atuomobilů in Europe and the United states to comply with the regulation on carbon dioxide emissions.
Nitrogen oxide, which emit diesel engines, however, it is considered a carcinogen and can cause asthma.
At the same time, increasing the burden on the automakers to the installation of equipment to neutralize the gases issued diesel engines, which impedes the competitiveness of the car.
While the German car manufacturers are facing a careful inspection, chancellor Angela Merkel is facing charges of coddling powerful automotive companies and ignoring their problems.
The company is trying to avoid the mistakes of Volkswagen, in an attempt to meet the emission limits installed in their cars software, which in testing reduced the amount of issued emission, but under normal conditions, the software has been deactivated.
Several senior representatives of Volkswagen were accused in the United states and others are being investigated on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month in Germany, arrested the former head of the thermodynamics department of engine development at Audi.
Former manager Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio is of Italian nationality and does not apply to the extradition procedure, may therefore face trial in the United states.
At the beginning of this year, the Audi involved in the criminal investigation of the German police in the affairs of the carmaker Volkswagen after the authorities have accused Audi of installation of the system, which should circumvent the european emission limits - and expanded the charges, which Audi is facing in the US.
The inclusion of the carmaker Audi in the investigation can have a negative impact on Volkswagen: a luxury car manufacturer make up a disproportionate share of the profits of Volkswagen.
The plane crash-landed on the beach.
A man and a girl were killed.
The accident occurred on the beach of Praia de São João in the area of Costa da Caparica, about 30 miles south of Lisbon.
One of the witnesses of the television channel SIC Noticias said that the plane before landing flew just above the people on the beach were sunbathing.
Some people from the beach, allegedly running away from danger into the sea.
Two people sadly in front of the machine to escape failed.
On the beach, according to local media, killed 50-year-old man and a little girl of eight.
"The plane is hit and the place was dead," described the local chief of police Pedro Coelho Dias.
Their nationality is not yet known.
On board were two people, both from the accident got out alive and the police have them taken away for interrogation.
D11 or how not to build a highway.
And there are highways in the Czech republic at all dokončitelné?
I'll give you a riddle.
Is it an unfinished, even when it started to build in 1978.
Although this is an unfinished, constantly this fixes.
And further it shall not build, even if it has a building permit.
What is it?
Yes, hradec králové the motorway D11.
The construction of another of its stretch at least for a few months the newly stopped the movement Children of the Earth.
We východočeši we're getting the freeway in pieces, as if slicing a sausage.
Taken with the wheel and then you'll see, when and if we get another.
While we don't want nothing miraculous.
We just want to shorten the time of travel and we want to get the trucks moving to Poland or from Poland of villages and towns.
Endless streams of trucks going right through the town of Jaromer or Czech republic, which is not how to reasonably go around.
But yet the last leg of our dream highway was put into service in 2008, therefore before the incredible nine years ago.
Since then not a sniff.
Therefore, when it recently began to build the remaining four miles of the unfinished section to Hradec Králové and in other sections of the Jaroměř has begun with the archaeological exploration with the fact that the build starts at the end of this year, you could have in eastern Bohemia to hear the loud banging of earbuds.
I mean no one believed it.
Last week it turned out that the build this year will not be.
And maybe not even next year.
Movement Children of the Earth-Club for sustainable transport from Brno because the submitted decomposition.
Children of the Earth repeated his tactics of the D1.
They challenged the decision on the building permit in its entirety.
In the decomposition of asking for a review of all already issued binding opinions of all the concerned authorities.
For example, the project of the municipality, the ministry of the environment, but also the ministry of defence or the Rail authority.
So far, therefore, from the D11 went down near the village with the telling name Pohřebačka.
So we're, we're just going down the highway and all of a sudden we're standing on the side road and we prefer to be subsequently included in the column.
The worst thing is that similar stories you see across the country.
Scary, constantly clogged the road to Benešov, highway D1 or D8.
Everyone has their Pohřebačku.
What is required by Children of the Earth?
What is the nature of the problems of construction of roads in the Czech republic?
And why is the existing system of highway network virtually nedokončitelná?

Lavender from Provence threatens climate change
Lavender became the symbol of the Provence in the southeast area of France, now however, they are vulnerable to climate change.
Lavender is declining due to dry climate and harmful insects, which raises the dismay on the faces of the researchers and the farmers, who are looking for a solution.
Eric Chaisse, an expert of the agricultural research institute of CRIEPPAM in Provence said: "the Cultivation of lavender in Provence is under threat, because in the past few years was this plant exposed to climate change, which brings about less rainfall in spring and autumn.
It affects the life of lavender.
Guilty to also have cicadas and locusts carrying micro-bacteria, which are in a dry climate to thrive.“
There is much at stake.
Lavender attracts tourists and oil, which of them produced, is an important ingredient of perfumes and cosmetics.
Eric Chaisse said: "Instead of long and beautiful blossoms grow smaller, undeveloped and often weak plants.
The amount of oil obtained from these lavender is, of course, smaller.“
A possible solution may be a more efficient distribution of water and slowing the evaporation of water from the soil, but also spraying lavender protective mixture of clay and water, and breeding more of the species resistant to dry weather.
The murder of journalist highlights the growing threats in Mexico
The staff of the weekly Riodoce meets regularly every Wednesday, to discuss the news about the riots that are taking place in the area of Sinaloa for the participation of organized criminals, corrupt officials and endless drug wars.
Today, however, under the onslaught of recent events, meets mainly for my own safety.
They learn that it is important to change their habits.
Two veteran journalists talk about what would be safer: take your kids with you to the office, to which someone in 2009, attacked with a grenade, or leave them at home.
Security experts have written on the black board three simple words: adversary, neutral, and allies.
Ask journalists to to each word to name names - there is no need for evidence, just use your imagination and premonition.
To choose is from what - drug traffickers, politicians, businessmen and journalists are suspected of taking money from the government or the drug cartels - the catalogue of criminals, whose job it is to cover up criminal behaviour.
The violence continues and the bodies pile up in a pile across the country; journalists among them has been growing constantly: according to the Committee to protect journalists there are at least 25 since the onset of president Enrique Pena nieto's previous to power in December 2012; 589 journalists is under federal protection after the attacks and threats; and in all the seven states of many this year killed seven.
Among them also a co-founder of the periodical Riodioce, editor and inspiration for colleagues, Javier Valdez Cardenas.
"The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and work as a journalist," wrote Valdez in one of his many books about the violence associated with the drug.
His loss is palpable, even if his presence is all-pervading - great photos of Valdez with the inscription "Justice", which shows the middle finger, hanging in the facade of the building; two journalists - Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez - age over 30 years old, have a t-shirt with a photo of Valdez with a smile on his face, glasses on his nose and hat of Panama.
The meeting takes place less than two months after his death; journalists talk about the mutual traumas, nightmares, insomnia and paranoia.
Yet, in 2010 was established the special federal prosecutor's office with the aim to solve cases of journalists, yet according to the observations of the Committee to protect journalists sued the two suspects.
Most of the thousands of murders occurring every year, is associated with the drug trade and organized crime. Murderers of journalists are so very rarely get to court.
Journalists from Riodoce insist that they inform about the violence that is happening in Sinaloa; even though they are the destruction of grief and the said territory is at present very treacherous.
Without information about the killers, and without visions of justice is meeting on the safety of groundless, says Ibarra.
"It is foolish to waste time on such appointments," he adds to it.
"If we don't get more information, you can't trust anyone."
In the morning 15. may left the Valdez headquarters Riodoce in Culiacán, capital of Sinaloa.
He managed to drive a few blocks when his red Toyota Corolla stopped, the two men, who him from the car pulled out and killed him with 12 shots, apparently because of the title of the article - which can be translated as Twelfth river.
The shooters then got into his car and away from the crime scene, it crashed.
Valdez died at the age of 50 years.
He left behind a wife and two adult children.
It seems that in Culiacan rumors spread quickly.
In Valdezově case is, however, suspicious of the silence.
Since last year's arrest of Guzmán and his January extradition to the United states with the Sinaloa became one of the bloodiest battlefields of the country, as rival factions trying to fill the empty space.
Every day in the streets of Sinaloi killed several people and the cemetery is full of jeweled two-storey mausoleums of drug lords, many of which are larger than houses.
Forget for a moment that the word "truce" means that one drug cartel controls the coastal state with valuable ports and important routes, which travel to the United states drugs.
Despite the fact, as well as the fact that Valdez was intimately acquainted with the risks of his employment, Ismail Bojorquez (60), co-founder and director of the Riodoce still obniňuje from the fact that your friend didn't protect.
Believes that his death contributed two errors.
The first was the February release of an interview with Damaso Lopez, the leader of one of the warring drug cartels, which led to war with the sons of Joaquín Guzmán.
A settlement could sons get angry; suspected members of the gang to buy up all copies of the newspaper the moment they landed on the shelves.
The second mistake was nepřinutit Valdez, to leave the country for her own safety after the seizure of other newspapers, in which was published the same story.
Valdez has become a legend in Mexico and abroad, and on his death is seen as an important milestone in the fight mexican criminals against journalists.
He did survive so long and all of his friends and colleagues believed, that will never change.
In the periodical Noroeste, he was practically a veteran, when in 2003 he decided to sell their shares in the value of $ 50 and set up together with five colleagues Riodoce.
In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to run a newspaper and not mention yet the drug trade," said Bojorquez.
Riodoce time gained a good reputation for brave and true news; the newspapers began to flourish.
Reporters love going into the search for problem topics and publish texts without censorship - the reader fascinated to read the stories that no one else dared to publish.
Eight years after the founding of won Riodoce the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot for a report on Latin America.
The same year he won the Valdez award International freedom of the press Committee to protect journalists for its brave coverage of the mexican drug trade.
Valdez openly admitted that he was scared.
"I was afraid for my life," he said when receiving the prize.
Drug trafficking in Sinaloae is a "way of life", said Valdez in October last year in an interview for Rompeviento TV.
"You have to take the role of a journalist - or play dumb.
I don't want to someone asked me: 'What did you do in the face of death... why didn't you say what's going on?'."
Employees Riodoce after the Valdez misses. The man was known for his mocking me and unrefined language. He was a good friend, who likes giving advice and hugs - a teacher who knew how to survive.
Everyone relied on his daily routine.
He always wore his hat.
Often went to the bar El Guayabo across agencies and used to sit at the same table.
Now you ask, caused this routine of his death?
His death also sparked questions about its own assumptions - how do the best at your job and stay alive?
"If they don't like to mess with their wives, children, clean stores, secret landing areas."
"These things were forbidden," said Bojorquez.
The result is a high level of self-censorship and self-preservation.
You have to trust your instincts.
If you feel that something is not right here, hands off.
The trouble is, said the editor of Riodoce Andres Villarreal, that "smell is the sense that can be fooled... and then there was that thing with Javier."
The old rules, according to him, as well as by the other, in Sinaloae is no longer valid - as well as in the states of Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states, which are home to a toxic mix of lucrative smuggling paths, weak governments and corrupt politicians.
The landscape is constantly changing.
In the room where to meet the staff of Riodoce, are not allowed no cell phones; a few days ago was discovered spyware, which bought the government to monitor mexican journalists and activists.
In front of the building two police officers found relief from the forty-degree heat in the shade of a nearby tree.
Were chosen by the state to protect the offices of Riodoce, which are located in a four-storey building in a middle-class neighborhood of Culiacan.
Journalists made fun of it, if these officers do not belong to the 50% law, who are according to the observations of the government corrupt.
It has been several months since the journalists last went to the mountainous areas, which basically controlled by drug cartels.
On this week's program are the three main stories.
The first of them is the murder of the brother of former boxer Julio César Chávez in Sinaloa.
Posvíceno also have to suspicious of government expenditure that took place in the hometown of the governor of the state.
Recently also there have been several abductions in one of the most luxurious restaurants Culiacán, a mere block from the office of the public prosecutor.
No one officially has not announced the identity of the kidnapped people or the circumstances of the abduction, so journalists should beware of when they were going to write about what he knows every resident of the city: that she the restaurant is a favorite destination for drug traffickers and politicians.
One of the journalists reading from the public record, that the restaurant was registered under the name, which is associated with a certain politician, who is a member of the Institutional revolutionary party (PRI), controlling all levels of the political scene for almost the entire last century.
Several of the governors of the PRI was recently accused of corruption in high places.
Villarreal asked the journalists to write about the earlier incident in the restaurant happened, including the incident in which one of the sons of Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzmán escaped the military strike force.
A month ago, would you readers about this topic read in the Valdezově section, which was the best source of information about the abductions.
"Valdez would certainly be the case deciphered," said Villarreal (46), which is also called "El Flaco" for his slender figure.
"For now, all the informants turned their backs."
Valdezova office turned into a storehouse of signs and stickers to protests against the killing of journalists. The staff definitely did not expect that they will become activists on behalf of the press.
Journalist Miriam Ramirez grabbed a few signs and went the following morning to demonstrate in front of the office of the public prosecutor for further journalists.
Salvador Adam disappeared just three days after Valdezově murder in the western part of the state of Michoacán.
It was discovered only a charred body. Authorities claim that on the basis of DNA analysis it is a Adamea.
Activity of journalists is intensifying across the country. Many of them organize protests and doodle on the sidewalks and buildings "SOS printing".
The director of the newspaper Bojorquez's day on a visit to Washington, where they are trying to gain international support and to achieve justice for Valdezově death.
At the meeting with the governor of Sinaloa, which is held the day after the murder, Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities of watching journalists and their murder in the preaching of the truth.
In the meantime, has asked for a transfer to another department out of fear that her anger might endanger its impartiality.
Valdez has repeatedly stated that mexican journalists are "obehnáni" organized crime, corrupt officials and an indifferent public.
In his latest book, "Narco-journalism" wrote, that journalists are dying not only the hands of the drug cartels, but also on the order of politicians and security forces that collaborate with organized crime.
The media supervisory group Articulo 19 accused of more than half of all attacks on journalists, police officers and public officials.
"In Mexico you're going to die because you want to silence," added Ramirez.
Murder obviously work.
No one will ever forget the death of blogger Mary Elizabeth Macíasové, which occurred six years ago at the northern border of Tamaulipas.
Her body was found along with a note allegedly signed by the Zetas cartel: "That's how I ended up because of his reports."
Next to the severed heads lay a keyboard and headphones.
Some affiliates have decided to terminate the activity, such as the newspaper El Norte located in the northern border state of Chihuahua in response to the march murder of the rapporteur Miroslavy Breach.
The others are still ongoing, as well as it did El Manana of Nuevo Laredo after the killing of its director in 2004.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juarez addressed publicly the drug cartels article on the home page entitled "What do you want from us"?
Some journalists have fled from their homes or even across the border.
It's a tough decision.
Find a job in exile is difficult, as well as get rid of the feeling that you're constantly being followed.
And journalists are persecuted and killed, such as in the case of Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered in the year 2015, together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City, three months after escaping from the Veracruze.
For those who decided to stay and not to give up their jobs, is every day big risk.
Ibarra, who wanted to be one poet, admits that writing about drugs scares him.
"Mexico is going to hell, that's why I became a journalist," he said.
It's Friday midnight and the staff of the Riodoce sitting on the sidewalk in front of the office - the latest edition sent to the printer - drinking beer, when all of a sudden starts to ring the phone.
They learn that in a shootout between gang members and police officers near a beach resort in the city of Mazatlán 19 people died.
The war is escalating, just like it promised many of the messages left in this area, the members of the syndicate.
The journalists of this news to be published from a mobile phone on the website Riodoce.
Not a day goes by and the initial headline changes once again.
The sounds of police sirens show to the next firefight.
Bojorquez casts a cursory glance at a police patrol, make sure they're careful.
If you have fear, do not give it any clear.
Under a huge portrait of the fallen co-founder of their periodicals - of which the middle finger is an eloquent slogan for the entire Sinaloa - all employees Riodoce followed his steps.
"How could we even think about leaving," said Bojorquez, "if I am on the same day he was killed Javier, one intern asked to have her sent out into the streets?"
Dinosaurs use camouflage to avoid enemies
At first glance it looks like a statue, no matter how scary.
Researchers have now uncovered the conclusions of the first findings of an amazing creature the size of a rhinoceros, which perfectly preserved the remains - which experts have called the 'Mona Lisa of dinosaurs' - found the canadian miner.
The remains have been preserved in such a high degree that the experts were able to determine reddish-brown color of his scaly skin and said that the dinosaur had a 'troubled past'.
An article in the journal Current Biology, said that this is a 'nejzachovalejšího have not yet found an armored dinosaur, and one of the best species of dinosaur in the world'.
The fossil is a new species of the family Nodosauridae. The dinosaur lived in the Cretaceous period, about 110 to 112 million years ago.
His perfectly preserved condition literally shocked the researchers, who described it by the words 'truly remarkable'.
Armored bíložravec is according to the National Geographic so far the best preserved fossil of its kind.
For finding worth Shawn Funk, a fossil revealed 21. march 2011 when drilling in a mine Suncor Millenium near Alberta, canada.
Ran into something that looked like a foreign object and decided to examine it closer.
The fossil was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.
The researchers spent the next six years working on uncovering the animal from a huge piece of land with a weight of 1100 kg.
After the completion of the work is a dinosaur ready to be unveiled.
'Just a little blind your eyes and you'll believe he's asleep,' said the head of the works of Caleb Brown and naturalist of the museum of the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the animal is exposed to.
'Will surely go down in history history as one of the most beautiful and nejdochovanějších species of dinosaur - the Mona Lisa of dinosaurs.'
Studying his skin, the researchers found that the herbivore - yet, that was covered with armor and resembled a walking tank - very likely faced a serious threat from carnivorous dinosaurs.
Heavily armored dinosaur was using a red and white camouflage to protect against predators and used the masking, which uses many of today's animals.
Experts say that this allowed him to better blend in with their surroundings and avoid enemies. The system of camouflage suggests that he was a favorite food of the larger dinosaurs.
Messages about 110 million years old dinosaurs of the family Nodosauridae first appeared in the newspaper in may. It is currently available for viewing at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.
Researchers gave him the name Borealopelta markmitchelli after the technician of the museum, Mark Mitchell, who together with the team spent more than 7,000 hours of careful hiding out in the fossils.
Thanks to the amazing dochovanému state fossils could dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the patterns and the shape of the scales and armor throughout the body.
Uncovered a method of masking, which is commonly used today, the animals in defence - the upper part of the animal was darker than its lower part.
Although this masking effect is in the nature of normal, the researchers ' findings are surprising, because Borealopeltaova size far exceeds today's animals using the same technique.
It is therefore possible that dinosaur was such an abundance of predators that evolution gave when the survival of the preference to the masking before the confrontation.
Many of the current animals with a cloaking device - for example, a deer, a zebra or an armadillo - they are much smaller and also more vulnerable as prey, suggesting that nosodaurus had to for their survival literally fight.
'Predation huge and heavily armored dinosaur illustrates the dangers which they imagined the predators in the cretaceous period,' said Brown.
Chemical analysis of the organic components contained in the scales also revealed that dinosaur skin was probably reddish-brown coloring.
Researchers continue to study the animal and looking for other facts about his life, including a well-preserved stomach contents, to track down his last meal.
He believes that the dinosaur after death fell into the river and was carried away into the sea, where it sank to the bottom.
In the area of Alberta was at that time the same climate as today's Florida and rivers and oceans are stretched much further inland than it is today.
'This nodosaurus is actually remarkable in that it is completely covered in perfectly preserved scaly skin and at the same time, is preserved in three dimensions and we can see its original size,' said Brown.
'For these reasons, it looks like the animal virtually the same as at the time of the cretaceous.
To its reconstruction do not need to use your imagination; you just have to cut me some slack and it seems as if just sleeping.'
In the cretaceous period the Earth walked through the giant teropodi, carnivorous dinosaurs that traveled on two legs.
Although the king of all dinosaurs - Tyrannosaurus rex - that lived several million years after the Borealopeltaovi, this armored dinosaur could be the favorite prey of his equally fearsome ancestors.
These include Acrocanthosaurus, 11,5 meter long monster with a weight of over 6 tons.
The researchers, whose latest findings were published in the journal Current Biology, believe that the body Borealopelta was washed into the sea after he was mummified in mud.
For finding worth Shawn Funk, a fossil revealed 21. march 2011 when drilling in a mine company Suncor Millenium near Alberta, canada.
According to the museum it is the best preserved of the armored dinosaur in the world, including the skin and the armor, which is also complete from the snout after hip replacement surgery.
The animal attains in average a length of 5 meters and weigh up to 1300 kg.
From his shoulders he protruded two 50 cm spines.
Researchers believe that this herbivore patrolling the territory of present-day Canada, until he was done in the river, which washed into the sea.
His underwater tomb to preserve the body in perfect condition.
The fossil remains of this species are preserved in the also extent, that the armoured plates around the skull still cover the remnants of the skin.
As written by Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, 'finding the steps to the preserved individual can be compared with winning the lottery.
The longer I watch him, the shocking me find seems.
The fossil remains of this species are preserved in the also extent, that the armoured plates around the skull still cover the remnants of the skin.
By his side lies his right front foot with toes pointing up.
Easily I can count the scales on his foot.'
As one activist learned the answer to the question: 'Whose Streets?'
9. August 2014 Brittany Ferrell rocked throughout the body.
The day after she arrived in New York, is a native of St. Louis sat down on the bed in the Airbnb room and was going through posts on Facebook on your phone.
Hit on the contribution of a pupil of the high school.
"The police just shot the 18-year-old boy, whose body still lies on the street," was in it.
Podivila that no one else her this post written, so she closed Facebook and opened a Twitter.
User @TheePharoah her constantly retweetoval posts on the wall.
The Rapper from St. louis. Louis publish on Twitter, your posts about the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old young man shot by a police officer white male in Ferguson, Missouri.
Posted a photo of Brown's body to lie limp on the street, where no one took it after four hours.
"This is crazy," she thought Ferrell.
Death but it wasn't for her and her community is nothing new.
Putting down the phone, to come back to him in the evening, when watching the tweets about the people who gathered on Canfield Drive.
Watch photo of police tape and screaming people. One of the men claimed that it is the victim's father, and in his hand he held a sign with the inscription "Fergusonská police killed my unarmed son"!
Watch live news - one of the police officers stood in front of a group of protesters, holding in the hand a guide and on its other end a barking dog.
In another video he held other officer, as indicated, a gun in his hand, with which he aimed at the crowd and yelled: "I'll kill you All... animals."
"It's not normal," said Ferrell.
"This is not the type of murder to which we have become accustomed and which we can call the normal.
I felt goose bumps all over the body.
"I was angry and I cried."
Immediately booked a return flight and the next day she went home.
After landing at 23:00 to pick up my six-year-old daughter from the father, and she decided that morning to go to Ferguson.
The story of what happened Ferrellové and the city of Ferguson over the next three years, describes the new document "Whose Streets?", which will be released in cinemas 11. August.
It's a story of survival and protest, love and resistance, the strength and resilience narrated from the point of view of the people living in the community, who goes out into the streets, demanding answers.
On the way to Ferguson introduced Ferrell's dialogue with his daughter - dressed in a flower jersey and the same floral headdress - on a topic previously discussed many times already - "experiences with black people".
"Remember how I taught you about how the blacks had to fight for what they believed in?" he recalls in the interview.
"Right now, we're going to Ferguson, because the police killed 18-year-old young man and that's not right."
"The question that I didn't take her with me," she said later Ferrell.
"Today's events are the culmination of... that have occurred in the past.
She had to know and see with your own eyes and grow up in it.
She needed to develop not only in activism and organizing, but also had to know the difference between the different layers of experience with blacks and what we must do to free themselves.
Yet, I'm able to provide her with the conditions in which experience firsthand the racism, do not differ in any way from another black child-women.
I feel that if I had it prior to this experience protect, I just wish her harm.“
After arriving in Ferguson was the first stop of the road South Florissant Road across from the police department, which has become a base of activists, who had expected the words of the police Darren Wilson about his possible involvement in the incident.
Here is Ferrell with his daughter, met with a local entrepreneur, who was preparing for the rest of the meal.
Together they prepared the food in the bags and helped to spread the protestant faith.
In the eyes of the Ferrellové slowly began to give birth to a new type of activism.
"My activism after 9. August turned upside down,“ said Ferrell, adding that while studying at the University of Missouri-St. Louis was president of the association of Minority Student Nurses Assn. and sought the introduction of health care and food in the black communities.
"I didn't have any experience with the organization.
It was natural.“
A few weeks later with Ferrell during an evening demonstration met with later spolurežisérkou document, Sabaah Folayanovou.
Folayan said that he and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar wanted "only to document" the ongoing events.
Ferrell, however, thought: "you're Working on a document or you are trying to find a story that could be used?"
Such type of skepticism seep into the community through the many people, often whites, who wanted to capitalize on the pain and resolve.
As she explained Folayanová in nedáném an interview: "we Heard the voices of people who are born and grow up in Ferguson, are very often neglected and that we were going to change."
Folayanová has already established cooperation with director Damon Davis, who is an acclaimed local artist, who deals with the issue of prisoners on death row.
His participation in the project zainteserovala also Ferrell and along with six other locals that followed a team of "Whose Streets?" in the years following the assassination of Brown.
"In this document, nobody is talking for us, but it is our testimony," Davis said.
"It was important for me - how are these people being represented - because in the same way I'm represented by me."
While the objective of the document was to focus on the experiences Ferrellové - in an attempt to show that the movement "is not about spasitelském leaders, but about the convergence of the community," said Folayanová - it turns out that she is the most open to participation in the filming.
Document "Whose Streets?" then describes the very personal aspect of life Ferrellové, for example, how she fell in love with his wife.
"I felt like I was naked," said Ferrell with a smile on his face at the thought of the first moment when I saw the final version of the document.
"I understand, however, that I could do this job and humanize black people, I have to open."
The story Ferrellové in addition emphasises the role of eccentric black women in the broader aspect of the movement Black Lives Matter.
Two of the three founders of the movement - who created in response to the killing of teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012 on social media campaign under the #BlackLivesMatter - they call themselves weirdos.
"Black kinky women in leadership positions in the final result is worth the preservation movement," said Ferrell, "because we're constantly battling on multiple fronts.
Black kinky women have to bear the brunt of these events.“
Folayanová with this expression agrees and adds that "the movement is in fact supported by black women and a lot of kinky black women."
Insisted, however, that "this is not a mere affirmative matter" and Ferrell is not the main heroine of the document because of their opinions.
"It's just she was the driving force and source of energy," she said.
"that she found herself in the front lines is not a coincidence, because life on these intersections in the skin of black geeky women is dangerous.
The rush of energy you feel even before the screen.“
Meanwhile, back in Ferguson, clearing out the cameras television stations their positions, but the heavy racial ties between the community and the police persist.
Ferrell is serving a two-and-a-half-year-old condition for blocking the highway during the demonstrations.
Socio-political atmosphere in the area which is called home described as "a Mess."
Yet ceaseless in his quest, to which is committed since three years ago, surged into the streets of Ferguson.
"It is our duty to fight for their freedom.
It is our duty to win.
We need to love and support each other.
The only thing we can lose is our chains.“
In the kolin region of the fire box.
The place came dozens of firefighters, helped by a helicopter.
Near Český Brod in the kolin region, between the villages of Bylany and the Liblice, was on fire from 14:00 field covering an area of roughly 15 hectares.
The fire around 15:15 ceased to spread, the fire department declare the third grade a fire alarm from the four possible.
According to a spokesman for firefighters Ladislav Holomčíka helped the fire from the air to extinguish even a helicopter.
At 18:00 firefighters managed to extinguish the fire, the fire caused damage of over 700000 crowns.
With flames on the spot they fought dozens of professional and volunteer firefighters.
The fire occurred due to a technical malfunction in the engine compartment of the combine.
Hasit also helped the helicopter, which in total made six shozů water.
"Instead of intervention, we have handed over to the owner until tomorrow 8:00 it will be a guard unit of voluntary firemen," he said today Holomčík.
And Becoming Resemblance: artist creates portraits using DNA Chelsea Manning
In the middle of one of the rooms of the new york Fridman Gallery is placed several faces of different skin tones - white, black and tawny - suspended from the ceiling on wires. Each of them the spitting image of the previous.
All 30 portraits created artist Heather Dewey-Hagborgová from swabs from the oral cavity and hair, which sent her Chelsea Manning.
Manning your samples sent out of the prison Fort Leavenworth, where the former analyst is serving a 35-year-old penalty for the unauthorized publication of the secret cables on WikiLeaks.
The new exhibition, which was launched 2. August, bears the name And Becoming Resemblance.
It is the result of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborgovou, which combines his experience with technology, computer science and art, and Manning - transsexuálkou and pioneering disidentkou, whose punishment decreased Obama three days prior to his departure from the post of president of the united states.
Algorithmic analysis of the DNA of Manning and the use of 30 portraits to illustrate it, how would a person with this genotype, created the Dewey-Hagborgová trenchant, if not an intellectual comment about the softness of the DNA - as well as about the many ways you can DNA to interpret - and neodmyslitelném determinizmu these interpretations, as well as identity.
Manning, born as Bradley Edward Manning, already from the youth talked about the fact that is considered to be a woman. Doomed was in 2013 on the basis of the twenty charges, including violation of the six espionage laws, computer fraud and theft.
All the photos of her holding the staff of the prison. The public missed only one black and white photo in a lower quality, that Manning, visibly upset, sitting in the driver's seat in the platinum blonde wig, with which it is now associated.
In 2015 still doznívaly positive reaction to the project of Dewey-Hagborgové of the year 2012 Stranger Visions.
In the framework of this project used the Dewey-Hagborgová various forensic items - such as cigarette butts and chewing gum - to create the image of the possible forms of these people.
And just at this time received an e-mail from Paper Magazine.
"Were going to interview with Chelsea Manning in prison and they wanted the article to complement the portrait," she explained Dewey-Hagborgová on the occasion of the opening of the new exhibition.
Visits or photography were not allowed, turned to Chelsea, asking if he would be interested in a DNA portrait.
The artist and her imprisoned muse became friends during the two years through correspondence.
Created even a comic book with the name Suppressed Images, illustrated Shoili Kanungovou, who presented a vision of what would happen, if Chelsea were reprieved, and could be the exhibition to attend in person.
President Obama is actually a few days after the release of the comic asked for the release of Manning, which was after a few excruciating years spent in a military prison in Kansas, a welcome change.
Indeed, it is interesting, that the exhibition takes place just at the time when Donald Trump leads the war with the people, who seek disclosure of governmental information and transgenderovými soldiers, while trying to find new ways to your tweets to encourage resentment in areas that should support.
In answer to the question on this special timing of the Dewey-Hagborgová said that "everything happens for a reason".
Under the statement of the artist on one of the walls of the gallery calls Manning his huge signature (the letter "i" in the surname is the dotted heart) after the end of the"self-factionalism, which is based on gender, race, sexuality and culture".
On the opposite side are the sequence of its mitochondrial DNA - centipede letters C, G, and And recorded in pencil.
The inclusion of the 200 letters (or nucleotides, according to sophisticated scientific vocabulary of the artist) wanted Dewey-Hagborgová illustrate how surprisingly similar, at least after page biological, we all are.
"I hope that people they learn that our genome doesn't matter who we are, and that the genetic data are subjective and everyone can interpret in their way," said Dewey-Hagborgová. The vision is also her job to Spurious Memories from the year 2007 on the theme of the video.
"DNA tells many different stories, this is 30 of them."
The last specimen of the exhibition, located in a separate room, is the only page of the above graphic novels.
Displays Manning, who is emerging on the way of King Kong from prison the United States Disiplinary Barracks with a megaphone in hand.
"As soon as you prevent in the speech, they win," it says.
"Never don't shut up."
"This is a direct transcript from one of the letters," said philadelphia artist.
"When I think about it, it gives me the creeps."
Manning has not yet exhibition personally visited - which was foretold in the comics - but when that happens, you will be greeted in the middle of the room with their masks, their own genomovými portraits, lined up like a mob of protestants.
Which was also the purpose of the exhibition, including almost 160 cm high statue of the Maningové, which are pencil recorded its genetic haplogroup.
"In the past were placed on the walls, but this time I wanted to make them full of the feeling of the crowd," said Dewey-Hagborgová about portraits.
"I wanted to set the impression of a mass movement, which takes the form of Chelsea and frees her."

"In the near future to finish the plan of WADA" - the vice-president of the Russian minister Mutko
Russia's deputy prime minister Vitaly Mutko said that not much time is to implement the remaining criteria of the World anti-doping agency (WADA) and znovuustanovení the Russian anti-doping agency (RUSADA).
"At the present time was already completed part of the criteria of the new plan and RUSADA have already won the right to planning and testing in collaboration with the British anti-doping agency (STOLE).
With regard to this fact was the updated plan for WADA,“ said Mutko on Thursday.
The deputy chairman commented on the second part of the plan of the WADA towards compliance with the code - which describes the criteria for the renewal of RUSADA, which was recently published on the website of the organization.
According to Mutka code does not contain anything, what should Russia be concerned about.
"Everything was announced and everything will be also implemented.
The results will be available to the International olympic committee (IOC) and WADA in the near future,“ he added.
One of these criteria, however, calls for public notification results of the investigation of WADA, which was investigating Richard McLaren, on the alleged sponsoring of doping of Russian athletes from the government.
On this topic Mutko said: "We're doing the investigation, since our anti-doping system clearly failed.
It was taken to all measures.
In our country, however, there were no state programs, and we can't confess to something that never existed.“
Mutkova words confirmed Vitaly Smirnov, director of the Russian independent public anti-doping commission.
In an interview for the Russian RSport Smirnov admitted the problems of the Russian anti-doping officials, but added: "On many occasions we have stated that the report contains controversial attitudes and regulation.
No one plans to accept the message without hesitation,“ concluded Smirnov.
WADA suspected RUSADU of taking out the doping controls in the context of Russia in November 2015 immediately before the doping scandal.
The organization, however, allow the planning and unification of testing under the supervision of international experts and the British anti-doping agency (STOLE) this year in June.
After a visit to the moscow headquarters of the organization in July, the director general of WADA, mr Olivier Niggli said that RUSADA is "on track" to restore validity.
Police charged three people, one is a juvenile.
The police accused the three men of the founding of Wednesday's fire, a rare wooden church in Třinec-Gutech in Frýdek-Místecku.
One of the accused is a juvenile, all three of them are of Czech nationality.
For a criminal offence of general threat to them threatens till 15 years of prison.
Reporters said today the ostrava police director Tomáš Cone.
It was according to him a deliberate crime.
"It's a very fresh matter and police are currently on the theme of the whole affair works," said Cone.
Said, that the police will act on the possible remand of the accused into custody.
For more information, according to the director it is not possible to publish.
"More yet I can't tell, because really things are working the staff of the service of criminal police and investigation and the prosecutor, who supervised," said Cone.
Wooden church of God's body in the Gutech came from 16. century.
He was a valuable monument with many original furnishings and paintings from the first half of the 16th. century.
The material damage will go according to preliminary estimates, in the tens of millions of crowns, but the historical loss is incalculable.
Soon after the fire started to think about the restoration of the church.
Most of the cost should cover the insurance, another cost is ready to share the ministry of culture and the city, it is also preparing a public collection and counts with the contribution of the owner of the relics, so the local parishes.
Similar to the wooden church of st. Catherine of 16. century in the Ostrava-Hrabová also destroyed fifteen years ago fire.
Caused when a fault in the wiring.
In his place was then created an exact copy.
The state counts with the citizens in the defense of the state.
To support their training.
With the financial support for the associations utilized in the defence of the state, with the voluntary marksmanship training or team training of trainers counts the intent of the act on the readiness of citizens to defend the state.
The ministry of defence, which his processing of the received task from the government, from him promises that can increase the physical fitness of the Czechs and their abilities that could then become a take advantage of in crisis situations.
This follows from the proposal that was prepared by the ministry.
If the law was adopted in the future, the state would have incurred to support brannosti of the order of hundreds of millions of crowns.
The basic aim of the proposal is according to its authors, to create an effective system that would help increase the readiness of the inhabitants of the Czech republic to the defence of the state, including the performance of military duty and on a voluntary basis.
The state would, for example, financial or material support associations of radio amateurs, shooters, or dogmen, and would allow to increase the capacity of their members.
In return would receive information about people who are willing, if necessary, come to the country in a time of crisis to help, and about their skills or material equipment.
Available could also be accredited instructors, who would associations and other interested persons to help in training or education.
It counts also with organizing meetings with war veterans or people who have acted heroically.
One of possible variants assumes that would create a new authority that would be in charge of the administration and coordination of the project.
The authors of the draft emphasize that the people's participation should be voluntary and the state would have their abilities used until after the announcement of state of emergency.
"The whole concept must respect the gradual blurring of the previously clear borders between the different types of threats," according to the intent with reference to the danger of so-called hybrid threats.
Ministry officials noted that it is therefore necessary to focus on the support of the widest possible set of capabilities, not only those of the military.
"The basic aim of the project is to create a very wide base, which every citizen will allow to competently respond to situations threatening the sovereignty of the state or the lives, health and property of persons, to protect themselves, or to contribute to the protection of others, and improper behavior neztěžovat performance of the tasks of the armed forces of the Czech republic," states intent.
The adoption of the law would bring considerable financial claims.
Their amount will be according to the ministry depend on the chosen variant.
Office for example, it is assumed the financial support of the projects to prepare citizens to defend the state in up to 100 million crowns.
If it was established the administrative and coordination center, its operation could cost around 60 million crowns per year.
Other money would go to salaries, or to build information system.
The proposal also assumes that would have to expand the scope of the regional military headquarters, which together employ a further 42 soldiers.
Officials of the ministry has previously said that the law should also help to resolve the disagreement of some Czech politicians with the introduction of the European union directive relating to possession of weapons.
Its adoption would allow the gunners, who will be part of the system, to retain some of the weapons, which the directive prohibits.
Startups that can help your company to not become the next Uber
Amy Errettová wanted to measure the degree of satisfaction of the employees of your e-commerce startup, but found no matching survey.
The answers were often inaccurate, unhelpful, or even misleading.
And yet, the promised anonymity of the survey, some employees expressed their distrust in the whole process.
"I was looking for consistency and objectivity," said Errettová, the owner of the e-commerce company hair care, Madison Reed is headquartered in San Francisco, which employs 75 people.
She asked for help from the outside.
The market is constantly discovering new startups from the field of human resources, to help companies with surveys of employee satisfaction.
Creating and licensing software with the specific intention of measuring the employees have the duty to allow startups companies to carry out a quick vote, to target specific teams and demographic groups, it also offers complete anonymity of the employees and a hotline for complaints, and also in some cases allow whistleblowers to bypass the supervisors and contact them directly director.
"On the market there are tools like Strava and Fitbit, which track your health status, but where is the Fitbit for your company?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and ceo of startup Glint based in Reedwood City.
Errettová reported that, thanks to Glintu acquired in three years a greater awareness of what her employees think and feel.
In addition to quick surveys and voting of specific teams offers a Glint of a temperature map of the company and a cursory overview of the groups with the highest number of complaints, as well as an overview of managers with a low rating - which allows the user to work on a remedy.
Companies are beginning to realize that it is necessary to pay attention to the culture of the work environment - for the case of them become the next Uber - which is caught up in a scandal after a former employee posted on his blog post describing the corporate environment and harassment of employees who dare to speak openly.
For startups like the Glint represents the demand for surveys of corporate culture is a lucrative business opportunity.
According to the website let's Talk Payments, which deals with the technical and financial progress, can the value of the global sector controls, regulation and compliance in 2020 exceed 118,8 billion.
Startup Convercent in Denver, in the state of Colorado, which helps companies in preventing and detecting improper conduct, he saw a small surge of interest and activity at the beginning of the year, just before the scandals Uber.
Among the nearly 600 clients Convercentu include Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Recently under their wing, accepted the also Uber.
Like the Glint allows Convercent companies to send customizable "flash" surveys, collect confidential information in real-time and display temperature maps of problem areas.
Also offers an anonymous text hotline, which allows employees to report inappropriate behavior.
If the problem involved the general director, the complaints are sent directly to the board.
"The court of public opinion has empowered regulators," said Patrick Quinlan, founder and executive director of startup Convercent.
If a company is convicted of improper treatment of its employees, or unethical behavior - and acted on-if the regulators - may face costly consequences due to the boycott of customers, the depletion of staff or judicial proceedings, added Quinlan.
Restaurant chain Ruby Tuesday, which employs over 25 000 people across 500 locations, uses Convercent for more than a year to increase the awareness of employees about corporate policies and procedures and ensure an easy way to contact corporate management.
Previously, if you wanted an employee to report any problem, had to trace the phone number or e-mail to company executives, to officially lodge a complaint and hope for a successful resolution.
Often it was a terrifying and unpleasant experience, said James Vitrano, general counsel Ruby Tuesday's, according to which previously didn't exist a reliable way of monitoring the grievances of the staff.
Now, when the company uses the Convercent, is assured by rapid detection and resolution of problems that previously never made it to the managers sitting in offices miles away from a real solution to the complaints - for example, discrimination, harassment or unfair treatment.
"Coming up with a holistic, overall view of the experience of the staff," said Vitrano, who manages a group of companies Ruby Tuesday overseeing the management of risks.
"At the same time we're protecting the shareholders from lawsuits by employees."
The company stopped taking ethics, values and participation of staff lightly in 2002 after the accounting firm Arthur Andersen collapsed after the fall of the company Enron in the matter of abuse of ethical rights of employees, said Quinlan.
But only when "the whole thing shone social media", started the company to realize that in the online world can not simply hide your skeletons in the closet.
"Before people started to use to monitor the ethics of the technology, relied on faith," added Quinlan.
Glint and Convercent offer their software in the form of services, for which the company pays regular fees.
It is the business model and the opportunity, you approve of the brave equity investors, who support both start-ups.
Convercent picked in the framework of its February campaigns from companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital overall $ 10 million, and eventually took the capital in the amount of $47 million.
Glint received in November $ 10 million from Bessemer Venture Partners and throughout the campaign earned $60 million.
These investments are hardly surprising due to the mutual nature of the company, culture and venture capital.
A growing number of research clearly confirms that today's employees expect from their workplace more than ever before.
And in competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, are not the main advantage of high salaries, and interesting projects.

According to experts of the working culture it is important to have data on employee satisfaction.
But the data itself are useless, if the company fails to take the necessary steps.
The reality is that once a company asks for feedback from employees, there can be huge changes.
And if change does not occur quickly - in the worst case at all - may cause disappointment and disinterest of the staff.

"Because as soon as things follow-through, employees will start to ask the question: 'did they Hear me at all?
Are they interested in me?
And if not, then why should it matter to me?'“ "
Company Madison Reed, which now regularly, every month, conducts a survey among employees, can Glintu solve the problem in one day, said Errettová.

And with the outflow of customers goes bankrupt the whole company.“

We are back where we left.
Billionaires is not enough that one same voice in the election as every one plnoletému man in the country.
They want to make decisions directly, and because not everyone is as cheeky as Andrej Babiš, who wants to own the state, they buy the political parties.
The owner of Penta Marek Dospiva, together with other colleagues for the water Martin Burda and Antonin Fryčem sponsoring Robejškovy Realistic.
The second life of the Civic democratic alliance financed by the owner of the insurance company and entrepreneur in real estate Paul Got, that's your side also the chairman of the.
A convicted corrupt and the king of the Czech gambling Ivo Valenta got the Side of the freeholders.
Political movement Agrofert holding, as a project of Andrej Babis nilly named kroměříž mayor Jaroslav Nemec, is a chapter for itself.
Your billionaire recently caught also Mayors.
Is Dalibor Dědek, the owner of the company on the alarm system Jablotron.
In his own words enters into the policy, therefore, to do good.
Entrée in starostenském jersey but the old Man didn't go very well.
"I never had a dream small goals," he said at a press conference.
This means that my goal is to movement, YES the movement Mayors gained in the elections twenty percent.
Some smiled.
Dědkovo slip of the tongue but it is rather significant.
Billionaire Dalibor Dědek is a man of fixed views.
Although he intends to compete for votes of voters in jersey Mayors, continues to support Andrej Babiš.
Old man indeed, the Babis in the last parliamentary elections supported.
"Babiš is not a seasoned speaker and is not ruled by fancy rhetoric of political snakes," wrote about him before the election 2013.
But certainly not into politics because he wanted to personally make amends.
For me Babiš hero will remain.
He is willing to step out of your world, which is under the control of, and do something for all of us.
Shortly after the Mayors introduced as a new backup, declared his admiration for A again.
And he said that he wants to take the Mayors have learned to possible cooperation with Babiš imagine.
Some may appreciate that the Old man does not change his views and stand up for her no matter what jersey I wear.
Others may speculate whether Babiš sent to the Mayors build their crap to someone like that clumsy.
Another may ask whether the head of Jablotronu to be with the boss Agrofertu didn't break up in a bad way in the shop and is looking for another way to its commercial rival to defend.
The first Dědkova public appearances but made just around the Babis.
The old man promised that Mayors will send the campaign to ten million crowns.
And when they say they will need more money, send more.
A few years ago over a similar statement difficult who suspended.
Indeed, the court recognized a crook Zdeněk Bakala before the election in 2010, he spent millions on all sides.
The political division of the security agency of Vít Bárta, TOP 09 and the civic democrats like that together came to nearly thirty million.
But today is a different time.
The law prohibits anyone to a political party gave more than three million.
When Old man enters into politics, could you at least learn the rules of the game.
Maybe you would then have to ask the question, why is politics such a bad reputation.
Your first days in politics, then the Old man crowned the proposal to tax advantage of families investigated children.
People with a higher education qualification with us a month come to roughly fifty thousand.
You basic to less than twenty.
A man with fifty thousand is for the conditions here rich.
The one with twenty of the poor.
In Dědkově vision of society the poor have faithfully paid taxes and the rich are enjoying the benefits from the functioning of the social state in which running is too much do not participate.
Rich is simply need to help to hadn't was living hand to mouth.
Mayors for their new acquisition can mutually congratulate and Like to rub their hands.
The rest of us and thanks to the old Man we can confirm that the billionaires are good people.
Remains then the question of who to vote for.
For me, those who know the rules of the game and want to follow them.
Those who are members and the members of his party nor the citizens and the citizens of the state do not have for their employees and the country for his property.
And finally, those who want to take in the rich country lived well to all people, not just some.

Approaching the eleventh morning session and the players of american football UCLA press on the sideline of the new school playground.
Some of them take their clothes off jerseys and they reveal a sweaty back, an unmistakable sign of the first day of training camp.
For a majority of the members of the team these few minutes of doing nothing supplants the lunch break.
Players enrolled in summer semester they go into the rooms after a three-hour training session to study for final exams, before returning to the Wasserman Football Center at the meeting, which is held in the morning at 6:30.

The players the Bruins would have the hotel occupy starting this week, but Mora recognizes that when the room emptied during the season, it could be a problem.
"The land will be patrolling security service," added Mora.
"The safety is taken care of, but it is not excluded, that someone can rent a room and record our workouts.
With such material well-traded.
The Hotel will fortunately watch a security guard, as well as parking area no. 8.
We use the maximum of their resources.
I believe that all will be well.
Everything is planned out.“

Creating graphic novels: a story about a Castle in England
A small castle Scotney Castle recently played the main role in the music video of the group Squeeze and their refuge in him found also Margaret Thatcher during the ' 70s. and 80. years of the last century.
Scotney, however, was from his cozy place by the river Bewl in the british Kent witnessed 700 years of turbulent history, which inspired the curly-haired Jamie Rhodes of York county - a well-known penchant for historical documents - to create graphic novels.
"Look at the font of man, which is 300 years after his death fascinates me," says Rhodes with a straight face.
"When I hold in my hands a letter, I feel a personal connection."
Graphic novel And the Castle in England documenting the life of families that dwelt in the castle of Scotney from the middle ages to the Eduardovského period. Each story illustrates a different british artist Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
However, this is not the first Rhodes scholars, the book inspired by archives: is also the author of Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories (2014), a collection of inspired documents of the British library - a project which for him was very emotional.
"I am interested in the thumbprint on the letter, written by a double agent in the 70's. years, who worked for Jakobity,“ he said.
"It is the imprint of his thumb!
And letters always smell like smoke, because in those days you had to keep reading to light a candle.
When you get to the letter I smelled it now, 300 years later, it's like I went back in time.
I love the archives!“
For someone who is so fascinated with old papers, there is support from the organization of the National Trust and Arts Council England and the opportunity to dwell nearly four months at the castle almost like a dream. ("To tell you the truth, stay I little longer.")
Rhodes spent time researching a victorian "new" castle, browse through the archives and studying the many treasures and curiosities, such as the head of a hyena on the wall and bottles that have been dumped for centuries in a ditch.
He was walking around the grounds and examined the ruins of the old castle, he spoke with hajnými, gardeners, and sometimes also with artists who worked on illustrations for his book.
In the night "was drinking whiskey and writing".
Confidential history of Scotney is a relatively big unknown, since the organization of the National Trust gained access to documents in 2006 after the death of the last heir, Elizabeth Husseyové.
When Rhodes arrived at the scene about ten years later, the staff started only penetrate into the archives, which Rhodes described the words, as if "the aristocrats many centuries throw up their hands with the words: 'Put it in the attic'."
Diaries, letters from the days of the British empire, map showing possessions: "you Might think that the dispute about the land is boring," said Rhodes, "but I ran into one case where two families dragged on birch.
Cut it out, guys!“
Some of the stories in the book using the castle as a springboard and diving deeper into English history, including the story with the name of The Labourer, which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle, to join the English uprising of 1381.
"I found the record of the rebellion in the castle from the year 1380, which was in a book called the Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex," said Rhodes.
"The English rebellion actually started in this area and it occurred to me that the revolt is a good starting point.
Maybe together in the end somehow connected.“
The other stories are firmly linked with the history of the castle - such as The Priest, which tells the story of the jesuit priests, which harbored darrell's family for seven years during the English reformation.
Or The Smuggler the smuggler of the 18th. century named Arthur Darrell, who allegedly staged his own funeral, when he filled the coffin with stones (which are found several years after after the uncovering of the coffin).
Rhodes favorite family are Darrellovy: "I was Intrigued mankind, - then men were always debt and spending money on things they couldn't afford.
Different generations of the family Darrellů's address that by taking the rich or the old missus - I imagine that it was a handsome gentlemen, who likes hanging head dědičkám.“
With the termination of the stay in the castle searching for Rhodes after other adventures.
Recently returned from a two-week stint in the Finnish wilderness, where I soaked the inspiration for his next book about Elämänmäki, which is a former sanatorium of the early 20th. century, which was swallowed up by nature.
For Scotneyho it is, however, a special place.
"I was sad when I left," he said.
"I thought: 'Now to get the hell back to real life'."

Sex robots are on the rise - should we be on the lookout
Just when it seemed that the year 2017 can not be more bizarre, it will appear on the internet the report on the technological development of sex robots.
Yes.
Sexual robots are currently really popular.
Organization Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) recently issued a statement about the development of sex robots within the next five to ten years.
In the words of a former professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the university of Sheffield and co-founder of the FRR Noel Sharkey is necessary to look at the rise of sex robots really.
Customers can choose the color of the eyes, the shape of the nipples and the appearance of the nails of the robot.
"People think of them they're tightening, but sales are growing and we need to be ready for it, that we will see increasingly," said Sharkey on the occasion of the publication of the report.
Modern sexual aids is changing from a doll to robotic women with silicone skin, which is pleasant to touch warm - of course there is artificial intelligence, which mimics the behavior of a person.
The user can robot "edit" to the image - from the color of the eyes and the shape of the nipples to the appearance and color of the nails.
Very disturbing however, is the fact that many of the robots has its own "personality", which would have disgraced even a Stepford wife.
Modern inflatable dolls have evolved in the robotic women with silicone skin.
Owner of the robot RealBotix can your spare a woman to set different character traits, among them shyness.
And then there is the sexual robot woman Roxxxy Gold company True Companion that comes with pre programmed personalities, including "frigid Farrah", which is characterized by its shy nature and the "wild Wendy" to "adventurous" nature.
"Personality Roxxxy Gold is set to the maximum possible extent to fit your personality," he writes on the website of the company True Companion.
Thus has like, what you like and vice versa.
Even moody, as well as people.
May be tired, talkative, or be "in the mood".
The rise of sex robots is alarming for several reasons - among which not a substitution for real interpersonal relationships. Disturbing are rather inferior female traits and violent cues - e.g. a frigid (read: defiant) Farrah.
Company True Companion for your website similar to that of Roxxxy to vibrator for men.
"When a woman can have a vibrator, why can't a man have a Roxxxy?" it says on the page.
Sexual robots, however, is not simply a fetish or sexual help.
Their formation and almost perfect sophistication indicate something darker and deeply rooted in our culture - the displacement from the ideal or sexual equality towards a desire for engaging sex with an optional premium.
Most men, of course, a robotic woman does not buy and while FRR talking about their growing popularity, the sex-bots still remain on the outskirts of the interests of the general public.
This marginal interest, however, can become a mirror set in the current modern times.
And most people are not weird, or violent until they to nezavdá the pretext of free market.
It is no coincidence that these sophisticated sexual robots appear at a time when women around the world carve out our own rights and in the White house sits a president who is to the address of the women expresses the often very pejoratively.
Nejhrůzostrašnějším aspect of the series the Story of the servant is not what we see - the hanged body and hollowed-out eyes, but rather the reality of these visions.
Book the original Story of the servant represents a step in the right direction, but at present it seems that this is a small step.
Sexual robots have as much as possible resemble real women (albeit with rates of porn stars).
Their creators is constructed so as to be pleasant to the touch and operate on a first glance like a real woman.
However, when it comes to their "personality", the robot can not replace a real woman.
They can't break up with your partner or just walk away.
They have no job, no history. Anything that would encourage their independence or undermine their devotion to his master.
In other words, they seem like decent slaves.

Trumpovo great victory?
Against this is Mitt Romney the epitome of common sense
Concrete sign Trumpovy era has become the political divisions that divide the american electorate and in the micro scale also zpřetrhávají the whole family.
In the period of Christmas and Thanksgiving in the american newspapers was teeming with advice on how to cope with relatives who vote for Trump.
Supposedly we're just waiting for it to allow the nerves.
Less attention is paid, however, to Trump the ability of the family cementing.
I'm talking about because to me this week, she visited in New York, my cousin - a poet and a fan of the left, who lives in Chicago and who in our family for a long time paid for by the republican fool.
She reminded me that solidity in the face of a common enemy can have a strong effect.
Now, with Trump in the White house, suddenly the whole family - including all of the republican siblings, with whom hašteřila about politics for years - on the same page.
During dinner at the family table is a good thing; but it strikes me that in a wider context, it represents a significant risk.
Trump reinforces the left, but the negative effect his presidency has the power to push us all to the right.
If we are talking about "normalization" and Trump, we refer to the terrifying possibility that his antics may one day lose the attractiveness.
However, there are still more long-term scenario in which Trump "normalizes" pravičácké republicans, who, odporujíc his standards, suddenly the epitome of what can be called rational.
In these today with nostalgia in my heart I remember Mitt Romney and his version of crazy negotiations - dog on the roof of the car, the 14% income tax (at least we should have awareness about his tax return) - both of which examples look in comparison with Trump as a very mild misbehavior.
After leaving Trump, it is sufficient to be the subsequent republican candidate at least normal, which will be an immense improvement.
We took advantage of the visit my cousin and we took the kids to Central Park for the largest carousel, which operates the new york parks department - for your three dollars you will not find a better use, unless you need the caffeine.
Horses are majestic, the center roller is covered with a glass fibre - clowns and animals is recorded, and in terror staring at your own shoulders - a completely bleak outlook and cinkavá music, oddly enough, reminds the public transport.
Many a cliché will soon get tired of: the view from high-rise buildings, the skyline is becomes cool, a place to breathe the atmosphere and reality of the city not getting your expectations.
About thirty-five years later I'm still having trouble getting over the fact that Swiss Cottage is not in fact a swiss cheese - not counting a theme pub, Ye Olde Swiss Cottage - but a subway station in London.
The carousel in Central Park, however, raises a remarkably magical experience, and to the extent that it has been great to entertain two two-year-olds, as well as the two mature women.
If I could have the carousel rate, he deserved the maximum points. No one, however, thankfully doesn't ask.
This week I had a similar experience experienced in the store, when I was in the credit card payment was asked about the appreciation of my "experience" on a scale from one to five.
In the cafe on the corner of my street is the same, with the only difference that I can to rating throw in 15% gratuity for what you buy behind the counter.
Not only that, it slows down the otherwise quick sale, but the waitress is thus forced to intrude themselves into the good graces of shoppers, when it is not needed.
The woman in the store with me with a smile apologize, when I reluctantly evaluate my transfer credit cards five stars.

The vet, however, shall take random samples of eggs and chicken meat originating from Belgium, the Netherlands, France, Italy, Germany and Poland, on whose markets appeared troubled brand of insecticide.
Eggs from Belgium was referred to the veterinary administration of the Czech market for the last time in April and eggs from the Netherlands for the last time in may.
Chicken meat from Belgium in the Czech republic last appeared in June.
In the Czech republic but there is a certain amount of chicken meat from the Netherlands.
Fipronil is a substance that is part of the preparations against fleas, lice and ticks.
It must not be used in animals whose meat people consume.
The world health organization considers the preparation as moderately toxic.
Its high doses lead to a feeling of nausea and dizziness.
Riga is beautiful, I will miss him, says the goalie Sedlacek and looking for engagement.
I'd wanted to catch for ten years.
"Maybe someday I'll be back," smiled the 27-year-old Sedláček, who could start the season in the zlín jersey.
It depends on whether the start of the new year gets engagement.
What were the four years that you lived in Latvia?
If I had to evaluate as in school, so for three.
The first year I really fished, I had an experienced goalie.
I was taught to.
The second year I began to catch.
Before the third season, I thought, that will give me more space.
But they brought in a new goalkeeper, with whom I again alternated.
Last year, I assumed that I would be catching all the time.
But during the opening ten matches, we gained five points, so the coaches began to spin.
At the end of any more catch my colleague.
But then it's done.
They wanted him got to play on next season.
What life was like in Riga?
Wonderful.
Is it the little Prague.
Beautiful, european, historic city.
I will miss him.
I have found a girlfriend.
We together the third year, next year we're getting married.
So I brought.
How difficult is the KHL for goalies?
The first ten teams is really high quality.
Then there are teams like us or the Slav against them must your play style change.
The skill is on the other side, so that you have something to replace it.
It means to play a more backward, more of a fight.
In the width field I did not see the problem.
The difference is that the Russians want to play in an empty.
Less shooting, and even when you have a half-empty goal, I prefer to record.
In the Czech republic don't just shoot more.
You got no problem traveling and moving through seven time zones?
If a person doesn't have a family, it's not a problem.
Can in peace sleep.
The Program is mostly done so that you play maybe four games out and then have two days off.
How Latvians perceive your club in the KHL?
As the national team.
The whole Latvia is watching hockey, along with basketball is the national sport.
Cheers all.
Even when things went wrong, went a lot of people.
Help the action of the Dinama in the KHL to the fact that Latvia at this year's world championships almost progressed to the quarter-finals?
KHL is played since 2008 and Dinamo is there from the beginning.
And from the same time began their results at the world cup go up.
In the 2014 olympics in Sochi, fell in the quarter-finals with Canada just 1:2.
This for them was an incredible result.
Thanks to the KHL to get to a higher level.
Still more Latvian players headed to the Czech top league.
In Zlín is pushed through Roberts Bukarts and before signing the contract is Ralfs Freibergs.
How is it that they come here so much?
They are no béčkoví players, are really good quality.
The local teams are looking for cheaper and younger players from abroad, Latvians among them.
This is the natural direction.
KHL starts in three weeks.
Why are you still without an engagement?
Already at the beginning of February, I knew, that in Riga continue I won't.
Thus we began to search for something.
On the table was Sparta.
But due to the fact that the budget is not on the goalkeeper, is not what we agreed.
Then it was a classic.
We talked with different teams, but in the end opted for someone else.
So I train at home in Zlin and I'm going to wait for something to appear.
You're not nervous?
That was four years ago, when I left here and didn't know what will.
The current situation is not the best, on the other hand, I after some time at home.
Something I in the KHL odchytal, so I'll take it otherwise.
The question just is, when and where I sign.
How real is the variant that the new year starts in Zlín?
Anything can happen.
We'll see what happens in a month where everything goes.
Now I can only wait, what the agent will agree.
Do you prefer a contest?
The past season has not been kind to choose from.
So I'm waiting on the phone.
Government drift for Years continues.
In January of this year I'm in the article With due diligence? he wrote, inter alia, about the camp in the Years of the small eagle.
The crux of the problem remains the same, and so I dare to pivotal passages of the article to remind the.
About the camp in Years, talk for many years.
For the reader, who knows exactly what it's about, it's probably best if they look e.g. on the official website of the cultural monuments of the Memorial site years Ago.
There is in the introduction, historical overview, learn that the camp stood two miles east from the village years Ago, that from 8. 8. 1940 served as a labor camp, from 1. 1. 1942 was the camp and from 2. 8. 1942 became a gypsy camp.
In the following text is described the course of life in the camp, including inhuman conditions, until march 1943, when they were first letští prisoners assigned to auschwitz transport.
Day 4. 5. 1943 was the largest transport to the extermination camp transported 370 persons.
In total there were 420.
Very sad history of the immense suffering of human beings, which caused them again to human beings and perverted ideology.
There is no dispute about the fact that it is necessary to have these events constantly remind.
There is no dispute either about the fact that this commemoration should take place at the monument in the place of the suffering of these people.
The problem is elsewhere.
Under socialism, the the camp are somehow a bit forgotten and in the 70's. years of the 20th. century was in the vicinity of and on the part of the former camp built a pig farm.
The history of the camp accidentally discovered in 1992, the American Paul Polansky, in 1995 was in the Years of the unveiled monument.
In the mid-90's. years 20. century promised by the government buyback and demolition of the pig farm, but has not happened so far.
In 1998 the monument was declared a cultural monument and, since 2009, belong to his administration under the Memorial to Lidice.
In July 2013 called on the united nations human rights Committee the Czech republic to a pig farm closed.
So very briefly the facts about the postwar fate of the camp.
Until last autumn the government approved the redemption of the pig farm and decided to be drawn up an expert opinion to determine the prices.
According to the minister of agriculture said after the government pig farm was bought by.
According to the minister of culture, Herman "some sort of numbers there are, but I'd probably thwarted those intentions, if I go with them to the public."
We'll see what will bring an expert opinion.
According to some unofficial estimates, may run to hundreds of millions, according to others the price can reach up to a billion.
So as so that in any case will not be cheap.
And yet only a few hundred metres from the former camp stands a monument, to which adjustments the state has invested in 2010, nearly ten million crowns.
Even if after the whole transaction financed united nations human rights Committee, which apparently is not threatened, it would have been by me as a waste of money.
Which the government has other priorities?
The memorial, a dignified place of worship, stands the will of history, practically in the immediate vicinity of the tragedy, and whoever wants to, can here the memory of the suffering and murdered to bow.
I see no reason why this change!
Let's leave it the way it is, and reverent place let's keep with the utmost care.
Of the trust property, and thus the taxpayers ' money, should the responsible person, in this case the government of the Czech republic, to treat with due diligence.
At least with such, as in his own business!
Of course, the minister of finance and deputy prime minister is not the whole government.
But even so, I perceive from the point of view of the above, the password to the leader of the movement, YES, just as the empty pre-election proclamations.
In may this year I took a ride to look directly at the place.
A very nice driveway, landscaped parking lot, a replica of the wooden camp buildings.
In one exposure, in the second integrated TOILET with running water.
Little natural amphitheater with seating and with views over the own place of worship, which is made of stones placed at a slight slope.
A lot of flowers and wreaths.
All the attributes corresponding to the significance of this site, as is right and proper.
Currently underway on the site of the original camp archaeological research.
It would be wise to consider whether it would not be possible e.g. of the excavated foundation to preserve and in an appropriate manner at least visually accessible.
This direction could strain your efforts to the minister of culture Daniel Herman.
In the event that he succeeds in the government to enforce the redemption of the piggery for the state money, it will be just another unfortunate step in his already problematic tenure as minister of culture.
Red meat, dairy products and chocolate can alleviate the symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)
For your digestive system can be the red meat and dairy products nightmare.
A new study, however, suggests just the opposite: a diet rich in animal protein and dairy products could help relieve the symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease.
Incurable disease that affects up to 1.3 million of the U.S. population and 300 000 patients in the Uk, causing abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
Patients are usually reminded in order to alleviate the symptoms of nepožívali meat and dairy products. Researchers at the university of Washington, however, found that the essential amino acid tryptophan contained in the protein helps build immune cells that support the resistance of the intestines.
The leader of the study dr. Marco Colonna explained that the immune cells protect the intestine and provide the breakdown of harmful microbes from the food.
The number of inflammatory cells is offset by the number of cells, which promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissue.
Once the scales tilt on the side of the inflammation, may occur zánětlivému bowel disease.
In the research, scientists have found the presence of immune cells supporting the body's tolerance in the stomach of mice with specific bacteria.
This bacteria requires the creation of cells in the presence of tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins.
Professor Colonna said: "we have Found a connection between one species of bacteria - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the gut microbiome and the development of cells that support the body's tolerance.
The more tryptophan had a mouse in your diet, the more they had of these immune cells.“
At the same time suggested that if it turns out that the same is also true for humans, then would the combination of bacteria L. reuteri and a diet rich in tryptophan help to develop more tolerant and less inflammatory intestinal environment.
Graduate researcher dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barraganwasová in the study of a certain type of immune cells supporting the body's tolerance appeared that one group of test mice, these cells, while the second group of the same mice kept separately cells lacked.
Derive from the fact that one group of mice has a different intestinal mikrobiom - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi that commonly reside in the gastrointestinal tract.
The intestine of the mice was tested by the method of sequencing DNA and the researchers found six species of bacteria in mice with immune cells that lacked the second group of mice.
Mice, which were bred in a sterile environment and lacked the intestinal mikrobiom - developed, therefore this type of immune cells - has been filed bacteria L. reuteri - and created immune cells.
To understand how bacteria affects the immune system, the researchers grew L. reuteri in the fluid, and then transferred a small amount of liquid - without bacteria - stunted immune cells, which were kept in isolation.
Immune cells evolved in permissive cells.
After removal of the active components of the fluid it turned out that it is a by-product of tryptofanového metabolism known as acid indolyl-3-acetic acid.
When the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the diet of mice, the amount of these cells increased by 50 percent. After halving the dose of tryptophan at the same time fell by half the number of cells.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that people have the same permissive cells such as mice and most of us keeps bacteria L. reuteri in their gastrointestinal tract.
It is not known if the by-products of tryptophan from bacteria L. reuteri cause the development of cells in humans in the same way as in mice, but defects in the genes related with tryptophan have been identified in people with inflammatory bowel disease.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan added: "Each of us should probably strive for the development of these cells, because they control the inflammation of the internal surface of the intestines.
Potentially high level of tryptophan in the presence of bacteria L. reuteri can increase the population of cells.“
José Mourinho considers signing a contract with Nemanjem Matiæ and his transfer to Manchester United for a 'genius'
Manchester United won in his team of "genius" in the form of Nemanja Matiće - at least it thinks Jose Mourinho after the midfielder made his debut in Wednesday's game against the Sampdorii.
Matic, who signed a contract for 40 million pounds, said in the first match by winning 2:1 in Dublin - the last pre-season match before Superpohárem UEFA, where United meet on Tuesday with Real Madrid and impressed in his role of a midfielder alongside Paul Pogby and Andreas Pereira.
However, did not attend the team's pre-season asian tour, Matic shouldn't have form and played only 45 minutes, which is according to the words of Mourinho before the start of next season the Premier League work.

"We will help him to as soon as possible to get into shape ."
As well as Matic and his new teammates Victor Lindelöf and Romelu Lukaku also played the first match at the Aviva Stadium, and Mourinho is starting to slowly shape my eleven for next season.
An independent source reported this week that Mourinho still wants to sign a contract with three other players, but insists that the club has done a "fantastic job" and he brought to the team three of the four most important players.
"I thank the club that helped me get three of the four players," he added.
"Four out of four should they pleased me more, but I recognize that they've done for me maximum."
The challenge the king of chicken cuticles Nice Pears.
He wants a lesson from the Pohlreich!
The mnohoslibný picture began to take shape thanks to the new show on TV Prima Zdeňkova academy.
Pear immediately sniffed a chance.
"Dear Zdeňka, I'd like to get this signed up in your academy the cooking, because, hand on heart, I think from you I can learn a lot," challenged him in a video on the social network.
And because you two have a few years špičkují, he didn't forget Lada riled up this time either.

Their participation in the Pohlreichově the new show seriously.
It's time to move up a level and learn from the master.

Pohlreich but did not comment because he was filming new episodes of his next tv show Yes boss!.
The participation of Pears in the culinary academy responded just Cool with the fact that the whole affair takes as his personal activity that goes beyond the tv.
A great blow was struck by a Pear Pohlreichovi in December 2004, my first cookbook.
During the few days she has sold over 300 thousand units!
The new show, which last night unveiled the Prima at the press conference to the autumn broadcast schedule, is a genuine cooking school.
Pohlreich your students selects from among the spectators and in twelve parts is familiar with the twelve and his cooking techniques.
In the last episode of your show Now boil the head in November 2014 Zdeněk on the back of your t-shirts left nažehlit consisting of a pear.

Prop the White House cost taxpayers thousands of dollars
The decision of the White House to fly with the helicopter the navy on the South Lawn for the occasion of the celebration of the american manufacturing industry, which was held last month, came according to the records of the navy, which issued a weekly TIME for 24 000 $.
Green white helicopter Sikorsky VH-3D, also called Marine One in the presence of the president of the board, was the highlight of the program of the 17. July in the White House, which was a showcase of american design programs.
President Donald Trump, vice president Mike Pence and several high officials of the White House were a showcase of products from all 50 states.
A helicopter from Connecticut was exposed next to the yachts of Maine, the fire truck from Wisconsin and vidlicovitého a forklift from Mississippi.
Military officer, the White House issued a fragmentary order, or FRAGO, and asked about the presence of helicopters less than 36 hours before the landing of the helicopter on the South Lawn in the framework of the "extraordinary" events, indicated records of Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1) - the unit responsible for the management of helicopters.
"I wanted to make sure to have awareness about such an important event," wrote the commander of HMX-1 in the e-mail to his superior, the deputy chief of the navy for aviation the day before the event.
The report indicated that a helicopter arrive on the South Lawn 17. July approximately at 7:00 at the occasion of the show, the beginning of which is scheduled for 15:00 and will remain in place until the complete evacuation of the whole place, which was scheduled between 18:00 and 21:00.
In the e-mail also said that if there is a delay in departure from the White House, will be sent a replacement crew for the return flight due to the regulation of working time.
The original crew remained that night at the scene along with a helicopter and together with them also the unit security personnel.
From the record - which won the weekly newspaper of the TIME - it wasn't apparent if she was finally sent another crew out.
Hatch Act prevents government officials in the use of government property for political purposes.
Records indicate that HMX-1 is investigating possible breaches of this regulation.
"We were wondering if it was a violation of the Hatch Act, and we were assured that everything is in order," wrote the commander.
"Sounds like you've blocked," wrote the deputy commander.
This show "Made in America" was the White House labelled as an official event and the Hatch Act would therefore not apply.
But even the official events have political overtones.
When your participation in the event, the president pushed for health reform, which was going through the senate and spoke about the efforts to rein in government regulation.
The use of air transport equipment, such as Marine One or Air Force One for political purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.
Presidents use them when traveling.
However, their presence is purely for presentation reasons, it is unusual.
Trump ordered the inspection in February after the presidential plane pojíždělo in the background while his first first assembly in the framework of the campaign in Melbourne, Florida. His Twitter account is inundated with complaints about the use of the presidential plane by his predecessors.
"The white House is pleased to showcase 'Made in America', which showcased products from all 50 states, which produced the Americans, from american materials," said deputy press secretary Lindsay Walters.
The crew of the helicopter HMX-1 often train landing in the Washington d.c. area and on the South Lawn, and rehearse the possible arrivals with the president of the United states to the White House with maximum accuracy.
While Trump at the beginning of July in Germany participated in a summit of the G-20, HMX-1 conducted 58 training landing at the White House.
Years on the show Made in America was part of the current training of the crew, said a state official.
Unit the helicopter in the same day logged in under the "neprezidentských support missions" for the next eleven hours.
The white House said that tax payers ' money has not been paid by any other props.
Spokesman for Sikorsky, said that the company was not in any way involved in the negotiations on the exposure of the helicopter on the South Lawn.
HMX-1 does not retain records on the budget for the presidential years and the exact cost in connection with the show is, according to the navy difficult to determine.
According to the ministry of defense is the hourly price for the 2017 fiscal year, reimbursement of DoD for the VH-3D 24 380 $ per flight hour.
The records of the unit state time of 30 minutes from the base of the Marine Corps Air Facility Quantico, Virginia and back.
The white House argues that the actual operating costs of the helicopter are moving significantly below this amount.
"Indicate the cost to taxpayers on the basis of the estimates for reimbursement of expenses is very misleading," she said to Walters.
"These estimates include staff, maintenance and many other hidden costs that are included in the annual costs."
According to a study of RAND from the year 2015 reimbursement of expenses DoD do not include the load on the staff, but include the price of fuel, maintenance and contractual cost.
The then press secretary of the White House Sean Spicer defended the use of helicopters for the purposes of the show.
"The Idea of the show, which takes place this week, is to introduce products produced in the U.S.," said Spicer.
"I am aware that the company Sikorsky, and the state of Connecticut are very proud of the fact that they contribute to the defense of our state and that provide jobs for hundreds, if not thousands of people.
I think, like most Americans, that we are proud of the helicopter and other military equipment, to the manufacture of which is involved in countless american citizens.
This fact is entitled to remind.“
It is not clear if Trump during his rounds on the South Lawn was also look at a helicopter. With certainty we can say only that he sat down behind the wheel of one of the fire trucks.
Back in the White House, Trump addressed the representative of the company Sikorsky, and joked with the media about your own fleet of products.
"Sikorsky I know very well," said the president, "I own three."
A young woman stuck in a swamp near Macha lake, the police get to her, she's walking through.
The girl went to the beach on Sunday around two o'clock in the morning.
Instead of bathing but remained trapped in the marsh.
When she decided to ask the mobile phone for help to a police officer, had in the last 12 percent of the battery.
"For this reason, with it the police soon lost the connection," said police spokesman Ivan Baláková.
On the site, which approximately describe, it took several police patrols, but to find the young woman was not at all easy.
"Some of the officers had to wade through the reed swamp hundreds of feet, than underfoot feel again solid ground," closer to the Baláková.
And it was even missing.
Police officers look under it, from which the direction was based on her cries for help.
"To come here at least on this connection, agreed with her, that will be a loud countdown," said the spokesman.
Police woman found up at a quarter to five in the swamps in the locality Borný.
She was on the verge of physical and mental strength and showed signs of hypothermia.
Therefore, the ambulance moved to ceska hospital.
The connection the old Man is STAN?
From the sought after the bride becomes a whore girl.
It is a little ironic.
My web project hledameslusny.cz like a billionaire the voters basically said that STAN suffers from a deficit of decent people.
And stvrzoval that a politically disparate bunch of more less well-known mayors and independents has for the parliamentary elections, no national program.
Its electoral candidate just after the interview with the Old man becomes a decent man, whether he has any political opinion.
Once this started i Vít Bárta and very nicely it didn't work out.
Your quick on the decent people and personalities, which on the ballots where appropriate, replacing even some of the mayor, which he admitted even Gazdík, in addition, the Old man also being a favorite argument of the boss TENT, that the greatest value of the movement are just politically vetted and experienced mayors, traditionally the most popular politicians, even according to the surveys.
You now quietly relieved, hastily collected an unknown personality.
A total break with the people's party, after which the TENT has changed its logo and slogan, Gazdík explained by the movement wants to waste on candidates of the people's party their identity.
If but the TENT of the identity of the suspect, even then only a few, after the arrival of the old Man ends and the mere game on the identity.
Not only Gazdík has long been defined against, YES, Andrej Babiš, on the first joint press conference but the Old man, which the Babis publicly praise, said as follows: "My goal is to movement YES, I mean movement Mayors won in the upcoming elections, twenty percent."
Hopefully not to confuse the movement.
The old man is a successful businessman and a billionaire it is certainly no coincidence.
Often about politics talking like Babiš, unlike him, but not build their own political brand.
TENT for some time, it's more like a reality show than a real political party and Dědkova hand as if from a demand of the bride even more was a shop girl.
For some time he went to the TENT with the TOP 09, then with the people's party and now for a change looking for decent people.
Hopefully, someone will hear.
Police dogs trained in Bridge flights with the helicopter
Dogs specialized in the search for explosives and search dogs rehearsed today at the lake Bridge overflights by helicopter.
The police dog must not be timid and have of flying fear, said the head of the police dogmen the Ústí nad labem region Petr Tomášek.
Training a police dog takes about two years.
At the Bridge do as adults trained the dogs, those who trained only pass through.
In addition to the standard training, in which we detect in the vicinity of the lake sharp samples of explosives and to search for a lost helper, must have all 12 of the animals get in the helicopter and fly over the lake.
The main purpose of the exercise is to test the dogs in a helicopter.
To immediately it touches down the helicopter, you could go dog work, to not have a problem with the path of the helicopter.
"Lands the chopper, the dog goes and immediately is looking for," said Tomasek.
A dog that is restless or on the way the helicopter is not able to start work straightaway, it is from the training of the disabled.
"Most of them then leave the dog handlers, for example to the garden," said Tomasek.
The police has in the Ústí nad labem region 76 dogs with different specialties.
Dominated by German shepherds, growing in numbers but also shepherds belgian.
The handler takes care of him from a puppy.
"Raising him alone, preparing him for the service that the dog will do for us," said Tomasek.
The animal undergoes repeated veterinary examinations, which can detect any health handicap.
If the dog is healthy and nebázlivý, consists of the first test in 20 months.
"The sharp intervention gets around two and half to three years," said Tomasek.
Length of service in the police depends on the state of health of the dog.
Most often used within eight to ten years.
Live then most often with their handlers.

Since they served the building of state farm.
The work of destruction complete, the owners of the brewery after 1989.
The abandoned complex was devastován and disassembled for building material.
In the year 2007 but she brought new hope in the form of new owners, the architects Joan and Paul Prouzových.

Get to know the plant in one click.
Students with the formation of herbals and ordinary lovers of plants will help a new free app Pl@ntNet.
If they will be interested in what plant I came across on the walk, this app can help them.
All they have to do is plant photograph, and the app itself recognizes, what kind.
The new app, which is available for iOS and Android, was on Tuesday presented representatives of the Centre for ethical and environmental education CEEV in the bratislava Mountain park in the framework of the project the Secret life of the city.
The project involved pupils from the 50 Czech and Slovak schools, who with the teachers in the application database nafotografovali and have added plants from their surroundings.
The newly formed French app is free to download on the website of the Secret life of the city.
The main objective of the French programmers was, that most of the people contributing to the app your images, and thereby to increase the number of plants that the app can recognize.
"The children that will keep the tablet or phone in hand, can go into the woods," said the coordinator of this project Ivana Poláčková.
On the basis of sufficiently high quality photos of the flower, leaf or fruit plants can application in a few seconds to recognize her name, which then in Czech and in Slovak assigns under the photo.
The French in the project the Secret life of the city was enabled to translate the app into Slovak and Czech.

"The French will assess if it's beneficial, and then into the database add," informed Poláčková.
The concerns of GMB on the investment in the factory ' McVitie's in Glasgow
The unions are demanding assurances from the managers of the manufacturer of biscuits ' McVitie's long-term commitment to production in the factory in Glasgow.
The scottish trade union GMB said that the company for the time being silent on a possible investment in a factory in the area of Tollcross.
The factory employs more than 500 employees who manufacture, among other products and biscuits Hobnob and Rich Tea.
The owner of the ' McVitie's, a company Pladis, said that within the few previous years invested into the whole area of more than 5 million pounds.
She added that staff and trade union representatives will be "among the first informed" in the event of changes to the operation of the factory.
In a letter to my contractor the company have expressed the scottish trade unions GMB his concerns that the ' McVitie's "won't get their promises on financing and modernisation of production lines."
The main organizer of the GMB Drew Duffy added: "the Fact that we didn't get clear answers from the project manager regarding the needs of the company and the future investment plan in Tollcross is for our members very disturbing.
Worked here the generation of many families and staff come mostly from the local community and the area of Glasgow, where work in the factory represents a critical pillar of the decent jobs in areas of high unemployment and social separation.
From the point of view of work, salaries and benefits - and despite the outlook on Brexit, rising living costs and falling slow production - needs the eastern part of the Glasgow desperately prosperous manufacturer, what is the ' McVitie's.“
A spokesman for the company Pladis said: "the construction manager at Tollcross received a letter from the GMB only yesterday, and the company will issue as soon as possible statement, because we appreciate the continued commitment to employees and union representatives.
Regular meetings with staff and representatives of the GMB in Tollcross held two months ago, and at this meeting it was openly talking about the many problems.
We spoke with the staff, that as in all societies operating in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic conditions, we evaluate our traffic on a regular basis, which applies to all our operations, so we can continue to compete successfully with others.
Added: "In recent years we have invested 5 million pounds in the area of Tollcross, in particular in the production lines and streamlining operations.
We greatly appreciate the heritage Tollcrossu and the local site and in case of any changes in the operation of the local factories will employees and trade union representatives informed immediately.“
Warned PSG Barcelona about the transfer of Skill three years ago?
La Liga will possibly regret your interest in Marco Verrattiho
Paris Saint-Germain will not relent in your quest to get the Skill on her side after she passed 189 million £, then the amount required for the redemption of the Skill of the treaty, but warned that the French team Barcelona about his record of the raid already three years ago?
This sensational transfer stirred up the water of the summer transfers. Club Ligue 1 is ready to overcome more than double the previous record amount for the transfer of Paul Pogby to Manchester United, who last season paid 89 million £.
After the confirmation and completion of the transfer, Neymar will become the most expensive player in the world and at the same time the highest-paid professional athlete in the world - after tax will be from the team of PSG receive over 500 000 £ per week.
Barcelona is appalled by the way Neymar liberated from his contract, despite the fact that a confidential source confirmed that the club has always tried to Neymarovi to please since his arrival from Santos in 2013.
He was, however, the football world reminded of this three years ago the president of PSG?
When Manchester City in 2014, expressed their interest in Blaise Matuidiho, Nasser Al-Khelaifi warned all the club that should be interested in taking one of the best players to PSG.
"Don't worry, because as soon as someone tries to get one of our players, then we certainly will contact one of their players," said Al-Khelaifi.
"We respect all clubs.
But if trying to get one of our players, they will face the consequences.“
It seems that Barcelona has crossed the imaginary line, when in the summer expressed interest in the midfielder of PSG Marco Verrattiho.
PSG is clearly expressed in the sense that, under any circumstances, shall not permit the departure of the Italian representative. It is therefore possible that Barcelona for their presumptuous conduct now with the departure of Skill swallows the bitter pill.
Who can explain the penalties?
Has the political punishment of a widely comprehensible rules?
Donald Trump's nod to the anti-Russian sanctions.
The day before the U.S. imposed sanctions on venezuelan president Maduro.
And yet a day earlier, Trump wrote that China does nothing with the north Korean threat and that this can't go on.
From dripping with the thought of sanctions as the straw from the shoes.
Those things cannot be put into one bag.
Madurova Venezuela really surged on the path to dictatorship, even totalitarianism.
China is only acting as the us president wished.
Russia is a chapter for itself.
But if all someone wanted to summarize so that even the ordinary voter, american, european or other, understand what is and about what system of rules is based the policy of sanctions, it would be a task almost impossible.
In the sanctions against Russia, president Trump only gets it, what set up already, president Obama, just gave a detailed stamp.
So why such a stir?
Last year, Europe is terrified she will win-if the us elections, Trump, embraces with Putin and withdraw the sanctions.
Terrible idea.
In practice, but it's the other way around.
With Trump, the penalties do not release, but strengthening.
But Europe scares me even more.
The German minister Zypriesová says that Trumpovy sanctions violate international law.
It's like being kosher are only the sanctions approved by the UN security Council?
But then they are not kosher nor anti-Russian EU sanctions.
The head of the European commission Juncker again complains that Trumpovy sanctions threaten EU energy security.
It's like you have to use sanctions only as weak to anyone do not impair?
The ordinary voter in the dark.
Three years heard that the fate of the protiruských of sanctions depends on the implementation of the minsk agreements on ceasefire in Ukraine.
Now learns that the terms of the EU's energy security.
Voter in the dark and more broadly.
On Russia are coming, the sanctions for it, that too mounted where it does not.
China is hubována for it, that is mounted a little.
The venezuelan president is being punished for it, that is building a dictatorship in the borders of their country.
All the sentences or just considerations are its rationality.
But he sees in someone's system, procedure or rules?
Andrej Babiš: The cooperation with Okamurou I'm not thinking.
Andrej Babiš is married, crossing republic with his visionary book, and finalizes the election program.
In addition to the Pardubice region has also finished all the candidates.
According to his words to them will not significantly interfere.
Even agreed, to the moravian-silesian land led the governor and the shadow minister for education YES Ivo Vondrák.
"But if it succeeds, will have to choose whether he wants to be a deputy, or a governor," confirmed his earlier opinion of the Babis.
A lot of representatives and national politicians are upset their thesis that directly elected mayors should manage the towns and cities themselves, just with the managers.
Are you serious?
It wasn't like that.
I am a supporter of direct democracy, we elect directly the president and I believe that we should vote the mayor and the mayors.
In her book, I'm not talking about the interference of the representatives, there can be.
The question is, how many there will be.
During the presentation of your book what I dream Of, if by chance I'm sleeping, I'm on my own ears heard you talked about the abolition of local councils.
I don't remember.
I was talking about the direct election of and reduction of the number of representatives.
New York city with nine million inhabitants, has five districts and 51 representatives.
Prague with 1.2 million citizens has 1171 of representatives.
And primátorce with reproaches, that a few builds and did not prepare large projects, but for her it does not have competence.
The same is true of government in our history, followed just two people, Klaus and Zeman.
Which is not to say that they did it well.
The current prime minister but not running anything, the only moderated the debate.
So it can't work.
Therefore, you want to push through a majoritarian system?
He would be ideal, but it's hard to push for it.
In the program we just change the jednokolovou election to the Senate.
We have also proposed moving the mandate of the ministers and the modification of the rules of procedure of the house, to avoid unnecessary exhibicím members, who have to work mainly in committees and in the committees, not to show off at the meetings of the house of commons.
Certainly it is not true that I want destruovat parliamentary system.
But that's exactly what your opponents fear.
As a dictator you run the government, control of the house to 101 members, cancel the counties and the Senate and through the grateful mayors and mayors take over the whole country.
So it definitely is not.
There's nothing wrong with that, when we debate about the number of members.
French president Macron reported the reduction of the legislature by one-third, while there is one lawgiver 57 thousand Frenchmen, while for us it is based on the 17 thousand Czechs.
Macrona of course no one's accusing of endangering democracy.
Even if in the Czech republic, someone won the election overwhelmingly, we have the mechanisms that would have prevented him from making any dramatic changes.
Allurements for one who has a parliamentary majority, but they are great, just look to Poland or Hungary.
Nothing like that in the case of a movement, YES there is.
We just need a team that will be in the government working for the people, not for their party or resorts.
I don't understand why we couldn't agree on it, that will increase only the salaries of teachers, workers in culture and social services.
Why I was out-voted and have added about 21 percent of the members of GIBS, who now take 60 thousand?
On it, you as the prime minister landed?
The prime minister has to intervene when ministers behave inefficient, confusing the government with the travel agency and for the money the state would like to do as Marian Jurečka, who wanted to buy the forests in Romania and land in Africa.
The ministers in the government do not argue, the contradictions they have to talk outside.
The cabinet has to go finished material, in it there is no place on the coalition splits, the power of the vote and business, there has to decide.
How do you want to have a cohesive team, when ministers behave mainly stranicky?
Over the parties is the constitutional law.
When it came to the crunch, Sobotka said that the coalition agreement does not apply, and set out to Babis from the government.
It can make every prime minister.
But if the personality and has a control ability, similar to the hollow gestures not required.
Measure all the same and all require the perfect performance.
You know, the one you suggested to the minister of finance?
Even don't think about it, we in the government maybe we don't, no one with us doesn't want to cooperate, although i don't know what horrible thing I did.
So much skepticism is not in place.
Mayors have earned the entrepreneur the old Man, who would you like to work together, with the people's party may win wing will pro-George Čunka.
I don't think so.
CSSD leads Lubomír Zaorálek, that a coalition with the YES does not exclude, in the ODS may enforce Václav Klaus jr., who also will not be against.
I'd leave it for the voters.
Deputy prime minister and vice-president YES Richard Brabec said that you have many points in common with the SPD tomio okamura's, for example, in the field of economics.
So okamurovci come into consideration as a coalition partner?
Mr. Brabec claims that it said.
Mr. Okamura has its political history, ran for office as a puppet of Vít Bárta for VV, then solicited from the Dawn of money for my company, there was a coup.
He is of course a distinctive personality.
Of course, somewhat brownish.
If I take his program, so there is a wide involvement of people in the management of the company, direct democracy, I'd agree with that.
To you even ask.
I'm interested in, whether it is for you an acceptable person, who has xenophobic views, speaks at demonstrations to the gallows and wants to withdraw from the EU?
We cooperation with the party of mr System, we do not envisage, I can't imagine it.
It is obvious that he went into politics to her benefit.
And what tacit support of the communists your minority government?
I can't imagine even that, but the voters decide.
It will be a negotiation winner with the second in order, but god knows who will be the winner and who the deuce.
Of course it is important to be able to agree on the programme of the coalition government.
Let's go back to your quest to manage the state like a business.
But the government simply must drive, prime minister Sobotka let everything fester, never decided.
Coalition affairs, as the CEB or the EGAP did not work.
But Sobotka is his puppet, and it was also the reason why he fired me.
Once it did, CEZ dominated the Czech government.
It's incredible that the prime minister brought a resolution written by the management of CEZ, which obliges the minister of finance, as he has a vote at the general meeting of ČEZ.
If you become prime minister, you change the staffing ratios in the supervisory board and replace senior management of ČEZ?
Jesus christ, if I'm prime minister, we'll see.
So far, I'm not.
There's a rumor that CEZ already in your direction send signals.
Good cooperation with the ČSSD would be glad to trade for even better with a YES.
So maybe after the elections again, everything will go away.
I know nothing about it.
I don't have a lobbyist Humble or a Rosebud, I'm a separate entity, and this all moved on.
Just answer the question directly.
If you become the head of the government, you will strive for the exchange of management of ČEZ, the Czech television or Universal health insurance, so institutions that you criticize?
I'd like to CEZ was a transparent company.
Yet over the years what he did, thanks to commissions for traditional political parties.
You just have to trace the statements to mr. Schwarzenberg.
Although the state has in ČEZ majority, never drove it, there was only the number, which is wrong.
For me, it's a trivial matter.
CEZ has to take Dukovany, appreciate them, put them into a subsidiary of the company, arrange financing, do the supply the competition or get koinvestora and to build a new nuclear block.
The concept that the state has to finance and build new nuclear blocks, is absurd.
And the Czech television?
Some of her shows against me lead permanent dedicated campaign, but I don't and I won't have any responsibility of someone to throw away.
But dominate it.
I don't want anyone to dominate.
I'm just saying, that citizens pay for public radio and television charges roughly $ 7.2 billion per year, but actually do not know how these institutions operate.
How is it that they don't know?
The house did approve a report on their management, which has a direct influence on the positions of directors-general of Czech television and Czech Radio.
Look, how those messages are being discussed on the super power pact Sobotka Kalousek, who has always worked.
That is true of both the current parliamentary commission for evasion from investigation files, the lex Babiš.
And Sobotka was so stupid that they let Kalouskem push to have me fired from the government, which jedi'd percent of TOP 09, but the ČSSD is shaved off.
They fear the disruption of their corrupt system, and so talking about the threat to democracy Babiš.
No one is immune.
What do you say to articles describing how to the first deputy chairman of the YES Jaroslav Faltýnek building of power facilities by the handpicked son to the supervisory board of the Heating plants Brno and arranges the related lawyer Květoslavu Hlínovi contract with the city and national firms, such as the Prague transport company and Czech railways?
In that we have a permanent dispute.
I don't like it and several times I blame him.
Faltýnek argues that the aforementioned attorney is working for substantially lower rates and is reliable.
I so did not proceed.
As minister of finance I didn't have anybody.
We, unlike socanů, never had a corruption affair, no Peltu, Kratochvílová, Březinu.
If the us was any hint of cronyism, we immediately got that person fired.
In this respect, I am uncompromising.
If something like that happened, we'll get rid of anyone, it doesn't matter who it was.
