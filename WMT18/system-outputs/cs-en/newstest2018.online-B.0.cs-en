The Civil Rights Movement issued a travel alert for Missouri
The National Association for the Promotion of Colorful People (NAACP) published a warning for colorful people traveling to Missouri on the basis of discriminatory principles of the state and racist attacks.
"The NAACP Travel Statement for Missouri, with effect from August 28, 2017, urges African-American travelers, visitors and residents of Missouri to pay increased attention when traveling across the country due to a series of controversial racially-motivated incidents that are currently occurring across the nation," the statement said.
The NAACP has stated that this step has been taken on the basis of Missouri's current laws that make it more difficult to defend racially motivated acts before a court, as well as the conduct of law enforcement bodies that over-target minorities.
"There is a violation of civil rights.
People are stopped by policemen just because of their skin color, they are attacked or killed, "said President of NAACP for Missouri Rod Capel for Kansas City Star.
"We have accumulated the largest number of complaints so far."
This is the first warning of its kind that the organization has released for the US state.
Among the incidents cited by the organization were racially motivated curses directed against black-skinned students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, a black-skinned man from Tennessee.
Sanders died in disputed circumstances at the beginning of this year after gasoline crossed the state and the police put him in custody without charge of committing a crime.
The travel recommendation also highlights a recent statement by Missouri's State Prosecutor's Office, which states that black-skin drivers have a 75% chance of stopping the police.
"The purpose of travel advice is to alert people and warn their families, friends and co-workers before what might happen in Missouri," Chapel said.
"People must be prepared - they should carry money to pay the bail or warn their relatives that they are going to travel by the state."
According to the current FBI program numbers to report hate crime, there were a dozen cases of hate behavior in Missouri in 2015, bringing the state to sixteenth among all nations.
The travel alert is also a response to the new Missouri law, which makes it more difficult for a company to sue for discrimination in providing accommodation or employment.
The US Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) has issued travel recommendations for Texas and Arizona after countries have passed an immigration law that allows state officials to detain people on the basis of a violation of this law that the ACLU has to improve racial profiling.
Travel recommendations are usually issued by the Foreign Ministry for foreign countries, but lately advocacy groups have resorted to these measures in response to specific laws and trends within the US.
The model was killed by the chef.
Her family, after 12 years, has no peace!
Murdered is Sally Anne Bowman.
The Croydon-born girl was murdered by Chef Mark Dixie in 2005 in the restaurant where she worked, who stabbed her with stab wounds.
Both the victim and the assassin had sex and smoked marijuana, then killed her.
The killer then sat in a nearby café and watched the careful crime investigation of the crime scene.
Dixie, a former chef, was sentenced in 2008 to 34 years in prison for murder and rape by Sally.
He admitted only to the juvenile in court and the lawyer claimed that his client had already found a dead girl lying on the street.
After three years, the police convicted him.
Dixie claimed that Sally and her ex-boyfriend, Lewis Sprotson, were fighting for a fateful night.
The killer said, "He was really upset and after the attack, the girl started screaming."
"Even the taxi driver caught the attention," he said lyingly.
The girl, according to his testimony, had to defend herself, but she could, but in vain.
Lewis had to stab her on the street.
Dixie's version has been proven to lie and accused him.
After confessing, Dixie spoke of his zeal and taste for the girl.
When he dressed her after sex, he felt happy and had to burn marijuana.
Before the incidence, Sally was at her former girlfriend, drinking alcohol and taking cocaine, Dexie said to the police himself.
He said he felt adrenaline.
Sally started screaming for help, so she attacked her from behind and put her hand over her mouth, "added the Mirror Linda.
And after twelve years, the family faced further attacks by vandals destroying her grave.
In the last half year, they have been damaged four times.
There are so cruel people at liberty to dig these graves.
"So our daughter is not there anymore," said the Mirror's mother, the late girl Linda, about the disappearance of the urn with the ashes.
Linda was waiting for the invaders, but they had to always attack when she left the cemetery.
Design vibrators are tens of thousands.
"Czechs are neither prudent nor conservative," says Martin Rage, who runs the Prague boutique Intimity.
In it you will find designer and luxurious erotic aids.
Including those from Czech designer Anna Marešová.
It began inconspicuously about twelve years ago.
Martin Rage and his friends went on a bike tour in Moravia.
One of them did not just bring a bicycle, but also a box full of unusually looking vibrators.
"Different little dolls and dolphins and everything was green and yellow and just completely different," she tells me over lunch.
His friend has decided to work with the German manufacturer of designer erotic aids Fun Factory with a partner, and Martin offered to help with marketing.
When the companion left to pursue another profession, he replaced him.
Today he runs the Intimity boutique in Prague's Benedictine Street where he sells erotic aids in the way luxury handbags or shoes are commonly offered.
And why not?
These are also design items.
Moment, moment, you have fun at lunch, are you saying?
Come on, do not be such Puritans!
It's the Berlin Factory, designed by renowned designer Karim Rashid, for inspiration for the Intimity boutique.
They opened it in 2010, and it was a completely different concept of erotic business than what everyone here is used to.
No hidden covers, all done in a beautiful, decent style, products exhibited more like perfume.
Martin and his business partner, Zdeněk Šebelka, began to think about how to hold Prague's business where he should be and what he should be called.
The name of Intimacy was good for both.
"It's related to intimacy, and it is, it can be said gentle," he says.
It followed the purchase of the Internet domain and the search for a suitable space that was parallel to the various visualizations of the interior.
Eventually, the variant that had spread the shop into the garden of pleasure and the bedroom dominated by the bed prevailed.
Dagmar Stepanova from the FormaFatal studio prepared it for us.
We found space in 2013.
At first we did not find it perfectly ideal because it was not on the main street, but it was again the name of Intimity.
She is intimate.
He is in the alley next to the main one, so no one buys customers, "says Martin Rage.
We wanted to be first.
We wanted to make a deal that will be different, with branded goods, in an environment where women, who are mostly our customers, feel good.
And not to be ashamed of having entered such a trade at all.
When I entered the Intimity boutique half an hour ago, the streets were empty.
Besides, I did not even feel like going to a shop with erotic aids.
Just outside the door I was surprised by the pure elegance of the interior that I know from fashion boutiques.
Even if there is only a female operator in the store, so that women do not hesitate to ask for help, it does not mean that the male leg does not come here.
Mostly, gentlemen go shopping for gifts for their girlfriends.
"Men usually can not guess the right size and choose more," Martin smiles over a frequent mistake.
These are such prejudices, the clichés that women need some great aids, and that's not true.
So a good-faith man chooses an unnecessarily big vibrator.
Likewise, men choose mostly black underwear, while the woman usually tends to be more pink.
The absolute bestseller is currently the product Satisfyer.
From the expression in my face it must be clear that I do not know who is beating, because Martin immediately explains how it works.
It is such a proximity stimulator of the clitoris.
I have the adolescent's need to chuckle with admiration for the grave tone of my interpretation.
It does not seem like it.
And it does not really go wrong.
It is good value and has perfect user references.
We did not believe he would be so well received.
This is the latest revolutionary novelty.
The first revolution was caused by a sea horse vibrator.
He took care that women became more interested in designing such products.
The second was the We-Vibe Vibrator.
It has completely destroyed the taboos that may persist in some men and the fact that they see competition in erotic aids.
"Various variants are being done," he continues.
Single engine, two-stroke, with remote control.
This is a favorite category.
In a love affair, a woman can have a driver in her hand and determine the intensity of the vibrations.
On the contrary, a certain dropper is a category of stunning vibrators.
At least then with us.
Czech women seem to prefer multi-purpose aids and buy classic vibrators, although they are only used externally.
At the same time, it is very popular in western Europe, especially younger customers.
What about men?
It's hard to tell if a similar concept would work exclusively for men.
It might have to be a little different.
The question is what to offer men, "Martin thinks.
"We also have tools for them, but to a limited extent." The masturbator is the most sold, in this case the Tenga manufacturer.
It does not look like an anatomical imitation of the vagina, but "rather like a shower gel or as an egg or futuristic object.
Much focuses on functionality and user experience.
In Japan, it is completely different.
It makes me wonder.
I thought the Japanese would take a lot of erotic aids, I say.
"This is the Internet reality," I am told.
Everyday is completely different.
Here in Europe, erotic aids are more associated with being used by women.
In Japan, they are absolutely normal for men, and instead they are taboo for women. "Just for the sake of interest - what the Japanese Tenga brand, which is represented in the boutique Intimity represented, sells around the world, still accounts for about half of what is sold in Japan.
In our waters
The Czechs and the Czechs are not very friendly.
On the contrary, we are quite a friendly nation.
Definitely unlike countries such as Catholic Poland or Italy.
A typical client of the store ranges between 35 and 50 years and "already has some experience with both sex life and some help.
He will come for something nice, better to complement his partner life or for himself. "Martin Rage and his business partner, Zdeněk Šebelka, look after returning to make sure they are perfectly functional for each product.
We also do not want to go to boned and latex specialties, because we do not have room for it, on the one hand.
Such things could discourage those we are trying to target.
Which are the people who always had shy to go to the sex shop because they feared they would see something like that.
Lots of shelf products are really appealing.
It is also given by selecting reputed brands.
Some have even won design prizes, including the Red Dot Design Award.
The first ever prize winner was the seahorse "and this has triggered a change across the industry.
It began to drop out of cheap materials and work with health-conscious, began to produce other designs, different colors ...
Pleasant is that the design of some is Czech, popular designer Anna Marešová.
I have to say that I was quite surprised how many people buy the designer stuff Whoop.de.doo from Anna Marešová, although they are relatively more expensive.
There are customers who go directly to Venus's balls by Anna Marešová.
She did a really big job by presenting exactly what we are trying to present in the Czech Republic and abroad - that erotic aids can be done differently, nicely, with a story.
Annin's story began as school work.
Now it is a finished product, which is produced in our country.
I wanted to have the production process under control and also wanted to know what materials and how Whoop.de.doo products are produced.
Because it's not big-size but a small series, it's certainly more expensive than a big series.
Maybe I'm going a bit against the current, but it seems important to keep the development in our country in the Czech Republic.
It may well be that in a few years we will no longer be able to produce anything, "she describes later with Anna, who agrees with Martin that our company is becoming more open.
There is no encounter with a negative or a negative attitude.
At most people are embarrassed.
"But even you will start to smile." Currently, Anna Marešová offers a vibrator for you to make a personal message, and this year she also plans her own lubrication gel.
In the next year, vibrating eggs and other news should be added.
The limits of healthy sex
I wonder where the boundaries of what's right lie.
Is there something Martin Rage did not sell?
It's terribly difficult to define.
What happens to a normal one, another may seem totally abnormal, so we are more limited by a range of branded manufacturers.
None of them are into extreme extremes.
Before we say goodbye, I have the last question: What was the craziest demand they got?
Just now a week came an e-mail in which a lady asked for a masturbation aid for her boyfriend, with a twenty-eight centimeter nature.
So we had to write that we do not have such a thing.
There is still a question of whether somebody was kidding us, "Martin looks at me with a suspicious look.
It's happening from time to time ...
Wound for Karel Gott.
After two Alzheimer's cancers!
His friend Karel Štědrý is fighting a serious illness.
Karel Gott's best friend is fighting a disease that steals all memories.
"Yes, that's true," said the singer.
I know about my illness and I can handle it in the meantime.
"I take medication to slow down the concomitant phenomena of the disease," he said, thanking loved ones for support.
The whole branched family has come together to make life easier for Charles.
Wife Eva tries to be at home as much as possible, while her daddy from the first marriage of Zuzana and Tereza, the old son Karl said Karlas, commutes for her father in the house on the White Mountain.
He was fighting cancer twice and gave Slavík his experience to support him in his demanding treatment.
She has sixty chemotherapy treatments.
He was able to get back to work on the tennis court and the ski slopes.
"I'm predicted by the astrologer that I will be in ninety," said Karel Blesku.
He's a warrior.
They still want to sing.
"I repeat the words of the songs so I will not forget them," Charles admitted.
The same illness is now being fought by the actress Květa Fialová at the institute.
Do you have a patient with Alzheimer's in the family?
See how to behave.
Chile's parliament abolished the ban on interruptions, the law assesses the US.
In Chile, there is still an absolute ban on artificial interruption of pregnancy, so it can not be done for medical reasons either.
"I am sorry that the lawmakers have filed a complaint with the Constitutional Court and that now there will be ten people to decide what we have been arguing in parliament for more than two years," Socialist Senator Isabel Allende complained.
The Constitutional Court in Chile has ten members, and at the end of August it should get a new president, which is close to the opposition.
The law abolishing the absolute ban on interruptions, initiated by current President Michelle Bachelet, was approved by the Senate on July 19th.
The right-wing opposition then announced that the law would appeal to the court because it violated the right of the unborn child to live.
MEPs postponed the vote last month until the Joint Parliamentary Committee analyzes it.
On Wednesday, MEPs approved the draft and re-elected the Senate.
Under the new legislation, abortion should cease in three cases: if the woman's life is at risk if the fetus has no hope of survival, or if the pregnancy is the result of rape.
Similar exceptions existed according to the Spanish El País letter in Chile as early as 1931, that is, before the women were given the right to vote in 1949.
The absolute prohibition of abortions in 1989 was introduced by right-wing dictator Augusto Pinochet, just months before he left the office of the president.
Chile is one of the few countries in the world where there is an absolute ban on abortion.
Others are Nicaragua, Dominican Republic, Salvador, Haiti, Malta and Honduras.
For example, in Salvador, about 20 women are now behind bars, who serve up to thirty years of prison sentences for the termination of their pregnancy.
In many cases, according to human rights defenders, spontaneous miscarriage was described by the court as a murder.
Is there even something sacred?
The Statue of Liberty is now the target of Trump's White House
The unmistakable sign of regime change is the scrutiny of the statues.
Americans could tell about it just as well as everyone else - see the carefully crafted overthrow of Saddam Hussein's statue on Firdos Square in Baghdad in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the key advocates of the Trump regime, certainly knew what was going on when, in a heated debate with CNN reporter Jim Acosta on the topic of the presidential proposals to drastically reduce legal immigrants, he set out with a symbolic ax on the Statue of Liberty.
It is good to add that Miller did not attack the statue as such.
For him, a crowd of cruise ship owners and Immortals of the Statue of Liberty would smell it.
However, he attacked her significance, namely the fact that in 1903 a plaque with the famous poem Emmy Lazarus was placed on the pedestal, until 17 years after the monument was completed.
Miller chided Acosta with the words, "I do not want to go into history here, but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that sheds light on the world.
The poem that was placed on the pedestal in addition to that you refer to is not part of it. "
Miller is actually right, but as he said, this is not history.
These are, in particular, the striking words of Emma Lazarus, which resonate today - not only by immigrants, but by the poorest of the poorest: "Let me go, who sinks, who is poor, who freely breathes lightly, who has wicked worms in the midst of full cities."
And in modern times, we can better track than ever the "wicked worms" on our screens.
Miller did not try to critique poetry - he wanted to make it clear that these people are not welcome in the US.
This conflict over the importance of the statue is part of a comprehensive political and cultural war: it is essentially a conflict about the importance of America.
Emma Lazarus, as well as her friends who, after her death, sought to place a plaque with poems on the statue pedestal, knew quite well that she was going into a high political game.
The statue was to express the connection of the French and American Republican governments by representing a classical theme, the female embodiment of liberty.
Emma Lazarus altered this meaning: in her poem, the female figure is not abstract, but has its own voice.
It also has a very different name: Mother of Exiles.
The merging of a poem with a woman's image is a brilliant feminist move and a devastating attack on American nativism.
And in the same way that Emma Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, the devotees of the right have long sought to reverse this meaning.
Famous commentator Rush Limbaugh - John the Baptist on Trump's rise to power - argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty does not really invite anyone into the country, but presents early neoconstructivism, bringing the American flame to the backward world: "The Statue of Liberty goes forward.
He is carrying the torch of freedom from the United States and offering it to the rest of the world.
The torch does not illuminate the way to the United States. "
Limbaugh strangely touches an important thing.
The meaning of the sculpture depends on the point of view.
Emma Lazarus describes the statue from the point of exhausted and damn traveler, who often arrives with hope in the heart to a new country after a long and terrifying cruise across the ocean.
It is literally a sight for the world through the eyes of people seeking refuge and a chance for a better life.
From this perspective, the statue expresses hope and listens to their needs.
And of course this is a perspective that Miller and Trump do not recognize.
Their torch is not meant to illuminate the way, but to instigate hatred, which is their only source of power.
World Athletics Championship 2017: Neil Black is praising the Scottish members of the British team
Eilidh Doyle recalls the times when the British team had only two Scottish members
UK Athletic Federation Director Neil Black said the strong squadron of 16 Scots in the World Championship team will be "a huge asset to the team."
For the World Cup in London 2017, starting on Friday, a record number of Scottish athletes was selected.
Black believes that "something special is going on in Scotland" and British athletics could learn from the Scots.
"We are trying to understand and adapt - we will work on it," said Black.
"I've been talking to people from the Scottish Sports Institute, and they think it has to do with what they did.
Scottish athletics officials think it has to do with what they did.
British Athletics: It has to do with what they did.
People in the streets think it too.
Whatever it is, it's absolutely amazing. "
Several Scottish athletes will strive for a medal, including Laura Muiro and Andrew Butchart - who will compete with Sir Mo Pharaoh in the 5000m race, while Eilidh Doyle has been elected captain of the team.
"Eilidh is modest.
Her introductory speech was amazing, "Black said.
"Several athletes, whether Scots or athletes of other nationalities, came out of the room with a great sense of pride and motivation.
The passion and uncovering feelings Eilidh was talking about were unrepeatable. "
The Commonwealth silver medalist, who will compete in the 400m hurdles at its fifth World Championships, said it was "unbelievable" that there were 16 Scottish athletes in the British team.
The previous record of 1983 and 2015 is seven.
Midwife on the medium track Muiro set only five British and two European records in the last year.
The MS will participate in the 1500 m and 5000 m runs.
Another of the great Scots is Chris O'Hare, who will run the 1500m track. This year's British Team Racing and Annual Games won.
Doyle remembers her first championship, where she was the only other Scottish member of the Lee McConnell team.
The captain of the team said she was "very proud" of the fact that not only a large number of her colleagues got into the team, but in many cases they would also attack the final and medal.
"The extraordinary role of the captain of the team is that I have been chosen by other team members, but it was a great honor for me, but the consciousness that team members have chosen me is delighted," she added.
"Obviously, I am very proud of all the Scots who have come to the team.
It proves where I've moved.
They are athletes who will think of the front seats on the podium.
And my opening speech?
Yes, I think she did.
I just pointed out the fact that we can be proud of this championship this year because it is held on home ground.
It is important to use the support of domestic fans and enjoy the fact that we are back at the Olympic stadium.
I have a second chance to race and I will enjoy the unreal atmosphere. "
Criticism Blocking on Facebook: Do not talk about public office unless you criticize voters
Father of our country knew about his criticism.
The Americans loved George Washington, but the newspaper did not take long to criticize it for anything, starting with domestic politics and ending with its political views.
Yes, this critique did not leave him cold.
But he did not try to silence critics.
Because in 1783 Washington said: "Freedom of speech can be withdrawn - and we will be silly and dumb as a sheep for defeat."
It brings me to Maryland, Governor Larry Hogan, who needs to work on it to start acting like Washington.
Hogan's employees blocked and deleted contributions from at least 450 people who freely expressed their views on his official Facebook page.
This week he was sued by the US Civil Liberties Union for these acts.
The Governor's staff dismissed the action as unfounded, and many commentaries of "who cares" appeared in the comments on the Internet.
"It's just Facebook," said many users.
Still, it matters.
Especially in the moment when it comes to people like Hogan.
In an absolutely democratic state, he is an extremely popular Republican governor.
It boasts the second highest popularity of all 50 governors.
Hogan is not annoying.
As you can see, your state is self-righteous and strictly adhered to the principles.
He has also shown himself to be skilful in using Facebook as the main means of communicating with his voters - the exception is not even the publication of the first bareheaded photo after chemotherapy.
Blocking people who come to the Governor's Site - which is a public forum, designated as official and managed by its staff paid from taxpayers' money - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
In an interview with Washington Post Hogan's spokeswoman Amelia Chasse, the governor argued that comment blocking was from post-moderation posts.
But using the image of internet trolls, spammers, or angry people is too easy.
The Washington Post interviewed several real people who had been deleted.
And that's what they are - real people who speak to their elected leaders, teacher, entrepreneur and pastor, no trolls.
As everyone said, their comments were polite and considerate, not blatant.
In his commentary, the pastor cited the Bible, appealing to Hogan's Catholic faith.
Lawyer Bowie Lakshmi Sarma Ramani, MD asked for hate crimes, but her comment was not hateful.
"I politely remarked that I was disappointed by its inadequate response to hate crimes and other up-to-date reports," she wrote in the Washington Post's commentary section.
"I do not like the idea that as soon as a certain number of people commented on the same topic, some people are called to promote so-called collective effort instead of being recognized as a larger group of interested citizens."
What the governor's employees called "concentrated spam interest" would probably be called "advocacy" by others.
The modern Facebook era allows us to easily manage posts by blocking criticism or deleting negative comments.
It is much more comfortable than in the past when the same procedure would require sending workers to the streets where they would collect and burn all copies with criticism or arrest or silence Protestants.
And that's exactly what's going on, only in digital form.
Hogan is not the last public figure to be criticized for defamation of Facebook and other social media.
President Trump is facing a complaint from Twitter users who have been denied access to his account.
One of the first important regulations was born last week in Virginia.
The chairman of the Loudoun County Board of Supervisors violated the first appendix in Alexandria, according to District Judge James C. Cacher, where she prevented one of voters from accessing her Facebook page.
Governor Matt Bevin (R) of Kentucky also received visits from ACLU for his use of Facebook and Twitter.
That should not be so difficult.
In Washington, the low cost of postage had virtually the same impact as the Internet.
Between 1776 and 1800, the number of daily newspapers quadrupled and his leader's position was questioned by many anonymous writers.
And even in those times, Washington had to deal with anonymous trolls.
People writing pseudonyms such as Juricola, Valerius, Belisarius and Portius wrote letters in newspapers and questioned Washington's decision.
According to historical documents gathered by people in the online project Papers of George Washington Project, a petition criticizing his opinion against the Treaty of Amity, Commerce, and Navigation with Britain has been stacked in his office.
But he did not silence them.
Freedom of speech, disagreement and intimidation lies in the very foundations of our nation.
And the real leader must accept it.
Czechs quickly used free roaming, spending more data abroad than abroad at home.
Abroad, Czechs consume more from their tariffs than at home.
Most often they are in Austria, but the consumption of data in the summer season is dominated by Croatia.
On vacation, on the one hand, they have more time to browse the web, and most of the umbrellas do not have the ability to connect to Wi-Fi.
Beach, bathing and smart phone in hand.
This is the typical Czech holiday in Croatia after customers can use the services of local operators at home prices.
This results from O2's fresh statistics.
Thanks to the new roaming rules, most Czech travelers abroad have more data at a flat rate than at home.
It is no wonder, therefore, that in Croatia, where winter is the minimum of ours, the consumption of data rose even fifty times this summer.
Italy ranked second in the list of consumed data.
For most minutes, the Czechs call from Germany, where they are going to work a lot during the summer.
Croatia, according to the Association of Czech Travel Agencies, visits 800,000 Czechs a year, so it is our most popular holiday destination.
But people exchanged a book for sharing experiences with a mobile phone.
The record was this July 7th.
"Tens of millions of photographs will be transferred to the data," said O2 Silvia Cieslar, director of the mobile segment.
Although Croatia is leading in the volume of data, the highest number of Czech users is in neighboring countries.
The first place is Austria, followed by Germany and Slovakia.
Croatia is up to fourth and Italy sixth.
We go to Austria for hiking and active holidays, for which we do not have much time to browse the Internet.
"In addition to Austria, the Czechs are heading towards the Adriatic," Cieslar explained.
While the operator recorded a high year-on-year rise in roaming charges, the phone is much lower for calls.
The number of roaming minutes increased by double compared to the previous year.
With a huge lead over other countries, Germany dominates here.
"Calling roaming is mostly used by business customers on business trips," Cieslar added.
Ronan Rafferty hopes for a homey atmosphere at the Renaissance Club
Former Ronan Rafferty will be in the cool atmosphere of the Renaissance Club in East Lothian, Scotland, where he is hosting the 25th Scottish Senior Open.
Ronan Rafferty, who comes from Northern Ireland, last year succumbed to Paul Eales on the nearby Archerfield Links golf course and will play the ambassador's role this year as the founder of the club and CEO Jerry Sarvadi.
"I watched the Renaissance Club slowly grow up in my eyes and this year's tournament will show the world its beauty," Rafferty said.
"Players will be able to enjoy the high quality of the pitch.
Jerry did a great job.
He is a keen advocate of this game and is proud of his achievements.
This year's tournament is in the right hands. "
English Eales will be the first to defend the championship title, despite having won the European Tour and European Challenge Tour during his 32-year career.
"I feel good about that," the Southport golfer said.
"I did not have the opportunity to defend my victory at the Extremadura Open, because a year after my win the tournament was canceled.
Returning to this part of the country is magical.
It is a beautiful place for golf.
I remember last year when Sharon and I had a really great win for me and my wife.
It was a beautiful time that I will not forget. "
Gary Orr, who joined the European Senior Tour after celebrating 50 years ago, returns home.
This event will be his first Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
"I always like to play on home ground," Orr said of Helensburg.
"You want to be successful and feel great pressure.
I really enjoy playing again and I think I'm doing well.
With the result I am satisfied. "
Triple of players will also be joined by the former Masters winner Ian Woosnam and the senior tournament winners Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are among six Scottish players on the pitch, others include Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
Entrance to the tournament is free of charge. Parking costs £ 5 per car with one passenger and £ 10 per car with two or more passengers.
All profits will be paid to Prostate Cancer UK.
Poverty and death in the Indonesian country of gold
When Bardina Degei cooks dinner, she does not use the stove.
In fact, he rarely uses a pan.
In her wooden hut, located in the capital Paniai Enarotali in the Indonesian province of Papua, a woman usually simply throws a sweet potato in the local "note" into the fire.
After half an hour of potato, he takes off and tastes delicious with his unwashed hands.
Bardina is sitting on muddy ground - the house is not equipped with furniture - where he also performs his everyday work, such as washing laundry in turbid water from a nearby swamp.
The bucket in a room without a roof adds to the toilet.
As the youngest of her husband's four wives, she was not assigned any field for cultivation.
Polygamy is common here.
Work in the late hours of the night is a danger: most of the men in the village are unemployed and often drink alcohol, and soldiers are home to the village.
"In the afternoon after 5 o'clock, no one will let you wander around the village," says Bardina.
It is a rare sight in everyday life in the highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony that was declared part of Indonesia in 1969 after a controversial referendum, when only 1026 elders were forced to vote by publicly raising their hands in front of the occupying army.
The current movement, protesting against the Dutch rules, quickly turned its anger against the Jakarta government, which ruled the whole region except for foreign journalists or civil rights supervisors.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua - independent Papua New Guinea occupied the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is such a remote and devastated city that you can reach for a ninety-minute flight from Jayapura to Nabire, and then a five-hour stomach riding.
Mass transfer at this location does not work.
The city of 19,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences, roofs of wool sheets in shades of gray and rusty.
Only a very few Indonesians, let alone journalists, and virtually no strangers looked at this place.
Before the arrival of the Christians, local people worshiped a god named Uga Tamee.
And that's not all.
"We were not used to wearing these dresses," says Bardina, pointing to her colorful, hand-knit turban, dark shirt and bright skirt.
"We used only the leaves before."
Papua is the poorest province of Indonesia - 28% of the population lives below the poverty line, and child mortality here, and literacy is one of the worst in Asia.
At the same time, however, it is an Indonesian country of gold.
The largest and most profitable gold mine in the world, Grasberg owned by Freeport McMoran from Phoenix, is located just 60 miles from Paniai, a rocky province of approximately New Jersey, home to about 153,000 people.
Only in 2015 Freeport produced gold and copper worth 3.1 billion dollars.
In addition, Papua supports wood harvesting at an estimated $ 78 billion.
These wealth, however, is a source of suffering for the Papuan people and a guarantee of oppression by the mighty Indonesian army.
The 2005 New York Times investigation shows that Freeport paid local army agents and troops about $ 20 million between 1998 and 2004, including $ 150,000 per officer.
Papuan citizens calling for self-government threaten this golden goose and are therefore hard pressed.
According to human rights activists, more than 500,000 Papuans have been killed since 1969, and thousands more have been raped, tortured and imprisoned by the Indonesian Army.
Mass murders in the Papui tribal region during the 1970s were equal to genocide, as the Asian Human Rights Commission said.
Only last year the Indonesian police arrested more than 3900 peaceful Protestants in the region.
We Will Lose Everything, a report from the Brisbane Archdiocese in 2016, describes the cruelties that occurred last year as extrajudicial executions, torture - another report is particularly popular rape and electric shock - and the brutal suppression of peaceful demonstrators.
"It is difficult to count the number of casualties because incidents occur every week," said Andreas Harsono, an Indonesian researcher at Human Rights Watch.
The whole situation was attracted by the fact that the papuan sources attracted colonists to Indonesia.
Of the 3.5 million people in the province, 83% report Christianity, but demographics are changing with the influx of Muslim immigrants from the Indonesian islands - Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Javanese canteens sell fried chicken and gado-gado or a mixture of vegetables and peanut sauce.
Local people fight for survival.
"Immigrants have begun to sell chickens and vegetables on traditional markets at lower prices than the local Papuan," explains 24-year-old Abeth You, who was born in Paniai and moved to work in the capital of the Jayapura province.
"The original inhabitants of Papua - mother-mother (women) - have lost their jobs."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, nicknamed Jokowi, promised in his presidential campaign in 2014 the resolution of inequality and violation of rights.
The former carpenter secured his way to the presidential palace in Jakarta 27 of 29 Papua districts, including Paniai.
But there has been very little change in Papua, and local people feel betrayed.
"Our heart was broken because in 2014 we voted for Jokpwi in the hope of hearing our call for justice," You said.
The fact is that just two months after the October inauguration of Jakowi, Paniai experienced a great shock.
On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children chanted a Christmas song at the campfire in Enarotali when two Indonesian soldiers on motorbikes came out of the night.
Two of the surprised children told them they should turn on the lights.
One of the soldiers touched upon this complaint and the tone they were told and later returned to four other soldiers, local priest Yavedt Tebai said.
Two of the soldiers in a state of hostility pursued a group of children and beaten them with the guns of their weapons, reported victims and witnessed events.
One of the soldiers then fired at a group of children.
One of the children, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was beaten so hard that he fell into a coma.
A few hours later, someone fired the nearby building of the Electoral Commission, and the next day things were getting higher.
About 1,000 young Papuan men and women gathered on a football field in front of the local police station and army headquarters and demanded justice.
They came with ceremonial hunting bows and performed the waita dance - which runs in a circle and mimics the singing of the birds - the Papuan tribe of Mee Pago.
Several Protestants began throwing stones at the buildings.
With an increasing strain, the soldiers were ordered through the radio: "If the crowd tries at least three times to resist, you have permission to shoot," TIME said in an official document whose content was never published in the local media.
Yeremias Kayame (56), chief of the Enarotali Kego Koto district, recognized the imminent danger and urged the residents to break into their homes.
But no one had neglected his words.
"When I turned, someone shot me into my left wrist," he told TIME weekly on the porch of his painted wooden house.
Kayame still does not know who was a shooter, but according to his words a bullet belonged to one of the soldiers present.
"There were plenty of people around and a lot of shooting," he added.
One of the locals, Alfius Youw, was hit three times by the words of his cousin who witnessed the shooting.
"I ran to my body to make sure it was him," Yohanes said in a humorous voice, which, like many Indonesians, uses only one name.
"I saw he was dead ... I kissed him."
The Papuan police inspector, General Yotje Mende, told reporters that his officers only "secured" the station that was under attack.
"We have to defend ourselves when people are threatening us with death," said Papuán police spokesman, Commissioner Pudjo Sulistiyo in 2015.
"It's a matter of life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five protesters have been killed and many have been wounded.
The murder report broke through the Jakarta media the following day.
Three weeks later, Jokowi gave Jayapura a passionate speech and expressed his sympathy for the victims' families and promised to deal with the violence in Papua.
"I demand an immediate solution to this problem so that it can never be repeated," he said.
In October 2016, Minister of National Security Wiranto announced that he would introduce an out-of-court mechanism to resolve violent acts that occurred in the past.
Excuses began almost instantly.
"Most of the violent acts occurred long ago.
Some of them occurred in the 1990s and some at the beginning of the 21st century.
I want to say that we are committed to punishing these violent acts, but it will not be an easy task, "he said.
In a June 5 interview for the TIME weekend in Jakarta, however, Wiranto said he did not plan to take action in Papua.
Instead, they say that "all cases will be brought to court".
Wiranto, accused of "crimes against humanity" by more than one thousand dead during the 1999 independent election in East Timor, said that 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua have been settled, including the Paniai incident.
The families of the shooting victims in Paniai welcomed his claim with distrust.
"I have been interviewed four times in the last three years, but I have not heard of it yet," Yohanes said.
"I'm tired."
As he says, a few years later he still lives in fear.
"I'm afraid," he says.
"I'm afraid the army will arrest me or someone will shoot me."
His brother Yacobus confirmed the view of many Paniai residents who are afraid of the incident.
According to him, the Army members beat him after helping to bury four of the victims.
"After the body was buried, my army began to search for me," he said.
And shooting still does not work.
On Tuesday, the Indonesian police shot the villagers in neighboring Deiyai.
There was a row between the villagers and the manager of a construction company who refused to assist in transporting the unconscious man to the hospital.
Ravianus Douw (24), who drowned while fishing in a nearby river, died on his way to the hospital.
Angry villagers protested in front of the company building.
According to the police, the villagers were throwing the stones and the answer was a warning shot.
Local residents, however, claim that the mobile brigade (Indonesian paramilitary police) began firing in the crowd and killing one person.
"There was panic, we were afraid of retribution," said 29-year-old Domingu Badii for TIME, who lives near the hospital and witnessed the arrival of the wounded.
"I did not get out of the house for two days."
Deiya's parliament demanded the punishment of participating police officers and the withdrawal of a mobile brigade from the area.
Paniai has always been in the eye for the Indonesian government.
Lack of meaningful development only deepens the isolation of indigenous people of the tribes of Mee, Moni, Dani, and Damal who live in the central highlands.
Many of them joined the Papuai Liberation Movement (OPM), a rebel army that protects the rights of the Papuans by attacking and kidnapping Indonesian policemen.
Some of the OPM leaders come from Paniai, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
As a result of the attacks, the army has arrested and arbitrarily detained thousands of Paniai residents in recent years, all under the pretext of "securing national sovereignty."
Some of them are never seen before.
Paniai is known as a "tragic and forgotten place" among the inhabitants of Papua.
Oil in the fire is coming to poverty.
The little rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive for the locals.
And the bread is equally unattainable.
Local residents grow their food: mainly sweet potatoes, fruits and leafy vegetables.
Women work in the fields, each of which cultivates four or five fields with sweet potatoes.
Most harvests are for the family's needs, the rest are sold on the local market.
Ten pieces of sweet potatoes cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Since the Nabire airport has opened up more air routes and new immigrants have started to flow into the country, there is an increase in economic inequality between native Papuans and immigrants.
Few jobs are already occupied by more educated and richer immigrants.
Papuan people rarely have the necessary capital and education to go into business.
"Young people move out of villages for lack of job opportunities and money," said John Gobai, Chairman of the Paniai Tribune.
Thanks to isolation, Papua province is hidden from the world.
Strict rules for foreign journalists also contribute to this.
At the beginning of this year, two French journalists - Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp - were expelled from papui because of the "lack of co-operation with the authorities," despite the fact that they were given such a rare franchise for filming.
Phelim Kine, deputy director of Asian branch of Human Rights Watch, Jokowi promised in his election campaign the abolition of strict rules for journalists and transparency and development, but never did.
"Foreign journalists working in the rebellious eastern areas of Papua and West Papua are at high risk: not recognizing visas and blacklisting," the statement said.
The lack of news from foreign journalists means that international pressure on Indonesian in Papui is to a large extent limited.
In March, the six Pacific nations - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands - urged the UN Human Rights Council to investigate "various and widespread violent acts" in Papua, including shooting in Paniai.
These countries have also supported OPM in the past.
Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesman Arrmanath Nasir shrugged allegations when he told reporters in Jakarta that: "In Indonesia, the democratic system is still in place and the media are free, so it is difficult to mask evidence of human rights violations."
Local people call for the participation of foreign governments.
When an official delegation from the Netherlands, headed by human rights envoy Kees Van Baare, visited Jayapurau on May 4, local people were summoned by a source who also attended the session, but wanted to remain anonymous, the phrase "we want freedom."
For the year 2019, additional elections are planned in Indonesia, but the Papuan people say they will not vote for Jokowi.
"Jokowi is a man who has good intentions, but is surrounded by people associated with shooting in Paniai," said Gobau, chairman of the tribal council.
He wants Jokowi to know that the inhabitants of Paniai - except that they live in constant fear of a robber army - are fighting poverty, poor education and the health system.
Gobai claims that the Paniai, like the rest of the Papuan people, regard their voice as "the debt" that Jokowi must repay.
"They do not want money, they demand justice," he added.
In spite of threats and intimidation, the family of victims of Panania's shooting continue the last symbolic act of defiance: they bury the bodies of the victims on the land opposite the police and army stations.
Knowing that justice will never be enough, at least will not allow responsible people to forget their crimes.
"A member of our family was killed," Yacobus said, his head down.
"What can we do?"
The French Navy captured a huge supply of cocaine to Australia.
The French Navy has seized a Pacific Yacht carrying 1,46 tons of cocaine worth about $ 256 million.
The shipment headed to Australia.
During the strike, a four-man crew was arrested, apparently from Lithuanian and Latvian people.
The Yacht, named Afalina, sailed out of South America and the police pulled her to a port in Nouméa, the metropolis of the French overseas territory of New Caledonia in the Pacific Ocean.
The Australian Intelligence Service said it would work with its international partners to determine exactly where and where the drugs were directed and to uncover the "Lithuanian Syndicate".
"We are grateful to the French authorities for measures to stop a large number of drugs targeting Australia," said Col Blanch's executive director.
Drugs have been destroyed this week in Nouméa.
Australia is an attractive target for smugglers because of high street drug prices.
The country is also struggling with the growing number of people with drug addiction.
Contemporary race is not the first time recently.
Last month, three men were accused of transporting a large number of drugs from the United States to Australia, which attempted to smuggle across the Pacific Ocean on a small plane.
Seniors do not feel thirsty, they need to be remembered.
The problem may be in seniors' homes, according to a physician from the Geriatric Clinic of the General University Hospital in Prague, Pavla Mádlová could be an infusion of physiological solution that sticks with a thin needle under the skin.
However, they are only applied in health care facilities.
The older one is, the greater the amount of water in his body.
"In addition, he loses his thirst, so the seniors generally take less fluids and dehydrate very quickly," Mádlová said.
Two liters should definitely drink.
"But getting so much fluid in the old man is a big problem," she added.
In homes for the elderly, this is often not a doctor's care.
In hospitals, dehydration is commonly treated by infusions.
"I think they should be introduced there to get subcutaneous infusions," she said.
In a day, according to her, older people can deliver up to two pintled bottles of physiological saline.
Lack of fluids can cause malnutrition, headache, and decreased performance.
Dehydration will manifest itself as a complete loss of self-sufficiency.
"One day the old man says he can not get out of bed, he's talking confused," she added.
In case of neglect, it may result in a stroke.
Blood thickens and clogs blood vessels in the brain, and there is also a risk of kidney failure.
Lying patients should not be covered with a blanket, a maximum of cotton sheets.
Disposable diapers may also be a problem.
"It's more nursing, but the ideal would be to uncover the patient occasionally and let the skin explode," said the doctor.
In Dubai, the Torch skyscraper burned for the second time
In Dubai, one of the largest residential skyscrapers in the world was found in flames on Friday, with firefighters evacuating all 337-meter-high and 79-storey buildings.
Over the last two years, this is the second fire of this high-rise building that bears the name The Torch.
All residents of the building were evacuated and no injuries occurred. The cause of the fire is unknown.
"We slept and woke up the alarm. We heard shouting.
It took us ten minutes to run down from the 50th floor, "Geroge, one of the skyscraper inhabitants, told Reuters.
Dubai civilian defense said the firefighters had managed to get the fire under control around 4:00 am (0:00 GMT) and then continued cooling the building.
Government officials added that they provide alternative accommodation for the disabled.
The incident could again trigger a discussion on the safety of materials used to tall high-rise buildings around the world.
The results of the investigations launched by the Torch skyscraper after a fire in 2015 showed that the lining and external panels used to decorate or isolate were the most damaged.
The British police said the London Grenfell Tower insulation and lining system could have contributed to the rapid spread of fire in June's fire, killing nearly 80 people.
Survey results have shown that more than one in five US travelers are charging forbidden items on board an aircraft
A survey of passengers showed that more than twenty percent of them consciously or unknowingly banned items through the US Department of Transportation Security Administration's control station on board, with at least six percent of passengers boarding a plane with a knife or other sharp object.
Less than one percent of passengers claim to have been late in finding that they traveled with firearms, ammunition or explosives.
The results of a survey conducted by Stratos Jet Charters Inc. - which was answered by more than 1,000 respondents - have shown that younger passengers are more likely to break the rules.
Of the respondents who admitted they consciously attempted to travel with an item that is banned by TSA, 19.7 percent of passengers with several thousands of hours flying compared to less than 15 percent of Generation X members.
The most common items that have escaped TSA's attention include food and alcohol.
More than three percent of respondents consciously spoke over the security of a sharp subject, while 2.2 percent of women surveyed and 3.7 percent of men surveyed also admitted to deliberately banned drugs on board.
The company said it was conducting research among travelers around the world to find out how many of them accidentally spilled unauthorized items through airport control and how much it did deliberately.
Not surprisingly, most people who have transferred unauthorized objects - whether consciously or unconsciously - travel very often by airplane.
As the company has emphasized, the TSA directive is somewhat complicated and confusing.
People often do not know what fluids and how much they can get into the plane.
It is no surprise, therefore, that TSA confiscated the largest amount of liquid just forbidden.
For some time, people thought TSA would handle books in the same way as with smuggled goods.
Liquid transfer is permitted within domestic flights, not international ones.
EPA chief Scott Pruitt to postpone planned Obama Administration's emission reduction directives
After the Environmental Protection Agency was prosecuted by fifteen states, its chief Scott Pruitt appealed his earlier decision to postpone the implementation of the former Obama administration's plan to reduce carbon dioxide emissions.
Pruitt introduced changes to his plan, reacting more swiftly than previous governments to the needs of state environmental regulators.
He did not, however, mention a legal challenge filed against his previous position with the Federal Appeals Court.
This concerns the latest deadline set for October 1, when states are to start implementing the 2015 Regulation to reduce ground-level ozone.
Pruitt announced in June that it would postpone the deal for one year and order a more detailed study of the plan to avoid "interference with local decisions or impending economic growth."
Pruitt, who served as the Chief Prosecutor General of Oklahoma before serving as CEO of EPA President Donald Trumpe, has long served as a reliable opponent of stricter environmental regulations.
Since settling in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly moved or delayed the regulation proposed by the chemical and fossil industry.
Sudden Wednesday's turn is the biggest legal failure for Pruit's regulatory agenda.
Last month, the Federal Appeals Court in Washington decided that the EPA executive had exceeded its authority in an effort to delay the inclusion of the Obama administration's plan that required oil and gas companies to reduce methane leakage.
In a statement issued Wednesday night, Pruitt has designed its version of ozone standards and has strengthened EPA's commitment to collaborating with states through complex processes and meeting new standards within a given timeframe.
"Under the previous EPA administration, it has often failed to meet the deadlines and waited for it to be prosecuted by activist groups and others, agreeing to settle and plan further," said Pruitt, who in his previous position filed more than a dozen lawsuits with EPA.
"We do not believe in regulation through litigation and we take the deadline seriously.
We never joke about its status and the authority that results from it. "
The EPA statement, however, states that Pruitt may at some point use the "possibility of delay and all other legally-available authorities" to ensure that regulation "is based on sound policy and the most accessible information".
Republicans in Congress are pushing for a wider transposition of ozone rules.
The White House budget approved last month seeks to postpone the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years.
The measure has not yet been handled by the Senate.
New York's Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who was at the head of a coalition of states suing EPA this week, said the group was not going to allow it under legal pressure.
"Turning to the EPA - following our trial, is an important victory for the health and safety of the 6.7 million New Yorkers and more than 115 million Americans who are directly affected by air pollution," Schneiderman added.
New York joined California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington and Washington, D.C.
Ground-level ozone arises when conventional pollutants emitted by cars, power plants, oil refineries, chemical plants, and other sources react in the sun's atmosphere.
The resulting smog can cause severe respiratory problems in sensitive people and thousands of premature deaths each year.
Public health advocates and environmentalists are blushing with Pruit's sudden change.
"It is disturbing what pressure we need to develop to change the minds of responsible people and protect the air we breathe," said Lori Ann Burd of the Center for Biological Diversity.
"We must continue to struggle with the ideological pull of the Trump's administration, trying to help polluters and special interests."
He polluted the man with acid, yet he is not dangerous under the law.
You never know what you can do.
At one point you are at home with your family and you laugh, in the second you suddenly change your life from the ground.
And the worst thing is that you can not do anything about it at all.
A similar fate met Andreas Christopheros of Great Britain, whose face was burned with acid by an unknown attacker who was eventually acquitted.
Reuters reported.
In December 2014, someone at Christopheros knocked on the door.
Andreas rose to open.
He thought he was probably the messenger behind the door who was supposed to deliver the Christmas gifts for the family that day.
Instead, a terrible surprise awaited him.
A man he had never seen in his life poured him acidily without warning, saying, "That's for you, buddy."
The pain was indescribable.
Clothes fell on me like nothing, and I only felt unreal pain on my skin, "said Andreas.
The family moved him quickly to the hospital, but there was a terrible news from his family - he did not have the chance to survive.
Several weeks after the incident, doctors were constantly afraid that their patient would succumb to an infection that threatened to penetrate his wounds.
His injuries were very serious.
Of the ninety percent, the face that the doctors attempted to get together with the skin from other parts of the patient's body was affected.
A major complication for Christopheros was the loss of eyelids.
It's probably the most painful thing I've ever experienced.
"You can not hide from unexpected light, you can not close your eyes," he described his sorrow.
Today, Christopheros has completed twelve operations that are far from the last.
Accidents suffered by the victims of acid attacks may, according to plastic surgeons, require hundreds of surgical interventions and years of treatment.
Even after demanding and long-term treatment, the victims of the tissue have scarred to the end of their lives.
"Sometimes people are not recovering and are fighting for deformity and disfigurement throughout their lives," said Peter Dziewulski, a spokesperson for the British Association of Plastic and Aesthetic Surgeons.
The attacker mistaken.
As for the attack, Christopheros is confident that an unknown man had to confuse him with someone.
The perpetrator believed that a man who had sexually abused his close person was being attacked.
The police investigated the case thoroughly, and the attacker finally found out.
The man was originally sentenced to at least eight years in prison.
However, later, the verdict changed fundamentally to the astonishment of Christopher's family.
"Three judges eventually concluded that the sentence should be abolished because a man is not considered a threat to the public," said Christopheros.
Over the last few years, the number of corrosive substances has increased considerably.
The State Department of the Interior has voiced the issue by planning to issue new guidelines to prosecutors on the classification of caustics.
These should be classified as dangerous weapons.
However, victims of similar attacks are unwilling to give up.
They demand that the UK Government enforce stricter and longer sentences of imprisonment for people attacking their environment with acid or other corrosive substances.
They also call for tighter controls on the sale of dangerous substances, which are often commonly available in different shops as they are different cleaning products.
The famous skyscraper The Torch, one of the largest residential buildings in the world, burned at night in the largest city of the United Arab Emirates in Dubai.
According to the Dubai Civil Defense, the inhabitants of the eighty-story building evacuated in time and no one was injured.
According to a spokesman for the Dubai Police, a fire broke out on the ninth floor and spread up.
However, according to several residents of the house, this was the opposite.
"It started on the 67th floor, that's what they told us," one of the tenants said.
Also, according to another tenant quoted by Reuters, the fire broke out on the top floors and spread down with the falling glowing debris.
We slept.
We were alarmed, people were screaming.
"We were running down the stairs, it took us from the 50th floor for about ten minutes," the tenant George described.
Another CNN witnesses estimated that the flames had invaded about 40 dwellings.
On the ground, the fire destroyed at least two cars when the burning parts of the building hit them.
About two hours later, according to the Civil Defense Notice, the fire managed to get under control.
The cause of its origin is not yet known.
According to witnesses in the surrounding buildings, the current has fallen.
An extensive fire damaged the Torch skyscraper in Dubai in February 2015, ruining over one hundred apartments.
The whole building has about 680 apartments.
Even then, nothing happened to anyone because they had evacuated the people in time.
The Torch skyscraper was built in 2011 and has become the world's tallest residential building with its 352 meters.
Another Dubai skyscraper prepared it for the next year.
The bodybuilder had unbelievable 14 doping substances in the body.
He did not win anyway.
According to the Corriere della Serra, a sample of 23-year-old Ippolita had a large collection of illicit means - from steroids to diuretics to Parkinson's or anorexia.
Paradoxically, this wild mix did not help him, and finished fourth.
Now a bodybuilder is facing a four-year distance and criminal prosecution.
The record was 11.
Last year, Italian rabbi Davide Vasta was positively tested on 11 doping substances, a record high for athletes.
A three-liter player began to take steroids a year before, when he lost bodybuilding.
Lucka Vondráčková in the Czech Republic.
She passionately embraced a former lover!
As Lucka Vondráčková stepped into the Czech Republic, she is in one round.
And it also attracts attention wherever it comes.
Last time, her former lover, Michal Dlouhý, lived with her for three years.
The actor was 12 years older and he longed for the family.
Lucy was only 19 years old, and she definitely did not want to hide her nail career.
They went away from each other, but their friends stayed today.
They also managed to make a press conference at TV Prima where they met after a long time.
By coincidence, the two coincided in blue.
At first they ignored each other, but then they got together, and Lucie laughed at Michal's jokes as she grabbed her belly.
Then they hugged themselves and photographed willingly.
However, their encounter was not a coincidence, they play a loving couple together in the new series Prima Captain Exner.
Islamists received a life sentence in the UK for preparing an assassination.
On Thursday, the British court sent four members of the Islamist cell, who called themselves Three Musketeers, and planned a terrorist attack on the police and the army.
Four men, two of whom attended a training camp in Pakistan and previously convicted of similar deeds, were arrested last August.
The authorities then thought they were about to attack immediately.
In the car of one of the men, the security agents found a partially finished tubular bomb, knives with inscriptions in Arabic meaning "unbelievers," and a gunpowder.
This happened when the MI5 secret agent placed the eavesdropper in the car.
"Recent assassinations have shown how horrified the defendants could have been if they were not stopped," said Sue Hemming, a Prosecutor's Office.
Three convictions at the age of 28, 25 and 33 may request release after twenty years.
The fourth convict, 38 years old, can do so after 15 years behind bars.
The men claimed during the London trial that they were innocent and that the MI5 agent found the weapons found in the car.
The court also heard it, but the accused's allegation was rejected.
Thursday was the hottest day of the year.
In Hodonín they measured 38.3 ° C.
The Tuesday temperature record of 37.3 degrees Celsius remained at the top only two days.
With 38.3 degrees Celsius, which was recorded in Strážnice in Hodonín, it surpassed Thursday, which has so far been the warmest day of this year.
This was confirmed by the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute.
But compared to Tuesday, many temperature records did not fall on Thursday.
On Tuesday, records of 35 of 145 weather stations measuring over 30 years were overcome or matched.
On Thursday, only nine long-term measuring stations recorded record temperatures.
Maybe in Strážnice the temperature was the same as the previous record in 2013.
In Lednice in Břeclavsko Thursday 37.4 degrees exceeded the original maximum by four tenths of the degree and in Pohořelice in Brno 37.1 grade exceeded the record by three tenths.
Both records, as well as Strážnice, came from 2013.
In the west, it was ten degrees less.
The high temperatures appeared on Thursday mainly in the south and east of Moravia.
After Straznice was the biggest heat in Dyjakovice in Znojmo and Brod nad Dyjí in Břeclavsko, where the mercury climbed to 37.8 degrees, but the record did not overcome.
On the other hand, in the western and northwest Bohemia, according to the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute (ČHMÚ), meanwhile, Thursday temperatures are only about 22 degrees Celsius.
"Temperatures began to grow there later this afternoon," meteorologists said.
According to the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute (ČHMÚ), the current heat in the Czech Republic will gradually disappear and on Sunday there could be more rain.
Most temperatures in Moravia remain high on Friday and in the southeast of Moravia and on Saturday.
China is missing tourists.
Beijing is billions for visa policy.
For decades, China has been trying to exert its influence without the use of force.
It spends 10 billion dollars a year to promote language schools and build universities abroad, pushing its entertainment industry to foreign markets and trying to attract Western tourists.
But that does not work for Beijing.
The local state media talks about a plan to make tourism a driving force for economic transformation and modernization.
However, the number of visitors grew by only 3.8 percent last year and about 80 percent of tourists to China came from Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan.
It is caused, among other things, by the fact that, despite all its global aspirations, the Chinese Foreign Minister does not welcome open minds, evaluating the situation in the most populous country of the world, Professor of Economics at Beijing University Christopher Balding in an article for Bloomberg.
An example of this is China's visa policy.
Only 13 countries have visa-free travel with China, the citizens of other countries have to deal with the visa in advance.
Therefore, the Chinese authorities in the United States are crowds comparable to celebrations of the Chinese New Year.
The visa costs $ 140, but if you do not want to wait long hours in the queue, you have to pay $ 100 or more for additional services.
Such restrictions create significant economic barriers.
A study by the Journal of Economics and Finance showed that the visa requirement reduces the number of visitors by 70 percent.
In 2015, only two million Americans visited mainland China, while Hong Kong, which accounts for less than three percent of China's gross domestic product and has less than one percent of its population, visited 1.8 million Americans.
China is often deepening this problem when it uses tourism to pursue its political goals, for example in disputes with Taiwan and South Korea.
When China restricted transport to South Korea in the spring as part of a rupture around the South Korean missile defense system, the South Koreans retaliated it and China avoided it.
In May, the number of visits fell by 42 percent yoy, while Japan grew by 85 percent.
All this affects macroeconomic stability.
According to a recently published report by the US Federal Reserve, Fed has allowed China to leave as much as $ 190 billion as a result of China's foreign travel, while China spends about $ 35 billion a year on foreign currency sales to incoming tourists.
According to official figures for balance of payments developments, China has had a deficit of $ 217 billion in tourism last year, equivalent to 44 percent of the entire Chinese surplus in commodity trade.
So a small number of tourists, a country that has anxiously impeded the outflow of capital, has a very painful blow.
However, the above-mentioned factors are only one manifestation of more general restraint vis-à-vis foreigners.
In many parts of China, practically nobody heard about immigrants.
Already in 2013, less than a million foreigners lived in China.
There are also several individual cities in the United States.
Even Japan, which is not just the crossroads of immigration, has doubled.
Many scientific papers show that immigrants usually revive economic growth, entrepreneurship and innovation.
In China, however, you will not find it.
Solving these problems will be politically challenging, but the step is to simplify the visa system.
Other Asian countries, particularly India and Vietnam, have recently made great efforts to simplify and reduce visa procedures.
If China wants more foreign tourists and their hard currencies, it should be easier for them to get there.
In the Pilsen Zoo they multiplied the deadly toxic reptiles.
The Poles' Kingdom of Pilsen can enjoy the juveniles of just three rare, fatal poisonous reptiles.
In the exposition, visitors will see only nine newly born Turkish vipers.
This species lives in northern Anatolia, even at an altitude of 2000 meters.
"It's even a meter long," said Martin Vobruba, a zoo spokeswoman.
The youngsters of the other two species, the deadly and the red cobras, will gain momentum in the breeding grounds of the garden.
We still can not tell when people will see them.
"We would not want to lose them," said the nurse Miroslav Dohnal, saying it could take a year or two.
The Australian lethal vampires came to the world eight, they are the descendants of a breeding pair originating from the population around Sydney.
"The one that visitors can see in the exhibition is one of the deadly people in the Perth area," said Vobruba, adding that in human care, it is necessary for wintergirls to hibernate 6-8 weeks at 13 degrees Celsius.
One hundred percent success was accompanied by a bunch of African spitting red cobras.
A couple in the Pilsen Zoo hatched four eggs out of four eggs.
"The incubation lasted for 65 days," Vobruba added.
This species in the wild is ejecting poison at its victims, up to four meters away.
Going to the eyes, it can cause permanent blindness.
The youngsters of all three species live in the zoo with mouse hats.
Within 40 days in the garden, hatching of youngsters from the mammalian black bun is still awaited, the eggs are stored in the incubator.
Trump puts pressure on Mexico to pay for the border wall
The Washington Post, the US daily, has published President Trump's telephone conversations with Mexico and Australia's leaders.
In a telephone conversation on 27 January with Mexican President Enrique Peña Niete, Trump urged him to stop publicly announcing that he would not pay for the construction of the proposed wall.
The American president has told him he publicly condemns the construction of the wall, supposedly saying, "You can not talk like this in the press."
Trump, in his campaign, has promised to build a wall along the southern border and claim that Mexico will pay for it.
The transcript of his first conversation with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull also revealed a tense exchange of views.
President Trump told Turnbullo that the US oversight agreement over Australian refugees is "ridiculous" and "stupid" and insisted that if he agreed to such an agreement - which emerged during President Obama's reign - he would look "drugged" after he proposed a ban on the entry of refugees into the United States.
Trump ended the call after he explained to Turnbullo that "this is my most unpleasant call of the day."
Tusk spoke again to the prosecution office for Smolensk.
"He has something to worry about," said the dead president's brother, the president of the ruling Justice and Justice Pius Jaroslaw Kaczyński, at Tusk's address.
"I have nothing to worry about, Kaczynski does not shake me," Tusk said, reading the current leadership of the country, trying to abuse the justice against political opponents.
When leaving the headquarters of the Prosecutor's Office, Tuska waited for TVN 24 people, who chanted Donald Tusk! And wished the politician a hundred years !.
Tusk thanked for his support and assured himself of a clear conscience: "I have nothing to worry about and Kaczynski will not shake me."
Prosecutors say nothing to the prosecutors, but he does not doubt that justice is to serve the current Polish rulers as a tool against opponents, opposition or people who do not like it, and I am afraid I belong to this group.
He had been second to the interrogation.
The excerpt was questioned for the second time in the prosecution, this time the questioning had to be related to the misdeeds at the victims of the Smolensk disaster.
In addition, there was a change of bodies in coffins.
They forbid the opening of coffins to the family, and there had to be some reasons for that.
And the reason was that they were afraid of scandal because it would burden Polish-Russian relations.
"Maintaining good relations at all costs, in spite of such a terrible event, should have served to make Donald Tusk someone very important in the EU," Kaczyński said in the Catholic television Trwam.
He added that a possible conflict with Russia could frustrate the chances of Tusk to get the most important armchair in the Union, of which Poland has absolutely nothing.
At the same time, Kaczynski said he warned German Chancellor Angela Merkel that Donald Tusk might fall differently, but did not take note of it.
Tusk underwent an eight-hour hearing in the prosecution office on April 19th.
He never spoke as a suspect, only as a witness.
However, many of his summons were considered part of the apparent effort of the Polish government and PiS Kaczynski to discredit Tusk as a political opponent by linking up with various scandals.
The prosecutor's office is subordinate to the Minister of Justice in Poland, who acts as the Prosecutor General.
The call to questioning soon came after the election of Tusko by the European Council chief, whom Kaczynski struggled hard but in vain to try to prevent, among other things, during a visit to Merkel in Warsaw.
At the EU summit against the prolongation of Tusko's mandate, only Polish Prime Minister Beata Szydlova was alone in protest.
In this case, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán left Warsaw as well.
Burma and Senegal.
Where can the Czechs everywhere vote?
In autumn parliamentary elections, registered voters will be able to vote on the composition of the Chamber of Deputies from Burma, Senegal or Luxembourg.
In these and several other countries, the Czech Republic has opened its embassies since the last parliamentary elections held in 2013.
It comes from the decree governing the delivery of ballot papers abroad.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has prepared its update, currently in the reminders procedure.
Fourteen years ago, 10,000 Czech citizens voted abroad.
"Since the last amendment to the Decree in 2013, there have been some changes that have to be taken into account in these lists," the ministry explains.
"In some countries, new embassies have been created, some offices have been closed or a representation level has changed," the paper writes.
The decree contains two annexes, the first of which contains representative offices, to which paper ballot papers are supplied.
This group of offices includes the representation of the Czech Republic in the neighboring countries, ie Germany, Poland, Austria and Slovakia.
More than one hundred Czech authorities receive a ballot print version.
It is their list with the decree that changes.
Four years ago, Czechs could vote at the Czech Embassy in Libya or Zimbabwe.
Today both embassies are closed.
The Czech Republic also canceled its representation in Malaysian Bamako and Kyoto, Japan.
There will be no election at the Consulate General in Donetsk.
That Czech Republic concluded in 2014 due to the war in the east of Ukraine.
They are newly on the list of embassies in Nairobi, Kenya, Dakar, Senegal, and Zambian Lusaka.
In Asia, since the last parliamentary elections, the Czech Republic has extended its representation to the Consulate General in Iraqi and Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan Province.
Votes for registered voters will also be available at the Czech Embassies in Burma and Cambodia.
Czechs abroad had the opportunity to choose the deputies in the polling stations at embassies or consulates for four times.
Before each election, the state election commission determines by lot the region, for which the candidates are voted abroad.
For the first time it was in 2002, when it was decided among the South Moravian candidates.
In the next two elections, the Czechs voted abroad among South Bohemian candidates.
In 2013, the Central Bohemia Region was selected in 2013 as well.
The number of Czechs voting abroad steadily increases.
At the premiere 15 years ago, about 3,800 people came to vote, in 2006 about 6700, four years later 8222.
Early parliamentary elections four years ago showed 10,571 voters at the embassy.
Moore's Ford Massacre: Activists recalled racist lynching
The Ford Mercury of 1948 passed through the watching people of Monroe, Georgia and curled up toward Moore's Ford Bridge.
But before a car with four black-skinned passengers and a white driver was able to reach the bridge, a group of white men with their weapons built it.
The leader of the group - a middle aged man in a striped suit - dug a long cigarette and stared at the windshield of the car.
Inside the passengers were shaking with fear.
"We want that and Roger!" The man yelled.
"Bring him to me!"
The silence interrupts the roar of the young black man who is pulled from the passenger seat.
Fortunately, this scene is a mere reconstruction of events that occurred on July 22.
But when one of the men throws a rope over Roger's throat, the audience sighs in excitement.
Since 2005, Moore's Ford has been returning regularly to a group of activists who have reconstructed that fatal night in 1946, when two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and Mae Murra Dorsey - were killed by members of Kukluxklan.
For the murders, no one has yet been tried.
"It's amazing that not one person has been arrested for all these years - despite being in our community, even if we know their identity," Tyrone Brooks, who helps organize the event, has been heard.
"It's a stain on our history and the burden in our souls."
Brooks is a 71-year-old Georgia state congressman and a lifetime civil rights fighter.
In his eyes, the reconstruction of the event is a dramatic call to action. Every year, Monroe commemorates that justice has not been done enough.
"We demand judicial prosecution and closure of the case, we want calm in the mind and reconciliation, but justice first of all," said Brooks.
"Until then, the process of healing and reconciliation can not be initiated."
The jurist covers on July 27, 1946 one of the bodies of the lynching victims at Moore's Ford.
According to the FBI's NBC News news, up to 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding districts had to participate in the lynching.
However, no one has yet been prosecuted.
Despite the fact that the suspects remain for free for decades, civil rights adherents claim that both reasons for lynching - politics and sex - were known to all city residents.
In April 1946, at the decision of the Supreme Court, the residents of Georgia's blacks were the first to have the right to take part in the elections scheduled for the summer.
And during the summer elections, the FBI, Roger Malcom's black-skinned farmer, had been struck by Barnett Hester's white-haired landlords - allegedly for his wife.
In the city, according to Brooks, it was reported that Hester had coauthorized Dorothy with Malcom's wife and brought her to another state.
According to the FBI, on July 25, 1946, the landowner Loy Harrison, a prominent owner of white land plots, deposited $ 600 with Malcom.
Dorothy and cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey accompanied him.
Upon returning from the prison, just before entering the Moore's Ford Bridge, a group of suspects traveled to them.
"As it turned out, Harrison planned and organized the murders," the FBI concluded.
"It is also clear that there has been a secret agreement between state and local lawmakers who have not only been involved in lynching, but have also deprived of evidence and concealed the identity of witnesses."
Brooks made a brief statement on the matter.
"It was a massacre because of electoral law," he said.
"The murders had a clear connotation for all locals of black skin: this is how you hit when you register and go to vote."
An annual reconstruction of the event at Moore's Ford Bridge has been organized for almost ten years by Cassandra Greene.
Her performance is figurative, engaging and concise, showing a deeply rooted racism that many would like to see exalted in modern America.
Watching this reconstruction is not easy, and it's even harder to turn away from sight, but Greene says it makes sense.
"Nobody wants to talk about lynching because we have to face the unpleasant feelings that are hiding in each of us," Greene said.
"But there can be no relationship between us unless you understand what I have to go through."
The main rehearsals of this year's reconstruction began in June, and on the first day, approximately 30 actors - a dozen white people, the rest of the blacks - sputtered into a room where Greene met a very carefully planned show.
Wade Marbaugh serves as assistant director.
For many years Kukluxklan's leader has been playing, but in his words the role is exhaustive.
"I have a bad feeling because it's against who I am," said Marbaugh.
"I think it's very important to remind this part of history regularly because we never want to return to such a time."
The actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, who play the role of Roger Malcom, or Barnett Hester, rehearse their roles.
The show starts with a skirmish - Malcom arguing with Hester and blaming him for having slept with his wife.
"Get out of my land n-e!"
Rascona can not be.
There is a skirmish.
At that moment, everyone (at least every black actor) will burst into laughter.
Greene laughs at all the most.
"What happened?" Rascona says.
He is confused.
Was I too rude?
"No," Greene says cheerfully.
"I just do not think the Caucasians were saying that in such a tone."
"Exactly," one of the black-skinned actors said.
"You have to put more emphasis on R."
The energy in the room is suddenly better, hostility replaces the feeling of rapprochement.
Everyone wants the performance to be authentic, just to make it worth the four victims of the massacre.
The actors repeat the scene.
Rascona this time emphasizes the correct pronunciation of the word on N.
Now no one laughs.
The show ends violently and quickly.
Turn, shots ... and silence.
A woman dressed in black is standing over actors' bodies and singing Billie Holiday's "Strange Fruit" song.
With every word there is a sadness in the room.
Against this background, a dozen watchers wipe sweat and tears from their eyes.
The audience is practically the same number of blacks and whites.
One pair came from the Ithacy of New York, many of them are from nearby.
Each of them tolerates the local humid climate for almost eight hours and Brooks is in the crowd leading to the graves of Malcolm and Dorsey.
Until now, the murders could be seen with a distance, but now, standing in the same place where the lynching occurred, the atmosphere is scary.
With the last words of the song, Greene's crowd calls for inspection of the bodies.
Kids knelt to the victims' heads, watching fake blood and motionless bodies, whispering something in their ear.
"They are not dead," says the little boy.
It'll be a few minutes and Greene will thank the audience. It's over.
The actors clean the rope and rub their tears.
Bradshaw hugs Marbaugh, a man in a suit that played the leader of Kukluxklan.
Nick Rascona hugs his two actor-buddies and squirms in their arms, and emotions end up on him.
"That's all right," whispers one of the women.
"We know the role is wrong.
But you had reason for that. "
Later that day, the audience meets with actors for dinner.
At one table, a young Caucasian couple is passionately talking about a black couple performance they met today.
Denise Duplinski barely found words to express her sense of today's performance.
"It is difficult to listen to those ugly words and look at those abusive deeds ... which are made by people who look like you and do it because they look like you," she said for the reconstruction.
"It makes me realize that lynching is still an up-to-date subject," she added, "it's just called police skirmish."
Tyrone Brooks sits in the courthouse across the room, enjoying dinner and talking about civil rights.
In his own words, he has already begun to plan for the next year.
"Reconstruction of these events is inspiring, as it describes the fear we had to experience - but it is also a moment to think," he said.
"If we do not learn from it, who knows ... it could happen again.
People who do not know and do not understand the history of their country are doomed to repeat it. "
I love the instructions for use.
One friend of mine says that the instruction manuals are read only scrabble.
I do not agree, on the contrary.
It is one of the modern forms of art, often pure surrealism.
With nostalgia I remember the past, where the instruction to use anything was rather a rare phenomenon.
So my first gramophone contained only one paper on which hieroglyphs were showing the involvement of some components, all of which were some of the secret signs.
When something went wrong within years, I offered the letter to a shaman who was not afraid to unscrew the backboard.
With a grin he advised me what the labyrinth of paper was suitable for.
Yes, it was a common aid in the chronic depletion of toilet paper.
He could easily find a broken wire and allow me to listen to expensive vinyl badges again.
The New Age has brought new guides.
Even the relatively simple fruit juice, where it simply held the skewed grep, required about ten pictures.
Especially good was a sketch with a description of how to insert one piece into another.
The set was two-part, and a different procedure was simply not possible.
To do so required a considerable effort with the need to break some plastic parts.
My despising tutorials ended with my Seat Leon self-drive.
The 2003 production year still had such a booklet with instructions for minor repairs, including the replacement of the light bulb.
It was easy.
A total of three steps and work should be done.
Unfortunately, the author of the manual failed to state that while the bulb on the right was to be replaced in only three steps.
1. Remove the cover.
2. Unscrew the broken bulb and screw in a new one.
3. Slide the cover.
The bulb on the left had a problem with the placement of the battery cover.
At first I thought that by inserting the right upper limb into the chassis of the car, I find some spring, a screw that can easily slide off that cover and then I will follow points 1-3 of the economical author of the service book.
Footbridge error.
That cover had no place, no space for the slender Cinderella, let alone the obese Slezan.
I lost half an hour of my life, completely without any success.
The situation was further enhanced by my wife's entry into the garage, which he summoned the sign and the words he heard from my mouth quite exceptionally.
"What are you doing here?" She asked softly.
My answer lasted about 90 seconds, but if I skipped vulgar terms, there were only two publishable words remaining.
I change the bulb.
"Why is it so long?" She said with a sentence that might be her last in a long-lived volume.
Slowly, I explained the problem to her, emphasizing the torture of the author of the manual, where the burning of hot iron on her hand, which she wrote, and finally her resignation to never write anything, was just an introduction to a wide range of Witch Hammer instructions, including his comisic burning on the top of Losinský zámek.
"What about removing the box?" The woman said, removing the battery.
In clear despair, and then step 1-3 was as easy and fast as the right side.
I thought nothing could surprise me.
And the day I called a colleague who was just about to collapse after checking two officers of the State Drug Control Service.
I know him as a colleague of a balanced man, who has experienced both impossible and impossible in the field, and who can interpret wild stories in an uninterrupted voice.
"Imagine being fined for not having a handwashing instruction," he said in a low voice.
Gradually, I drew the whole problem out of the fact that he had no pictorial instructions on how to wash his hands over the sink on the patient's toilet.
His counseling officer's argument that adults usually wash their hands and that the need for pictograms to handle the worthy activity of decent people did not have a healing effect and cost him a lot of money.
"It's not so," she told him.
He understood that the simple rinsing of the flooded palms with running water is a primitive act at the level of the Cromanon that the modern man, Homo sapiens sapiens, performs this ceremony in ten steps.
So it is necessary to tell you that it is necessary to let the water go out of the tap.
The whole process has a total of eleven points, but at the end it is a joyous finding that you have washed your hands just as the SUDC hosudar orders it.
Finally, I must say that I was inspired and prepared a detailed plan for toilet activity.
In terms of defecation, the procedure is unified, there is no problem, urination, due to certain differences of both sexes, it will be necessary to give instructions two.
The pictograms remain a problem, because the perfect procedure means an accurate drawing of all the anatomical details, which could provoke a certain outrage for a prudent visitor to the toilet, despite the fact that he can finally learn that he was wiping the hole in the course of his whole life in a completely wrong way.
Pearson will release another 3000 employees and reduce the dividend in an effort to revive business
British education group Pearson on Friday said it would release another 3000 employees and reduce the interim dividend by 72 percent in response to another restructuring program to change the business model.
Another wave of layoffs, which, according to Executive Director John Fallon, will occur at the end of 2018 and early 2019, is preceded by a previous decision by the company to dismiss 4,000 employees as part of a previous restructuring.
Pearson announced a cost reduction plan for another £ 300m ($ 394 million) in May under the third cost reduction program to resurrect declining trade as a result of the rapid development of digital education.
The company, which last month agreed to sell its stake in Penguin Random House to Bertelsmann, said the outlook for this year remained unchanged after announcing a one-percent increase in core sales in the first half of the year to £ 2.05 billion.
Attack on Kabul Convoy: NATO soldiers were killed in a suicide blast
A suicide bomber attacked a military convoy in Afghanistan's capital Kabul, and one NATO soldier died and several others were injured, official officials said.
Five soldiers and an interpreter were injured, says NATO.
According to unofficial reports in the assault in the Qarabagh district, three civilians also died.
This month, Afghanistan was hit by a bomb attack - on Tuesday, more than 30 people were killed in a heist mosque explosion.
On Monday, a suicide attacker killed two people near the Iraqi Embassy in Kabul.
NATO said in its statement that Tuesday's explosion occurred after a patrol with members of the Afghan army was attacked by a "local person with home-made explosive devices."
The statement also states that all injured soldiers are out of danger to life and are in an American military hospital at Bagram Air Base.
According to the rapporteurs, the growing power of the Taliban and groups known as the Islamic State (IS) in the Qarabagh region is a major source of concern for NATO allied forces in nearby Bagram.
According to the UN, in Afghanistan, at least 1662 civilians died in the first half of 2017, of which 20% died in the capital.
At the end of July, he killed a bomb in a car of at least 30 people in Shia Kabul district.
The Taliban entered the attack.
May 31 killed a big burglary in the city center of more than 150. It is the deadliest militant attack in the country since US troops overthrew the Taliban government in 2001.
Violence undermines the already dubious situation in Afghanistan, and US President Donald Trump is considering increasing the number of US soldiers to help military units and police in the country.
According to the rapporteurs, the suicide bombings they have overcome in recent weeks with public confidence in the government, its regulations, and especially the reputation of President Ashraf Ghanin.
The EPA, in response to the lawsuit, reassessed its decision to delay the smoking rules
The US Environmental Protection Agency has revoked its decision to postpone the Obama administration's law, which ordered states to cut emissions, just one day after the agency sued 15 states.
EPA announced on Wednesday night its decision to submit the "Ozone Standards 2015" with the words that it represents the agency's commitment to cooperating with states.
"We believe in a dialogue with our state partners and listen to their views," said CEO Scott Pruitt in a statement.
In June, Pruitt announced EPA's efforts to postpone ozone standards - measuring actual air pollution in specific areas of the country, and setting limits to be met by October 2018 on the basis of measurements.
A group of fifteen of most of the democratic states, along with Washington, DC, filed suit on Tuesday, arguing that the EPA's conduct is illegal.
President Donald Trump's administration is seeking to avoid many environmental regulations proposed by former President Barack Obama - according to Trump's words in an attempt to kick-start economic growth.
But the new government's struggle has begun counter-measures on the part of Democrats and Conservatives who fear the impact of emissions on public health.
EPA says on its websites that airborne ozone-depleted air can "reduce lung function and increase respiratory symptoms," such as asthma.
Singer Ladislav Bubnár got shot and blood flowed!
This is a relatively new singer in this country, which we have already recorded in June of this year, when this unusual singer of Czechoslovakia hosted a monstrous event in Czech Republic, hosted by leading figures such as Master Karel Gott, Lucie Bila, Simona Krainová and many others.
The purpose was simple, to show to the public and to present his music video clip to the song Sara, whose baptism was performed by the just-mentioned personalities.
Little is known, however, that the shooting of a video clip that was taking place in Russia was not without problems and the singer Ladislav Bubnár himself had to be treated.
It was his first big shoot with the stars of the Russian national ballet and did not go without a real trap.
The song Sara is very emotional and is based on the unhappy love of two lovers.
For the dramatic scenes, the singer's squeeze in the video clip had to indicate the punch strike.
At one point, however, he struck him so strongly and directly into the nose that the young singer had to be treated by doctors.
"It was a blow, I did not expect it, my blood was instantly triggered," Ladislav commented on the situation.
The colleagues and the producers said that the situation was unfortunate and Ladislav failed to react in time.
Fortunately, the injury was not so serious to affect the continuation of the next shoot.
We bring you the video clip of a young artist, you can record that scene with a stroke.
Unfortunately, the bleeding version was not used.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko spoke at a meeting about the possibilities of a mutual duel
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, two boxers who could pitch the most exciting lightweight boxing match, met for the first time on Tuesday's meeting.
Each of them was in a separate room at ESPN offices in Los Angeles until Garcia, a lightweight World Boxing Council lightweight champion, did not come down to the lobby where he welcomed Lomachena, a World Boxing Organization champion.
After Garcia's victory, on the basis of a unanimous decision against former four-time world champion Adrien Broner on Saturday's Showtime Show, both boxers got on the list of the top five lightweight boxers.
Garcia stretched his right and said, "How is it, champion?
Good luck. "
Lomačenko defends his title against Miguel Marriaga on ESPN on Saturday at 19:00.
Boxers pose for photographers and Lomachene's manager Egis Klimas adds that a potential boxing match would be a "perfect test".
"I'm a former springweight champion," adds Garcia.
"For a fight with Broner (67 kg) I had to pick up, but I'm not that big.
On my 63 kg I'm small.
I would like to go back to the lightweight category.
Lomachenko must pick up again to get lightweight ... then we can fight.
After that the fans longed.
Why not do it. "
Lomačenko agrees.
"The boxing would have been successful."
Klimas has called for a pay-per-view payment - part of his strategy, Lomačenko should make his lightweight debut at the end of this year and compete next year with Garcia (37-0, 30 knockouts), who also expressed an interest in defeating duel Jorge Linares vs. Luke Campbell on September 23 for the Lightweight title in the Forum Arena.
"The match should be in the form of pay-per-view, that's what fans are asking for," said Garcia, who later said he was open to the opportunity to broadcast the match through a television station that would come up with the best offer.
"We are the main attraction.
No one else will attract such attention.
We will wait for the right opportunity ... "
Garcia said he recognized Lomachenko as "a great boxer" and could attend his Saturday match.
Lomachenko did not catch up with Garcia's laugh when he said the Riverside division's champion looked "very slow ... sorry for Mike, but you're thinking about a knockout."
Garcia said his goal was to show strength and then boxing.
The two boxers said they felt rising tensions against each other.
"You will not forget this fight.
No other match attracts so much attention.
And I will put a great deal of fire in the fire, "Garcia said.
Lomačenko said, "I was waiting for the best boxers and this is Mikey."
It will be a great match. "
The young couple disappeared without a trace 12 years ago.
Their car was now found at the bottom of the Volga.
A pair of young Russians Ilja Zirnov and Kira Cherkasov have been missing since December 2005.
There was an extensive search for them, but without success.
Finally, the police terminated the investigation for lack of evidence.
The families of the lost couple lived in the uncertainty that they did not know what the couple had done.
After 12 years, the sad ending of the whole story has come.
The wreck of their car found a lay diver on the bottom of the Volga river in the town of Cheboksary in Chuvash.
Only with the documents left in the car the police managed to identify the couple.
Documents survived the entire decade underwater without them taking much longer to find out the identity of the police.
The couple was last seen when Zirnov borrowed a car from his father to pick up his girlfriend from work.
The diver who discovered the car remains anonymous so far.
He reported his findings to the Police of Czechoslovakia, which the next day the car pulled into the beach.
Investigators believe that the death of a young couple was an accident caused by a frosty path across the river.
However, the investigation continues, and further details will be published after its closure.
Latest test results to determine the age limit for asylum applications in Sweden
The latest test results of asylum seekers in Sweden who have been subjected to a new method of assessing their age show that over 80 percent of respondents were 18 years old, but not everyone believes their accuracy.
The Swedish Forensic Medicine Agency (RÃ¤ttsmedicinalverket) has begun a new test at the beginning of this year.
The purpose of the method is to assess candidates more precisely when assessing asylum applications, and the measure was taken after the Migrationsverket was criticized for failing to determine the correct age of some refugees who lied about their age.
To date, the Swedish Migration Agency handed over 6,880 cases and the Forensic Medical Agency has now published a total of 2481 tests conducted from mid-March to 31 July 2017.
80 percent (2002) were judged to be over 18, while in the next 25 cases the Forensic Medical Agency considered that the interviewee was "maybe over 18 years of age".
In the next 423 cases, it was decided that the interviewee was "perhaps under 18 years of age".
Testing is only available if the age of the interviewee is questionable.
According to Johan Gransson of the Forensic Medical Agency, the results correspond to the previous month.
"Compared to last month, the statistics are kept in the halls and numbers are very similar," he told The Local.
Higher numbers of applicants whose age was estimated at the age of 18 do not necessarily mean that asylum seekers are lying about their age.
In May, the agency released the results of 581 tests, saying that in 442 cases it was found that "the interviewee is 18 years or older".
The Svenska Dagbladet newspaper investigated 581 reported cases and found that in 243 cases the respondent said he would be 18 years old.
Criticisms have also been made of a medical method of age determination that includes x-rays of wisdom teeth and MRI scans of knee joints, which are then assessed by dentists and radiologists.
One of the skeptics is Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute, who is also involved in assessing people's biological maturity to determine the age at which puberty passed.
"I had reason to think about this issue and I do not think these types of measurements to judge age are correct.
Assessing the biological age is somewhat uncertain in a sense.
If we can not accurately determine age, we should not pretend otherwise, "Metro said for the newspaper.
Agency's Gransson's forensic medical agency advocated the decision: "Generally speaking, the risk of an incorrect assessment of a child as an adult is small.
The highest risk is that the interviewee is just below the age of 18, which in this case accounts for 10 percent of all respondents. "
Trump threatened the President of Mexico by phone.
US President Donald Trump in a phone call to Mexico's Enrique Penny Niet threatened that he would not meet him if he publicly said that his country would not pay for building a wall between the US and Mexico.
Trump said in an interview that funding would somehow be arranged, although he admitted that it would have to be secured from other sources.
Similarly, Trump also spoke with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull.
This follows from the transcripts of the interviews that the US daily The Washington Post published on Thursday.
Trump has made the construction of a wall on the southern Mexican border a major promise in his campaign last year.
In the very first interview with the Mexican President, shortly after taking on Trump, Niño was undiscriminatingly rebuking himself for criticizing his wallbuilding plan.
Describing the southern neighbor as a growing political issue, and urging the Mexican President not to publicly say that his government would never pay for the wall.
"You can not say this to the press," Trump said in a January 27 interview and threatened to break contacts with the Mexican President if he continued to issue defiant statements.
Funding is supposed to be somehow invented, and eventually it will go well.
"But if you say that Mexico will not pay for the wall, then I do not want to associate with you anymore because it is unacceptable to me," he said, according to the American daily Trump.
The wall has been called the least important thing we talk about, but politically perhaps the most important thing.
The executive order to build the Trump wall was issued shortly after taking power.
Mexico is rejecting the construction and financing of a 3200-kilometer-long wall, so the relations between the two countries have also shrunk.
At the end of March, Trump said the project would still be paying the United States.
Trump eventually met his Mexican counterpart for the first time at the G20 summit in Hamburg in July.
The Washington Post also reported on Trump's phone conversation with Australian Prime Minister Turnbull on January 28th.
White House Chief called the conversation ridiculous.
That conclusion led him to an exchange of views on the agreement that Australia would grant asylum to Central American refugees in exchange for the United States accepting persons from internment facilities in the Pacific Island States.
Trump considered the deal at first to be stupid, but later approached it.
"You can certainly say that this is not the deal you have created, but you will have to stick to it," Trump Turnbull said.
In some passages, the telephone conversation with Turnbull was almost jovial, for example, when Trump appreciated as a good idea the Australian refusal to accept refugees arriving in boats.
"You're worse than me," said Trump.
Suddenly the tone of the conversation sharpened.
"I hate accepting these people," said Trump.
I assure you they are bad.
That's why they're in prison now.
"They will not be great people going to work for the local dairy," he said.
He also said in a conversation that a fugitive may become a Boston assassin in five years.
Trump headed at the end of January, roughly a week after coming to the White House, telephone conversations with a number of world statesmen, often several days later.
The call to Turnbull finally marked him as the least comfortable for the day.
Before concluding, he stressed that he had a pleasant conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin before.
In front of the crowd, they executed the killer Rana.
He was watching her father.
The execution took place on the square in the capital Yemen Saná.
Muhammad al-Maghrabi chose for his victim a little Rana Almatari, who lived in his neighborhood.
Al Maghrabi kidnapped the girl, took her father's house where she raped her and strangled his bare hands.
She then raped her body, which then moved near the mosque.
The violent death of a small girl has hit the entire country facing the threat of civil war.
Yahya Almatari was first of all a thousand-year-old crowd who met to witness the execution.
Muhammad al Maghrabi was sentenced to Sharia law.
After the execution, the victim's father communicated his feelings to the media.
I feel like a newborn.
I was relieved.
It's the new day of my life.
The other members of the family were present, along with the crowd, shouting out the phrase "live justice."
The gunman in the square brought a police van from which he was dragged.
The policemen tied him to his belly.
One of the members turned his weapon against him, firing fire from the immediate vicinity.
The present crowd celebrated each blow that was burned.
Mr. Almatari told the MailOnline site that justice was done in accordance with the country's legal system.
"Justice, Allah and the Sharia Law have won," he added.
I stood at the Liberation Square in Sana and waited for the execution of my daughter's murderer.
Then we and my family went to the morgue.
We took Ranino a small body and buried him in a nearby cemetery.
Both me and my wife Jamileh are grateful that justice has been done.
The police were afraid that the crowd gathered in the square would fall into hate madness, the killer grabbed and gassed.
Execution was ordered by a court that is under the management of Shiite Houti.
Originally, however, Maghrabi was sentenced to 100 beats when he was arrested, but his act aroused such an outrage that the judge had chosen the death penalty.
Al Maghrabi was arrested two days after the girl's disappearance on June 27th.
Ranina's family knew him well.
When the police searched the cellar of his house, she found evidence that the man planned his act.
Mr. Almatari described him as a creature.
What could be his motive?
Even the beast would be more merciful to Ran.
"Our family has no enemies, and the wounds that Ranino's body was carrying were terrible," he told the media.
"Rana disappeared in the afternoon, we reported it to the police that day, we told the newspapers and all our TV stations, the posters with her photo were hanging everywhere," he continued.
Everyone thinks the police got a tip from the murdering parents who suspected their son of horror.
The girl's mother, Jamileh, had to be hospitalized after learning that her daughter's body had been found.
Rana went out to play with the other children in the neighborhood.
After 10-15 minutes, I went to see where she was.
We were looking everywhere, but Rana was gone.
We walked around our block, our friends took cars and drove around, but we were looking in vain.
The Yemeni residents were disgusted with the crime and began gathering in front of the police station where al Maghrabi was held and demanding immediate punishment.
A representative of the Justice Department read the record of the investigation into the crowd to calm them down.
The accused apparently did not show regret over his deed.
Just before the sentence, the police read the sentence, but the convict only glanced briefly at his executioner.
The whole event was shot for national television, but many recordings were made on the Internet that the crowd had taken.
The Governor of West Virginia announced the change of political party
The Democratic Governor of West Virginia, Jim Justice, announced on Thursday evening at President Trump's Assembly that he was moving to another party.
"Whether you like it or not, the Democrats have turned their backs on me," said Governor Justice.
"Today, after a long prayer and reflection, I announce to you ... Today, as a resident of West Virginia, I say that I can no longer support you as a democratic governor."
The crowd of viewers exploded in joy.
"Tomorrow, I'll join the Republicans," Justice added.
"As a coach, I can tell you it's time to jump into another match."
Trump has previously promised people in the West Virginia Assembly an important announcement.
Trump won in West Virginia with 42 points and Justice did not support Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice, who, according to Forbes magazine, is the only billionaire across the country, was elected in 2016.
Forbes adds that Justice has inherited large assets from his father and is the owner of several coal mines.
The value of his property is estimated at $ 1.59 billion.
On Thursday evening, the Republican National Committee issued a statement stating: "Governor Justice overrun is another blow to a democratic party that puts obstacles in our way rather than making our country up."
"For a democratic party that has only 15 governors and controls the least legislators in history, the Governor Justice's announcement is the last drop for a now wandering party without a leader who vainly seeks to find a positive and unifying message," RNC chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said in her statement to CBS News.
Sebastian Coe praises Russia's "sincere" apology for a doping scandal
Former excellent athlete Sebastian Coe praised Russia on Thursday for a sincere apology for a doping scandal, but repeated again that the time has not yet come for Russia to return to the sporting world.
Dmitry Shylakhtin, the head of Russian athletics, said at the IAAF Congress - which was held on the eve of the World Athletics Championships - that the expulsion of his country from the sport world was right and that he was determined to fight doping.
He apologized "to all athletes who lost gold and silver medals in this way."
Despite his comments, members of the IAAF Congress voted to maintain the ban that came into force in November 2015 after a World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) report showed that Russia was promoting doping to its athletes.
"I think today we have witnessed a very sincere response and presentation," IAAF President Sebastian Coe told reporters.
"All the members of the council and the congress were pleasantly surprised that Russia had confessed its error and was working hard to correct and restore the proper functioning of the entire federation."
Coe said he was also "pleased" that Russia had accepted the criteria for its reintroduction.
"I think that today is very good and we have advanced to the next level, but the Congress supports the recommendation of the Crisis Staff to maintain the punishment that was ruled out for Russia," Coe added.
"In the coming months, we must do everything we can to stabilize the situation.
Our aim has always been to separate honest athletes from those dishonest, "he concluded his speech.
At the World Athletics Championships, which begins on Friday in London, 19 Russian athletes who have complied with the strict IAAF rules will compete under the neutral flag.
IAAF Crisis Chief of Staff, Rune Andersen, said on Monday that Russia still has to meet several criteria before being admitted back.
Drug tests are still unsatisfactory, and excluded coaches continue to operate, told reporters in London after the IAAF Council's presentation.
The State Order CzechTrade was acquired by František Savov, whose state is prosecuted.
The public order of the state export agency CzechTrade was acquired by the publishing house Mladá fronta František Savov.
Officials gave him 100 percent points in all qualitative criteria.
They did not mind the fact that the Czech state is prosecuting Savova for tax evasion and demanding his extradition to the Czech Republic.
The export agency of the Ministry of Industry and Trade, CzechTrade, announced in April a public contract for the four-year provision of editorial content for BusinessInfo.
The order of a total value of 30.8 million crowns was awarded to the entrepreneur František Savov, the Mladá fronta publishing house.
That's what the Czech police have accused of tax evasion in 2014 and is running away.
Savov fled to Great Britain and the Czech Republic is requesting his release.
The case was highlighted by Aktuálně.cz server.
The award of the contract was based on 60% of the price offered and the 40th beauty contest, the quality of the project.
The second criterion was greatly helped by Savov's company.
According to information, Dotyk.cz received 100 points in all partial quality criteria.
This was the result of a move to another candidate, the Vltava Labe Media VLM publishing house, which offered a better price.
While Mladá fronta operated with CZK 404,900 a month, VLM offered CZK 324,350.
Unlike the Mladá fronta, however, the judges received all the qualitative criteria below the average score of 62 points.
The tender was also attended by the consultancy company BDO Advisory and the R-Media digital agency, which is the same as the Aktuálně.cz server under the Economia publisher.
VLM publishes several objections to the outcome of the tender, considering its assessment to be unfair and insufficiently substantiated.
After their refusal, they decided to contest the competition with the Office for the Protection of Competition.
He considers that CzechTrade has acted in violation of the law.
"The petitioner is convinced that the contracting authority made a decision on the selection of a public procurement contractor on the basis of a purely subjective assessment, clearly favoring a participant of the Mladá fronta, a.s., to the detriment of the petitioner and other suppliers," the draft law on the opening of proceedings submitted to the ÚOHS this week.
According to Michal Klíma, CEO and Chairman of the VLM, the scoring committee's scoring seems to be extremely suspicious as a credible and 100% evaluation of the Mladá fronta project by all its members.
"Every independent observer must consider such a miraculous success of one of the competitors as unlikely and suspect," Klima said.
CzechTrade has not yet commented on the situation.
The CzechTrade agency does not comment on the public contracts before closing them.
All information about the above-mentioned contract is published in the Profile of the Contracting Authority and in the Public Procurement Notice in accordance with the law.
"After the completion of the contract, the full written report will be published, but during the term of the contract we can not comment on it," Štěpán Dlouhý, media agent for Dotyk.cz, said.
Mladá fronta responded with a statement that it considers it extremely problematic that the Economia publishing house hit an article in Aktuálně.cz in a competition where it has its own business interests.
However, that fact was mentioned in that article.
The tender could have helped her to provide her with the BusinessInfo Editorial Services portal over the past four years.
The contract was first auctioned in 2013 when the Department of Industry and Trade led Martim Kuba ODS.
Frantisek Savov blamed the police for tax evasion in connection with excessive VAT deductions for his companies, which caused the Czech state alleged damage of up to 770 million crowns.
The Czech Republic has been requesting the UK to issue it as early as 2014.
According to Savov, the head of the ANO movement, Andrej Babiš, is behind his criminalization, under the influence of the publishing house Mafra.
London's court last year dismissed Savov's appeal against the issue, but the businessman appealed.
"From our point of view, the case has not moved since last year, and we have not received any notification from the UK yet," Štěpánka Zenklová, a spokesman for the Prague City Prosecutor's Office, told Aktuálně.cz.
Apart from ownership of the Young Front, Savov was part of Harvestor Limited, based in Cyprus, which dominated the Samson Ceska Budejovice brewery, and in the Cypriot company Maraflex, which is profiled as an investment fund, buying endangered assets.
Heavier Machinery Services, formerly Legios, owed more than three billion crowns.
In the past Savov was also associated with the transfer of property from the former Socialist Youth Union.
The biker ride along the sidewalks and the park, ending in the tumbling.
The biker caught his attention with a ruthless ride along the streets, pavements and park paths in Úsovice.
When the patrol began to haunt him, he decided to drive in the direction of the Station.
"Police officers persecuted the city with caution when on one of the trips to Marianske Lazne he did not manage and he entered the field with a motorcycle, where he crashed," said police spokesman Daniel Dvořák.
Finally, the rescue helicopter had to arrive to the accident, which was carried to the Pilsen hospital by the wounded motorcyclist.
Eventually the police found that the biker did not own a driving license, the registration marks on the motorcycle were stolen, its production number cut and the production label itself removed.
It is possible that the machine was stolen.
The origin of the motorcycle is subject to further investigation.
"By the breath test, the presence of alcohol in the driver's seat was avoided, but the test found positive results for methamphetamine," the police spokesman added.
How the financial rules of football will affect the transfer of Neymara to Paris
Rules limiting the funding of European football clubs will not interfere with Neymar's record transfer from Barcelona to Paris-Saint Germain, France.
Any penalty for Paris Saint-Germain will be implemented by EUFA, which oversees European football teams and has the power to ban teams from participating in the prestigious Champions League.
The fair play (FFP) rules introduced by UEFA in 2011 state that the PSG will have to prove that Neymar's transfer was not funded without major losses.
Barcelona has paid € 222 million just to redeem Neymara from his contract, and Neymar will demand a salary of several tens of millions of dollars a year.
Here are some financial terms for Neymar's transfer to France.
Given that the PSG team is funded by a wealthy Qatar family who has become wealthier in energy sales, he can afford to bring Neymara to the already star soccer family.
Clubs can spend huge amounts on the purchase of players, but on the other hand they have to prove their legal sources of income, which allows them to cover the overhead costs of football-related business activities.
The FFP was introduced by Michel Platini after being appointed to the Director of UEFA in 2007.
A former French player believed that the clubs that are indebted in pursuit of new debt reinforcements are ultimately cheating and risking bankruptcy if banks or owners refuse to secure it.
In 2011, FFP redirected its attention to club debt to monitor its losses.
This change meant that the business model used by Roman Abramovich and Chelsea in 2003 - to buy a club with the potential and spend the sums over the gamer to build a global brand - was not as advantageous at one time.
Under the current three-year trial period ending in 2018, clubs may incur a loss of up to € 30 million.
And despite the fact that Platini had to leave his post in 2015, his successor Aleksander Ceferin is determined to defend the prohibition of overpayment.
"The FFP rules are still valid and we are committed to strengthening them in the future," Andrea Traverso, who supervises compliance with the FFP rules, told the Associated Press last week.
Although PSG has paid Neymara's redemption amount in a one-off payment, it may spend the amount for accounting purposes for the full duration of the contract.
Neymar signed a five-year contract so that the transfer can be broken down to € 44.4 million annually for five years.
The first wave of the highest FFP sanctions hit PSG in 2014 with Manchester City, which owns the Abu Dhabi group.
PSG issued a fine of € 60 million ($ 82 million) - which was later reduced to € 20 million - and an order to reduce the Champions League team to 21 players in the 2014-2015 season, instead of 25 players.
UEFA looks out for teams that might try to circumvent financial regulators by raising their income through club-owner companies.
Even though the Qatar company sponsors the PSG, once funding exceeds the standard market rate, UEFA has the right to disallow the bill.
A similar move was made by UEFA in 2014 after it decided that the amount of funds provided by the Qatar Tourism Authority to the PSG team was too high.
Part of Neymar's earnings in PSG could be reportedly paid by MS in 2022 in Qatar.
PSG and MS 2022 in Qatar have denied fat that Neymat should become Ambassador of the World Cup and that such a maneuver would easily reveal UEFY officials.
Past penalties imposed on PSG mean that UEFA will closely monitor any attempt to circumvent the rules,
According to Tuesday's insiders, UEFA did not initiate any investigation into the transfer of Neymara to PSG.
The source of this report wished to remain anonymous because he is not entitled to comment on the PSG situation, The Associated Press reported.
The latest published financial statements show that the PSG closed 2015-2016 with a net profit of EUR 10 million and a turnover of EUR 542.4 million.
The financial statements for the current financial year have not yet been published.
The PSG expects the arrival of Neymara to be a huge opportunity for sponsors, merchandising and the sale of jerseys.
The club promises to increase turnover by up to 30 percent from signing the contract.
Spanish League officials, apparently concerned about the departure of one of the biggest stars, have sought to ruin Neymar's departure, arguing that the PSG would violate the rules of the FFP.
"It is a clear case of" financial doping "of the club and the state," said President Liga Javier Teba for the Spanish newspaper AS, referring to the ownership of the PSG club by the Qatari Syndicate.
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, whose club owns an American sports mogul, shares La Liga's same attitude towards club funding.
"It's the result of ownership that has changed the football world for the past 15 years," Wenger said on Thursday.
"Once the club owner becomes a member, everything is possible.
Compliance with the rules of financial fair play is very difficult because the state may have different interests in the participation of such players in its club. "
Spartan midfielder Rosicky: Changes are painful, but we have to believe.
Sixteen thousand applauding fans on their feet.
Tomáš Rosický is pleased.
Same scene as in the Sunday match against Bohemians.
The Spartan midfielder shuffled the Crvené Zvezda game, made several goals but his teammates did not go into the black.
The Letensk team, pumped by the new multimillion-dollar reinforcements, ends after the opening doubles in the European Cups.
Was it hard to make a fight with Belgrade?
After the goal was scored, four had to score, which was hard for us.
At least we did not want to play, to gain confidence, so that we can get away from the next games.
We had some chances.
We have to work together as a team to move our game.
Why has Sparta not been able to get to the match so long?
The game is awesome.
The combination of the opponent was much better than ours.
We did not get anywhere, half-time we fired once.
This is, of course, very little when you have to win two or three goals.
The second half was much better, we managed to play with them in the final third.
But you have to push opponents more often into such positions.
Is there a problem with a large number of changes in the report?
Of course, it is one of the pains when a new team is formed.
We have only played three games and the team is still changing.
It's about the coach to find the perfect eleven that suits.
Is it encouraging for you to have played part of two games consecutively?
They're still just parts of the game.
I do not know how my status will develop and when I can play from the beginning.
Are you still optimistic about the changes that occurred in Sparta?
We have to be, otherwise we can not.
It's the same as with injuries.
If you do not believe it, you can not go back.
Sparta has somehow decided, we have to be optimistic, otherwise the situation will be even worse.
The fans came again in large numbers, but they were embarrassed.
What can you tell them?
There was an amazing visit again, just like with Bohemia.
I'm so sorry we can not make them happy with better performance.
Show something for what they will come next.
We can thank them for coming.
I do not remember such visits when I played here fifteen years ago.
Can the season without cups be at least an advantage for the league?
So far we fight with ourselves, we play, so it's not such an advantage for us.
For an extreme tax evasion, the entrepreneur has to sit for ten years.
The Constitutional Court dismissed the complaint by entrepreneur Jiří Toman, who is to serve a substantial amount of tax cuts for ten years in prison.
Imputed damage amounts to 645 million crowns.
Toman in the complaint claimed that justice violated his fundamental rights, the factual findings of the courts in Zlín and Olomouc are said to be incomplete.
However, the Constitutional Judges dismissed the complaint as unfounded, CTK found out of the court database.
The IC is not another appeal court.
"It can not as a fourth instance assess the factual or legal misconduct allegedly committed by the ordinary courts if they do not constitute a violation of constitutionally protected rights and freedoms," the resolution says.
Toman was tried as a fugitive.
The verdict is final from November 2015, when the Supreme Court in Olomouc confirmed it.
At that time, Toman was in custody in Argentina, where he found himself at the time of the US ruling.
The imposed penalty is at the upper limit of the statutory rate, which according to the verdict corresponds to the damage incurred.
The High Court described the case as an extreme tax evasion that has only a macroeconomic impact on the state budget.
Man served from 2005 to 2008 as Chairman of the World Servis Board of Directors.
Damage of 645 million crowns came only from January to July 2008, the total leak according to the expert exceeded one billion.
For procedural reasons, however, it was no longer possible to judge Toman for the full amount.
According to the indictment, World Servis has not included any invoices in its tax returns.
Instead of monthly VAT levies and excise duties in the order of at least tens of millions of crowns, taxes were paid in just a few hundreds of thousands.
World Servis and some of the companies that the company traded with are related to entrepreneur Radomir Vybíral, who has judged 13 years in jail for VAT-handling machineries.
The Constitutional Court also rejected his complaint.
Serials "Summer to Survive" and "Comrade Detective" play on a nostalgic string
This iteration of the story is nostalgic both for the characters of the famous 1980s and for the dirty 1990s (when the geniuses David Wain and Michael Showalter introduced the comedy sketch "The State" on MTV) and, of course, even for modern times, 2001, before stars like Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd snuck into bigger projects.
As a cultural artifact, it is a light parody as well as the embodiment of our modern facebook era of permanent memories.
From a franchise look, it looks like someone is breathing.
"First Day of Camp" has worked surprisingly well - not only because of the absurdity of humor (an example of this being the story of the emergence of a tin can of vegetables by Jon Jon Benjamin).
The authors diverged from the main humorous point - middle-aged actors playing teenage horny children - and could not be tired of previous events.
The sequel to "Ten Years Later," in which mature adults do not push so much on the emotional plane and satire, is sometimes sporadic, including the 90s thriller parody as "Hand on the Cradle".
At one point, the character finds Apple Powerbook junk, roller skates and "a bunch of other things in 1991" on the pile.
Many major story lines are repeated.
Good-hearted Coop (Mr. Showalter), now a writer, still did not translate over his love for Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) is still panic.
Not to mention the crazy plot that includes Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter), inspired by George H. W. Bush (very well occupied by Michael Ian Black).
As always, the best part of the franchise is many side stories.
It's especially fun to watch Elderly Long-haired young man alias Matt Dillon's character from the movie Young, whose once respected character Andy is now behind the old pepper.
Franchise could trigger moments of accidental madness, such as the return of the Seven Up series, until it reaches what I suppose will be a logical release: "Twenty Years Later," when the entire group will be released for the premiere "Summer to Not Life" in the last scene.
"Comrade Detective" at Amazon in the meantime appeals to another type of nostalgia: the Cold War revival of the series "Such Normal Americans," "Atomic Blonde: No Regret", and even the "GLOW" series where the eastern and western wrestling scene icons collide.
The comedy of Brian Gatewood and Alessandra Tanaka, directed by Rhythm Thomas, is to act as a TV show: a drama about two Romanian Bucharest policemen from the 1980s fighting for truth and atheism in the way of Marxism-Leninism.
The main role - tough Gregor and Iosef idealist - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Ulica, who chanted the English language Channing Tatum (executive producer of the series) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
It's a great idea.
Unfortunately, this is not much more.
For some jokes, you're laughing (like police watching chess on TV - a parody of American football).
The series was given to many famous actors - including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny.
"Comrade Detective" is too focused on the awkward propaganda drama - which includes Reagan's masked killer - and that's what it looks like.
Six long episodes are too long and comical moments are not enough.
For a shorter footage, the propaganda satire in Comrade Detective could work, as in a scene where Gregor and Iosef repeatedly visit the US Embassy, in whose hall two fatheads are banging burgers stacked on a large pile.
A clear message for the imaginative Communist audience is the fact that western culture can transform everything into food and orgy.
Invincible Romanian creators are not mistaken: we do so with our own culture as well as with theirs.
Russian athletes did not stop the IAAF start-up ban.
The IAAF International Athletics Federation at the London Congress confirmed the extension of the international ban on the start of Russian racers due to the state-sponsored doping program.
The voting in the world championship, which begins on Friday, was very clear as expected.
The prolongation of the ban was expressed by 166 delegates, against only 21 votes.
The main reason for the rejection is that Russia fails to meet all the requirements for the introduction of the anti-doping system, as noted by the IAAF Special Review Group chief Rune Andersen.
His group recommended that the ban continue.
Some older doping cases remain unresolved, a number of suspected athletes have not yet been heard, and coaches are still working in the country with a rumored reputation.
Russia's anti-doping agency RUSADA, which does not meet the standards of the World Anti-Doping Agency, is not yet fully operational.
However, RUSADA may undergo testing under the supervision of foreign experts and the British Anti-Doping Agency.
"Although progress has been made, much remains to be done," said IAAF Chairman Sebastian Coe.
The Russian Athletic Federation was suspended in November 2015, with Russian athletes, among other things, attending the last year's Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
Despite the ban on the upcoming World Cup, 19 Russians who have previously proved they have been tested for a long time outside the Russian anti-doping system will attend.
However, they will not be able to start national championships in the championship, and if they are victorious, they will not play a Russian anthem.
Bank of England will hold the interest rate at 0.25%
The Bank of England should, as expected, declare that the interest rate will remain unchanged, following subdued economic growth and a weakening of inflation that has speculated on rapid growth.
The Bank of England warned that economic growth would remain "behind" in the context of interest rate retention - despite the squawk of family budgets.
Politicians of the Bank of England's Committee on Monetary Policy (MPC) voted six to two to maintain the interest rate of 0.25%. The results of the vote for interest rate hikes supported poor economic growth backed by weak growth.
In its Annual Inflation Report, the bank predicted growth to 1.7% in 2017 and 1.6% in 2018, and warned that the decline in family budgets would continue and the bank expects inflation to rise to 3% in the autumn.
At the same time, the bank has indicated that Brexit's inflation will rise over the next few years, and said rents on movable assets would rise more than expected in the financial markets.
Members of the committee also voted to withdraw part of the mammoth package to boost the economy and put into practice a year ago in response to Brexit.
As a result of this, a Timetable Funding Plan, which offers inexpensive subsidies to banks, will begin to apply from next February, although Bank of England said it would offer £ 15bn less than £ 115bn.
Just before the decision, the bank said: "The MPC predicts that gross domestic product (GDP) will stagnate in the short run along with the pressure on real household incomes and consumption."
On the subject of rates, the bank said it would be necessary to "tighten monetary policy belts" to calm inflation, "to a greater extent" than the markets expect.
Markets currently predict first growth in the third quarter of next year and further growth in 2020.
The Bank, however, stressed that any increase would be "gradual" and "limited".
The bank lowered the growth forecast for this year and next year, compared with 1.9% and 1.7% predicted in May.
The forecasted growth of 1.8% in 2018 remained unchanged.
After the release of estimates, the pound fell against the dollar and the euro.
The pound declined 0.5% to $ 1.31 and 0.4% to 1.11 euros.
The decision to maintain the current situation came after a more sluggish increase bridged the hopes for further growth - GDP halted to 0.3% in the second quarter versus 0.2% in the previous three months.
The increase will most likely remain at 0.3% in the third quarter, although at the end of the year it should slightly increase as reported by the bank.
The latest inflation report is a slight consolation for households hit by rising inflation and poor pay rises. The bank said the situation would worsen before growth.
The report also states that monetary policy "can not prevent" revenue cuts in the coming years, but wages are expected to "rise significantly" towards the end of the three-year forecast.
Economics should also grow due to a strong interest in British goods due to a weak pound, which compensates for a lower percentage of consumer spending.
This decision came a year after the rates in August were down to 0.025% in response to the shocking vote on the EU referendum, which led to a fall in the pound.
The bank estimates that complete unification of prices and the economy will last for at least four years.
Prior to the bank's decision on the latest rates, many demanded an increase in rates along with rising inflation, which has been pushing up ever-increasing domestic pressure. Three policymakers demanded an increase of 0.5% in June.
Inflation dropped back to 2.6% last month from 2.9% in June, even though the bank said it was expecting such a change and inflation should rise again in the course of next month.
The bank said that the 2% overrun target was "completely" due to the weak pound.
Andrew Montlake, director of Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: "Given the recent fall in swap rates, it looks like competition in the mortgage market will only rise as creditors begin to compete for contracts looking at a good outlook towards the end of the year.
The market looks particularly good for those who end the existing contracts and re-mortgages - there are options free of charge, as well as the low rates they get popular. "
The NHS prescribes a controversial HIV drug to 10,000 patients
Patients will gain access to 'transformative' HIV treatment since September, following a decision by the Supreme Court to fund the NHS drug.
The National Health Service (NSH) has announced that a pre-exposure prophylaxis (PREP) pill that is used before sex and reduces the risk of infection in high-risk patients by up to 86 percent will be offered through healthcare services to around 10,000 patients within a three-year trial.
NSH agreed to finance a trial period after the Appeals Court upheld a ruling by the Supreme Court last year, stating that the NHS had funds to pay for PrEP despite the statement that the drug should be funded by local authorities.
The decision, which was announced on Thursday, was adopted by NHS England as Chief Executive Officer Simon Stevens as "Significant Intervention," while the National Aids Trust (NAT) decision described it as "a decisive moment."
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to receive patients, and other clinics will join in October, and by April 2018, they will be fully implemented across England.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PREP) is an HIV-treated sex medicine to reduce the risk of HIV disease.
Tests have shown that PrEP significantly reduces the risk of HIV transmission among endangered patients.
Application of PrEP before sex means that there are enough specific drugs in the patient's body to prevent infection.
These medications can be taken every day or at least two hours before sex.
Among the tested patients are homosexual or bisexual men, transsexual people and people with HIV positive partners who are not successfully treated.
Clinics will identify eligible participants signing the test, including men, women, transsexuals and individuals with a partner whose HIV status has not yet been controlled by the appropriate treatment.
People living and registered with GPs in the UK can also sign up for their potential sexual health clinic and apply for potential testing.
The program comes with taxpayers at £ 10 million, and NHS England has signed a contract to distribute medicines this week after receiving an international public contract.
The trial period is designed to gather clinical evidence and assess the full potential of PREP, its targeting, use and implementation on a large scale.
Simon Stevens added, "This important intervention should complement and fully exploit the ever-expanding and increasingly successful prevention of HIV.
It is another milestone in over thirty years of trying to stop one of the greatest challenges to human health. '
Deborah Gold, NAT's executive director (National Aids Trust) said: "We are witnessing a crucial moment in the fight against HIV.
If the PrEP is administered correctly and in the case of patients at risk, it will offer the possibility of transforming the English HIV epidemic.
NSH will offer patients who are at high risk for HIV infection from September a new powerful tool that is individually controlled and not subject to the need to persuade a partner, which will improve the quality of many lives.
We accept this statement with pleasure. '
Ian Green, CEO of Terrence Higgins Trust, said: "First priority must be to deploy tests quickly across the country, ensuring that it is available to every patient.
Now we have a trial drug PrEP and we are on our way to protecting more than 10,000 people at risk of contracting HIV. '
Shadow Minister of Health Sharon Hodgson said, "The start of the PREP trial is a welcome and long-awaited change after months of delay and delay by the government.
Evidence suggests how transformative this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and ending the transmission of this life-threatening infection.
Subsequent tests will take us a step closer to a full understanding of PrEP benefits.
It is now important that we launch the tests as soon as possible across the country to protect people who are exposed to HIV and thus end the spread of HIV in society.
High Stakes Life: The mezzanine and clever design have transformed this small apartment into Earls Court in a spacious home
Joanne Leigh, a former banker with passion for real estate, exchanged a large house in Knightsbridge for an apartment in Earls Court in 2014.
Located on the first floor of Queen Anne's smart terraces - it is a demonstration of modern design that makes the most of the space available.
"I lived with my ex-husband in a much larger house in Knightsbridge," said Joanne.
"I was looking for something at a more reasonable price.
I came across this Earls Court apartment and had the same ceiling height.
I immediately fell in love with him, and on the same day I nodded to him. "
Since then, an apartment of 1000 square meters has been completely renovated.
One-room apartment with complicated layout - to get into the bedroom, you had to go through the kitchen - Joanne wanted to add storage and mezzanine to use the high ceiling.
"I longed for a high ceiling, large windows and plenty of light.
Those were my demands, "she said.
For this purpose, Erfana Azadi employed Duck & Shed design and design studio based in Notting Hill and used a nearly four meter high ceiling to create a home that was not just a project but a place to live.
The ceiling did not reach the height so that two gaps would come up - a challenge for architects to create a mezzanine on which to walk upright.
Erfan had to engage his creative thinking.
"The steel structure is quite complicated," he explained.
"We had to organize both spaces so that we could walk upright.
Not just to build a simple platform, but to bend the steel structure at the same height to above and below the ceiling. "
This arrangement made it possible for Erfan to construct two full-featured rooms on top of each other - adding dramatically to them.
In the mezzanine, the old copper window frames in the Retrouvius design look in the magnificent living room.
Mirror furniture in gold, silver, and retro chandelier Serge Mouille creates a unique style.
The use of mirrors plays an important role in drama, space and lighting.
The short corridor has mirrors on both sides and looks longer.
The mirror in the kitchen looks like a window into the next room.
At the front door there are storage rooms equipped with mirrors for storing cutlery and glasses.
The advantage of the living room, which gives the whole apartment an impression of significantly larger space, is the possibility of separating it from the kitchen, if not used.
Folding kitchens are nothing new.
What is unique about this solution is the folding door.
"We had to solve the technical side," Erfan says about reinforced veneered doors.
"The door is equipped with counterweight to make it very easy to pick up."
With the clever use of space and storage space, Joanne gained another 16 square meters, second room and a better overall layout of the apartment.
"When it comes to that, what you sell is a residential area - or a valuation of your property," Erfan said.
"Real estate broker basically when entering the apartment calculates its estimated cost based on the living space."
In this case, it has been possible to increase the living area while preserving quality materials that give space a luxurious look.
"Material is very important because you touch it and create an emotional bond with your home," Erfan added.
"You do not love the electricity distribution in the walls.
Yes, they are important, but your hearts will not get. "
As it turned out, the quality design and the increase of the living space can transform the ordinary apartment into an exceptional work.
And just like Joanne, you can finally decide to stay.
The United States is disconnected.
The cultural and political gap between the blue and red states is deepening.
California has declared a ban on traveling its citizens to Tennessee and seven other states.
The state of Tennessee has repaid it and has issued a retaliatory ban on traveling its citizens to California.
Of course, this is not a ban in the full sense of the word, US citizens can travel freely in all fifty states.
California is forbidden to spend state money on the voyages of its citizens to eight other states such as Alabama, South Dakota, Kansas, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, Tennessee and Texas.
Who stops madness?
California is strong for LGBT, and any LGBT disagreement is seen as discrimination.
Tennessee, however, has adopted a conscientious objection that a psychotherapist who has a moral problem with LGBT community therapy is not required to provide it, but is required to provide these patients with another therapist who does not have such a problem.
Texas and other states have in turn adopted laws under which religious charities that have been given to mothers by birth after birth have no obligation to give these children adoption to same-sex couples.
Because of these California Conservation Reservation laws, it has banned funding its citizens' journeys to eight states of the Union from its resources.
In practice, this means that Californian professors do not have to travel to scientific symposiums in Texas, for example, from their universities because they are co-financed by the state of California.
Similarly, school sports teams can not travel to tournaments or competitions such as Tennessee with the financial support of their schools.
On the road, they have to get either federal grants, but it is absurd for the federal government to finance the travel of citizens from State A to State B, or private sponsorship.
Tennessee's state of affairs has reached patience, and his parliament has passed a resolution that he also does not like Californian policy of high taxes, high government spending, high deficits and tolerance of illegal immigrants, but yet California does not make the embargo on board.
It imposes them as a retaliation for the California embargo on Tennessee.
And the same will happen to any state of the Union, which would order a similar ban on traveling to another state for whatever reason.
At the same time, he urged the parliaments of all states to stop this insanity.
That's the facts, now a comment.
The situation is toxic.
First of all, all of this is constitutional, nothing is unconstitutional.
States have the right to enforce conscientious objection laws, as well as decide what their money will go for and what they can not do.
Second, what is wrong with the conscience reservation?
When a butcher has a religious problem selling pork, why could not he offer only beef, lamb, poultry and fish?
Why should he be forced to sell pork under penalty of punishment, if the butchers offering pork are enough?
In Colorado, one baker faces anti-discrimination lawsuit and a high fine because he refused to bake a cake for a homosexual wedding.
He also refuses to bake the Halloween cakes or alcohol.
Why punish him and leave him alone and do not order the cakes in the hundreds of other bakers?
Thirdly, the beauty of the federal system is that the constitutional rights of all federal citizens are guaranteed, but individual states can adjust their internal, domestic politics in non-federal powers according to their own, that is, according to the preferences of their inhabitants.
Then there are diversity, diversity, diversity.
California may be Californian, and Texas may be Texas.
But California wants California to be Californian and Texas, and seven other states are also Californias!
Fourthly, members of the LGBT community once legitimately sought to tolerate their lifestyle.
Today, many members of this community are governed by the rule of living and living, which should guide all reasonable people, but some activists strive not for tolerance towards themselves but for others, but for extreme intolerance towards others.
According to them, no one should ever be morally, religiously or philosophically dissatisfied with the LGBT lifestyle, and if they do, they should be criminalized.
The mentality of these activists is totalitarian.
They are modern enemies of freedom.
Fifthly, I do not know the situation in US history, when states have made such a snap, for the sake of political affairs, except for the one case.
Even in times of struggle for the civil rights of blacks, where North and West were on the side of integration, and the South on the side of segregation, states did not impose sanctions on themselves.
The only case was the 1950s, the political cause was slavery, and the war on the North against the South.
Naturally, nothing like that happens now, but the situation is still toxic.
The cultural and political divide between the blue democratic states and the Red Republican states deepens and the US is internally mentally disconnected.
Unauthorized agitation.
Critic Putin got a fatty fine.
Russian opposition politician Alexei Navalnyj was fined 300 thousand rubles for violating campaign rules before the presidential election next year.
The court imposed a fine on him for calling people to participate in unauthorized demonstrations.
Navalnyi has organized two large anti-government street protests over the past two months and announced he will seek the post of head of state in March next year.
The ruling Kremlin chief Vladimir Putin has not yet announced his candidacy, but is generally expected to do so and win again.
Navalnyi said the police came to him in the morning and brought him to court.
The guy awarded him the fine for calling people to demonstrations through videos on the YouTube web portal.
The fine is three hundred thousand.
"Later, we're going to take them off the judge's salary," the Kremlin criticized the twitter.
The Russian Electoral Commission recently concluded that Navalnyi could not take part in the presidential election because he was previously convicted of embezzlement.
However, Navalnyj, who is considered to be a fighter against corruption, considers the judgment to be politically motivated.
Fines amounting to 300 thousand rubles, or 25 thousand rubles, the court also imposed on Thursday two members of the Naval Pre-election Team, Leonid Volkov and Nikolai Ljaskin.
Navalnyj entered Russian politics as an anti-corruption blogger and gradually became a dominant person on the fragmented opposition scene.
The authorities are trying to defend the Naval in any campaign.
In February, he was sentenced to a five-year suspended sentence for robbing the Kirovles forestry business.
In May the verdict was upheld by the Appeals Court.
The ruling is so effective, which prevents Naval from running for the Russian law.
Brothers are fighting for an empire worth over $ 500 million
Two brothers now, over four decades after the Italian Empire founded their empire, drag one of the most expensive Victorian property worth more than $ 500 million.
Former director of Carlton Football Club and developer Colin De Lutis dwells in the Toorak estate, just three rooms from his younger brother, Paul, who struggled to share property and property to the highest court.
Paul wanted to leave the family business in 2014, but the sharp litigation is constantly ruled by the Supreme Court.
Together with her mother, Anne owns a total of 38 real estate worth more than half a billion dollars. The first deal was bought by the family in 1973 at Smith Street in Collingwood.
At this point, the family founded Westco Jeans, which grew into a chain of 160 stone shops.
In 1999, the family sold the entire company for $ 85 million.
Other properties were purchased for the money, and the De Lutis family portfolio now includes offices, building sites in Brunswick and Sorrent, Gold Coast and Mt Buller flats and suburban shopping centers.
Paul owns about one-third of the company's assets, while his father, Colin, who, according to Paul's words, "the major engine and dominant person" of the De Lutis family, owns only two-thirds of his assets.
The court's writings state that Colin owns $ 316 million of property while Paul manages real estate for $ 176 million.
For Paul, the distribution of assets and financial resources has become a problem.
"Colin's proposal sounded profoundly in my favor," Paul wrote in a statement in court in 2015.
Last Friday, after several unsuccessful attempts at reconciliation, the first session of the Supreme Court took place.
Brothers now also compete to control the existing business-from which Paul, according to Colin's statement, cut off.
Colin denies that this is not true and accuses Paul of mismanaging some properties.
In a previous sworn statement, Colin said he believed in a successful resolution of the conflict.
"My Italian origins dictate to me that the family is most important," he wrote.
Hundreds of affidavits, emails and news from companies, including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, flood lawyers, including Allan Myers, QC, and lawyers from both sides.
Ms De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who had been running dairy bars and delicacies since the 1950s and bought the Brunswick store in the 1970s.
For the money raised by building their property, they bought a property in Collingwood, where Colin opened his first family business with jeans.
Colin said that when he founded Westco "in the last year of college, Paul was still a small, about 10-year-old boy."
Anna De Lutis said that along with Luigi, who died in 2012, he hoped that the transfer of wealth to his sons would be good.
"Luigi often said he never wanted his sons to go to court," she wrote.
The other two brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis family, and Colin said that Mark had been compensated for $ 10 million on his leave, and that Luke was $ 26 million.
As Paul said, Luke and Mark "were not happy with the terms of their financial compensation."
Since then, Colin has been holding back, despite the fact that he is a former member of AFL's board of directors, as noted in his autobiography in 2015 by Eddie McGuire, a well-known television personality and best friend of Colin.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul de Lutis and their lawyers on Friday.
Only Colin responded by means of a text message stating that, given the fact that the case is being dealt with before a court, "I have nothing to say".
"It is very sad that my brother Paul decided to deal with the matter in court," he wrote.
In mid-2016, in one of the statements in court, Colin said he was trying to adapt to his brother's demands.
"Our father would be very dissatisfied if he saw our current situation," he said, adding that he "still hopes for a successful solution."
On Friday, all hopes were out of sight.
"Our disputes will be settled in the near future," Colin wrote.
Vedro in the Czech Republic.
Teachers shower children.
Drivers of public transport fasten water and summer clothes.
At the Na Chodovci kindergarten in Prague 4, where there are about 35 children, only out in the morning.
The school is after reconstruction and the planted trees do not yet provide a great shadow.
There is no swimming pool, but teachers teach children in the fog.
In the afternoon, children stay in classes where blinds and curtains are pulled down.
The air is trying to cool down with the air purifier because they do not have air conditioning.
It's also challenging for teachers and cooks.
"The indoor and outdoor temperature exceeds the hygienic limits for kindergartens, so we should not even have open operation at this time," Miloslava Makovičková, nursing director, said.
There is a glass corridor in the nursery, where the temperature is around 40 degrees.
We wind up in the morning after 6 o'clock, the windows are closed and we have sunblinds on the south.
"But it will not help," she added.
Better conditions are available at Na Hrázi in Hostivice, where children spend most of their time outdoors.
We have grown trees on the land, so we're underneath them.
"We have a beautiful walnut, there is a table under it, and we do things there," said Barbora Kompanová, nursery director.
Teachers try to go to the forest with the kids, where there is a bigger chut.
Children wet their caps and have different water games on the program.
"We have a hand-pressurized nebulizer that is used to spray flowers, and we use it to shower children," Kompanova said.
Also, the headmaster of the nursery school in Novoborská street in Prosek, Prague, Jitka Vilimovska, said that teachers are trying to keep children in the shade and sprinkle them with water.
"We have a fairly grown garden, so they're under the trees," she said.
It goes out in the morning and then after 15:00.
Every child must have a headgear.
Teachers also remind children that they should drink.
They can choose, for example, little sweetened tea or diluted juice, and have a drink in the garden with water.
Every day, they also have a vegetable salad to eat, and for the snack always fresh fruits and vegetables sometimes brought to their parents.
"Maybe one mum brought about ten-thousand-pound melon for children today," Makovičková added.
Drivers receive water or summer uniform.
DPP Prague Transport Company provides them with water, ion drinks or summer uniforms in hot days.
Cabins for tram and bus drivers are mostly air-conditioned, DPP spokeswoman Aneta Řehková said.
In addition to the cabins, some trams are also air conditioned in the passenger compartment.
High-temperature tram tracks have not seriously damaged anyway.
Small damage occurred in a loop in Hostivař.
At the current high temperatures, we must pay particular attention to ensuring that a sufficient number of drinks are available to the driver.
"Chilled drinking water is available in all loops, alternating points and carriages," said Řehková.
In the crèches and in some alternating places employees have so-called sodobars, which produce chilled soda.
Drivers also receive soluble protective ionic beverages.
"They can also use a summer uniform that increases the comfort of drivers in their daily shifts," the spokesman added.
Hot and dry weather in the last days has resulted in an increased number of fires.
On Tuesday, firefighters in the Czech Republic liquidated 108, which is twice the long-term average.
On Tuesday, on a day when temperatures in the Czech Republic climbed above 35 degrees Celsius, the firefighters employed mainly fire fighting.
"There are fires prevailing in the natural environment, as well as those associated with wildlife," said firefighters Nicole Zaoral.
Relieving the firefighters did not bring even evening weather change when the heat in many places replaced by storms and torrential rain.
In connection with thunderstorm firefighters went to 236 hits.
It was mainly about removing grabbed trees and branches.
"They were most affected by the Středočeský Region," Zaoralová continues.
However, the help of firefighters was also in Stvolinek in Českolipsko, where 60 people from the children's camp evacuated to safety for the storm.
Tropical temperatures also assigned work to Prague rescuers.
On Tuesday and midnight, ambulances went to dozens of cases of carbon monoxide poisoning.
People should therefore have their water heaters checked, the rescuers warn.
Carbon monoxide is a colorless, odor-free gas that is released by incomplete combustion.
Symptoms of poisoning include nausea, vomiting, headache, and fainting.
In case of suspicion of poisoning, leave the infested room.
Trump's new Chief of Staff plans to reduce the presidential media diet
Many have tried it before, and have always failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can do it.
If so, it will be the first one.
Politico said the new White House chief of staff is planning to limit the flow of President Trump's information - including television coverage - in hopes of keeping trump on the surface.
Here is part of Josh Dawsey's report:
"When White House Staff Chief John F. Kelly met the first day in a new position with staff, he outlined the key issue of Trump's White House, which he intends to correct: the wrong information that comes to the President.
Kelly said he had to personally approve all the information - whether on paper or a spoken word - because the president could better decide on the right information. "
Kelly's diagnosis makes sense, but many of his predecessors have teeth to control Trump and his presentation in the media.
Trump's relationship with the media dates back several decades - and now, when sitting in the White House, his habit of watching TV news is even stronger.
"If Trump as a candidate was upset with fair reports, it was good to show him a lot of other media in the positive light that was easier to convince," Sam Nunberg, a former campaign adviser, told Politico in February.
Tara Palmeri, from Politico, wrote that "the key to keeping Trump tweets at bay - at least according to the words of the six former organizers of his campaign - is to ensure that Trump regularly watches the media that praises him."
Okay.
However, the idea that Trump's tendency to publish his opinions on Twitter has ever been "under control" is ridiculous.
Maybe these campaign organizers know something that others do not know - that Trump's tweets would be more outrageous if they were not checked.
Tweets that Trump has never sent will probably never know.
If his employees managed to keep him at least a few times, then their efforts did not go wrong.
However, no one has ever been able to stop Trumps regularly from triggering controversial topics.
Part of the problem is that in the White House, which consists of competing factions, people regularly try to strengthen their agenda by trumping through the materials - which may or may not be reliable - that support their view of the world.
The Politico Portal, which covered the issue from all sides, published in May a report on the tendency of consultants to submit questionable information to the head of state.
This is an example of such information from reporter Shane Goldmacher's pen:
"Trump's current and former officials say the president is often very angry about negative news from the media, especially about reports of leakage, and seeks to find out their origins.
This situation took place at the end of February, when someone gave the President a copy of an article from GotNews.com - a website of provocative Charles C. Johnson - who accused deputy chief of staff Katie Walsh of being the source of many leaks of information from the White House.
Despite the fact that Johnson was forever harassed from Twitter for harassment, or that he has not substantiated his allegations, or that he has published false allegations in the past and later appealed.
Trump read the article and started asking Walsh. "
Goldmacher added that then Chief of Staff Rein Priebus and White House Secretary Rob Porter "were trying to implement a system to manage and document information that President Trump will receive."
Would it work?
Kelly now, three months later, is pushing for the same strategy.
Maybe he's a more efficient manager than Priebus, but Trump's impulsivity is just not going to be lost and his helpers are still in power.
These unchanging factors of the Kelly Mission will surely add up.
Tourists are negotiating a ditch and returning to the 'Million Dollar Quarter'
Several of the most sophisticated homeowners in West Midland, England, are once again reeling in with enthusiastic tourists who negotiate with local authorities about the right to regain their fields.
Tourists parked 20 caravans in a field on the thriving street in Solihull, nicknamed "millionaire borough."
Bringing horses, children and caravan army, tourists return after they were exposed in May, and they did not miss the trench that was kicked out on the basis of regulations by the authorities to prevent their invasion.
The tactical group found gaps in the defense and penetrated the unpopulated caravan field, which served as a way.
The rabid neighborhood residents attacked Solihull's city council, not being able to solve the problem.
One of the people who wished to remain anonymous said: "They took the place on Monday night after they were moved to Bentley Heath Street, where they were throwing stones on other people.
The board should be ashamed of its inability to solve the problem.
All the tourists were moved to another place and now they returned.
Last night they arrived, and now they are going to get even more. "
She added that: "The Birmingham Governing Board knows how to deal with this problem, and uses court orders to protect parks.
I live in Streetsbrook, and I do not intend to pay taxes until the board of directors meets the tourists. '
Another anonymous resident said, "It's ridiculous. We just recently watched the last departing tourists and are back.
And this time there's even more, and this time they brought their horses with them. '
A spokesman for the Solihull Board of Trustees said: "We are aware of an unauthorized stay on the land near Streetsbrook Road and in cooperation with the local police we take the necessary legal steps to successfully solve the whole problem.
In order to gather as much evidence as possible, it is essential that as many local residents as possible report any uncoordinated or unlawful behavior to the police at 101.
So we get the overall picture we bring to court. '
Her husband husband struck a car in Brussels.
He brought him a government special.
The government specialist brought the wounded Róbert Žitňanský to Bratislava on Wednesday after noon.
There were two ambulances at the airport, and aboard the plane was under the constant control of Slovak doctors.
The long-planned flight has gone without any complications.
According to TV JOJ, Robert Zitnansky had a serious accident at the beginning of summer in Brussels.
He said he was hit by a car and has been in serious condition ever since.
After being transported to his homeland, he was transported to a specialized office in one of the Bratislava hospitals.
Economic analyst is the husband of Slovak MEP Jana Žitňanská from NOVA.
She did not want to comment on the incident.
The couple have three children together.
Italians stiffen in the fight against NGO rescue boats with immigrants on board
Italy has announced that it will prevent NGO rescue boats arriving on the coast of Italy with Mediterranean immigrants if the NGO does not sign new rules regulating their operations.
"If NGOs do not sign new rules of conduct, it will be hard to imagine that they could continue their operations," Interior Minister Marco Minniti said in an interview with Turin daily La Stampa.
The Minniti warning came a day after the Italian authorities seized the German rescue organization Jugend Rettet for suspicion of trafficking in human beings, which greatly facilitates illegal immigration.
A rescue organization operating for the first year has refused to comment on the matter because of the accusations made by the Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosios.
"For us there is and will always be the number one priority of saving human lives. We are so sorry that we can not currently operate in rescue zones," the organization said in a statement on social networks.
"We can only comment on all current charges after collecting all the information and assessing the whole situation."
Italian authorities have been following Jugend Rettet's Iuventa since October.
Her crew is suspicious of the fact that the ship was carrying the immigrants handed over directly by the human traffickers, repeatedly.
At least one meeting was allegedly only 1.3 miles from the Libyan coast, according to the prosecutor's file. The Italian media reported the meeting.
The crew of the ship is suspected of violating the law and bypassing the Italian Coast Guard, overseeing rescue operations in the area - from humanitarian enthusiasm, rather than anything else.
The Code of Conduct establishes the presence of an Italian police officer on board ships such as Iuventa to monitor activities.
Only three of the nine non-governmental nonprofit organizations involved in rescue operations have so far agreed to adhere to the Save The Children Code, the MOAS of Malta, and the Spanish Pro-Activa Open Arms.
The latter said on Thursday that the new rules are not necessary but acceptable, as they do not represent any "substantial change or hindrance" to rescue operations.
Adoption of the new Code of Conduct was also rejected by the Nobel Prize-winning MSF.
Minniti has in the meantime been told that a sharp decline in immigrants in recent weeks landing in Italy as part of rescue operations suggests that efforts to strengthen patrols off the coast of Libya and co-operation with local mayors bear fruit.
"In the last few days, we start to see the light at the end of the tunnel," the minister said.
He also revealed plans for further talks with the mayor of Libya on economic development initiatives this month as well as representatives of Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving these countries in the hope of achieving Europe.
Nestydatá Mesarošová: The silicone and cellulite clutched over her overalls!
The hot summer days are all tempting to take on only the most necessary thing to cover the most intimate ones.
Only Dominika Mesarosová does it the opposite.
At the afternoon meeting at the Prague Zoo, where actors, moderators, singers and all the TV Prima players just swarmed, they wrapped their body in a mini overal.
And just a few normal moves were enough, and the model showed all her silicones but also her butt.
She overcame herself several times between the halves, plus she was so tall that she had to keep editing it.
The attention of the masters and the photographers present was certainly not a necessity.
Michelle Carter sentenced to send text messages encouraging suicide Conrad Roy
A woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two years' imprisonment for inciting her friend to commit suicide by texting and phone calls.
Michelle Carter, twenty-year-old, will take 15 months from a two-year prison sentence and then spend five years in conditional release.
Carter was sentenced in June for the unintentional killing of Conrad Roy, who married her own life on July 13, 2014.
Roy's father said in court at Thursday's court: "The whole family is devastated.
My son was my best friend. "
Carter was left to freedom until the decision.
She was threatened with up to 20 years of imprisonment, but her lawyers argued that she and Roy suffered mental illness.
Dressed in red trousers and creamy blouses, Carter stood at the verdict on the spot with tears in her eyes, her hands clasped, her eyes on the ground.
"Her actions killed Conrad Roy," the plaintiff said to the judges.
"She ended his life to relieve herself.
She could not accept her own responsibility, "she said.
"She did not show any remorse."
However, Carter's lawyer said it was "unfortunate circumstances he regretted very much."
Judge Lawrence Moniz added that "her age or level of maturity or even mental disorder does not have a significant impact on her performance."
The applicant read Roy's mother Lynn Roy's statement: "I will not have a single day to worry about losing my son.
I want him to be proud of me - I look after his sisters and we will endure the enormous pain we will carry with them forever, "the statement said.
Roy's sister, Camdyn Roy, testified that she was "chasing" her consciousness that she would never take part in the wedding marriage and would never be the aunt of his children.
"The loss of a person I've ever seen since I was born is the pain I'm going to make for my life," she said.
The State of Massachusetts does not have a valid law that would punish a person helping to suicide a second person, so this case establishes a legal precedent.
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found in the car seat, carbon dioxide poisoned in 2014.
The case has attracted the attention of the whole nation after the Carter text messages that triggered suicide were published.
"Maybe it's getting busy, jumping out of the building or punching, I do not care," wrote the text that Carter sent just two weeks before his death when Roy was on family holidays.
Several minutes before suicide he wrote to him, "You have to do it Conrad," and "Just throw the generator and you'll be free and happy."
Judge Moniz said Carter longed for attention through Roy's death and ordered him to refrain from any comments in the press.
The case raised many questions.
One of the people on the side of Carter was Amanda Knox, who was convicted of murdering her British roommate in Italy in 2007. Two years ago she was acquitted.
Miss Knox (30) published a statement in the Los Angeles Times: "Michelle Carter deserves understanding and help, not jail."
Audi will adjust up to 850,000 diesel vehicles in response to a sharp response
Just days before the announcement, Audi, the carmaker, said BMW would offer its customers software upgrades in more than 350,000 vehicles.
The BMW president said the company believed that "there are more intelligent options than driving restrictions" in response to European cities - including BMW, which is home to BMW - considering a ban on or limiting diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will adjust three million Mercedes cars across Europe to reduce diesel emissions.
None of the companies called this decision a withdrawal.
European car manufacturers have greatly promoted the use of diesel cars in Europe and the United States to meet the carbon dioxide emission regulations.
However, nitrogen oxide, which discharges diesel engines, is considered to be a carcinogen and may cause asthma.
At the same time, there is an increase in the cost of automobiles for the installation of equipment to neutralize the gases emitted by diesel engines, which makes it more difficult for cars to compete.
While German carmakers are facing careful searches, Chancellor Angela Merkel faces charges of spoiling powerful automobile companies and ignoring their problems.
Companies are trying to avoid Volkswagen's mistakes that have installed software to test their emissions, but in normal conditions software has been deactivated.
Several senior Volkswagen officials have been accused in the United States, and others are being investigated on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, an ex-engineer engineer engineer in Audi will be arrested in Germany.
Former Zaccheo manager Giovanni Pamio is of Italian nationality, so he is not extraditable, so he can face the lawsuit in the United States.
At the beginning of this year, Audi was involved in a German police criminal investigation into Volkswagen after the authorities accused Audi of installing a system to circumvent European emission limits - extending the accusations that Audi faces in the US.
Audi's inclusion in the investigation may have an unfortunate impact on Volkswagen: a luxury car maker makes a disproportionate share of Volkswagen's profits.
The plane landed on the beach in an emergency.
The man and little girl died.
The accident occurred at the beach of Praia de São João in the Costa da Caparica, about 30 kilometers south of Lisbon.
One of the witnesses to the Noticias SIC television channel said that the plane had landed just above people who sunbathe on the beach.
Some people from the beach reportedly fleeing the danger to the sea.
Unfortunately, two people were not able to escape before the machine.
The 50-year-old man and eight-year-old girl died at the beach according to local media.
"The plane crashed and they were dead," police police chief Pedro Coelho Dias said.
Their nationality is not yet known.
There were two people aboard the plane, both of them crashing alive and policemen took them to interrogation.
D11 or how not to build a highway.
And are the motorways in the Czech Republic at all possible?
I'll give you a puzzle.
It's unfinished, even though it began to build in 1978.
Even if it is not up to date, it is constantly being corrected.
And it must not be built, even if it has a building permit.
What is it?
Yes, D11 highway.
The construction of another section of it for at least several months has recently stopped the Children of the Earth movement.
We get a highway on the east, like a salami.
The wheel is cut and then you see when and if we get another one.
We do not want anything miraculous at the same time.
We only want to reduce travel time and we want to get trucks coming to Poland or Poland from villages and towns.
The endless streams of trucks go straight through the towns of Jaroměř or Náchod, which is not as reasonably close as possible.
But until now the last section of our dream motorway was put into operation in 2008, that is, before the incredible nine years.
Since then, not even a knock.
Therefore, when the remaining four kilometers of the unfinished stretch to Hradec Králové have begun to be built and the archaeological survey started with the archaeological exploration on the other sections of Jaroměř with the beginning to begin at the end of this year, you could hear a loud banging of the bobbins in eastern Bohemia.
After all, no one believed it.
Last week it turned out that building will not be this year.
And maybe next year.
The Country-Club Children's Movement for Sustainable Transport from Brno has broken up.
Children of Earth repeat their D1 tactics.
They attacked the building permit decision in its entirety.
They request a review of all the binding opinions already issued by all the authorities concerned.
For example, the City of Hradec, the Ministry of the Environment, but also the Ministry of Defense or the Railway Authority.
Meanwhile, from D11, we come down to the village with the eloquent name of Poleska.
So we drive, we just drive along the highway and suddenly we stand on the side road and we prefer to be placed in the column.
The worst thing is that you see similar stories across the country.
Scary, constantly clogged road to Benešov, the D1 or D8 motorway.
Everyone has their Humans.
What do Children of Earth demand?
What is the essence of the problems of road construction in the Czech Republic?
And why is the motorway network practically incomplete in the current system?

Lavender from Provence threatens climate change
Lavender has become a symbol of Provence in southeastern France, but now it is threatened by climate change.
Lavender decreases due to dry climate and harmful insects, which raises scares on the faces of researchers and farmers seeking solutions.
Eric Chaisse, a specialist in the agricultural research institute CRIEPPAM in Provence, said: "Growing lavender in Provence is threatened because in the last few years, this plant has been exposed to climate change, which brings with it less rainfall in the spring and autumn.
This affects the life of lavender.
Bikes and grasshoppers carrying micro-bacteria that run in dry climates are also blamed on it. "
At stake there are many.
Lavender attracts tourists and the oil that is produced from them is an important ingredient in perfumes and cosmetics.
Eric Chaisse said: "Instead of long and beautiful blossoms, small, undeveloped and often weak plants grow.
The amount of oil obtained from these lavender is, of course, smaller. "
A possible solution can be to more efficiently distribute water and slow the evaporation of water from the soil, as well as spraying lavender with a protective clay / water mixture and breeding more species resistant to dry weather.
The murder of a journalist highlights the growing threats in Mexico
Riodoce weekly staff meet regularly every Wednesday to discuss news about the riots that are taking place in the Sinaloa region with the participation of organized criminals, corrupt officials, and ongoing drug wars.
But today, under the storm of recent events, it is mainly because of its own safety.
They find it important to change their habits.
Two deserving journalists talk about what would be safer: take their children with them to an office that someone attacked in 2009 with a grenade or leave them home.
Security experts wrote three simple words on the blackboard: adversaries, neutral, and allies.
They ask journalists to give names to each word - no evidence is needed, just use imagination and premonition.
To pick them out - drug dealers, politicians, traders and journalists are suspected of taking money from government or drug cartels - a catalog of criminals whose job is to cover up criminal behavior.
Violence persists and the bodies are piling up across the country, journalists are growing in numbers: according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists, there are at least 25 since the arrival of President Enrique Pen Niet in December 2012, 589 journalists under federal protection after attacks and threats, and seven in seven countries this year.
Among them is co-founder of Riodioce, editor and inspiration for colleagues, Javier Valdez Cardenas.
"The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and work as a journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his many books on drug-related violence.
His loss is plausible, even though his presence is all-pervading - a large photograph of Valdeze with the inscription "Justice" shown by a middle-aged man hanging in the front of the building, two journalists - Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez - over 30 years of age, with a smile on the face of Valdeze, Panama's caps and noses.
The meeting takes place less than two months after his death, and journalists talk about mutual trauma, nightmares, insomnia and paranoia.
Despite the fact that a special federal prosecutor's office was established in 2010 to address journalists' cases, two suspects have so far denounced the Committee on the Protection of Journalists.
Most of the thousands of murders occurring each year are associated with drug trafficking and organized crime, and killer journalists are so rarely going to court.
Journalists from Riodoka insist that they will report on the violence that is happening in Sinaloa, even though they are destroyed by grief and the territory is currently very treacherous.
Without information about murders and without the vision of justice, the security meeting is irrelevant, says Ibarra.
"It's foolish to waste time on such meetings," he adds.
"If we do not get more information, no one can trust."
On the morning of May 15, Valdez left Riodoc's headquarters in Culiacan, capital Sinaloy.
He managed to drive several blocks when his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men who pulled him out of the car and killed him with 12 missiles, apparently due to the title of the article - which can be translated as the Twelfth River.
The shooters then boarded his car and landed near the crime scene.
Valdez died at the age of 50.
He left behind a woman and two adult children.
Culiacan seems to be spreading fast in Culiacan.
In Valdez's case, however, the suspicion is silent.
Since last year's arrest of Guzmán and his January issue to the United States, Sinaloa has become one of the country's bloodiest battlefields as the rival faction is trying to fill an empty spot.
Every day several people are killed in the streets of Sinaloi, and the cemetery is full of ornate two-story mausoleas for drug kingdoms, many of which are larger than houses.
Forget it for a moment that the word "truce" means that one drug cartel controls a coastal state with precious ports and important routes to the United States for drugs.
Despite the fact that Valdez was intimately familiar with the risks of his job, however, Ismail Bojorquez (60), the co-founder and director of Riodoce, still claims that he did not protect his friend.
He believes two mistakes have contributed to his death.
The first was the February issue of an interview with Damaso Lopez, the leader of one of the rival drug cartels that led the war with the sons of Joaquin Guzmán.
Peace could be angry with the sons, suspects gang members bought all copies of the paper when they landed on the shelves.
The second mistake was not to force Valdez to leave the country for his own safety after seizing other newspapers in which the same story was printed.
Valdez became a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his death is seen as an important milestone in the fight against Mexican criminals against journalists.
He had survived so long, and all his friends and colleagues believed it would never change.
Noroeste was practically veteran of the periodicity when he decided to sell his $ 50 worth of shares in 2003 and set up with five of his colleagues, Riodok.
In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to run journalism and not to mention drug trafficking," said Bojorquez.
In the meantime, Riodoce gained a good reputation for brave and true news, and the newspapers have begun to succeed.
Journalists like to search for problematic topics and publish texts without censorship - readers fascinated to read stories that no one else dared to publish.
Eight years after its founding, Riodok won the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot Award for Latin America.
In the same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee for the Protection of Journalists for his brave reports on Mexican drug trafficking.
Valdez openly admitted that he was afraid.
"I was afraid of my life," he said when receiving the prize.
Drug trafficking in Sinaloae is "a way of life," Valdez said in October last year in an interview with Rompeviento TV.
"You have to take the role of a journalist - or play stupid.
I do not want someone to ask me, "What did you face face to death ... why did not you say what was happening?".
Employees of Riodoce miss Valdez, a man known by his joking and indiscriminate tongue, a good friend who liked to give advice and hug - a teacher who knew how to survive.
Everyone relied on his everyday routine.
He always wore his cap.
He often went to the El Guayabo bar opposite the offices and sat at the same table.
Now they are asking: did this routine cause its death?
His death also raised questions about his own assumptions - how to do his best to stay alive?
"They do not like them when you get involved with their wives, children, clean shops, secret landings."
"These things were forbidden," said Bojorquez.
As a result, there is a high level of self-harm and self-esteem.
You have to believe your instincts.
If you feel something is not playing here, your hands are gone.
The problem is, said editor Riodoce Andres Villarreal, that "smell is a sense that can be fooled ... and then the thing happened with Javier."
The old rules, like others, do not apply to Sinaloae - just like in the states of Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states that are home to a toxic mix of lucrative smugglers, weak governments and corrupt politicians.
The landscape is constantly changing.
No cell phones are allowed in the room where Riodoce employees meet, and spyware was bought a few days ago by governments to monitor Mexican journalists and activists.
In front of the building, two policemen find relief in front of a 40-degree heat in the shade of a nearby tree.
They were selected by the state to protect the offices of Riodoc, which are located in a four-storey building in the bourgeois quarter of Culiacan.
Journalists are wondering if these police officers are not those 50 percent of lawmakers who are corrupt on the government's behalf.
It's been several months since journalists went to mountainous areas that basically dominate drug cartels.
There are three main stories on this week's program.
The first is the assassination of the brother of former boxer Julio César Chávez in Sinaloa.
They are also highlighted by the suspicious government spending that took place in the hometown of the governor of the state.
Recently, there have also been several kidnappings in one of Culiacan's most luxurious restaurants, just a block from the Prosecutor's Office.
Officially, nobody has identified the identity of the abducted people or the circumstances of kidnapping, so journalists have been careful when they were about to write about what every city citizen knows: that the restaurant is a favorite destination for drug traffickers and politicians.
One of the journalists has read from public records that the restaurant was registered under a name associated with a politician who is a member of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), controlling all levels of the political scene for almost the past century.
Several PRI governors have recently been charged with high-level corruption.
Villarreal asked journalists to write about the incidents that had occurred in the restaurant, including an incident in which one of the sons of Joaquín "El Chapo" Guzmán escaped the army intervention unit.
A month ago, readers would read this topic in the Valdez section, which was the best source of information about kidnappings.
"Valdez would certainly have deciphered the case," said Villarreal (46), nicknamed "El Flaco" for his slim figure.
"Now all the informants turn to our backs."
Valdez's office was transformed into a warehouse of signs and stickers to protest against the killing of journalists, and the staff certainly did not expect them to become activists representing the press.
Journalist Miriam Ramirez has grabbed several signs and has begun to demonstrate the following morning before a public prosecutor's office for another journalist.
Salvador Adame disappeared just three days after Valdez's murder in the western part of Michoacan.
Only a burned-up body has been discovered. The authorities claim that DNA analysis is Adamea.
Journalists' activity is growing across the country, many protesting and screaming on the sidewalks and SOS prints.
Bojorquez, the head of the Bojorquez newspaper, is on a visit to Washington where he seeks international support and justice for Valdez's death.
At a meeting with governor Sinaloy, which took place the day after the murder of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities of watching journalists and their murders for proclaiming the truth.
Meanwhile, she asked for a transfer to another department, fearing that her anger might jeopardize her impartiality.
Valdez has repeatedly stated that Mexican journalists are "surrounded" by organized crime, corrupt officials and the indifferent public.
In his latest book Narco-journalism, he wrote that journalists are dying not only in the hands of drug cartels, but also at the order of politicians and security forces who work with organized crime.
The Articulo 19 media watchdog has accused more than half of all attacks on journalists from police officers and public officials.
"You die in Mexico because they want to silence you," Ramirez added.
The murders are obviously working.
No one will forget the death of blogger Marie Elizabeth Macíasová, which occurred six years ago at the northern border of Tamaulipas.
Her body was found along with a message that allegedly signed the Zetas cartel: "That's how I ended up because of my reports."
There were keyboards and headphones beside the chopped head.
Some branches have decided to end their activities, such as the El Norte newspaper at the northern border of the Chihuahua State in response to the March murder of the rapporteur, Miroslava Breach.
The others are still going on, just as El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did after the killing of his director in 2004.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juarez addressed the drug cartels publicly on an introductory page titled "What do you want from us"?
Some journalists have fled their homes or even across borders.
It's a tough decision.
Finding work in exile is difficult as well as getting rid of the feeling that you are constantly pursuing someone.
And journalists are being persecuted and killed, as in the case of Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered in 2015 together with four women in a flat in Mexico City, three months after escaping from Veracruz.
For those who choose to stay and do not give up their jobs, it poses a great risk each day.
Ibarra, who wanted to be one poet, admits writing about drugs is scaring him.
"Mexico is heading for hell, so I became a journalist," he said.
It's Friday midday, and Riodoce's employees sit on the pavement in front of the office - the latest edition sent to the printer - drinking beer when the phone starts ringing.
They are told that 19 people have died in a shooting game between gang members and policemen near the beach resort of Mazatlan.
The war is rising, just as promised by many members of the syndicate in this area.
Journalists publish this news from a mobile phone on the Riodoce website.
There will not be a single day and the introductory headline changes again.
The sounds of police sirens point to another shootout.
Bojorquez casts a glance at the police patrol to see if they watch.
If they are afraid they do not show it.
Under the immense portrait of the fallen co-founder, their periodicals - the middleman of which is an eloquent slogan for Sinaloe - all Riodoce's employees follow his steps.
"How can we think of leaving," Bojorquez said, "when the same day when Javier was killed, one intern asked me to send her to the streets?"
Dinosaurs used camouflage to avoid enemies
At first glance it looks like a sculpture, however frightening.
Researchers have now revealed the findings of the first finds of an amazing creature of the size of a rhinoceros, whose perfectly preserved remains - the experts called "Mona Lisa of the Dinosaurs" - were found by a Canadian miner.
The remains were preserved to such an extent that experts could determine the red-brown color of his scaly skin and said the dinosaur had a "troubled past."
An article in Current Biology reported that it is the most preserved armored dinosaur and one of the best dinosaur species in the world.
Fossil is a new species of the Nodosauridae family, and the Dinosaur lived in the Cretaceous period, about 110 to 112 million years ago.
His perfectly preserved state was literally shocked by researchers who described it as "truly remarkable."
According to National Geographic, the armored beacon is still the best preserved fossil of its kind.
Shawn Funk finds the fossil spotted on March 21, 2011 when drilling at the Suncor Millenium near Alberta, Canada.
He encountered something that looked like a foreign object and decided to explore it more closely.
The fossil was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.
Researchers spent the next six years working to uncover the animal from a vast piece of land weighing 1100 kg.
Upon completion of the work, the dinosaur is ready to be revealed.
"You just have to narrow down your eyes and believe you're asleep," said Caleb Brown, lead author of the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the animal is exposed.
It will definitely be recorded in the history of history as one of the most beautiful and the most preserved species of dinosaur - Mona Lisa dinosaurs. '
By studying his skin, the researchers found that this herbivore - despite having been covered with armor and resembled a walking tank - was likely to face a serious threat from carnivorous dinosaurs.
The heavy armored dinosaur used a red and white camouflage to protect predators and used a camouflage system that used many of today's animals.
Experts say it allowed him to better blend with his surroundings and avoid enemies. The masking system suggests he was a favorite of larger dinosaurs.
Reports of the 110 million-year-old dinosaur family Nodosauridae first appeared in the papers in May, currently available at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.
Researchers gave him the name of Borealopelta markmitchelli, after the museum technician Mark Mitchell, who spent more than 7,000 hours with the fossil exposing the team.
Thanks to the amazingly preserved fossil state, Dr. Mitchell and the international team of scientists could document the shape and shape of scales and armor all over the body.
They revealed the method of camouflage commonly used by today's animals in defense - the upper part of the animal was darker than its lower part.
Although this camouflage effect is common in nature, researchers' findings are surprising because Borealopelta's size far exceeds today's animals using the same technique.
So it is possible that the dinosaur was such a number of predators that evolution gave preference to camouflage before confrontation.
Many contemporary animals with camouflage - for example, deer, zebra and / or armadillo - are much smaller and also more vulnerable to prey, suggesting that nosodaurus had to fight literally for its survivors.
"The prediction of the huge and heavily armored dinosaur illustrates the dangers posed by the predators during the Cretaceous period," Brown said.
Chemical analysis of the organic ingredients contained in the scales also revealed that the dinosaur's skin was probably reddish-brown in color.
Researchers continue to study the animal and seek further knowledge of his life, including preserved stomach contents, to find his last meal.
He believes that the dinosaur fell to the river after death and was taken to the sea where he sank to the bottom.
In the area of Alberta, the climate was the same as today's Florida, and the rivers and oceans stretched much further inland than it is today.
"This nodosaurus is truly remarkable in that it is completely covered in perfectly preserved scaly skin while being preserved in three dimensions, so we can see its original size," Brown said.
For these reasons, the animal looks almost the same as it was during the Cretaceous period.
You do not have to use your imagination to reconstruct it: it just needs to narrow your eyes and it just seems as if it's just asleep. '
In the Cretaceous period, huge teropods, carnivorous dinosaurs, who moved on two legs, were passing through the Earth.
Though the king of all the dinosaurs - Tyrannosaurus rex - lived several million years after Borealopelta, this armored dinosaur could be a favorite prey to his equally fearsome ancestors.
These include Acrocanthosaurus, a 11.5 meter long monster weighing over 6 tonnes.
Researchers, whose latest findings have been published in Current Biology, believe that the body of Borealopelta was discharged into the sea after being mummified in the mud.
Shawn Funk finds the fossil spotted on March 21, 2011 when drilling at the Suncor Millenium mine near Alberta, Canada.
According to the museum, it is the best preserved armored dinosaur in the world, including leather and armor, which is complete from the muzzle to the hip.
The animal averaged 5 meters in length and weighed up to 1300 kg.
There were two 50 cm of spines protruding from his shoulders.
Researchers believe that this herbivore was extending the territory of today's Canada until it ended up in a river that washed it into the sea.
Its undersea tomb kept the body in perfect condition.
Fossil remains of this kind are preserved to such an extent that the armor panels around the skull still cover the remains of the skin.
As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, finding such a survivor can be compared to winning the lottery.
The longer I watch him, the shocking finding comes to me.
Fossil remains of this kind are preserved to such an extent that the armor panels around the skull still cover the remains of the skin.
At his side lies his right front leg with his fingers pointing upwards.
I can easily calculate scales on his feet. '
How did one activist learn the answer to the question: "Whose Streets?"
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell shuddered all over her body.
The day after she arrived in New York, the St. Louis native sat on a bed in the Airbnb room and went through Facebook posts on her phone.
It has hit a high school student's contribution.
"The police have just shot an 18-year-old boy whose body is still on the street," he said.
She was surprised that nobody else wrote this post, so she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
@TheePharoah constantly retweeted wall paper.
The St. Louis Rapper posted on Twitter his contributions to the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old boy shot by a white-skinned cop in Ferguson, Missouri.
He published a photograph of Brown's body lying in the street, where no one took him after four hours.
"That's crazy," Ferrell thought.
But death was nothing new to her and her community.
She dropped the phone to return to the evening when she watched the tweets about the people who gathered at Canfield Drive.
She watched photographs of police tapes and screaming men, one of the men claiming to be the victim's father and holding a sign with the inscription "Ferguson police killed my unarmed son"!
She watched the lively news - one of the policemen stood before a group of protesters, holding a clue in his hand, and at the other end of the barking dog.
In another video, another policeman held, as he said, in his hand the weapon he was aiming at the crowd and yelled, "I will kill you all ... animals."
"That's not normal," Ferrell said.
"This is not the kind of murder we've gotten used to and what we can call normal.
I felt goose skin all over my body.
"I was angry and wept."
She immediately booked her return flight and the other day she traveled home.
After landing at 23:00, she picked up her six-year-old daughter from her father and decided to go to Ferguson in the morning.
The story of what happened to Ferrell and Ferguson over the next three years describes the new documentary "Whose Streets?" Which will be released in cinemas on August 11th.
It is a story of survival and protest, love and resistance, strength and breakthroughs told from the point of view of people living in the community who venture into the streets and ask for answers.
On her way to Ferguson, Ferrell introduced her dialogue with her daughter - dressed in a flower dress and the same floral face - on a topic they had previously discussed many times - about "experience with blacks".
"Remember how I taught you how the blacks had to fight for what they believed?" Recalls the conversation.
"We're just going to Ferguson now because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and that's not right."
"It did not take into account that I would not take it with me," Ferrell said later.
"Today's events are the culmination ... that happened in the past.
She had to know and see with her own eyes and grow up in it.
She needed to develop not only in activism and organization, but she also had to recognize the difference between the different layers of experience with blacks and what we need to do to get rid of them.
Even though I am able to provide her with conditions in which she does not experience racism in her own way, she does not differ in any way from another black child-woman.
I feel that if I had protected her from this experience, I would only hurt her. "
On arrival at Ferguson, the first stop of the South Florissant Road was across from the police department, which became the base of activists who expected the words of police officer Darren Wilson about his possible involvement in the incident.
Here Ferrell and her daughter met with the local entrepreneur who was preparing for the other food.
Together, they prepared the food in the bags and helped deliver it to the Protestants.
In Ferrell's eyes, a new kind of activism began to slowly be born.
"My activism turned upside down after August 9," Ferrell added, adding that she was president of the Minority Student Nurses Assn University at Missouri University, and was seeking to introduce health care and food in black communities.
"I had no experience with the organization.
It was natural. "
Few weeks later, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan's later co-director during an evening demonstration.
Folayan said that he and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar wanted to "document only" ongoing events.
But Ferrella thought, "Are you working on a document or trying to find a story that could be used?"
This type of skepticism has penetrated the community through many people, often white people, who wanted to earn on pain and determination.
As Folayan explained in a recent interview, "We have heard that the voices of people born and raised in Ferguson are very often neglected and that we wanted to change."
Folayan has already established a collaboration with co-star Damon Davis, a well-known local artist who deals with the topic of death row prisoners.
His participation in the project was also enforced by Ferrell and along with six other local residents who watched the "Whose Streets" team in the years following the assassination of Brown.
"There is no one in this document, but it is our testimony," Davis said.
"It was important to me - how these people will be represented - because in the same way I will be represented."
While the aim of the document was not to focus on Ferrell's experiences - in an attempt to show that the movement "is not about the sovereign leader but about bringing the community together," she said, she was the most open to participation in filming.
The "Whose Streets?" Document describes a very personal aspect of Ferrell's life, for example, how she fell in love with her wife.
"I felt naked," Ferrell said with a smile on her face as she thought of the first moment she had seen the final version of the document.
"But I understand that in order to do this job and pollute the blacks, I have to open."
In addition, Ferrell's story highlights the role of a black-skinned black woman in the wider aspect of the Black Lives Matter movement.
Two of the three founders of the movement - who created in response to the killing of teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012 on a social media campaign under #BlackLivesMatter - call themselves freaks.
"Black black-haired women in leadership positions are ultimately supposed to keep the movement," Ferrell said, "because we are constantly fighting on multiple fronts.
Black eccentric women must bear the weight of these events. "
Folayan agrees with this statement and adds that "the movement is in fact supported by black women and a great deal of eccentric black women."
He insists, however, that "this is not a mere affirmative matter," and Ferrell is not the main hero of the document because of her views.
"She was the driving force and source of energy," she said.
"That she just found herself in the front lines is no coincidence, because life at these intersections in the skin of a black, strange woman is dangerous.
You can feel the jolt of energy in front of the screen. "
Meanwhile, back in Ferguson, TV station cameras have been vacated, but heavy racist ties between the community and police persist.
Ferrell is serving a two-and-a-half-year condition for blocking the motorway during demonstrations.
The socio-political atmosphere in an area she called home is described as "a mess."
Still, she does not keep up with her efforts, which she has committed since she had set out on the streets of Ferguson three years ago.
"It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It is our duty to win.
We must love and encourage each other.
The only thing we can lose is our chains. "
A field burned in Cologne.
Dozens of firefighters went to the place, helped by the helicopter.
Not far from Cesky Brod in Cologne, between Bylany and Liblice, a field of about 15 hectares was burning from 14:00.
Fire ceased to spread around 15:15, firefighters declared a third degree of fire alarm from four possible.
According to the firefighter's spokesman, Ladislav Holomcik helped fire from the air and the helicopter.
At 6:00 pm the fire brigade managed to extinguish the fire, the fire caused damage for 700,000 crowns.
There were dozens of professional and volunteer firefighters fighting with flames.
The fire was due to a technical fault in the engine compartment of the combine.
The helicopter, who carried out six shoals of water, had helped.
"We were handed over to the landlord instead of the attack, until tomorrow, 8:00, it will be guarded by a unit of volunteer firefighters," Holomcik said today.
A Becoming Resemblance: Artist creates portraits using Chelsea Manning's DNA
In the center of one of Fridman Gallery's New York rooms there are several faces of different shades of skin - white, black and brown - hanging from the ceiling on the wires, each of which seems to have fallen out of the previous one.
All 30 portraits were created by artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from the swabs from the oral cavity and the hair that Chelsea Manning sent to her.
Manning has sent her samples from Fort Leavenworth, where a former analyst is serving a 35-year sentence for unauthorized disclosure of secret cable entries to WikiLeaks.
The new show, launched on August 2, is called A Becoming Resemblance.
It is the result of a two-year correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, who combines his experience with technology, informatics and the arts, and Manning's transgender and pioneering dissolution, whose punishment was cut by Obama three days before his departure from the post of President of the United States.
By analyzing the Manning DNA, and using 30 portraits to illustrate how a person with this genotype would look, Dewey-Hagborg created a bizarre, if not intellectual, commentary on DNA compliance - as well as the many ways DNA can be interpreted - and the inherent determinism of these interpretations as well as identity.
Manning, who was born Bradley Edward Manning, has been telling her that she is a woman since her youth and was sentenced in 2013 to twenty charges, including a violation of six espionage laws, computer fraud and theft.
All her photographs were held by prison staff, and only one black-and-white photograph of lower quality was missed, to which Manning, visibly anxious, was sitting on the driver's seat in the platinum blond wig that she is now associated with.
In 2015, there was still a positive response to the Dewey-Hagborg 2012 Stranger Visions project.
As part of this project, Dewey-Hagborg used various forensic items - such as cigarette butts and chewing gums - to create an image of the possible forms of these people.
And it was at this time that she received an e-mail from Paper Magazine.
"They were going to interview Chelsea Manning in prison and wanted to add the portrait to the article," Dewey-Hagborg explained at the opening of a new exhibition.
However, visits and photography were not allowed, so they turned to Chelsea asking if she was interested in a DNA portrait.
The artist and her imprisoned muse have stunned for two years through correspondence.
They even created a comic called Suppressed Images, illustrated by Shoili Kanung, who introduced a vision of what would happen if Chelsea were to be honored and could attend the show personally.
President Obama, in fact, a few days after the release of the comic, asked for Manning's release, which was a welcome change after several unbearable years at a military prison in Kansas.
It's really interesting that the show is running just when Donald Trump is fighting a war on people who are trying to publish government information and transgender soldiers while trying to find new ways to encourage tweets in areas that they should support.
In response to a question about this particular timing, Dewey-Hagborg said that "all is happening for some reason".
Under the artist's statement on one of the walls of the gallery, Manning calls her huge signature (the letter "i" in her surname is drained with her heart) after the end of "self-made fractionation based on gender, race, sexuality and culture."
On the opposite side are the sequences of its mitochondrial DNA - the centipede of letters C, G and A recorded with a pencil.
By including 200 letters (or nucleotides, according to the sophisticated scientific vocabulary of the artist), Dewey-Hagborg wanted to illustrate how surprisingly similar, at least biologically, we are all.
"I hope that people will take away that our genome does not matter who we are, and that genetic data is subjective, and everyone can interpret them in their own way," said Dewey-Hagborg, her work Spider Memories in 2007 on video.
"DNA tells many different stories, this is 30 of them."
The last sample of the exhibition, located in a separate room, is the only page of the above-mentioned graphic novel.
It shows Manning emerging in a King Kong way from the United States Disiplinary Barracks with a megaphone in his hand.
"Once they stop you from speaking, they will win," she writes.
"Never be silent."
"It's a direct transcription from one of the letters," said a Philadelphian artist.
"When I think about it, it makes me goofy."
Manning has not personally visited the show - which was predicted in a comic book - but when it happens, she will be welcomed in the center of her room with her masks, her own genomes portrayed as a crowd of Protestants.
Which was also the purpose of the exhibition, including the nearly 160 cm high Maning statue, on which her genetic haplogroups are recorded.
"In the past, they were placed on the walls, but this time I wanted them to feel the crowd," Dewey-Hagborg said about portraits.
"I wanted to impress the mass movement that takes Chelsea's looks and liberates it."
Professor of the Northwest University and employee of Oxford University seeking murder
These days, a nationwide search for a Northwestern University professor and staff at Oxford University is being prosecuted for suspicion of murdering a man who was found stabbed to death in a luxury Chicago apartment, police said.
On Monday, an arrest warrant for the first-degree murder was issued to a man named Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) for their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, Cook County.
Cornell-Duranleau (26) died as a result of several stab wounds.
The Chicago police said the body of the deceased was found on July 27.
Police officers were notified of this fact by phone, and after arriving at Grand Plaza Apartments, they found a victim in one of the flats with several market wounds.
Cornell-Duranleau was declared dead on the spot and the detectives investigate the case as a murder, police investigate the two suspects, the authorities said.
Lathem worked for 2007 as the Associate Professor of Microbiology and Immunology of the Northwest University.
Alan K. Cubbage, Vice President of the Public Relations University, said in an e-mail statement that Lathem is now on administrative leave and was banned from entering the university campus.
"The matter is now being investigated by the authorities, and the Northwest University works with them," Cubbage said.
Warren is a senior financial manager at Oxford University.
A spokeswoman at Somerville College and Somerville College said in an e-mail statement: "We were contacted by the British police and we are ready to assist the US police as well."
The statement also states that Warren's colleagues were shocked by the fact and wished to join the police.
Anthony Guglielmi, Chief of Public Affairs of the Chicago Police Department, said he called on suspects to surrender to competent authorities.
"The police have information about their place of residence, and the search for suspects is scaling," Guglielmi said.
Guglielmi also added that local, regional and national authorities are helping police in the search for suspects.
According to Guglielmi, the police received a phone call from the Grand Plaza administrator, who was alerted to the events that were to happen in apartment No. 1008.
Police described the entire scene as very violent.
Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the incident occurred on July 27th.
He added that Lathem and Warren were captured by security cameras.
"We believe Professor Latham knew his victim," Guglielmi said.
The Grand Plaza management has issued a statement to all residents: "The police are now working on compiling a victim's timeline and profile and investigating various motives, including domestic violence."
"We will complete the WADA plan in the near future" - Vice-President of the Russian Government Mutko
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said that it would not be long before the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) and the re-establishment of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) were implemented.
"Currently, some of the criteria of the new plan have already been finalized and RUSADA has already acquired the right to planning and testing in cooperation with the British Anti-Doping Agency (UKAD).
In view of this, the WADA plan was updated, "Mutko said on Thursday.
The Vice-President commented on the second part of the WADA plan to comply with the Codex - which describes the criteria for the renewal of RUSADA - which was recently published on the organization's website.
According to Mutka, the Code does not contain anything that Russia should worry about.
"Everything has been announced and everything will also be implemented.
The results will be available to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA in the near future, "he added.
One of the criteria, however, calls for a public announcement of the results of the WADA investigation investigated by Richard McLaren about alleged sponsorship of doping by Russian athletes by the government.
On this subject, Mutko said, "We are conducting an investigation because our anti-doping system apparently failed.
All measures have been taken.
However, there were no state programs in our country, so we can not admit to anything that never existed. "
Mutka's words were confirmed by Vitaly Smirnov, director of the Russian Independent Public Anti-Doping Commission.
In an interview with Russian RSport, Smirnov acknowledged the problems of Russian anti-doping agents, but added: "On many occasions, we have stated that the report contains controversial attitudes and regulations.
Nobody plans to accept the message completely without reservations, "Smirnov concluded.
WADA suspected RUSADA of doping controls in Russia in November 2015 immediately before the doping scandal.
However, the organization has allowed planning and testing unification under the supervision of international experts and the British Anti-Doping Agency (UKAD) this June.
After a visit to the Moscow headquarters in July, WADA CEO Olivier Niggli said RUSADA was "on the right track" to resume.
Police accused three people, one is juvenile.
Police accused three men of setting up a Wednesday fire of a precious wooden church in Třinec-Guty on Frýdek-Místek.
One accused is juvenile, all three are Czech nationalities.
A 15-year jail sentence is threatened with a general crime.
Journalists told Tomas Kužel, the Moravian-Silesian police director, today.
It was a deliberate crime.
"It's a very fresh matter, and the police are working on the theme of the matter," Kužel said.
He said the police would negotiate the possible detention of the accused.
Further information by Director can not be disclosed.
"I can not tell yet more about the fact that the staff of the Criminal Police and Investigation Service and the prosecutor supervising the case actually work on the matter," Kužel said.
The wooden church of the body of God in Guth was from the 16th century.
It was a valuable monument with many original equipment and paintings from the first half of the 16th century.
Tangible damages will amount to tens of millions of crowns, but the historical loss is not quantifiable.
Soon after the fire began to think about the restoration of the church.
The majority of the costs should be covered by the insurance policy, the Ministry of Culture and the City are ready to share the costs, the public collection is being prepared and the contribution of the owner of the monument, ie the local parish, is being prepared.
A similar wooden church of St. Catherine from the 16th century in Ostrava-Hrabová also destroyed a fire fifteen years ago.
This caused a defect in the electrical installation.
An exact copy was created in his place.
The state counts with citizens in defense of the state.
They will support their training.
With the financial support for defense-sponsored societies, volunteer shooting training or a team of training trainers, the subject-matter of the Act on Citizens' Preparedness for the Defense of the State counts.
The Ministry of Defense, which has been assigned to the government by the government, promises to improve the physical fitness of the Czechs and their capabilities, which could then be used in crisis situations.
It follows from the proposal prepared by the ministry.
If the law were to be adopted in the future, the state would spend hundreds of millions of crowns in support of the defense.
The basic aim of the proposal is, according to its authors, to create an effective system that would help to increase the preparedness of the Czech Republic's population to defend the state, beyond the performance of military duties and on the basis of voluntary activity.
For example, the state would support radio or amateur societies, shooters or cynologists by financially or materially, and would increase the capabilities of their members.
In return, he would get information about people who are willing to come to the country when the crisis is in need of assistance and about their capabilities or material equipment.
Accredited instructors could also be available to assist the associations and other stakeholders in training or education.
It also includes organizing talks with war veterans or people who have been heroically preserved.
One of the possible options assumes that a new office would be created to administer and coordinate the project.
The authors of the proposal emphasize that people's participation should be voluntary and that the state would only use their capabilities after the declaration of threat status.
"The whole concept must respect the gradual wiping of previously apparent boundaries between the different types of threats," says the intention with reference to the danger of so-called hybrid threats.
Ministers noted that it was therefore necessary to focus on supporting the widest possible range of capabilities, not just military ones.
"The basic aim of the project is to create a very broad base that enables each citizen to respond to situations that threaten the sovereignty of the state or the lives, health and property of individuals, to protect themselves or contribute to the protection of others and to misbehave the task of the armed forces of the Czech Republic.
Adopting the law would bring considerable financial demands.
Their amount will, according to the Ministry, depend on the option chosen.
For example, the Office foresees financial support for projects to prepare citizens to defend the state up to 100 million crowns.
If an administrative and coordination center were set up, its operation could cost about CZK 60 million per year.
More money would go to wages or build an information system.
The proposal also suggests that the regional military headquarters, which would employ 42 additional troops, would have to be extended.
Ministry officials have earlier said that the law should also help resolve some Czech politicians' disapproval of the introduction of a European Union arms possession directive.
Its admission would allow shooters who will be part of the system to retain some weapons that the directive forbids.
Startups that will help your company not to stay with another Uber
Amy Errett wanted to measure the satisfaction of employees of her e-commerce startup, but did not find a proper survey.
The answers were often inaccurate, useless, or even deceptive.
And despite promising the anonymity of the survey, some employees voiced their distrust in the process.
"I was looking for consistency and objectivity," said Errett, owner of e-commerce Madison Reed hair care company based in San Francisco, which employs 75 people.
So she asked for help from outside.
New startups in the field of human resources are constantly on the market to help companies with employee satisfaction surveys.
Creating and licensing software with a specific intent to measure employee responsibilities allows startups to run fast-track companies, target specific teams and demographic groups, offers complete employee anonymity, and hotline for complaints, and in some cases also allows informers to bypass senior staff and contact directors directly.
"There are tools such as Diet and Fitbit on the market that monitor your health, but where is Fitbit for your company?" Said Jim Barnett, co-founder and CEO of Glint's startup at Reedwood City.
Errett said she had gained awareness over what her employees thought and felt for three years.
In addition to quick surveys and voting for specific teams, Glint offers a company's thermal map and a snapshot of the most complaints groups, as well as an overview of low-rated managers - allowing the user to work on a remedy.
Companies are beginning to realize that it is necessary to take care of the culture of the work environment - in case they become the next Uber - who is screaming in scandals after the former employee posted on his blog a paper describing the corporate environment and harassing employees who dare to speak openly.
For startups like Glint, the demand for corporate culture surveys is a lucrative business opportunity.
According to the Let's Talk Payments website, which addresses technical and financial progress, the value of the global control, regulatory and compliance sector by 2020 can exceed $ 118.8 billion.
Startup Convercent from Denver, Colorado, which helps companies prevent and detect inappropriate behavior, saw a small increase in interest and activity at the beginning of the year, just before the Uberu scandals.
Nearly 600 Convercent clients include Airbnb, Microsoft, and Tesla.
Recently under his wings he also accepted Uber.
Like Glint, Convercent allows companies to send customizable "flash" surveys, collect real-time confidential information, and display temperature maps of problem areas.
It also offers an anonymous text hotline that allows employees to report inappropriate behavior.
If the Director General is involved in the matter, complaints are sent directly to the Management Board.
"The Public Opinion Court has mandated regulators," said Patrick Quinlan, founder and CEO of the Convercent launch.
If the company is convicted of mistreatment or unethical behavior - and unless the regulators engage - can face costly consequences due to customer boycotting, employee exhaustion, or court proceedings, Quinlan said.
The Ruby Tuesday restaurant network, which employs over 25,000 people across 500 locations, has been using Convercent for more than a year to raise employees' awareness of company policies and procedures, and to provide an easy way to contact corporate executives.
Earlier, if the employee wanted to report any problem, he had to find a phone number or e-mail on the company's management, officially file a complaint and hope for a successful resolution.
Often, this was a disparaging and unpleasant experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesday's general assistant, that there was no reliable way of tracking employees' complaints.
Now that the company employs Convercent, rapid detection and resolution of problems that have never before been encountered by office managers are a mile away from the actual resolution of complaints - such as discrimination, harassment or unfair treatment.
"This is a holistic, overall view of employee experience," said Vitrano, who manages Ruby Tuesday's risk management group.
"At the same time, we protect shareholders from litigation by employees."
Companies have lost light on ethics, values and employee participation in 2002 after Arthur Andersen's accountant collapsed after the fall of Enron over the abuse of employees' ethical rights, Quinlan said.
But only when "the social media glittered on the whole thing," companies began to realize that in the online world they could not simply hide their skeletons in the closet.
"Before people began to use technology ethics, they relied on faith," Quinlan added.
Glint i Convercent offer their software in the form of a service for which companies pay regular fees.
It is a business model and opportunity that is approved by brave capital investors who have supported both startups.
In its February campaign, Convercent chose $ 10 million from companies like Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital and eventually won $ 47 million in capital.
Glint won $ 10 million from Bessemer Venture Partners in November and earned $ 60 million throughout the campaign.
These investments are hardly surprising due to the mutual nature of companies, culture and venture capital.
An increasing number of research clearly confirms that today's employees expect more from their workplace than ever before.
And in competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, the main advantage of high salaries and interesting projects is not the main advantage.
Employees want to perceive that they are accepted and valued and that their time is spent on a company that seeks a positive mission.
"If people are happy in their work, they feel that their voice is heard and their work is rewarding, they are striving for the success of the company," said Nina McQueen, Vice President of Global Benefits and Employee Benefits of LinkedIn, which uses Convercent and Glint.
Investors earn if companies and companies thrive if their employees are satisfied.
And when an analytical tool emerges on the market to ensure employees' engagement and commitment to the company, it is no wonder that there are many investors who will support this effort.
According to occupational culture experts, it is important to have data on employee satisfaction.
But the data itself is pointless if the company does not take the necessary steps.
The fact is, once the company asks for feedback from its employees, there may be major changes.
And if the change does not happen quickly - in the worst case at all - it can cause disappointment and lack of interest among employees.
"When you ask for 4000 views, you have to be ready for 4,000 conversations," said Russell Raath, director of consultancy at Kotter International, who has seen many companies relying too heavily on data.
"Because once things are over, employees will start asking," Did they hear me at all?
Are they interested in me?
And if not, then why would it matter to me? ""
Madison Reed, who is doing a survey every month on a regular basis, can help solve the problem within one day, Errett said.
After gathering feedback from employees frustrated with slow decision-making and communication quality, Errett was able to reorganize several teams within the company and start communication training to successfully solve the problem.
Ruby Tuesday gains a very important insight into its employees and hopes to achieve high employment in the industry, which is known for frequent dismissals.
"If you are not trying to create a transparent work environment, employees will not trust you," added Vitrano.
"And once you lose your employees, you lose customers.
And with the outflow of customers, the whole company goes bankrupt. "
Thursday became the hottest day.
Thursday is 38.3 degrees recorded in Strážnice in Hodonín until the warmest day of the year in the Czech Republic.
It surpassed the calf, which was originally the hottest day of the year with 37.3 degrees.
The staff of the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute informed about it.
Compared to Tuesday, however, many temperature records did not fall.
Vedra hit mainly Moravia, in Bohemia was mostly cloudy.
On Tuesday, 35 of the 145 weather stations measuring over 30 years were overcome or equalized.
On Thursday, the record had only nine long-term measuring stations.
Perhaps the temperature in today's Strážnice was the same as the previous record in 2013.
In Lednice in Břeclav, today's 37.4 degrees surpassed the original maximum by four tenths of the level and in Pohořelice in Brno the current 37.1 degrees exceeded the record by three tenths.
Both records, as well as Strážnice, came from 2013.
High temperatures have appeared mainly in the south and east of Moravia.
After Straznice was the biggest heat in Dyjakovice in Znojmo and Brod nad Dyjí in Břeclavsko, where the mercury climbed to 37.8 degrees, but the record did not overcome.
On the other hand, in the western and northwest Bohemia, according to the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute (ČHMÚ), today's highest temperatures are only around 22 degrees Celsius.
"Temperatures began to grow there later this afternoon," meteorologists said.
According to the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute (ČHMÚ), the current heat in the Czech Republic will gradually disappear and on Sunday there could be more rain.
Most temperatures in Moravia remain high on Friday and in the southeast of Moravia and on Saturday.
There has been such a disaster here.
Billionaires do not have the same voice in the election as any one of the underage people in the country.
They want to make a decision directly, and since not everyone is as keen as Andrei Babiš, who wants to own the state, they buy political parties.
Owner Penty Marek Dospiva and Martin Burda and Antonin Frych are sponsoring Robyshev's Realists.
The second life of the Civil Democratic Alliance is funded by the owner of the insurance company and the real estate entrepreneur Pavel Sehnal, who is also his chairman.
The condemned coroner and the king of Czech gambling Ivo Valenta bought the Private Party.
The political movement Agrofert, as the project of Andrej Babiš did not name the Mayor of Kroměříž Jaroslav Němec, is a chapter for herself.
Their mercenaries have also recently caught the Mayors.
It is Dalibor Dědek, the owner of the company Jablotron security equipment.
In his own words, he enters politics to do good.
Entrée in the old-fashioned jersey did not do much to the Grandfather.
"I have never dreamed small targets," he said at a press conference.
That is, my goal is for the YO movement to get the Mayors movement gained twenty percent in the elections.
Someone smiled.
However, the ancestral reverberation is more characteristic.
Billionaire Dalibor the Old is a man of firm opinion.
Although he intends to vote for voters in the janitor, he continues to support Andrei Babiše.
The Grandparents supported Babies in the past parliamentary elections.
"Babiš is not a seasoned speaker and does not have a lively rhetoric of political snakes," he wrote about it before the 2013 elections.
But he definitely does not go into politics because he wants to personally improve himself.
Babi's hero will stay for me.
He is willing to step out of his world that he has under control and do something for all of us.
Shortly after the Mayors introduced her as a new reinforcement, he recalled his admiration for Babis.
And he said he wanted the Mayors to learn a possible collaboration with Babis.
Some may appreciate the fact that the Old Man does not change his opinions and stands behind him no matter what jersey he is wearing.
Others may speculate whether Babiš sends to the mayors to build a bokeh of someone so awkward.
Others may ask whether Jablotron's boss, perhaps with Agrofert's boss, did not break into the shop and find no other way to defend his business rival.
However, the first grandfather's public appearances were not just around Babis.
The Old Man promised to send ten million crowns to the Mayor.
And if he says he needs more money, he will send more.
Several years ago, he would have been hard to suspend such a statement.
Indeed, gauner judicially accredited by Zdeněk Bakala before the 2010 elections scattered millions on all sides.
The Political Division of the Security Agency, Vita Bárta, TOP 09 and the Civic Democrats, came together for about thirty million.
But today is another time.
The law forbids anyone to give more than three million to the political party.
When the Old Man entered the politics, he could at least study the rules of the game.
Perhaps he would not have to ask why politics had so bad a reputation in our country.
During his first days in politics, the Old Man crowned a proposal for a tax advantage for families with studied children.
People with college education will come to us about fifty thousand a month.
Those with basics in less than twenty.
A man of fifty thousand is rich in the local circumstances.
The one with twenty poor.
In the Granddad's vision, the poor pay taxes honestly, and the rich enjoy the benefits of the functioning of the welfare state on which they do not participate much.
The rich are in need of help, so that they do not suffer poverty in need.
Mayors can congratulate each other for their new acquisition and Babis shake hands.
The rest of us, thanks to the Grandfather, can confirm that billionaires are not good people.
But there remains a question of whom to vote for.
For me, those who know the rules of the game and want to follow them.
Those who do not have members and members of their party, citizens and citizens of the state, are not their property and their country.
And finally, those who want to live well in all rich people, not just some.
No one wanted Trump's paradise.
The villa complex had to be cheaper by 234 million.
Sale of real estate is sometimes not easy.
And it does not help 11 bedrooms, a wonderful sea view, or the fact that the property is sold by US President Donald Trump.
When selling the Le Chateau des Palmiers, the price went down by an unbelievable £ 8 million.
Mirror.co.uk reported on this site.
The brochure says: "Sincerely, Donald J. Trump."
Win like any other.
But even the merger of the real estate company with the US president did not hold up an extreme price tag.
Donald Trump had to reduce the price of his Caribbean seat to an incredible £ 8 million.
The original price of the property was 21.5 million pounds, the final price dropped to 13 million pounds.
Even after the discount, the villa complex costs about 76 average apartments in the center of Prague.
And there's no wonder.
An impressive 5 acre estate on the Caribbean island of St. Martin has 12 full bathrooms, 11 bedrooms, a variety of dining rooms, a gym and other rooms.
It consists of several buildings.
Part of the property is a swimming pool and a tennis court.
Tens of palms are planted on the plot.
From the terrace there is a wonderful view of the sea.
According to real estate experts, the fact was that the connection with the president was not enough to attract potential buyers.
Now the real estate is closer to normal property prices on the island.
Trump bought the property in 2013.
According to speculation, he paid about 15 million pounds.
The property was to be bought for hire.
Le Chateau des Palmiers was the most expensive property on the island of Saint Martin.
But with the new prize, it ranks second.
The property in the neighborhood was valued at 13.5 million pounds.
The NCAA decided to end two training sessions a day
The eleventh morning is approaching, and UCLA UCLA football players cling to the side of the new school playground.
Some of them take off their jerseys and reveal their sweaty back, the unmistakable sign of the first day of the training camp.
For most members of the team, these few minutes of doing nothing will take a lunch break.
Players enrolled in the summer semester will go to the room after a three-hour session to study for the final exam before returning to the Wasserman Football Center for a meeting that takes place at 6:30 the following morning.
"For these boys, the next three days will be a good mug," said coach Bruins Jim Mora a while before Monday's swing on Tuesday.
By eliminating two training sessions in one day, NCAA wants to lighten players - paradoxically, training days are even longer - at least until Friday when the final exam ends.
That's why the first three UCLA trainings are scheduled at 19:15 - to fit into the already crowded diaries of many students.
For the first time in six seasons spent by Mora as a Westwood trainer, Bruins training camp began a week earlier than last year, and the training is limited for the summer semester, with the decision to limit the number of training sessions from two to one a day.
Eighteen training sessions are scheduled to take place by August 20th, after which formal preparations for the first match against the Texas A & M team are taking place in September.
Mora has been told he supports NCAA's decision, despite adding another item to a packed diary of players.
"Three or four days are players under great stress and it's very exhausting for them," said Mora.
"But no one has given up, everyone is trying. They are great.
I think that on Saturday, when we have more time, everything will calm down. "
UCLA will be closed after the end of the training camp, which will not be easy when looking at the clear lines of the adjacent parks from the adjacent parking lot and the luxurious Luskin Center, which occupied the players after harvesting the protective net behind the goalpost.
Bruins players should occupy this week starting this week, but Mora recognizes that when the rooms are emptied during the season, there might be a problem.
"The land will be guarded by the security service," added Mora.
"Security is taken care of, but it is not excluded that someone can rent a room and record our training.
Such material is well traded.
Fortunately, the hotel will guard the security as well as parking lot 8.
We will make the most of our resources.
I believe everything will go well.
Everything is planned. "
Facebook plans to scrutinize facts more closely to reduce the number of false messages
Facebook will send more potentially fake articles to third-party control and display findings under the original posts in an effort to fight so-called "fake news," said the largest social network on Thursday.
The company, in a statement on its website, writes that it will start using updated machine learning to detect possible hoaxes that it will send to third parties for verification and potentially display survey results under the original postings.
Facebook has been labeled as one of the main sources of false reports and many believe that these unconfirmed reports have influenced last year's US presidential election.
Political debates are taking place in Europe, French voters are flooded with false reports of the May presidential election, and Germany plans to impose a fine on the social media in advance of the September elections if it does not promptly remove the angry contributions.
Facebook on Thursday said in a statement in Germany that it is about to start testing a new messaging function in the US, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
"In addition to viewing third-party testimonials, people ask for more content to be better informed and can decide what they can share," said Sara Su, Facebook Product News Manager, on her blog.
She added that Facebook continues to test the "related articles" feature and is also working on other changes to reduce the number of false messages.
Graphic Design: The story of A Castle in England
Little Castle Scotney Castle has recently played a leading role in the music video of the Squeeze group, and its shelter was also found by Margaret Thatcher during the 1970s and 1980s.
Scotney, however, was from a cozy spot on the Bewl River in Kent, a 700-year-old stormy story that inspired Jamie Rhodes's curly Yorkshire County - famous for his historical record - to create a graphic novel.
"The look of the man who is 300 years after death fascinates me," says Rhodes with a serious face.
"When I hold a letter in my hand, I feel a personal connection."
A story in England illustrates the lives of the families who have lived in Scotney since the Middle Ages until the Eduard period, each illustrating a different British artist - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
But this is not the first archive inspired by Rhodes: he is also the author of Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories (2014), a collection inspired by the British Library's documentary - a project that was very emotional for him.
"He took my fingerprint on a letter written by a double agent in the 1970s who worked for Jakobita," he said.
"That's the fingerprint of his thumb!
And letters always smell like smoke, because in those times you had to light a candle to read.
When I touch the letter now, 300 years later, it's like coming back in time.
How I love archives! "
For someone so fascinated with old papers, support from the National Trust and Arts Council England and the opportunity to spend almost four months in the castle almost as a dream. ("To be honest, I stayed a little longer.")
Rhodes spent time exploring the Victorian "new" castle, browsing the archives, and studying many treasures and curiosities, such as the head of hyenas on the wall and bottles thrown away for centuries in a ditch.
He walked across the grounds and studied the ruins of the old castle, talking with the harpsmen, the gardens, and occasionally also the artists who worked on illustrations of his book.
At night, he "sipped whiskey and wrote".
Scotney's confidential history is relatively unknown, as National Trust gained access to documents in 2006 after the death of the last heir, Elizabeth Hussey.
When Rhodes arrived at the site ten years later, the staff began to penetrate the archives Rhodes described as saying, "The aristocrats of many centuries are throwing their hands with the words," Put it in the attic. "
Diaries, letters from the British empire, maps showing properties: "You may think that the land dispute is boring," Rhodes said, "but I came across a case where two families were dragging a birch.
Leave that people! "
Some stories in the book use the castle as a springboard and deeper into English history, including a story called The Labourer, which tracks a man who leaves a newly built castle to join the English Uprising in 1381.
"I found a rebellion record at the 1380 Castle, which was called Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex," Rhodes said.
"The English uprising has actually begun in this area and it occurred to me that rebellion is a good starting point.
Perhaps they are related somehow. "
Other stories are firmly connected to the history of the castle - for example, The Priest, which tells the story of a Jesuit priest who had hidden Darrell's family for seven years during the English Reformation.
Or The Smuggler about an 18th-century smuggler named Arthur Darrell, who allegedly pitted his own funeral when he filled the coffin with stones (which was discovered several years after the coffin was uncovered).
Rhodes's favorite family is Darrell: "I was attracted by the male race - the men were always indebted and they spent money on things they could not afford.
Different generations of the Darrell family have solved this by taking rich or old ladies - I imagine they were handsome gentlemen who liked to heal their heads. "
Rhodes searches for the end of his stay at the castle after further adventures.
He recently returned from a two-week sessions in the Finnish wilderness, where he took inspiration for his next book about Elämänmäki, a former sanatorium of the early 20th century that was absorbed by nature.
But for Scotney, this is a special place.
"I was sad when I left," he said.
"I thought," Now, let me go back to real life. ""
Washington changes the green card award terms
The media has published the words of President Donald Trump on the new US immigration plan, which will also change the green card award.
It is estimated that the number of legal immigrants will fall by 50,000 year-on-year as a result of stricter rules on the granting of temporary work visas and restrictions on family visas.
New rules are proposed by the Republicans and the President.
The bill will soon be submitted to Congress.
"This law will reduce poverty, raise wages and save billions of dollars for taxpayers, and we will bring this change of green card issuance rules to residents of other countries.
The law will limit the number of immigrants and replace the current scheme.
The new application process favors English-speaking applicants who spend money and demonstrate skills that will benefit our country, "said Trump, quoted by the media.
Sexual robots are on the rise - we should be alert
Just as it did not seem to be more bizarre in 2017, there is a report on the technological development of sexual robots on the Internet.
Yes.
Sexual robots are currently very popular.
The Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) has recently released a statement on the development of sexual robots over the next five to ten years.
According to former professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at Sheffield University and co-founder FRR Noel Sharkey, it is important to look at the rise of sexual robots seriously.
Customers can choose the color of the eyes, the shape of the nipples and the look of the robot nails.
"People get tired of them, but sales are rising and we have to be ready to see them more and more," Sharkey said on the occasion of the release of the report.
Modern sexual aids are changing from an inflatable pan to a robotic woman with a silicone skin that is warm to the touch - artificial intelligence, of course, that mimics human behavior.
The user can adjust the robot to its image - from eye color and nipple shape to look and nail color.
Very concerned, however, is the fact that many robots have their own "personality" that would also embarrass Stepford's mistress.
Modern inflatable dolls have evolved into a robotic woman with silicone skin.
The RealBotix robot owner can set up a variety of different character features, including shyness.
And then there's a true robotic robotic woman named True Companion, Roxxxy Gold, which comes with pre-programmed personalities, including the "frigid Farrah," featuring a shy character and "wild Wendy" with an "adventurous" character.
"The personality of Roxxxy Gold is set to match your personality as much as possible," says True Companion.
So she likes what you like and vice versa.
She's even moody, just like people.
She may be tired, talkative, or be in a mood.
The rise of sexual robots is alarming for several reasons - not including confusion about real interpersonal relationships, but rather inferior female character traits and violent cues - such as frigid (Farrah reading).
True Companion likes Roxxxy to be a vibrator for men on its website.
"If a woman can have a vibrator, why could not a Roxxxy man?" He writes on the page.
Sexual robots, however, are not just a fetish or a sexual aid.
Their emergence and almost perfect sophistication point to something darker and deeply rooted in our culture - moving away from ideal or gender equality towards the desire for compelling sex with an optional surcharge.
Most men, of course, do not buy a robotic woman and while FRR talks about their growing popularity, sexual robots still remain on the edge of the general public.
However, this marginal interest may become the mirror of modern times.
And most people are not strange or violent unless they give them a pretext for the free market.
It is no coincidence that these sophisticated sex robots appear at a time when women around the world are gaining their rights, and the President of the White House is sitting in the White House, who is often very disrespectful about the woman.
The most awesome aspect of the story The story of a servant is not what we see - hanging bodies and drawn eyes, just like the reality of these visions.
Book story The story of a servant is a step in the right direction, but at the moment it seems to be a small step.
Sexual robots should as closely as possible resemble real women (though with porn levels).
Their creators are designed to be nice to touch and act at first glance as a real woman.
But when it comes to their "personality," the robot can not replace a real woman.
They can not break up with their partner or just leave.
They have no work or history, nothing to incite their independence or disturb their loyalty to their master.
In other words, they are nice slaves.
The 21st century speaks: maid.
The NBA star on the green arm.
Curry is fighting in California for a cut.
Stellar basketball player Stephen Curry has not lost his professional first golfer in spite of his first bang.
The double-award winner for the most-profitable NBA player played the lower series of the Ellie Mae Classic in Hayward, California's first round of 74 wins and will fight for the cut.
Golden State, who won the second NBA title with the Warriors this season, began a lot of nervousness, and his first shot ended in a beverage holder in a golf cart parked at a fairway.
Even then, he was not as accurate as he was under the basketball basket, but he had ten professionals behind with a four-shot balance over par.
"It was not the perfect way to get started, to call the referee right after the first shot, but then a little sad," Curry said, with a huge trick on him.
It was very nervous to blow the first blow to the tournament, but it was all I hoped for.
"If you told me I would play 74 in the first round, I would take it immediately," he added.
If Curry is able to fight with a cutem who will probably have two wounds under par, he will become the first representative of another sport that can do it on the Web.com Tour.
"I want to play better next time, and now that I get rid of it, maybe it will go," said an enthusiastic golfer who had played in celebrity and mixed amateur and professional competitions in the past.
In Hayward he starts for the first time in a tournament that falls under the PGA.
In order to participate in Ellie Mae Classic, he won a sponsorship exemption and retained amateur status.
The Web.com Tour series is one category under the elite PGA Tour.
Trump's big victory?
Against this, Mitt Romney is the embodiment of common sense
The unfortunate sign of the Trump era is political divisions that divide the US electorate and, on the micro scale, also break the whole family.
In the Christmas and Thanksgiving period, the American newspaper has advised on how to deal with relatives who choose Trump.
We're just supposed to wait for our nerves to be released.
However, less attention is paid to Trump's ability to bundle the family.
I'm talking about this because my cousin, a poet and a left-wing poet who lives in Chicago, has been visiting New York this week, who has been paying for a Republican fool in our family for a long time.
She reminded me that a face-to-face encounter with a common enemy might have a strong effect.
Now, with Trumpe in the White House, the whole family - including all Republican siblings who have been bickering about politics for years - is on one wave at a time.
At dinner at the family table, it's a good thing, but I am struck by the fact that in a broader context it poses a significant risk.
Trump strengthens the left, but the negative effect of his presidency has the power to push us all right.
If we talk about "normalization" and Trump, we refer to the terrible possibility that one of his shuckers may lose their attractiveness one day.
There is, however, a more horrible long-term scenario in which Trump "normalizes" right-wing Republicans who, contrary to its standards, will suddenly be the epitome of what can be called rational.
In these nostalgic hearts today I remember Mitt Romney and his version of crazy action - a dog on the roof of a car, a 14% income tax (at least we had a sense of his tax return) - both of which look like very mild offenses compared to Trumpe.
After leaving Trump, it will be enough for a subsequent Republican candidate to be at least normal, which will be an enormous improvement.
We used our cousin's visits and took our children to Central Park on the largest carousel that runs the New York Department of Parks - you will not find better use of your three dollars if you do not need caffeine.
The horses are enormous, the central cylinder is covered with fiberglass - the clowns and the animals are shooting and looking at their shoulders in horror - a gloomy look and cranking music oddly reminds public transport.
Many clichés soon get tired: view from high-rise buildings, the panorama looks, instead of breathing in the atmosphere, and the reality of the city does not get your ideas.
Thirty-five years later, I still did not translate the fact that Swiss Cottage is not really Swiss cheese - not counting the Ye Olde Swiss Cottage - but the London Underground station.
The roundabout in Central Park, however, provokes a remarkably magical experience, to the extent that two two-year-olds and two mature women enjoy it.
If I could evaluate the merry-go-round, it would deserve the maximum points, but no one is fortunate enough to ask.
This week I experienced a similar experience in the store when I was asked to rate my "experience" on a scale of one to five when I was paying for a credit card.
In the cafe on the corner of my street it's the same, except that I can score 15% tip for something I buy behind the counter.
Not only does it slow down otherwise fast sales, but the waitress is forced to rub into the favor of shoppers when it is not needed.
The woman in the store apologized to me as I reluctantly assessed my five-star credit card handover.
Oscar Pistorius was taken from prison to hospital due to chest pain
This is the second time Pistorius had to be taken to the hospital.
Last year he was treated because of a wrist cut, which, according to the prison statement, caused himself after falling into the cell.
Pistorius was convicted of murder after his appeal against the original sentence for killing.
He killed his girlfriend Steenkamp in the early hours of Valentine's Day in 2013 with a few gunshot wounds through the toilet cabinet door in her Pretoria home.
Pistorius claimed he had mistaken her for a thief.
The petitioners announced their intention to appeal again, this time against the six-year sentence of Pistorius, which is too mild in their words.
The National Prosecuting Authority said she would appeal to the South African Supreme Court and the trial will take place this year.
In case of success, Pistorius threatens to extend the sentence to 15 years.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
For the first time in history, she gave birth to a captive bred panda who had been mating in the wild.
The pand rescue program is a huge success.
The center is trying to expand the genofond pand chased in captivity.
Worker Center Zhang Qing told New China Agency that pand breeding is at risk of a crossbreeding.
In captivity, only 471 pandas lived at the end of last year.
In the wild, only two thousand survive.
The effort to let pandas captured with the wild ones is the first step to keep pand breeding to protect this species.
Fifteen-year-old Ccha'oxao was launched into a nature reserve at the beginning of the Pandi mating season on March 11th.
With the tracking device on the neck, scientists could see every step she took.
His chosen one met Cchao-cchao 12 days later.
The sexual intercourse with the pandemic male took a minute and a half and hit successfully.
This can also be considered a small miracle because pandi males are not considered to be the most successful lover of the animal kingdom.
The males fairly poorly estimate the time when the female is ready, moreover they are often confused and do not know what to do.
The baby was born healthy and, given that Chao-chao had an extraordinary appetite during pregnancy, weighed 216 grams after birth.
The average weight of the newborn panda is 70 grams lower.
Two Bulgarians were detained for illegal camping in Greece
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced the detention of two Bulgarian tourists on the territory of Greece for illegal camping, quoted by bTV.
A group of tourists, including two Bulgarians, was arrested on August 1 in the morning by the Sithonian police.
Everyone was released the same day, but the investigation continues.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has told the TV channel that Bulgarian tourists were later released.
The Greek authorities tightened the rules of free camping and imposed severe penalties on anyone caught in a place where camping is not allowed.
Checks will take place throughout the season.
The ministry said the court could impose a fine.
Spilka is in fifth place after the first round of the British Open.
The golfer Klára Spilková is ranked 50th after the first round of the British Open.
The Kingsbarns Scottish Playground scrolled one score under the par with three birdies and two bogeys.
Twenty-nine-year-old Czech player has the hope that for the first time, the famous major will go through a break.
The $ 3.25 million prize went best to American star Michelle Wie, who won the first round in the 64-run course, eight under par.
Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands are pulling millions of toxic eggs out of the market.
The Netherlands itself has temporarily closed 180 poultry farms due to the incident.
According to Reuters, the Dutch Food Safety Authority, NVWA, has been investigating 20 percent of all Dutch poultry, which means 80 percent of the eggs in the market are safe.
The Office stressed that the risk represented only a limited number of egg types recognizable by specific numbers.
According to the German authorities, the amount of toxic substance in eggs is small and does not pose a threat to adults, but a potential threat to children.
Petr Majer, a spokesman for Czech SVS, said that eggs and chickens from the Netherlands and Belgium, where the authorities have approached the breeding, have not recently been introduced into the Czech Republic.
Veterinarians, however, take samples of eggs and chicken meat from Belgium, the Netherlands, France, Italy, Germany and Poland, in whose markets problematic insecticide labels appeared.
Eggs from Belgium were last seen in the Czech market in the Czech Republic last year and eggs from the Netherlands last in May.
Belgian chicken from Belgium last appeared in the Czech Republic in June.
In the Czech Republic, however, there is a certain amount of chicken from the Netherlands.
Fipronil is a substance that is part of flea preparations, everything and ticks.
However, it must not be administered to animals whose meat is consumed by humans.
World Health Organization WHO considers the preparation to be slightly toxic.
His high doses lead to feelings of nausea and dizziness.
Riga is beautiful, I will miss, says goalie Sedláček and looks for engagement.
I still want to catch ten years.
"Maybe I'll be back once," smiled the 27-year-old Sedlacek who could start the season in the Zlin jersey.
It depends on whether you get an engagement at the start of a new year.
What were the four years you spent in Latvia?
If I had to rate it like in school, then three.
I missed the first year, I had an experienced goalie before me.
I learned.
The second year I started catching.
Before the third season, I thought they would give me more space.
But they brought a new goalie, with whom I turned again.
Last year I assumed I would keep catching.
But during the first ten games we only got five points, so the coaches started to spin.
At the end, my colleague was catching up.
But that's how it works.
They wanted to keep him up for next season.
What was life in Riga?
Beautiful.
It's a small Prague.
Beautiful, European, historic city.
I will miss you.
I found a girlfriend there.
We are together for the third year, next year we will be taking.
So I brought something.
How challenging is KHL for the goalie?
The first ten teams are really good.
Then there are teams like us or Slovan, who have to change their game style against them.
The skill is on the other hand, so you have to replace it with something.
It means playing more backwards, fighting more.
I did not see a problem in the width of the pitch.
The difference is that the Russians want to play empty.
Min is shooting, and even if they have a half-empty goal in front of them, they prefer to record.
The Czech Republic still shoots more.
Did not you travel and travel over seven time zones?
If a person does not have a family, it is not a problem.
He can sleep calmly.
The program is mostly done by playing four matches outdoors and then having two days off.
How do Latvians perceive their club at KHL?
As a national team.
All of Latvia is watching hockey, along with basketball it's national sport.
Everybody cheers.
Even though it did not work, a lot of people were going.
Did Dinamo help KHL help to make Latvia to the quarterfinals at this year's World Cup?
KHL has been playing since 2008 and Dinamo has been there since the beginning.
And from that same time, their results at the World Championships have begun to go up.
At the Sochi 2014 Olympics, they just fell 1: 2 in the quarterfinals with Canada.
That was an unbelievable result for them.
Thanks to KHL they have reached a higher level.
More and more Latvian players are heading to the Czech extraliga.
Roberts Bukarts envied Zlín and Ralfs Freibergs signed the contract before signing.
How much do they have so many?
They are not bachelors, they are really good.
Local teams are looking for cheaper and younger players from abroad, Latvians are among them.
It's a natural direction.
KHL starts in three weeks.
Why are you still engaging?
At the beginning of February, I knew I would not continue in Riga.
So we started looking for something.
Sparta was on the table.
But because we did not have a budget for the goalie, we did not agree.
Then it was a classic.
We talked to different teams, but decided in the final for someone else.
So I'm training at home in Zlín and I'll wait for something to come up.
Are not you nervous?
That was four years ago when I left and did not know what was going to happen.
The current situation is not the best, on the other hand I am after some time at home.
Something I caught in KHL, so I'm taking it differently.
The question just sounds when and where I sign.
How real is the variant that you will start the new vintage in Zlín?
Anything can happen.
We'll see what's going to happen in the month of what's up.
Now I can just wait for the agent to talk.
Do you prefer a competition?
The past season was not such that I could choose.
So I'm waiting for the phone.
Government flight at Flight continues.
In January of this year, I wrote in the article "Care of a Good Manner" about the camp at Lety near Orlík.
The nature of the problem remains the same, so I can recall the crucial passages of the article.
The Lets camp has been talking for many years.
For the readers who do not know exactly what's going on, it's probably best to look at, for example, the official site of the cultural heritage of Pietní místo Lety.
There, at the beginning of the historical overview, he learned that the camp was two kilometers east of the village of Lety, that he served as a labor camp since 8 August 1940, since 1 January 1942 he was a gathering camp and since 2 August 1942 he has become a gypsy camp.
The following is a description of the course of life in the camp, including inhumane conditions, until March 1943, when the first Flight prisoners were assigned to Auschwitz transport.
On May 4, 1943, 370 people were transported to the extermination camp.
In total, there were 420.
A very sad history of the enormous suffering of human beings that has caused them human beings and perverse ideology.
There is no question about the need to constantly remind these events.
There is no question that remembrance should take place at the memorial in the place of the suffering of these people.
The problem is elsewhere.
During socialism, the campsite was somewhat forgotten and in the 70s of the 20th century a pig was built near and on the part of the former camp.
The history of the camp was accidentally discovered in 1992 by American Paul Polansky, in 1995 a memorial was unveiled at Leth.
In the mid-1990s, the government had promised the purchase and demolition of the pighouse, but so far it has not happened.
In 1998, the monument was declared a cultural monument and since 2009 its administration falls under the Lidice Memorial.
In July 2013, the UN Human Rights Committee called on the Czech Republic to conclude the pig.
So very briefly the facts about the post-war fate of the camp.
Only in autumn the government approved the purchase of the piggy bank and decided to make an expert judgment to determine the price.
According to the Minister of Agriculture, the government is buying the pigs.
According to Herman's Minister of Culture, "there are some figures, but I would probably have thrown those plans if I went to the public."
Let's see what the expertise will bring.
Some unofficial estimates may amount to hundreds of millions, according to others, the price may be as high as a billion.
Anyway, it will not be a cheap affair anyway.
And just a few hundred meters from the former camp stands a memorial, which the state has invested in almost 10 million crowns in 2010.
Even if the whole transaction was funded by the UN Human Rights Committee, which obviously is not a threat, it would be a waste of money.
Which government does not have other priorities?
A memorial, a dignified place of commemoration, is the will of history almost in the immediate vicinity of the tragedy, and anyone who wants to worship can be here to pay tribute and murders.
I see no reason to change it!
Let it not be as it is, and keep the sacred place with utmost care.
The responsible person, in this case the government of the Czech Republic, should be treated with the care of a good man.
At least as much as in your own company!
Of course, the Minister of Finance and Deputy Prime Minister is not the whole government.
Yet, from the point of view of the aforementioned facts, I still perceive the identity of the leader of the YES movement only as an empty pre-election proclamation.
This May I went straight to the place.
Very good driveway, landscaped parking, replicas of wooden camp houses.
In one exposure, in the second integrated toilet with running water.
A small natural amphitheater with a seating area and a view of its own relic location, made of stones located on a mild slope.
Lots of flowers and wreaths.
All attributes corresponding to the meaning of this place as it suits and belongs.
Archaeological research is currently taking place on the site of the original camp.
It would be wise to consider whether it would be possible, for example, to preserve part of the exposed foundations and at least visually make them available in an appropriate manner.
In this direction, Minister of Culture Daniel Herman could have strained his efforts.
If he succeeds in pushing the state to buy the piggy bank in the government, it will be just another unfortunate step in his already quite problematic role as the Minister of Culture.
Red meat, dairy products and chocolate can alleviate the symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)
For your digestive system, red meat and dairy products can be a nightmare.
A new study, however, suggests the opposite: a diet rich in animal protein and dairy products could help alleviate the symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease.
An incurable disease affecting up to 1.3 million US residents and 300,000 patients in the UK causes abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea, weight loss, and extreme fatigue.
Patients are usually reminded not to use meat and dairy products to alleviate the symptoms but researchers at the University of Washington have found that the essential amino acid tryptophan contained in the protein helps to build up immune cells that support the immunity of the intestines.
Dr. Marco Colonna, the lead investigator, explained that immune cells protect the intestines and ensure the destruction of harmful microbes from food.
The number of inflammatory cells is balanced by the number of cells that support tolerance and protects the body without damaging the sensitive tissue.
As soon as the bowl scales to the side of the inflammation, an inflammatory bowel disease may occur.
In the research, scientists have found the presence of immune cells that promote body tolerance in the stomach of mice with a particular bacterium.
This bacterium requires the presence of tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to produce cells.
Professor Colonna said: "We found a link between one species of bacteria - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a common part of the intestinal microbe and the development of cells that promote body tolerance.
The more tryptophan the mice had in their diet, the more they had these immune cells. "
At the same time, he suggested that, if it turns out to be the same for humans, the combination of L. reuteri bacteria and tryptophan-rich diet would help to develop a more tolerant and less inflammatory intestinal environment.
Postgraduate researcher Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barraganwas, in the study of a certain type of immune cell supporting body tolerance, discovered that one group of test mice had these cells while a second group of the same mice bred separately had cells lacking.
It has been deduced from the fact that one group of mice has a different intestinal microbe - a community of bacteria, viruses and fungi that usually dwell in the gastrointestinal tract.
Mouse mice were tested by the DNA sorting method and the researchers found six species of bacteria in immune cell mice that lacked a second group of mice.
The mice, which were kept in a sterile environment and lacked intestinal microbe - and therefore did not develop this type of immune cells - were treated with L. reuteri - and formed immune cells.
To understand how bacteria affect the immune system, researchers researched L. reuteri in the fluid and then transferred a small amount of bacteria - free of immune cells to the immune cells that were stored in isolation.
Immune cells developed into a tolerant cell.
After removing the active ingredient from the fluid, it has been shown to be a byproduct of tryptophan metabolism known as indolyl-3-acetic acid.
When the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the diet of the mice, the number of these cells increased by 50 percent. After splitting the doses of tryptophan, the number of cells decreased by half.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that humans have the same tolerant cells as mice and most of us keep L. reuteri bacteria in their gastrointestinal tract.
It is not known whether tryptophan byproducts from L. reuteri cause cell development in humans the same way as in mice, but defects in tryptophan-related genes have been detected in people with inflammatory bowel disease.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan added: "Each of us should probably seek to develop these cells because they control the inflammation of the internal surface of the intestines.
A potentially high level of tryptophan in the presence of L. reuteri may increase the population of cells. "
José Mourinho considers the signing of the contract with Neman Matić and his transfer to Manchester United for "ingenious"
Manchester United has genius in Nemanja Matić's team - at least that's what José Mourinho thinks after defending his midfielder on Wednesday's match against Sampdoria.
Matić, who signed the 40 million pound contract, played in the first match with a 2-1 victory in Dublin - the last pre-season before the UEFA Super Cup, where United meets Real Madrid on Tuesday - and played a role as midfielder alongside Paul Pogby and Andreas Pereira.
However, since he did not take part in the pre-season Asian tour, Matić did not have the form and played only 45 minutes, which is why Mourinha is to be involved before the start of the next Premier League season.
"He needs time, but he is experienced, intelligent, and has a brilliant thinking - he thinks soccer," Mourinho said.
"We'll help him get into his condition as soon as possible."
Like Matić, his new teammates Victor Lindelöf and Romel Lukaku also played the first match at Aviva Stadium and Mourinho is slowly starting to form his eleven for the next season.
An independent source announced this week that Mourinho still wants to sign a contract with three other players, but insists that the club did a "fantastic job" and brought three of the four most important players to the team.
"I thank the club for helping me get three of the four players," he added.
"Four out of four would please me more, but I admit they have done the most for me."
The Life Challenge of the King of Chicken Lambs Lady Pears.
He wants a lesson from Pohlreich!
This multifaceted picture began to emerge thanks to a new show at the TV Prima Zdenek Academy.
The pear immediately sniffed a chance.
"Dear Zdeněk, I would like to apply for this to your cooking academy, because you have a hand on my heart, I think I can learn a lot from you," he said in a video on the social network.
And since the two of them have been doing their best for years, he has not forgotten Lada to irritate him this time either.
"In return, I can teach you a dietary chicken meat, american cucumber from Znojmo or invite you to the water to show you why it's a favorite fried cheese," said Pear.
His participation in Pohlreich's new show really means serious.
It is time to move higher and learn from the master.
"The question is, what's the boss," the Blesk said.
Pohlreich did not comment because he was filming new parts of his next show Yes, boss !.
Only Prima has responded to the participation of Pear in the culinary academy, taking the whole thing as his personal activity outside the television.
In December 2004, Hruška Pohlreich set a big blow to his first cook.
Within a few days, over 300,000 pieces were sold to her!
The new show, which yesterday presented Prima at a press conference on the autumn broadcasting scheme, is a genuine cooking school.
Pohlreich chooses their pupils from among the audience and in twelve works he will introduce them to twelve cooking techniques.
In the last part of his show Now, the boss is cooking in November 2014, Zdeněk had a crossed pear on his back of his shirt.
If he had my face there, I would laugh a lot.
"I just smile over the pear - the pear is healthy and has plenty of vitamins," Láďa said.
Lada's culinary art thinks of himself.
"Cook according to Lady Pears is not even at home, because I do not let home gastropunk," says the boss.
I appreciate Zdeněk Pohlreich very much, even in his opinion, I make a honey chicken.
But my recipe does not appear in my show, "Prussian said.
It's a bad guy!
He's not a chef for me, it's a television clown.
"Gastronomic illiterate, or debilitated," said Pohlreich on Hruška's lecture.
"I'm not twenty to be able to waving over my hands, but I'm not doing it anymore," said Hruška, the insulting insult.
The British inventor uses a microchip in his hand to unlock the car and house by wave
The British inventor became the first person in the country with a microchip inserted into the body, simply by waving his hand to unlock the door from the house and the office and even start the car.
Thirty-three-year-old Steven Northam had a small chip implanted between his thumb and forefinger and is currently offering the same service through his BioTeq company to individuals and individuals who want to make life simpler with technology.
Dr. Geoff Watson, an anaesthesiologist at Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester, supervises the procedure for implantation and adherence to treatment.
Technology works on the same principle as microchips implanted in dogs and cats, and the entire procedure lasts 30 seconds.
The Northam's company also offers micro-chip lock and door locks, and the price of one lock is £ 300.
One child's married father had the technology integrated into his home and his BMW Z4, which starts with a simple waving hand.
The White House's requisition cost thousands of dollars taxpayers
The decision of the White House to fly a navy helicopter to South Lawn to mark the US manufacturing industry's celebration last month was $ 24,000, according to the Navy's daily newspaper TIME.
The white-green Sikorsky VH-3D helicopter, also called Marine One in the presence of the President on board, was the culmination of a July 17th program at the White House, a showcase of US design programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence, and several White House officials surveyed products from all 50 countries.
The Connecticut Helicopter was exposed next to the Maine yacht, the Wisconsin fire truck, and the Mississippi forklift truck.
The White House Military Officer issued a fragmentary order or FRAGO and asked for a helicopter not more than 36 hours before the landing of a helicopter at South Lawn during an "extraordinary" event, the Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1) records - helicopter management units.
"I wanted to make sure you were aware of such a major event," the HMX-1 commander wrote in his e-mail to his superior, deputy Navy commander for aviation, the day before the event began.
The report suggested that the helicopter will arrive at South Lawn on July 17 at approximately 7:00 pm for a show scheduled to start at 3:00 pm and remain in place until the entire vacancy that was planned between 18:00 and 21:00 is complete.
The email also said that if there was a delay in departing from the White House, a substitute crew would be sent for a return flight due to the working hours regulation.
The original crew stayed with the helicopter on the spot, along with a security staff, along with them.
The records - which TIME received - did not show whether the second crew was eventually sent.
The Hatch Act prevents state officials from using government assets for political purposes.
Records indicate that HMX-1 investigates possible violations of this regulation.
"We were wondering if this was a violation of the Hatch Act and we were assured that everything was all right," the commander wrote.
"Sounds like they're blocking you," wrote the deputy commander.
This "Made in America" show was marked by the White House as an official event and the Hatch Act would not apply to it.
But even official events have political subtexts.
During his attendance at the event, the president was pushing for the health reform that went through the Senate and talked about trying to keep the government's order.
Using airline assets such as Marine One or Air Force One for political purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.
Presidents use them when traveling.
However, their presence purely for presentation reasons is unusual.
Trump ordered control in February after the presidential plane was moving in the background during his first first rally in Melbourne, Florida, his Twitter account being overwhelmed by complaints about the use of the presidential plane by its predecessors.
"The White House is delighted with the show Made in America," which introduced products from all 50 US-produced Americans, "said press secretary Lindsay Walters.
HMX-1 helicopter crews often train landings in Washington and South Lawn and rehearse possible arrivals with the President of the United States to the White House with maximum accuracy.
While Trump participated in the G-20 summit in Germany in early July, HMX-1 conducted 58 landing trips at the White House.
The flight to Made in America was part of the current crew training, a state official said.
On the same day, the helicopter unit flew for eleven o'clock as part of a "non-resident support mission".
The White House stated that no additional props were paid out of the taxpayer's money.
Sikorsky's spokesman said the company was not involved in South Lawn helicopter talks.
HMX-1 does not keep records of the budget for presidential flights and the exact costs associated with the show are difficult to determine according to the Navy.
According to the Department of Defense, the hourly price for the fiscal year 2017, the DoD expenses for VH-3D is $ 24,380 per flight hour.
Unit records indicate 30 minutes from Marine Corps Air Facility Quantico in Virginia and back.
The White House argues that the actual operating costs of the helicopter are well below that amount.
"Putting taxpayers' costs on the basis of estimates of reimbursement is very misleading," Walters said of the matter.
"These estimates include personnel, maintenance and many other hidden costs that are included in the annual costs."
According to the RAND study of 2015, DOD expenses do not include staff costs, but include fuel costs, maintenance and contract costs.
White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer advocated the use of a helicopter for the show's purposes.
"The idea of the show taking place this week is to introduce products made in the USA," Spicer said.
"I am aware that Sikorsky and the State of Connecticut are very proud of the fact that they are contributing to the defense of our state and that they provide work to hundreds, if not thousands, of people.
I think, like most Americans, that we're proud of the helicopter and other military facilities that many countless American people are involved in producing.
That fact is reminded. "
It is not clear if Trump was also looking at a helicopter while taking a South Lawn tour, but he could only say he sat at the wheel of one of the fire trucks.
Back in White House Trump addressed a representative of Sikorsky and joked with the media about his own fleet of products.
"I know Sikorsky very well," the president said, "I myself own three."
A young woman was stuck in a swamp at Mácha's Lake, the police banging her.
The girl set off to the beach on Sunday about 2 o'clock in the morning.
Instead of bathing, she remained trapped in wetlands.
When she decided to ask a police officer for a mobile phone, she had the last 12 percent of the battery.
"That's why the police soon lost contact with her," police spokesman Ivan Baláková said.
A few police patrols set off on the site she described, but finding a young woman was not easy at all.
"Some of the police officers had to wade through reed marshes hundreds of meters before they felt strong ground beneath their feet," Balakova said.
Likewise, she was missing.
Police officers were guided by the direction of her call for help.
"In order not to miss this connection, they talked to her that she would count down aloud," the spokesman said.
The police found a woman in three quarters of five in the swamps of Borny.
She was on the verge of both physical and psychic forces and showed signs of subcooling.
That's why the ambulance was taken to the Czech-Charles hospital.
Linking Old Man to STAN?
From the wanted bride she becomes a selling girl.
That's a little irony.
In his web project, namasslusny.cz seems to say that billionaire voters basically said that STAN suffers from the deficit of decent people.
And he also affirmed that a politically uncompetitive group of lesser-known mayors and independents does not actually have a nationwide program for parliamentary elections.
Her electoral candidate just after an interview with the Grandfather becomes a decent person, whatever political opinion he has.
Vít Bárta was once again starting this way, and it did not work well.
In his pursuit of decent people and personalities who may replace some mayors in the candidates, as Gazdík admitted, in addition, the Dean cancels out the popular argument of Chief STAN that the greatest value of the movement is just political scrutiny and experienced mayors, traditionally the most popular politicians, according to surveys.
They are now replacing the soon-to-be-acquired unknown personalities.
A total break with the KDU, after which STAN changed its logo and slogan, Gazdík also explained that the movement does not want to lose its identity on the candidates of the KDU.
But if only a few people suspected STAN from identity, then just a game of identity ends after the arrival of the Old Man.
Not only Gazdík has long been outraged against YES Andrey Babis, but on the first common press, the Grandfather, who Babiše publicly praises, said: "My goal is that the YO movement, the Mayors movement, gains twenty percent in the upcoming elections."
Hopefully you did not misuse the movement.
The old man is a successful entrepreneur and the billionaire is certainly not a coincidence.
He often talks about politics just like Babis, but he does not make his own political mark.
STAN has for some time been more like a reality show than a real political party, and Ancestor's helping hand seemed to make a selling girl even more of the wanted bride.
For some time STAN went with TOP 09, then with the KDU and now looking for decent people to change.
Hopefully someone will hear.
Police dogs trained the helicopter flights in Most
Dogs specializing in the search for explosives and search dogs today practiced at Bridge Bridge over a helicopter.
Police dog must not be fearful and fear of flying, said Petr Tomasek, head of police cynologists in Ústí nad Labem.
Police dog training takes about two years.
At Most, both adult and trained dogs were trained, and those who are still trained.
In addition to standard training in which to expose sharp specimens of explosives around the lake and search for a lost figurine, all 12 animals had to board the helicopter and fly over the lake.
The main purpose of the exercise is to test the dogs in the helicopter.
In order for the helicopter to arrive immediately, the dog may work to avoid having a helicopter problem.
"The helicopter, the dog goes and is looking for it immediately," said Tomáš.
A dog who is unsteady or unable to start working on the helicopter route is excluded from training.
"They usually leave the handlers for example in the garden," Tomas added.
The police have 76 dogs with different specialties in the Ústí Region.
German shepherds predominate, but Belgian shepherds also grow.
The handler takes care of him from the puppy.
"He's training himself, preparing him for the service the dog will do for us," Tomas added.
The animal undergoes repeated veterinary tests that may reveal possible health hazards.
If the dog is healthy and hygienic, he / she makes the first test at 20 months.
"It takes about two and a half to three years to get a sharp hit," Tomas added.
Length of service for the police depends on the condition of the dog.
It usually works for up to eight to ten years.
They usually live with their dog handlers.
Narcos Season 3 Trailer: Pablo Escobar is out of the box and Cali Cartel becomes the centerpiece of the hit series Netflix
Despite the end of the second season of Narcos, when Pablo Escobar's killer is revealed, the Netflix series is far from over.
Confirmation from the streaming service has already reached the third and fourth season - the first one has already experienced the first trailer and the appearance of other negative characters.
In the third season, DEA focuses on the world's richest drug cartel: Cali Cartel.
Under the leadership of four influential godparents, they operate "as a Fortune 500 company," with the only difference being that they step up violent acts and bribes more government officials.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) is the leader of the cartel, Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) plays the brain of operations, Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) is in charge of Mexico and Chepe Santacruz Londono (Pepe Rapazote) dominates New York.
In the new trailer, Pedro Pascal returns as Javier Peña, the character of the vermining US and Colombian rights-enforcers in the fight against drugs.
Other actors include Matias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishé and Arturo Castro.
The third season, Narcos, will be premiered on September 1.
According to the UN, Afghan democracy relies on women in politics
Elections can only be credible if all members of society, including women, participate in it, a UN envoy in Afghanistan said Wednesday.
Nicholas Hays, head of the UN Relief Mission, said hundreds of women attended the local council, three women were candidates for a vice-president, and more than 30 percent of newly elected voters were women.
"The role of women can not be overlooked," he said in his statement Wednesday.
Elections can be fully representative and trusted only if women are involved as well as all related processes that are related to the election.
Local and presidential elections in Afghanistan are held on April 5th.
The Taliban has published several threats against the electoral process, which moves international combat activities to the second.
In this year's election, for the first time, a democratically elected government gives its power to the next government.
Haysom said the strong role of women would strengthen Afghanistan's democracy.
The Afghan Independent Electoral Commission said that out of a total of 3.6 million registered voters, 1.2 million women are women.
The unique brewery brews beer again.
Good beer to the brewery.
The enthusiasm and honesty of the new owners came back a few years ago to the life of the brewery in Lobice u Mšena.
The brewery commemorated for the first time in 1586 has a Renaissance core and in the nineteenth century it was rebuilt into a paratrooper operation.
The years of bloom followed, when the brewery was famous mainly for dark beers.
Unfortunately, during World War II production was stopped and in 1984 the brewery was nationalized.
Since then, the buildings have served the state farm.
The work of the destruction was completed by the owners of the brewery after 1989.
The abandoned site was devastated and dismantled for building material.
In 2007, however, new hopes emerged in the form of new owners, architects Jana and Paul Prouz.
They began to repair the buildings with maximum respect for the spirit of the building and every detail.
They carefully devoted themselves to studying archive materials, trying to preserve original materials and building elements.
The brewery has the same appearance as in the nineteenth century, when it started its golden era.
Their work has been awarded with a declaration of the brewery as a cultural monument by the Ministry of Culture, and the building has also become part of the European Industrial Heritage Trail.
In 2015, they rejuvenated the tradition of beer brewing.
If you want to taste great lobster beer in the scenic Kokořínsko countryside, visit the pub in the brewery area.
When brewing beer, they use the Kokorinian water springing in the protected landscape area, malt lobster fields and Žatec hops.
In the bar you will taste traditional light lager, but also dark beers and specialties.
And do not miss a tour of the brewery, held on Saturday and Sunday at noon and at half past two.
The largest artillery fortress of Czechoslovakia?
One of the largest fortresses of its kind in the world?
Such a unique building was to be the Stachelberg fortress between Trutnov and Žacléř, at the top of the terrain ridge above the village of Babí.
Originally, it would have formed up to twelve bunkers connected by a large underground.
Here was the headquarters, barracks, ammunition, material, power station, engine room, and hospital.
However, the Munich Agreement was completed.
In less than a year, he was able to build a single massive reinforced concrete bunker, and the underground spaces were broken.
Thanks to enthusiasts from Stachelberg, who started the reconstruction of the unique building in the early 1990s, you can also see yourself.
Underground is already accessible from 75 percent!
In addition to the T-S 73 infirmary cabin with exposition and underground, there is also an armed light fortification building, two deployed infantry log cabins, trenches and the nature trail of the Fortified Trutnov region.
Refreshment, cozy bower and breathtaking views of the countryside guaranteed!
This unique and gorgeous Czech building has come to the list next to such sights as the Great Wall of China, the Traian's harbor near Rome or the Assyrian palace in Nineveh and Nimrud.
The Chotesov Monastery originally from the beginning of the thirteenth century, which today consists mainly of a massive four-wing convent building over a beautiful garden.
The list he has got but unfortunately belongs to unique buildings that are in danger of extinction.
But enthusiasts do not want to give up, and they have a lot of events to support the monastery.
One of them is the next evening of the Chotesov Monastery on Saturday, August 5, 2010, where Vladimír Mišík, Ivan Hlas will perform, you will see fencing performances and you will look at places of magnificent large buildings, which are usually inaccessible.
But you will enjoy the atmosphere of this great place.
Do you want to see Neanderthals in your face?
The Welcome Exhibition at Neanderthal in the Anthropos Pavilion of the Moravian Museum in Brno attracts an unusual excursion to the deepest prehistoric times of the Stone Age, to the world of our predecessors.
You will find out how Neanderthals have managed to cope perfectly with all sorts of extreme climatic conditions, especially with the alternation of ice and inter-ice periods.
Despite their simple material culture, the predators of their time were extremely successful.
You will also learn how they looked, what their anatomy, technological skills and hunting skills were, as well as their aesthetic feelings.
That you would not tell the Neanderthals?
Let yourself be convinced in Brno.
The fourteenth KELT & WORLD MUSIC festival takes place on Saturday 5th at Veveří Castle.
In addition to great music, you will see the construction of a Celtic village, a Celtic way of life, including crafts, games for children and adults, divination, magic, or ritual painting on the body.
There will be no La Quadrilla with Irish and Scottish dances, drum jamming, bagpipe and amazing fire surprise by Carpe Nocte.
How does Moravia Silesia taste?
The seventh anniversary of the famous gastrofestival "How to Slide the Moravian-Silesian Region" takes place on Saturday, August 5, 2017, in the spa area of the Karlova Studánka Mountains.
Boasting chef Miroslav Kalina, tasting culinary specialties and regional food, enjoying music and dance performances, a rich program for children such as creative workshops, theater, bouncy castle, Smouli competition path and, of course, a number of competitions.
Get to know the plant with one click.
Students with herbalists and ordinary plant lovers will be helped by the new free Pl @ ntNet application.
When they are interested in what plant they have just encountered, they will be advised by the application.
All they have to do is capture the plant and the application itself recognizes what kind of thing it is.
The new application, available for both iOS and Android, was presented Tuesday by a representative of the CEE Center for Ethical and Environmental Education in the Horský park in Bratislava, as part of the project Secret Life of the City.
The project also involved pupils from 50 Czech and Slovak schools, who photographed and added plants from their surroundings to the application database.
The newly created French application is free to download on the Secret Life of the City website.
The main goal of French programmers was to make as many people as possible contributing to their applications, thereby increasing the number of plants the application can recognize.
"Even children who hold a tablet or a mobile phone can go into the forest," said Ivana Poláčková, coordinator of this project.
Based on photos of a flower, a leaf, or a fruit of the plant, the plant can recognize the name within seconds, which will then be assigned under the photo in both Czech and Slovak.
The French have allowed us to translate the application into Slovak and Czech into the project Secret Life of the City.
It is, therefore, welcome that users, after creating an account, have contributed to the image of a plant that is not yet in the database.
"The French will evaluate if it is beneficial and then add it to the database," said Poláčková.
GMB's concerns about investing in the McVitie's factory in Glasgow
Unions are asking for assurances from McVitie's cookie maker on long-term production commitment at a factory in Glasgow.
Scottish trade union GMB said the company is currently silent about any investment in the Tollcross factory.
The factory employs more than 500 employees, who also produce Hobnob and Rich Tea biscuits.
Owner McVitie's, Pladis, said she had invested more than £ 5 million over the past several years.
She added that employees and trade union representatives will be "among the first informed" in the event of factory changes.
In a letter to the building manager, GMB's Scottish Unions expressed concern that McVitie's "will not get its promises about financing and upgrading production lines."
GMB's main organizer Drew Duffy added: "The fact that we did not get clear responses from the developer on the needs of the company and the future Tollcross investment plan is very worrying for our members.
Generations of many families have worked here, and most of the staff come from the local community and the Glasgow area, where work in the local factory is a critical pillar of decent employment in the area of high unemployment and social exclusion.
From the point of view of work, wages and benefits - and despite the outlook on Brexit, rising cost of living and declining slow production - the eastern part of Glasgow needs a desperately prosperous maker like McVitie's. "
A spokeswoman for Pladis said: "Tollcross has just received a letter from GMB yesterday and the company will issue a statement as soon as we appreciate the ongoing commitment to employees and trade union representatives.
Regular meetings with employees and GMB representatives in Tollcross took place two months ago, and there was a lot of talk about this issue.
We talked to employees that, as in all companies operating in extremely competitive and uncertain economic conditions, we evaluate our operations on a regular basis, which applies to all our operations so that we can continue to compete successfully with others.
She added: "In recent years, we have invested 5 million pounds in the Tollcross area, especially in production lines and streamlining traffic.
We highly appreciate Tollcross's heritage and local locations and, in the event of any changes in the operation of the local factory, employees and union representatives will be immediately informed. "
Has PSG Barcelona been warned about the transfer of Neymara three years ago?
La Liga may perhaps regret his interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain will not allow Neymara to get Neymara on her side after she has £ 189 million, that is, the amount needed to redeem Neymara from the contract, but has warned this French team of Barcelona about her record-breaking raid three years ago?
The Ligue 1 Club is ready to overcome the record double of Paul Pogby's transfer to Manchester United, which he paid £ 89 million last year for the summer season.
After confirming and completing the transfer, Neymar will become the most expensive player in the world and the best-paid professional athlete in the world - after tax he will receive £ 500,000 per week from the PSG team.
Barcelona is outraged by the way Neymar has escaped from his contract, despite a confidential source confirming that the club has always tried to do everything to Neymar since his arrival from Santos in 2013.
But was the football world aware of this fact three years ago by the president of the PSG?
When Manchester City expressed interest in Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi warned all the clubs that would be interested in picking up one of PSG's best players.
"I'm not afraid, because once someone tries to get one of our players, then we will certainly reach one of their players," Al-Khelaifi said.
"We respect all clubs.
But if they try to get one of our players, they will face the consequences. "
Barcelona seems to have crossed the imaginary border when she was interested in PSG Marc Verratti in the summer.
The PSG has made it clear that under no circumstances will the departure of an Italian representative be allowed, so it is possible for Barcelona to take a bitter pill for its bold action now with the departure of Neymara.
Who will explain the sanctions?
Does the policy of punishment have a broad understanding of the rules?
Donald Trump nodded anti-Russian sanctions.
The day before, the US imposed sanctions on Venezuelan President Madura.
And the day before, Trump wrote that China is doing nothing with a North Korean threat and that it will not go on.
And that's the idea of sanctions like straw from boots.
These things can not be thrown into one sack.
Madurova Venezuela has indeed set out on the road to dictatorship, and totality.
China just does not behave the way the American president wished.
Russia is the chapter for itself.
But if all of them wanted to sum up so that even ordinary voters, American, European or otherwise, would understand what the system of rules is based on, and the policy of sanctions, it would be almost impossible.
In sanctions against Russia, President Trump merely draws on what President Obama has already prepared, but he has given an executive stamp.
So why such an uproar?
Last year, Europe frightened that if America's winning of the Trump elections would hurt Putin and withdraw sanctions.
A horrible idea.
In practice, however, it is the opposite.
Trumpe does not release the sanctions, but they tighten.
But Europe is scaring even more.
German Minister Zypries says that Trump's sanctions violate international law.
Like kosher are just sanctions approved by the UN Security Council?
But then there are no kosher or anti-Russian EU sanctions.
European Commission chief Juncker complains that Trump's sanctions threaten the EU's energy security.
It's like having sanctions to be used so weak that they do not endanger anyone?
A regular voter rolls.
For three years he heard that the fate of anti-Russian sanctions depends only on the fulfillment of the Ministerial Armistice Arrangements in Ukraine.
It is now known that this is the EU's energy security.
The voter rolls even wider.
Russia is penalized for mounting too much where it does not have.
China is ruined for mounting little.
Venezuelan President is punished for building a dictatorship in the borders of his country.
All these punishments or considerations have their rationality.
But does anyone see a system, order or rule?
Andrej Babis: I do not think about working with Okamura.
Andrej Babiš married, crossed the Republic with his visionary book and finalized the election program.
Besides the Pardubice Region, all the candidates have already finished.
In his words, he did not interfere with them in any way.
He even agreed to lead the Moravian-Silesian Governor and Shadow Education Minister Yvo Ivo Vondrak.
"But if he succeeds, he will have to choose whether he wants to be a deputy or a governor," Babiš confirmed earlier.
A lot of representatives and national politicians have upset you with the idea that directly elected mayors and mayors should manage municipalities and towns themselves, only with managers.
Do you mean seriously?
It was not.
I am in favor of direct democracy, we are directly electing the President and I am convinced that the mayors and the mayors should be the same.
In my book I do not talk about the interference of the deputies, they can be there.
The question is, how many will be.
When presenting your book What I dream about when I'm asleep, I heard with your own ears that you spoke about the cancellation of councils.
I do not remember that.
I spoke about direct election and reduction of the number of deputies.
New York, with nine million inhabitants, has five districts and 51 councilors.
Prague with 1.2 million citizens has 1171 representatives.
And the mayor reads that he does not build and prepare big projects, but she does not have the skills.
The same applies to the government, which in our history was governed only by two people, Klaus and Zeman.
I'm not saying that they did it well.
The current prime minister does not regulate anything, but only moderates the debate.
So it can not work.
So you want to push the majority system?
It would be ideal, but it will hardly get it.
In the program, we only have a change to a one-vote election to the Senate.
We also proposed a rolling mandate of ministers and an amendment to the Chamber of Deputies' Rules of Procedure to avoid unnecessary exhibitions of deputies working mainly on committees and committees, not to showcase at Chamber meetings.
It is certainly not true that I want to destroy the parliamentary system.
But that's exactly what your opponents fear.
That as a dictator you will govern the government, scrutinize the Chamber of Deputies with 101 deputies, abolish the counties and the Senate, and through the grateful mayors and mayors you will control the whole country.
It's definitely not the case.
There is nothing wrong with this when we debate the number of Members.
French President Macron reported a reduction of the legislature by a third, while there are 57,000 French on one legislator, while 17,000 Czechs are coming to us.
Macrona, however, does not blame for endangering democracy.
Even if somebody won the majority in the Czech Republic, we have mechanisms to prevent him from making dramatic changes.
The guides for the one who has the parliamentary majority are great, just look for Poland or Hungary.
Nothing like this is in the case of the YES movement.
We just need a team that will work in the government for people, not for their parties or ministries.
I do not understand why we have failed to agree that only the salaries of teachers, culture workers and social services will increase.
Why did they vote for me and add 21 percent to GIBS members who already get 60 thousand?
Would you like to get that premier?
The prime minister should intervene when ministers behave uneasily, confuse government with a travel agency, and like the state money they would like to do like Marian Jurečka, who wanted to buy forests in Romania and land in Africa.
Ministers are not supposed to argue in the government, contradictions should be cast out of it.
The cabinet must be ready for material, there is no room for coalition breaks, power ballots and commodities, there is a decision to make.
How do you want a cohesive team when the ministers are mostly party leaders?
The constitutional law is above the parties.
When it came to breaking bread, Sobotka said that the coalition agreement did not apply, and set off Babis from the government.
This can be done by every premier.
But if he's a personality and has control skills, similar gestures are not needed.
It measures everyone equally and requires perfect performance.
Do you already know who you would propose to the Minister of Finance?
I do not think about it at all, we will not be in that government anymore, no one wants to cooperate with us, even if I do not know what terrible I've done.
So much skepticism is not right.
Mayors have gotten the entrepreneur Old man who would like to cooperate with you; the guilds may win the wing of you, the lean Jiří Čunek.
I do not think so.
The CSSD leads Lubomir Zaoralek, who does not exclude the coalition with the ANO, Václav Klaus ml., Who will not oppose the ODS.
I would leave it to voters.
Deputy Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister Richard Brabec said that you have many points in common with the SPD Tomia Okamura, for example in the area of the economy.
So, the minions are considered as a coalition partner?
Mr. Brabec says he did not say that.
Mr. Okamura has his political history, stood as a puppet of Vít Bárta for VV, then he earned money from his money for his firm, there was a coup.
He is, of course, a distinguished personality.
But somewhat brownish.
When I take his program, there is a wide involvement of people in the management of society, direct democracy, with which we can agree.
I'm not asking for it at all.
I wonder if there is an acceptable person for you who has xenophobic views, talks on gallop demonstrations and wants to leave the EU?
We do not consider cooperation with Mr Okamura's party, I can not imagine.
Obviously, he went into politics to profit from it.
And how silent the Communists support your minority government?
I can not imagine it, but the voters decide.
It will be about negotiating the winner with the other in rank, but God knows who will be the winner and who the two.
Of course, it is important that they are able to agree on a coalition government program.
Let's go back to your attempt to drive the state as a business.
But the government just has to follow, Prime Minister Sobotka left everything out, he never decided.
Coalitions like CEB or EGAP did not work.
Sobotka is his puppet, and it was also the reason he fired me.
Once he did, CEZ controlled the Czech government.
It is incredible that the Prime Minister has brought a resolution written by the CEZ management, which requires the Finance Minister to vote at the CEZ General Meeting.
If you become prime minister, will you change the personnel situation in the Supervisory Board and will you change the top management of ČEZ?
Jesus, if I'm the prime minister, they'll see.
I'm not yet.
It's rumored that CEZ has already sent signals to you.
Good cooperation with the CSSD would like to be exchanged for even better with YES.
So after the elections, everything will go on.
I do not know anything about it.
I have no lobbist Pokorny or Růžičku, I am a separate unit and I do not even deal with it at all.
So answer right now.
If you become the head of the government, will you seek to replace the leadership of CEZ, Czech Television or the General Health Insurance Company, ie the institutions that you criticize?
I would like CEZ to be a transparent company.
Meanwhile, he had been doing what he wanted for years, thanks to commissions for traditional political parties.
Just look at Mr Schwarzenberg's statements.
Although the state has a majority in ČEZ, it has never been driven by it, it was only there, which is wrong.
For me it is a trivial matter.
CEZ is supposed to take Dukovany, award it, shuffle it to a subsidiary, arrange financing, make a supply competition or get a co-investor and build a new nuclear block.
The idea that the state has to finance and build new nuclear blocks is absurd.
And Czech Television?
Some of her shows have a permanent campaign against me, but I do not have and will not have any authority to throw someone away.
But take control of yes.
I do not want to dominate anyone.
I just say that citizens pay for public radio and television charges about 7.2 billion a year, but they do not know how these institutions manage.
How come they do not know?
The Chamber of Deputies approves a report on their management, which has a direct impact on the positions of CEOs and CTOs.
Look at the news, Sobotka Kalousek's Super Pact, which always worked.
This applies both to the current parliamentary commission for leaks from investigation files and lex Babiš.
And Sobotka was so stupid that he let himself push Kalousek to throw me out of the government, which scored TOP 09 percent, but the CSSD was overwhelmed.
They are afraid of disrupting their corrupt system, and so they talk about the threat to democracy by Babis.
Nobody is immune.
What do you say in the articles describing how YOr Jaroslav Faltýnek, the first vice-chairman of the YOUTH, is building a powerhouse by placing his son in the Supervisory Board of Tepláren Brno and arranging contracts with municipal and state-owned companies such as Prague Transport Company and Czech Railways to a related lawyer Květoslav Hlínov?
We have a lasting dispute.
I do not like it and I read it several times.
Faltýnek argues that the aforementioned lawyer works at considerably lower rates and is reliable.
I would not go so far.
As the Minister of Finance I had no one.
We, unlike the socians, have never had a corrupt affair, no Peltu, Kratochvil, Březina.
If there was any hint of clientelism, we immediately threw such a man out.
In this respect, I am uncompromising.
If anything like that happens, we get rid of anyone, no matter who it is.
