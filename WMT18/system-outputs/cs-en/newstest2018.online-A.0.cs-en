The civil rights movement issued a travel alert for Missouri
The National Association for Favouritism Color People (NAACP) has published a warning for color people traveling to Missouri based on discriminatory state principles and racist attacks.
"Travel recommendation NAACP for the state of Missouri, with effect from 28. On August 2017, the African American invites passengers, visitors and Missouri to take greater care when travelling across the state as a result of a series of controversial racially motivated incidents currently occurring throughout the state, "standing in a statement Association.
NAACP said that this was done under the current laws of the state of Missouri, which difficulted the defense of racist acts in court, as well as as a result of acts of law enforcement, which disproportionately target minorities.
"There is a violation of civil rights.
People are stopped by cops just because of their skin color, are attacked or killed, "said the president of NAACP for the Kansas City Star for Missouri Chapel.
"We are amassing the biggest number of complaints."
This is the first warning of its kind that the organization has issued for the US state.
Among the incidents that the organization cited were the racially motivated curses of channeled against black-skinned students at the University of Missouri, and the death of Toryho Sanders, a man of black skin from Tennessee.
Sanders died in controversial circumstances at the beginning of this year after he had gasoline in travel across the state, and the police plunged him into custody without charge of committing a crime.
The travel recommendation also draws attention to the recent declaration by the state prosecutor of Missouri, which states that black-skinned drivers have a 75% higher chance of stopping the police.
"The purpose of travel advice is to alert people and warn their families, friends and associates before what might happen in Missouri," Chapel said.
"People need to be prepared-they should carry money with them to pay for any bail or alert their relatives that they are about to travel by the state."
According to the current numbers of the FBI's hate-reporting program, in 2015, Missouri, a hundred cases of hate behavior occurred, bringing the state to sixteen places among all states.
The travel alert is also the answer to the new Missouri law, which makes it difficult for the company to prosecute for discrimination in the provision of accommodation or employment.
The American Union for Civil Liberties (ACLU) has issued a travel recommendation for Texas and Arizona after states have enacted immigration law that allows government officials to detain people based on a violation of this law, which, according to ACLU, has improved racial profiling.
Travel recommendations are usually issued by the State Department for Foreign countries, but recently, advokační groups have resorted to these measures in response to specific laws and trends within the US.
The model was killed by the chef.
Her family doesn't have peace after 12 years!
The murdered model is Sally Anne Bowman.
The girl originally from Croydon was assassinated by the chef Mark Dixiem in 2005 at the restaurant in which she worked, he planted stabbing wounds.
Both the victim and the murderer should have sex and smoke marijuana, then he killed her.
The assassin then sat in a nearby café, watching the meticulous criminology work of the ohledávání scene.
Dixie, a former chef, was convicted in 2008 to imprisonment of 34 years for the murder and rape of babes Sally.
He admitted only the juvenile infestation in court, and the lawyer claimed that his client had found the girl dead lying on the street.
After three years, the police usvědčila him.
Dixie claimed that Sally and her ex friend Lewis Sprotson were arguing for the fateful night.
The assassin said, "he was seriously upset and after his attack, the girl started screaming."
"Even the taxi driver attracted attention," falsely said.
The girl, according to his testimony, was supposed to defend herself, she could, but in vain.
Lewis had Ubodat in the street.
The Dixieho version was proven to lie and accused him.
After admitting Dixie, he spoke of his own and his appetite for the girl.
When he dresseded after sex, he felt satisfied and had to smoke marijuana.
Before the incident, Sally was with her ex-girlfriend, drinking alcohol and taking cocaine, and he told the police the Dex himself.
He said he felt adrenaline.
Sally started screaming for help, so he attacked her from behind and put her hand over her mouth, "added the Mirror Linda.
And after twelve years, the family faces further attacks by vandals destroying her grave.
He's been damaged four times in the last half-year.
At liberty there are so cruel people who break in these graves.
"So our daughter is no longer there," the Mirror told the mother of the deceased girl Linda about the disappearance of a urns with ashes.
Linda waited for the attackers, but had to always attack when she left the cemetery.
Design Vibrators cost tens of thousands.
"The Czechs are not Pruderní or conservative," says Martin Ráž, who runs the Prague boutique of intimacy.
It features designer and luxury erotic gadgets.
Including those from Czech designer Anna Mares.
It started quietly, about twelve years ago.
Martin Ráž and his friends went to cycling trip in Moravia.
One of them had not only brought the bike, but also a box full of remarkably-looking vibrators.
"Different krtečků and delfínků and everything was green and yellow, and quite different," he tells me over lunch.
His friend, with one of his companions, decided to work with the German producer of the Fun Factory design erotic gadgets, which Martin was interested in, and so he offered to help with marketing.
When the companion left to pursue another profession, he replaced it.
Today, it operates a boutique of intimacy in the Prague Street, where he sells erotic aids in the manner in which luxury handbags or shoes are commonly offered.
And why not?
These are also design items.
Wait, wait, you're having fun at lunch, you think?
Come on, don't be such a puritans!
Just the Berlin Fun Factory Shop, designed by the acclaimed designer Karim Rashid, served for a boutique of intimacy as an inspiration.
They opened it in 2010 and it was a completely different concept of erotic commerce than the one they are used to.
No hidden expenses, everything done in beautiful, decent style, products exhibited more like in perfumery.
Martin and his business partner, Zdeněk Šebelkou, began to wonder how to hold the Prague trade where he should be and how he should be named.
The name of intimacy pleased both.
"It's related to intimacy, and it's too, you can say, tender," he says.
It followed the purchase of an Internet domain and the search for a suitable space, which was parallel with various visualizations of the interior.
Finally, a variant was won, which laid out a shop in the garden of pleasure and a bedroom dominated by a bed.
Dagmar Štěpán from the studio of FormaFatal prepared it for us.
We found the space in 2013.
At first he did not feel completely perfect, because he was not on the main street, but he was therefore sitting in the name of intimacy.
He's intimate.
It's in the alley next to the main one, so nobody neokukuje customers, "Martin Ráž praises.
We wanted to be first.
We wanted to make a trade that will be different, with branded nice goods, in an environment where women who are mostly our customers feel good.
And not to styděly for having entered such a trade.
When I was in a boutique of intimacy half an hour ago entering, the streets Zela emptiness.
Besides, I didn't even feel like I was going to a shop with erotic aids.
Right at the door, I was surprised by the pure elegance of the interior, which I know from fashion boutiques.
Even if there's only a woman's service in the shop, women neostýchaly to ask for help doesn't mean that a man's leg won't come here.
Mostly, gentlemen come to buy gifts for their girlfriends.
"Men tend not to guess the right size and choose larger," Martin smiles over a common mistake.
These are the prejudices, the conventional cliché that women need some great aids, and it's not true.
So a man in good faith chooses an unnecessarily big vibrator.
Likewise, men choose a mostly black underwear, whereas a woman usually gravitating to pink color.
An absolute bestseller is the product of the aptly called Satisfyer.
From the expression in my face must be clear that I do not know which beats, because Martin immediately explains how it works.
This is such a touchless stimulator of the clitoris.
In me, the adolescents are uchechtnouted with admiration for what serious tone I am being given.
It's like Nechumelilo.
And it actually nechumelí.
It's at a good price and has a perfect user reference.
We didn't believe it would be so well accepted.
It's a recent revolutionary novelty.
The first revolution caused the vibrator in the shape of a seahorse.
He took care that women became more interested in the design of such products.
The second was a vibrator for the pairs of We-Vibe.
Completely zbořil taboos, which may persist in some men, and that they see competition in erotic aids.
"They do different variations," he continues.
With one engine, with two engines, with remote control.
This is a popular category.
In a love affair, a woman may have a control in her hand to determine the intensity of the vibration.
On the contrary, a certain parachute is a category of loading vibrators.
At least with us.
Czech women, it seems, prefers multipurpose gadgets and buy classic vibrators, although they need to be used only externally.
It is very popular in Western Europe, especially in younger customers.
What about men?
It is difficult to say whether a similar concept would work exclusively for men.
It would have to be a little different.
The question is what men offer, "Martin considers.
"We also have aids for them, but to a limited extent." Most is sold mainly masturbator, in this case from the manufacturer Tenga.
It does not look like an anatomical imitation of the vagina, but "more like a shower gel or as an egg or futuristic object.
It focuses heavily on functionality and experience in use.
In Japan, this is completely different.
It gives me astonishment.
I thought the Japanese girl had a lot of sex on erotic aids, I think.
"This is the internet reality," I explained.
The mundane is completely different.
Here in Europe, erotic aids are more likely to be associated with being used by women.
In Japan they are perfectly normal for men, and on the contrary they are taboo for women. " Just for interest-what the Japanese brand Tenga, which is represented in the intimacy boutique, sells worldwide, still accounts for roughly half of what is sold only in Japan.
In our waters
Czech and Czechs are not pruderní.
On the contrary, we are a fairly accommodating nation.
Certainly unlike countries like Catholic Poland and Italy.
The typical business client is between 35 and 50 years old and "He has some experience both with sex life and some aids.
He will come for something nice, better quality, to be added to the partner life, or to himself. " To return, Martin Ráž and his business partner, Zdeněk Šebelkou, care to ensure that they are perfectly functional for each product.
We also do not want to engage in specialties of the type bondáže and latex, because we do not have space, firstly it is not suitable here.
Such things could discourage those we are trying to target.
Which are the people who have always had shyness into the sex shop to go because they were afraid of having something like this peeks.
A lot of products exhibited on shelves are really appealing.
It is also a selection of renowned brands.
Some of them even earned Design prizes, including the Red Dot design Award.
The first award-winning was the Seahorse "and this triggered a change in the whole industry.
It began to jettisoning from cheap materials and, on the contrary, to work with disabled non glue, began to produce different designs, different colors...
It is pleasant that the design of some stands Czech, namely the popular designer Anna Mareš.
I have to say that I was quite pleasantly surprised how many people have in our design things Whoop. de. Doo from Anna Mares buys, although they are relatively more expensive.
There are customers who go directly to Venus balls from Anna Mares.
She has done a really huge piece of work by presenting in the Czech Republic and abroad exactly what we are trying to present – that erotic aids can be done differently, nicely, with a story.
Annin story began as a school job.
Now it is a finished product, which is also produced by us.
I wanted to have the production process under control and I also wanted to know from what materials and how to Whoop. de. Doo produce products.
Because it is not a Velkovýrobu but a small series, it is certainly more costly than a large series.
Maybe I'm a little upstream, but I find it important to keep up with us in the Czech Republic.
It may well be that in a few years we will not be able to produce anything, "describes the situation of Anna, who agrees with Martin that our company is becoming increasingly open.
He does not meet with negative or dismissive attitudes.
Most people are embarrassed.
"But they'll start smiling, too." Currently, Anna Mareš has a vibrator on offer that you can get a personal message on, and this year it also plans its own lubricant gel.
In the next year should accrue vibrating eggs and other news.
The boundaries of healthy sex
I wonder where the limits of what's fine.
Is there anything Martin Ráž wouldn't sell?
It's terribly hard to define.
What comes to one normal, another may seem utterly abnormal, so we are more defined by the assortment of branded manufacturers.
None of them are in any extrémností.
Before we say goodbye, I have the last question: what was the craziest demand they got?
Right now the week came an e-mail in which some Mrs. Poptávala masturbate a widget for her friend with a natural length of twenty-eight centimeters.
So we had to write that we had no such thing.
It's still a question of whether someone was kidding us, "Martin is measuring a suspicious look.
This, too, is becoming...

Chile's parliament has abolished the ban on Interrupcí, the law examines TC.
In Chile, the absolute ban on abortion is still valid and must not be done for health reasons.
"I regret that the legislators filed a complaint with the Constitutional Court, and that now ten people will decide what we have arguing in Parliament for more than two years," said Socialist Senator Isabel Allendeová.
The Constitutional Court in Chile has ten members and the end of August should get a new president, which, according to AFP, is close to opposition.
The law abolishing the absolute ban of interrupcí, initiated by current President Michelle Bacheletovou, approved the Senate of 19. July.
The right-wing opposition then announced that the law would invade the court because it violates the right of the unborn child to live.
MEPs postponed the vote on the bill last month until the Joint Parliamentary committee has analysed it.
On Wednesday, MEPs approved the proposal and re-made the Senate.
Under the new legislative adjustment, it should cease to be a criminal abortion in three cases: if a woman's life is endangered, if the fetus has no hope of survival, or if the pregnancy is derived from rape.
There were similar exceptions to the Spanish El País in Chile since 1931, before women were given the right to vote in the year 1949.
The absolute ban of Interrupcí in 1989 was introduced by the right-wing dictator Augusto Pinochet, only a few months before he left the office of the President.
Chile is one of the few countries in the world where the absolute ban on interrupcí is in place.
Other are Nicaragua, Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Haiti, Malta and Honduras.
For example, in El Salvador, there are now about 20 women in bars who serving up to thirty years of prison sentences for interruption of their pregnancy.
In many cases, according to human rights defenders, it was a spontaneous abortion that the court called a murder.
Is there anything sacred?
The Trumpova of the White House is now a statue of Liberty
The unmistakable sign of regime change is criticism of sculptures.
Americans could tell about it as well as everyone else-see the carefully staged overthrow statue of Saddam Hussein on Bagdádském Square Firdos in the year 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the key proponents of Trumpova regime, certainly knew what to brewing when, in a passionate debate with CNN reporter Jim Acostou, on President's proposals to drastically restrict legal immigrants, he set out with a symbolic axe to Statue of Liberty.
It looks like Miller didn't attack the statue.
It would zlynčoval him a crowd of boat owners and imitators of the Statue of Liberty.
But he attacked its significance, namely the fact that in 1903, a plaque was placed on the pedestal with the famous poem Emmy Lazarus, up to 17 years after the monument was completed.
Miller rebuked Acostu by saying, "I do not want to embark on history here, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that sheds light on the whole world.
The poem, which has been placed additionally on the pedestal, is not part of it. "
Miller's really right, but as he said, it's not about history.
These are mainly the striking words of Emmy Lazarus, who resonate today-inviting them not only immigrants, but the poorest of the poorest: "Let me go, who kles, who the poor, who can barely breathe, who beggarly the worm in the midst of full cities."
And just in modern times we can better watch these "abject worms" on our screens.
Miller did not try to critique poetry-he wanted to clarify that these people are not welcome in the US.
This conflict about the significance of the statue is part of a comprehensive political and cultural war: it is essentially a conflict about the significance of America.
Emma Lazarus, as well as her friends, who, after her death, sought to plant a plaque with a poem on the statue's pedestal, knew quite well that it was deserted into a high political game.
The statue was meant to express the connection of the French and US Republican governments by representing the classical theme, the feminine embodiment of liberty.
Emma Lazarus has changed this meaning: In her poem, a woman's character is not abstract, but has her own voice.
It also has a very different name: Mother deportees.
Merging a poem with a woman's picture is a brilliant feminist thrust and devastating attack on the American Nativismus.
And in the same way that Emma Lazarus changed the significance of the statue, the followers of the right have long sought to reverse this significance.
A well-known commentator, Rush Limbaugh-John the Baptist in the matter of Trumpovaing to power-in 2010, he argued that the Statue of Liberty in fact nezve nobody into the country, but represents the early Neokonstruktivismus, the bringing American flame of the underdeveloped world: "The Statue of Liberty Vykračuje forward.
He brings the torch of liberty from the United States and offers it to the rest of the world.
The torch does not illuminate the way to the United States. "
Limbaugh surprisingly hints at an important thing.
The significance of the sculpture depends on the angle of view.
Emma Lazarus describes a statue from the perspective of an exhausted and damned passenger who, often after a long and terrifying voyage across the ocean, arrives with hope in his heart to the new Earth.
It is literally a view of the world through the eyes of people seeking refuge and a chance for a better life.
From this perspective, the statue expresses hope and listens to their needs.
And that, of course, is a perspective that Miller and Trump definitely recognizes.
Their torch is not to illuminate the path, but to rozněcovat the hatred that is their only source of power.
World Championships in Athletics 2017: Neil Black pěje Praise to the Scottish members of the British team
Eilidh Doyle remembers the time when the British team had only two Scottish members
The Director of the United Kingdom Athletic Federation Neil Black said that the strong skvadra of the 16 Scots in the World Championship team will be "a huge benefit for the team".
For the London 2017, which starts on Friday, a record number of Scottish athletes was selected.
Black believes that in Scotland "something special is going on" and British Athletics could ledasčemu learn from the Scots.
"We're trying to understand and adapt – we'll work on it," said Black.
"I talked to people from the Scottish Sports Institute and they think it has to do with what they've done.
The leaders of Scottish athletics think it has to do with what they've done.
British Athletics: It has to do with what they have done.
People on the streets also think so.
Whatever it is, it's absolutely amazing. "
Several Scottish athletes will seek medals, including Laura Muirové and Andrew Butcharta-who will compete with Sir Mo Farah at the 5000 m race, while Eilidh Doyle was elected as captain of the team.
"Eilidh is modest.
Her opening speech was amazing, "Black said.
"Several athletes, whether Scottish or athletes of other nationalities, came out of the room with a sense of immense pride and motivation.
The passion and Neskrývané of the feelings with which the Eilidh spoke were unrepeatable. "
The silver Commonwealth medalist who will compete in the run over the hurdles at 400 m at its fifth World championships said it is "unbelievable" that the British team is 16 Scottish athletes.
The previous record from the year 1983 and 2015 is seven.
The runner-up on the middle tracks Muirová set only five British and two European records in the last year.
On the MS will participate in the run at 1500 m and 5000 m.
Another of the great Scots is Chris O'Hare, who will run the track at 1500 m. This season he won British team races and annual games.
Doyle remembers his first mastery, which was the only other Scottish member of the team, Lee McConnellová.
The captain of the team led her to be "very proud" on the fact that the team received not only a large number of her colleaguess, but in many cases they will also attack to participate in the finals and medals.
"The extraordinary team captain is that I was elected by other members of the team. It was a great honor for me, but the knowledge that the team members chose me is all the gratifying, "she added.
"I'm obviously very proud of all the Scots who got into the team.
It proves where I moved.
They are athletes who will be confronted on the podium.
And my introductory speech?
Yes, I think she did.
I only drew attention to the fact that we can be proud of this year's championship because it takes place on home turf.
It is important to use the support of domestic fans and rejoice in the fact that we are back at the Olympic Stadium.
I got a second chance to race and enjoy the incredible atmosphere. "
Block critiques on Facebook: neucházejte a public job if you don't take criticism of voters
The father of our country knew his criticism.
The Americans loved George Washington, but the newspapers did not take long to criticize it for anything, starting with domestic politics and ending with his political views.
Yes, this criticism nenechávalaed him cold.
But he didn't try to silence the critics.
Because in the year 1783 Washington said: "Freedom of speech can be repossessed – and stupid and dumb we will be guided as sheep for slaughter."
That brings me to Maryland is governor Larry Hogan, who needs to work to act like Washington.
Hogan's staff blocked and deleted posts at least 450 people who freely showed their opinions on his official Facebook page.
This week, the American Union for Civil Liberties sued him for these acts.
The staff of the Governor rejected the action as gratuitous, and in the comments on the Internet appeared many opinions of the type "who cares".
"It's just Facebook," many users reported.
Still, it matters.
Especially in the moment when it comes to people like Hogan.
In an absolute democratic state, this is an immensely popular Republican governor.
It can boast the second highest popularity of all 50 governors.
Hogan is not popudivý.
As evident is, his state drives with certainty his own and strictly adheres to principles.
It turned out to be also maneuverable in using Facebook as the main means to connect with its voters – the exception is not even the publication of the first photo with a bald head after graduating chemotherapy.
Blocking people who visit the Guvernérovu page – which is a public forum designated as official and managed by its employees paid from taxpayers ' money – is useless and ultimately dangerous.
In an interview with the Washington Post Hoganova, the spokesman Amelia Chasseová defended the governor, saying that the blocking of comments took place from the post moderation.
However, using an image of Internet trolls, spamerů or angry people is too easy.
The Washington Post quizzed a few real people who have deleted posts.
And exactly they are-real people who speak to their elected leaders; Teacher, entrepreneur and pastor, no trolls.
As everyone mentioned, their comments were polite and considerate, not profane.
The Pastor quoted the Bible in his commentary, apelujíc the Hoganovu Catholic faith.
The lawyer of Bowie Lakshmi Sarma Ramaniová, Md. Asked about hate crimes, but her commentary was not hateful.
"I politely remarked that I was disappointed by his lack of response to hateful crimes and other topical news," she wrote in a section with comments from the Washington Post.
"I don't like the idea that once a certain number of people comments on the same subject, some people are identified as the collective effort to promote, instead of being recognized as a larger group of interested citizens."
What the governor's employees called "concentrated spam interest" would probably call them "defense."
The modern Facebook era allows us to easily manage posts by blocking criticisms or deleting negative comments.
It is much more convenient than in the past, when the same procedure would require workers to be posted to the streets, where they would collect and burn all the prints with criticism, or would be arrested or silenced by Protestants.
And that is exactly what is happening, only in digital form.
Hogan is not the last public official to be criticised for insulting Facebook and other social media.
President Trump faces an action by Twitter users who are denied access to his account.
One of the first important regulations was born last week in Virginia.
The chairwoman of the Loudoun County Board of Supervisors violated the First Amendment in Alexandria, according to the district Judge James C. Cacherise, where prevent access to one of the voters on her Facebook page.
Governor Matt Bevin (R) of Kentucky also had a visit from ACLU for his use of Facebook and Twitter.
It shouldn't be that difficult.
In the Times of Washington, the low postage price had practically the same impact as the Internet.
Between the years 1776 and 1800, the number of daily newspapers quadrupled and his position as leader Zpochybňovalo many anonymous writers.
And even in those days, Washington had to deal with anonymous trolls.
People writing under pseudonyms like "Juricola", "Valerius", "Belisarius" and "Portius" wrote letters to newspapers and questioned Washingtonova decisions.
According to historical documents gathered by people within the online project papers of George Washington project, in his office accumulated petitions criticising his opinion against the deal of Amity, Commerce, and Navigation with Britain.
But he did not silence them.
Freedom of speech, disagreement, and intimidation lie in the very foundations of our nation.
And the real leader has to accept it.
Czechs quickly used free roaming, abroad consume more data than at home.
Abroad, Czechs consume more of their fare than at home.
Croatia is the most frequent movement in Austria, but the consumption of data during the summer season is dominated.
On holiday, both have more time surf on the web, and under the umbrella, they usually do not have the possibility to connect to Wi-Fi.
Beach, swimming and smart phone in hand.
This is the typical Czech holiday in Croatia, after customers can use the services of local operators for domestic prices.
It follows from the fresh statistics of O2.
Thanks to the new roaming rules, most Czech travellers have more data available abroad than at home.
It is not surprising, therefore, that in Croatia, where the minimum našinců is run during the winter, the consumption of data is even padesátinásobněed in this summer season.
In the second place in the data consumption chart, Italy was placed.
Most minutes the Czechs call from Germany, where many of them are leaving for business during the summer.
According to the data of the Association of Czech Travel agency, Croatia annually visits 800 thousand Czechs, it is our most popular holiday destinations.
But people exchanged a book for sharing experiences with a mobile phone.
The record was this year 7. July.
"The transferred data would fit tens of millions of photos," details the director of the mobile segment in O2 Silvia Ronald.
Although Croatia leads in volume of data, the highest number of Czech users is moving in neighbouring countries.
Austria is the first place to come, followed by Germany and Slovakia.
Croatia is the fourth and Italy sixth.
We are going to Austria for hiking and active holidays, where we Do not have so much time to browsing on the Internet.
"In addition to Austria, Czechs are heading towards the Adriatic," Ronald explained.
While the operator recorded high annual growth when roaming charges were released, growth is much lower for telephony.
The number of minutes in roaming has risen to double from a year ago.
Germany is dominated by a huge margin over other countries.
"Roaming calls are used by business customers on business trips," added Ronald.

Poverty and death in the Indonesian country of gold
When Bardina Degeiová cooks dinner, he does not use the cooker.
In fact, it rarely uses a saucepan.
In its wooden shack, located in the capital of Paniai Enarotali in the Indonesian province of Papua, the woman usually simply throws a sweet potato-in the speech of the local "Nota"-directly into the fire.
After half an hour, she cuts out the potato and tastes with her nemytýma hands with gusto.
Bardina sits on muddy land-the cottage is not equipped with furniture-where he also performs his daily work, such as. Wash the laundry in the water from the nearby swamp.
A bucket in a room without a roof supluje toilet.
As the youngest of four wives of her husband, she was not assigned any field to cultivate.
Polygamy is common here.
Late-night Labor is a danger: Most of the village's men are unemployed and often drinking alcohol. In addition, the village is home to soldiers.
"In the afternoon after five o'clock, no one will allow themselves to wander around the village," says Bardina.
It is a rare insight into everyday life in the highlands of Papua, the former Dutch colony, which was declared part of Indonesia in 1969 after a controversial referendum, when only 1026 elders were forced to vote in the form of public upheaval before Occupying army.
The current movement protesting against the Dutch rules quickly reversed its anger against the Jakartské government, which dominated the entire region with the exception of foreign journalists or civil rights supervisors.
In the year 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and Western Papua-independent Papua new Guinea occupied the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is such a distant and ravaged city, which can be reached after a ninety-minute flight from the capital of the Jayapura province to Nabire, and then pětihodinovou the stomach forming an ride.
Mass transit does not work at this location.
The town with 19 000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses obehnaných bamboo fences, roofs made of woollen sheets in shades of grey and rusty color.
Very few Indonesians, let alone journalists, and practically no strangers looked at this place.
Before the arrival of Christians, the locals worshipped God named Uga Tamee.
And that's not all.
"We weren't used to wearing these dresses," says Bardina, pointinging on his colourful, hand-knit turban, dark T-shirt and shining skirt.
"We only wore leaves before."
Papua is the poorest province of Indonesia-28% of the population lives below the poverty line, and children's mortality and literacy rates are one of the worst in Asia.
At the same time, it is an Indonesian country of gold.
The largest and most profitable gold mine in the world of Grasberg, which owns the company Freeport McMoran of the American Phoeenixu, is located only 60 miles from Paniai-Rocky province about the size of New Jersey, which is home to about 153 000 inhabitants.
Only in the year 2015, Freeport extracting gold and copper worth 3.1 billion.
In addition, Papua supports logging at an estimated value of 78 billion.
These riches are, however, a Papuánce source of suffering and a guarantee of oppression from the mighty Indonesian army.
An investigation by the New York Times in 2005 shows that Freeport paid local military officials and units about $20 million between 1998 and 2004, including 150 000 dollars for one officer.
Papuans calling for local authorities threaten this golden goose and are therefore hard to potlačováni.
According to human rights activists, more than 500 000 Papuánců have been killed since 1969, and thousands of others have been raped, trýzněnoed and imprisoned by the Indonesian army.
Mass murder in the tribal area of Papua during 70. The years of the last century were tantamount to genocide, as the Asian Human Rights Commission said.
Just last year, the Indonesian police arrested more than 3900 peaceful Protestants in the region.
We Will Lose Everything, the report of the Brisbane Archdiocese of 2016, describes the cruelty that occurred last year as extrajudicial executions, torture-according to the next report is particularly popular rape and execution by electric shock-and brutal suppression of peaceful demonstrators.
"It is difficult to count the number of casualties, because the incidents occur every week," said Andreas Harsono, an Indonesian research fellow at Human Rights Watch.
The whole situation přitížil the fact that Papuan sources attract colonists to Indonesia.
From 3.5 million inhabitants, the province is 83% Christian, but demographics are changing with the influx of Muslim immigrants from the Indonesian islands-Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Javanese canteen sell fried chicken and gado-gado, or a mixture of vegetables with peanut sauce.
Local people are fighting for survival.
"Immigrants began selling chickens and vegetables in traditional markets at lower prices than local Papuans," explains Čtyřiadvacetiletý Abeth you, who was born on Paniai and moved to work in the capital of the province of Jayapura.
"The original inhabitants of Papua-Mama-Mama (women)-so they lost their work."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, dubbed Jokowi, promised a solution of inequality and violation of rights in the 2014 presidential campaign.
The former carpenter secured and its journey to the presidential palace in Jakarta 27 of the 29 districts of Papua, including Paniai.
But very little has changed in Papua, and local people feel betrayed.
"Our heart was broken because in the year 2014 we voted for Jokpwiho with the hope of hearing our call for justice," he said.
The fact is that just two months after the October inauguration of Jakowiho, Paniai experienced a great shock.
On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children sang Christmas songs at the campfire in the town of Enarotali, when two Indonesian soldiers on motorcycles emerged from the dusk of the night.
Two of the surprised children told them that they should turn on the lights.
One of the soldiers made this complaint and the tone that was spokenly touched and later returned with four other soldiers, said the local pastor Yavedt Tebai.
Two of the soldiers in the drunk state persecuted a group of children and beat uped them pažbami their weapons, they reported the victims and witnesses to the events.
One of the soldiers then fired on a group of children.
One of the children, 16letý Yulianus Yeimo, was beaten so heavily that he fell into a coma.
A few hours later someone had burned the nearby building of the Electoral committee, and the next day things were still escalated.
About 1000 young Papuan men and women gathered on the football field in front of the local police station and the army headquarters and demanded justice.
They came with welcomes hunting bows and performed the dance of Waita, which runs in a circle and mimics the singing of birds-the Papuánského tribe of Mee Pago.
Several Protestants began throwing stones at the building.
With the stupňujícím of tension, the soldiers were ordered through the radio: "If the crowd tries at least three times for resistance, you have permission to shoot," it sounded according to TIME magazine in an official document, whose content was never published in the local media.
Yeremias Kaya (56), the head of the Enarotali Kego Koto District, recognized the impending dangers and called people to break into their homes.
But no one had heeded his words.
"When I turned, someone shot me in the left wrist," he told the weekly TIME on the porch of his brightly painted wooden house.
Kaya still does not know who was the scorer, but according to his words, the bullet belonged to one of the soldiers present.
"There were a lot of people all around, and there was a lot of shooting," he added.
One of the local inhabitants, Alfius Youw, was hit three times in the words of his cousin, who witnessed the firing.
"I ran to the body to make sure it was him," said the weekly TIME Zasmušilým The voice of Yohanesová, which, like many Indonesians, used only one name.
"I saw that he was dead... I kissed him. "
Papuánský Police inspector, General Yotje Mende, told reporters that his officers only "secured" the station that was under attack.
"We must defend ourselves when people threaten us by death," said the press spokesperson for the Papuan Police, Commissioner Pudjo Sulistiyo in the year 2015.
"It's a matter of life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five protesters were killed and many escaped injuries.
Report on murders Prošuměla Jakartskými media the following day.
Three weeks later, Jokowi delivered a passionate speech in Jayapuře, and expressed his understanding for the families of the victims and promised to deal with violence in Papua.
"I demand an immediate solution to this problem, so that it could never be repeated," he said.
In October 2016, the Wiranto National security Minister announced that it would introduce an extra-judicial mechanism to resolve violent acts that have occurred in the past.
Almost immediately, however, the excuses began to reverberate.
"Most violent acts have occurred a long time ago.
Some of them occurred in 90. Years of the last century and some at the beginning of 21. Century.
I mean, we're committed to punishing these violent acts, but it won't be a simple task, "he said.
In an interview from 5. June for TIME Weekly, which took place in Jakarta, however, Wiranto argued that it does not plan to introduce any measures in Papua.
Instead, he said that "all cases will be Předstoupeny court".
The Wiranto, which the UN accused of "crimes against humanity" on the basis of more than one thousand deaths during the independent elections of 1999 in East Timor, said that there had been urovnáno 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua, including the incident in Paniai.
Families of victims of gunfire in Paniai welcomed his assertion with distrust.
"In the last three years I have been internedočkaled a total of four times, but so far I have nothing to do," Yohanes said.
"I'm tired."
As he says, several years later he still lives in fear.
"I'm afraid," he says.
"I'm afraid the army arrest me or I'm being shot."
His brother Yacobus confirmed the view of many inhabitants of Paniai, who are afraid of the incident to speak.
In his words, he beat uped the members of the Army after helping to bury four of the victims.
"After the burial of the bodies, the army began to look for me," he said.
And shooting so far neustává.
On Tuesday, the Indonesian police shot at the villagers in the neighboring Deiyai.
The skirmish, in which one person died and another 17 injured, occurred between the villagers and the manager of the construction company, who refused to provide assistance in transporting a man unconscious to a hospital.
Ravianus Douw (24), who drowned while fishing in the nearby river, died on the way to the hospital.
The angry villagers protested in front of the company building.
According to the police, the villagers threw up the stones, and their response was a warning of gunfire.
The locals, however, claim that the Mobile brigade (Indonesian Paramilitaristická police) began firing into the crowd and killing one man.
"There was panic, we were afraid of retaliation," said for TIME 29letý Dominggu Badii, who lives near the hospital and witnessed the arrival of the injured.
"I didn't come out of the house for two days."
Deiyaiský Parliament craved the punishment of participating police officers and the withdrawal of a mobile brigade from the area.
Paniai was always a thorn in the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development only deepens the separation of indigenous peoples of the tribes of Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal, who live in the central Highlands.
Many of them joined the Liberation Movement, Papua (OPM)--Army rebels, which protects the rights of Papuánců by attacking and kidnaping Indonesian policemen.
Some of the OPM leaders come from Paniai. They are among the not Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Goya.
As a result of the attacks the army in recent years has arrested and arbitrarily detained thousands of inhabitants of Paniai, all under the guise of "securing national sovereignty".
Some of them no longer belong.
Paniai is known among the inhabitants of Papua as a "tragic and forgotten place".
Oil in the fire is pouring poverty.
The little rice that is sold in Enarotali is too expensive for the locals.
And bread is just as unachievable.
The locals have grown their food: mainly sweet potatoes, fruits and wheatgrass.
Women work on fields; Each of them tills four or five sweet potato fields.
Most of the harvest is intended for family needs, the rest are sold on the local market.
Ten pieces of sweet potato cost just 10 000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Since Nabire airport has opened more routes and new immigrants have begun to flow into the country, there has been an increase in economic inequality between native Papuans and immigrants.
So few jobs usually occupy educated and wealthier immigrants.
Papuanss rarely have the necessary capital and education to embark on a business.
"Young people move from villages due to lack of job opportunities and money," said John Gobai, chairman of the Tribal Council of Paniai.
Thanks to the isolation, the province of Papua is hidden from the world.
It also contributes to strict rules for foreign journalists.
At the beginning of this year two French journalists-Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp-were expelled from Papua-because of the "lack of cooperation with the authorities", all despite the fact that they received such a rare permit for filming.
Phelim Local Kine, deputy director of the Asian branch of Human Rights Watch, Jokowi promised to repeal strict rules for journalists and achieve transparency and development in his electoral campaign. However, this has never happened.
"Foreign journalists working in the rebellious nejvýchodnějších areas of Papua and Western Papua are at high risk: non-recognition of visas and blacklisting," he said in a statement.
The lack of reports from foreign journalists means that international pressure on Indonesian in Papua is largely limited.
In March Urgovalo six Pacific nations-Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands-the UN Human Rights Council on investigating "various and widespread acts of violence" in Papua, including firing in Paniai.
These countries have also supported the OPM in the past.
A spokesman for the Indonesian foreign Ministry, Arrmanatha Nasir International, shook off the allegations by declaring to reporters in Jakarta that: "There is still a democratic system in Indonesia and the media are free, so it is difficult to disguise evidence of human rights violations."
Local people call for the participation of foreign governments.
When the official delegation from the Netherlands, headed by the envoy for Human rights Keesem Van Baarem, visited 4. May Jayapurau, the local people provolávali according to the source, who also attended the meeting, but wanted to remain anonymous, the motto "We Want Freedom".
For the year 2019, other elections are scheduled in Indonesia, but Papuans claim not to vote Jokowiho.
"Jokowi is a man who has good intentions but is surrounded by people associated with shooting in Paniai," said Gobau, chairman of the Tribal Council.
He wants Jokowi to know that the inhabitants of Paniai-except that they live in constant fear of the marauding army-are rolling in poverty, miserable education, and the health system.
Gobai argues that the inhabitants of Paniai, like the other Papuans, regard their vote as "debt", which must Jokowi repay.
"They don't want the money, they demand justice," he added.
Despite the threats and intimidation of the family's victims of Paniaiské shooting, they continue the last symbolic act of defiance: bury the bodies of the victims on the land opposite the police and army stations.
Knowing that justice will never be done enough, at least let, so that responsible persons forget their crimes.
"A member of our family was killed," said Yacobus, his head tipping.
"What can we do?"
The French Navy caught a huge supply of cocaine to Australia.
The French Navy detained the Pacific yacht carrying 1.46 tons of cocaine worth roughly 256 million.
The shipment was directed to Australia.
During the intervention, the plays in four crew of the ship, apparently made up of Lithuanian and Latvian people, was arrested.
The yacht, named as Afalina, sailed from South America, and the police dragged it to the harbor in Nouméa, the metropolis of the French overseas territory of New Caledonia in the Pacific Ocean.
The Australian intelligence Agency said it would strive, in cooperation with its international partners, to identify precisely where and where the drugs were pointing, and to expose the "Lithuanian syndicate".
"We are grateful to the French authorities for measures that have stopped a large number of drugs destined for Australia," said Col. Blanch, CEO.
The drugs were destroyed this week in Noumée.
Australia is an attractive target for their smugglers because of the high street drug prices.
The country also faces the problem of Rostoucícho the number of people suffering from drug addiction.
The current roundup has not been the first one lately.
Last month, three men were accused of transporting large amounts of drugs from the United States to Australia, which they tried to smuggle across the Pacific Ocean in a small plane.
The elderly do not feel thirsty, the drinking is necessary to remind them.
The problem may be in homes for the elderly, the solution would be, according to a doctor from the geriatric Clinic of the General Faculty Hospital in Prague Pavla Mádlové could be an infusion of physiological solution that screw a thin needle under the skin.
But these are only applied in medical facilities.
The older the person, the more water in his body decreases.
"And he's losing a thirst, so the seniors generally take less fluids and dehydrate very quickly," said Mádlová.
Two gallons should be drunk for sure.
"But getting into an old man so much fluid is a big problem," she added.
In homes for the elderly, it's often no doctor Nehlídá.
In hospitals are usually handled by infusions.
"I think that even there should gradually be introduced to be able to receive subcutaneous infusions," she said.
In a day, up to two pint bottles of physiological saline can be delivered to old people.
Lack of fluids can cause malaise, headache and reduced performance.
Dehydration is an absolute loss of self-sufficiency.
"One day, the old man says he can't get out of bed, he talks confused," she added.
In case of neglect, it may result in a stroke.
Blood will thicken and becomes clogged vessel in the brain, there is also a kidney failure.
Lying patients should not be covered with a duvet, a maximum cotton sheet.
Disposable diapers can also be a problem.
"It's Ošetřovatelsky more challenging, but the ideal would be to uncover the patient occasionally and leave the skin vyvětrat," said the doctor.
The Torch was burned for the second time in Dubai
In Dubai, one of the world's largest residential skyscrapers was on fire on Friday. Firefighters had to evacuate all inhabitants of 337 meters high and 79 storey buildings.
In the last two years it is already the second fire of this high-rise building, which bears the proper name of the torch.
All residents of the building were evacuated and there were no injuries. The cause of the fire is unknown.
"We slept and we woke the alarm. We heard screams.
It took us ten minutes to descend from 50. Palate, "he said for Reuters George, one of the residents of the skyscraper.
The Dubai Civil Defense said the firefighters managed to get the fire under control around four o'clock in the morning (0:00 GMT), whereupon they continued to cool the building.
Government officials have added that they provide alternative accommodation for disabled people.
The Incident could again trigger a discussion on the safety of materials used to trim high-rise buildings around the world.
The results of the investigation, which began the management of the Tower of Torch after the fire in 2015, revealed that the cladding and external panels used for decoration or isolation were most damaged.
The British police said the London Grenfell Tower's isolation and lining system could have contributed to the rapid spread of fire in the June fire, killing nearly 80 people.
The survey results showed that more than one in five passengers to the USA carry prohibited items on board the aircraft
A survey among travellers showed that more than twenty percent of them were consciously or unconsciously conveyed prohibited articles through the U.S. government's transportation Security Administration's checkpoints on board the aircraft. At least six percent of the passengers came aboard an aircraft with a knife or other sharp object.
Less than one percent of passengers claim to have belatedly found that they were traveling with firearms, ammunition or explosives.
The survey results conducted by Stratos Jet Charters Inc.-and more than 1000 behalf requesting-showed that younger passengers are more likely to be in violation of the rules.
Of the respondents who admitted that they tried to consciously travel with a subject that is banned by TSA, there were 19.7 percent of passengers with several thousand hours of flying compared to less than 15 percent of members of generation X.
The most common subjects that have leaked the attention of TSA include food and alcohol.
More than three percent of respondents knowingly made a sharp objection through security, while 2.2 percent of the female respondents and 3.7 percent of the men surveyed also admitted that they deliberately carried banned drugs aboard the aircraft.
The company said it carried out research among travellers around the world to find out how many of them accidentally made unauthorised items through airport control and how much they did on purpose.
Unsurprisingly, most people who have transferred unauthorised items – whether consciously or unconsciously – are traveling by plane very often.
As the company underlined, the TSA guidelines are somewhat complicated and confusing.
People often don't know what kind of liquid they can carry on an airplane.
It is no surprise, then, that the TSA seized in the largest amount of the forbidden liquid.
For some time people thought that the TSA would treat books in the same way as pašovaným goods.
The transport of liquids is permitted within domestic flights, not international.
Head of EPA Scott Pruitt on deferral of planned guidelines to reduce emissions of the Obama administration
After fifteen countries were sued by the Environmental Protection Agency, Scott Pruitt his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the former Obama administration's plan to reduce carbon dioxide emissions.
Pruitt introduced changes within its plan. It responds svižnějily than previous governments to the needs of national environmental regulators.
However, he did not mention the legal challenge brought against his previous position in the Federal Court of Appeal.
This applies to the last deadline set at 1. October, when States should start to comply with the 2015 regulation to reduce the level of ground-level ozone.
In June, Pruitt announced that it would postpone the agreement for one year and order more detailed study of the plan to avoid "interventions with local decisions or impending economic growth."
Pruitt, who was the position of state Attorney General Oklahoma before putting up the role of head of CEPOL as President Donald Trump, served for a long time as a staunch opponent of tighter environmental regulations.
Since settling in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly movesed or delayed the regulation proposed by the chemical and fossil industries.
A sudden turning point is the biggest legal failure for the PRUITTOVU regulatory agenda.
Last month, the Federal Court of Appeals in Washington decided that the EPA had overstepped its authority in trying to delay the integration of the Obama administration's plan, which required oil and gas companies to reduce methane leakage.
In a statement issued on Wednesday evening, Pruitt proposed its version of ozone standards and strengthened CEPOL's commitment to cooperation with States through complex processes and meeting new standards within a given timeframe.
"The government of the previous EPA administration often failed to meet deadlines and waited until it was sued by aktivistickými groups and others, souhlasíc with a settlement and further setting of plans," said Pruitt, who in his previous position filed more than a dozen lawsuits on the EPA.
"We do not believe in regulation by means of litigation and we take the performance of the term seriously.
Never nežertujeme of the status and authority that follows it. "
However, the EPA declaration states that Pruitt may use the "possibility of delay and all other legally available authorities" at some point to ensure that regulation "will be based on sound policy and most affordable of information".
The Republicans in Congress are pushing for obšírnější transcription of the ozone rules.
The White House budget, approved last month, has been seeking a delay in implementing the 2015 rules for at least eight years.
The measure still failed to pass through the Senate.
A New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who was spearheading the coalition of states that sued the EPA this week, said the group wasn't going to allow it in legal coercion.
"The turnaround in EPA's views-following our lawsuit is an important victory for the health and safety of those 6.7 million New Yorkers and more than 115 million Americans, who are directly affected by air pollution," added Schneiderman.
New York joined California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, and Washington, D.C.
Ground-level ozone occurs when common harmful substances emitted by automobiles, power plants, oil refineries, chemical power stations and other sources reacts in a solar atmosphere.
The resulting smog can cause serious respiratory problems in sensitive people and every year thousands of premature deaths.
Public health advocates and environmentalists Pruittovu a sudden change in kvitují with gratefully.
"It's troubling what pressure needs to be made to change the minds of responsible people and protect the air we breathe," said Lori Ann Burdová from the Center for Biological Diversity.
"We must continue to wrestle with the ideological drag of the Trumpovy administration, which seeks to assist polluters and special interests."
Spilled a man with acid, but he is not dangerous by the court.
You never know what can happen to you.
At one point you are at home with your family and you laugh, in the second you will suddenly change your whole life from the ground up.
And the worst thing is, you can't do anything about it.
A similar fate was met by Andreas Christopherose from Great Britain, whose face was etched by an unknown attacker who was finally acquitted.
The information was reported by Reuters.
On December 2014, Christopherosových knocked at the door.
Andreas got up to open.
He thought that at the door he was probably a courier, who was supposed to deliver Christmas gifts for the family that day.
Instead, a cruel surprise awaited him.
A man whom he had never seen in his life immediately after opening without warning spilled acid with the words: "That's for you, my friend."
The pain was indescribable.
The clothes fell on me like nothing and I felt only unreal pain on the skin, "said Andreas.
The family brought him to the hospital swiftly, but his loved ones learned a terrible message-doctors did not have the chance to survive.
A few weeks after the incident, doctors were constantly worried that their patient would succumb to an infection that threatened to penetrate his wounds.
His wounds were very serious.
Ninety percent of the face was struck by doctors trying to get together using the skin from other parts of the patient's body.
The loss of the eyelids became a major complication for Christopherose.
It's probably the nejmučivější thing I've ever seen.
"You cannot hide from the unexpected light, you cannot close your eyes," he described his sorrows.
Today, Christopheros has twelve operations that are far from the last.
Injuries suffered by acid attack victims may require hundreds of surgical procedures and years of treatment, according to plastic surgeons.
Even after demanding and long-term treatment, victims of tissue have scarred for the rest of their lives.
"Sometimes people do not recover, and they fight deformity and disfigurement throughout their lives," said Professor Peter Dziewulski, a spokesman for the British Association of Plastic and Aesthetic surgeons.
The attacker was mistaken.
As for the attack, Christopheros is certain that an unknown man had to confuse him with someone.
The offender believed that revenge was a man who sexually abused his close person.
The police thoroughly investigated the case, and the attacker eventually Vypátrala.
The man was originally sentenced to a minimum of eight years in prison.
But later, the verdict on the astonishment of the Christopherosovy family changed fundamentally.
"The three judges finally concluded that the punishment should be abolished, since the man is not considered a threat to the public," said Christopheros.
Over the last few years, the numbers of corrosive substances have increased significantly.
The Ministry of the Interior has commented on the issue by planning to set new guidelines for public prosecutors on the classification of caustic.
These should be classified as dangerous weapons.
But victims of such attacks not going give up.
They demand that the Great Britain government enforce more stringent and longer sentences of imprisonment for people who invade their surroundings with acid or other corrosive substances.
They also require stricter controls on the sale of dangerous substances, which are often commonly available in different stores, since they are different detergents.
In the largest city of the United Arab Emirates, Dubai burned at night the famous skyscraper the Torch, which is one of the largest residential buildings in the world.
According to Dubai Civil Defense, the inhabitants of Osmdesátipatrové building were able to evacuate in time and no one was injured.
According to a spokesman for the Dubai Police, the ninth-floor fire broke out and spread up.
But it was the opposite of a few inhabitants of the house.
"It started at 67. This is what they told us, "said one of the tenants.
Also, according to another tenant quoted by Reuters, the fire broke out on top floors and spread downward with falling hot debris.
We slept.
The alarm woke us up, people shouted.
"We ran down the stairs, it took us from 50. Floor for about ten minutes, "the event was described by the tenant George.
Another witness for CNN estimated that the flames caught about 40 bytes.
On Earth, the fire destroyed at least two cars when the burning parts of the building were on them.
After about two hours, according to the Civil Defence communication, the fire managed to get under control.
The cause of its origin is not yet known.
According to witnesses in the surrounding buildings, the current fell out.
A massive fire damaged Dubai's skyscraper The Torch also in February 2015, destroyed over 100 apartments.
There are about 680 apartments in the entire building.
Even then, nothing happened to anyone, because the inhabitants managed to evacuate in time.
The Torch was built in 2011 and then became the largest residential building in the world with its 352 meters.
The record was prepared by another Dubai skyscraper next year.
The bodybuilder had an incredible 14 doping substances in the body.
He didn't win anyway.
According to the sheet Corriere della Serra, in the sample třiadvacetiletého Hippolyte occurred a varied collection of illicit means-from steroids to diuretics to medications for Parkinson's disease or anorexia.
Paradoxically, this wild mix did not help him to the title, he finished fourth.
Now the bodybuilder is at risk of four-year distance and prosecution.
The record was 11.
Last year, the Italian rugby player David Vasta tested positive for 11 doping substances, which in the meantime was a record number of caught athletes.
The Třetiligový player began by his words taking steroids a year before when he fell into bodybuilding.
Lucky Vadim in the Czech Republic.
Passionately hugged with a former lover!
Barely a lucky Vadim she stepped in the Czech Republic is in one round.
and the attention to wherever he comes.
She had last fallen into her arms, her former lover, Michal Long, with whom she had lived for three years.
The actor was then 12 years older, and he had longed for the family.
Lucie was only 19 years old and certainly did not desire to hang his career on the nail.
So they went from each other, but their friends remained today.
They also managed to do TV Prima's press conference, where they met after a long time.
Coincidentally, they both sladilied into the blue color.

Islamists have been given life for assassination in the United Kingdom.
On Thursday, the British court sent four members of the Islamist cell, the Three Musketeers, to life behind bars, and according to prosecution planned a terrorist attack against the police and the army.
Four men, two of whom attended a training camp in Pakistan and had previously been convicted of similar deeds, were arrested last August.
The authorities believed that they were about to attack immediately.
In the car of one of the men, the security agents found a partially finished tubular bomb, a knife with inscriptions that meant "infidel" in Arabic, and a mock gun.
This happened when the Secret Service agent MI5 umisťovaled into the vehicle with a listening device.
"Recent assassinations have shown the horrors that the defendants could have caused if they were not stopped," said deputy prosecution Sue Hemmingová.
Three convictions aged 28, 25 and 33 years may ask for parole after twenty years.
The fourth convict, who is 38 years old, can do so after 15 years behind bars.
During the London trial, men claimed that they were innocent and that the weapons found in the car had been placed by agent MI5.
The court also heard it, but then rejected the defendants ' allegations.
Thursday was the hottest day of the year.
Hodonínsko measured 38.3 °c.
Tuesday's temperature record of 37.3 degrees Celsius remained on the cutting edge for two days.
With 38.3 degrees Celsius, which were recorded in the military post on Hodonínsko, it surpassed Thursday, which thus became the hottest day this year.
The staff of the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute confirmed this.
Compared to Tuesday, however, many temperature records did not fall on Thursday.
On Tuesday, records of 35 from 145 meteorological stations, measuring over 30 years, were overcome or settled.
On Thursday, only nine long-term measuring stations recorded record temperatures.
For example, the Thursday's temperature was the same as the previous record of the year 2013.
In Lednice on Břeclavsku Thursday 37.4 degree surpassed the original maximum by four tenths of a degree and in Pohořelicích on Brněnsku current 37.1 degree exceeded the record by three tenths.
Both records, like the military post, came from the year 2013.
It was ten degrees less in the west.

On the other hand, in western and northwest Bohemia, for example, only about 22 degrees Celsius have been chmi by the site.
"The temperatures started growing there later in the afternoon," the Weathermen said.
The current heat in the Czech Republic will be gradually odeznívat according to Chmi and more significant rains could come on Sunday.
At most places in Moravia, however, high temperatures will remain on Friday and southeast Moravia as well as on Saturdays.
China lacks tourists.
BEIJING, because of visa policy, is losing billions.
For decades, China has been trying to exert its influence without the use of force funds.
Each year, it spends ten billion dollars in support of language schools and the construction of universities abroad, pushing its entertainment industry to foreign markets and trying to attract Western tourists.
That's not what Beijing is doing.
Its state media talks about the plan to make tourism a driving force for economic transformation and modernisation.
However, the number of arrivals rose only by 3.8 percent last year, and roughly 80 percent of tourists to China came from Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan.
This is due, among other things, that despite all of its global aspirations, China does not welcome foreigners with open arms, assesses the situation in the world's most populous country, professor of economics from Beijing University's Christopher Balding in an article for Bloomberg.
The Chinese visa policy is an example that speaks for all.
Only 13 countries have visa-free travel with China, and citizens of others have to take a visa in advance.
As a result, the Chinese authorities in the US are comparable to the celebrations of China's new Year.
The visa costs 140, but if one does not want to wait for hours in the queue, it must pay 100 and more for additional services.
Such restrictions build significant economic barriers.
The Journal of Economics and Finance has shown that the need for a visa reduces the country's number of visitors by 70 percent.
In 2015, mainland China was visited by only two million Americans, while Hong Kong, which is less than three per cent of China's gross domestic product, has visited 1.8 million Americans, living less than one percent of the population.
China often deepens this problem by using tourism to implement its political goals, such as in disputes with WAN and South Korea.
When China in the spring confined transport to South Korea within the split around the South Korean missile system, South Koreans it Oplatili and avoided China.
In May, the number of visits fell by 42 per year, while Japan recorded an increase of 85 percent.
This affects macroeconomic stability.
According to a recently published report by the US central Bank, the Fed may have left as much as 190 billion to China as a result of China's foreign journeys, and it will receive about 35 billion in currency sales to incoming tourists annually.
According to the official figures on balance-of-payments developments, China had a deficit of 217 billion in tourism in the last year, equivalent to 44 percent of China's entire surplus in trade in goods.
A small number of tourists, therefore, advocates a very painful blow to a country that anxiously defends the capital outflow.
But the factors mentioned above are only one manifestation of more general restraint on foreigners.
In many places in China, virtually no one has heard of immigrants.
Even in 2013, less than a million foreigners lived in China all over the year.
More of them have some individual cities in the United States.
Even Japan, which is not exactly the crossroads of immigration, has double.
Many scientific papers show that immigrants usually enliven economic growth, entrepreneurship, and innovation.
However, it is practically not found in China.
To solve these problems will be politically challenging, but the step that is being offered is to simplify the visa apparatus.
Other Asian countries, particularly India and Vietnam, have recently been making great efforts to simplify and cheaper visa-issuing procedures.
If China wants more foreign tourists and their hard currencies, it should be easier for them to get there.
In Pilsen Zoo Rozmnožili fatally poisonous reptiles.
The Kingdom of Pilsen I'm going to enjoy the pups of three rare, deadly reptiles.
In the exposition, visitors will see only all nine freshly born vipers Turkish.
This species lives in North Anatolia, even at an altitude of 2000 meters.
"It grows even in metre length," described the spokesman for the zoo Martin Vobruba.
The Cubs of the other two species, smrtonošů and Cobras Red, will be gaining strength in the breeding background of the garden.
We can't even tell you when people will see them.
"We wouldn't like to lose them," said the nurse Miroslav, with the fact that it could take a year or two.
Australian smrtonošů Zmijích came to the world eight, they are descendants of the breeding couple originating from the population around Sydney.
"The individual that visitors can see in the exposition belongs to the smrtonošům from the Perth area," said Vobruba, saying that in human care, it is necessary for Smrtonoše to wintering 6-8 weeks at 13 degrees Celsius.
100% success accompanied clutch African spitting cobras red.
Steam in the Pilsen zoo hatched four chicks from four eggs.
"Incubation lasted 65 days," added Vobruba.
This species in nature on their victims vystřikuje poison, up to a distance of up to four meters.
He's headed for the eyes, he can cause permanent blindness.
The chicks of all three species feed in the zoo with mice holaty.
Within 40 days in the garden still expect to hatch chicks from laying mamby black, eggs are stored in an incubator.
According to an unverified transcript of the telephone interview, Trump pressure on Mexico creates a payment for the border wall
The Washington Post's American Diary published a transcript of President Trump's phone calls with the leaders of Mexico and Australia.
In a telephone interview from 27. On January 1, with Mexican President Enrique Peñou Nietem, Trump Urgoval stopped him from publicly preached that he would not pay for the construction of the proposed wall.
The US president reproached him that he publicly condemns the construction of the wall, allegedly saying, "You can't talk like that in the press."
In his campaign, Trump promised to build a wall along the southern borders and preached to pay Mexico for it.
The transcript of his first call to Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbullem also escaped the public, odhalujíc a tense exchange of views.
President Trump told Turnbullovi that an agreement on US oversight of refugees directed to Australia was "ridiculous" and "silly" and insisted that if he agreed to such an agreement--which came under President Obama's rule--he would look like "drugged" after he designed The ban on the entry of refugees to the US.
Trump call ended after Turnbullovi explained that "This is my most unpleasant call of the day".
Tusk again testified to prosecutor's office for Smolensk.
"Has nothing to fear," said the Tuskovu address of the brother of the dead President, the Chairman of the Government party law and Justice of the PiS Jaroslaw Kaczynski.
"I have nothing to fear, Kaczynski will not intimidate me," said Tusk, reading the current leadership of the country, trying to exploit the judiciary against political opponents.
When leaving the headquarters prosecution waited for Tuska according to the television TVN 24 dav who chanted Donald Tusk! And wished a politician a hundred years!.
Tusk thanked for the support and assured that he has a pure conscience: "I have nothing to fear and Kaczynski will not intimidate me."
He does not blame the prosecutors for his words, but he does not doubt that the judiciary has the current Polish rulers to serve as a tool against opponents, opposition, or people they do not like, and I fear that I belong to this group.
He was a second time in the interrogation.
Expremiér was interrogated for the prosecutor's Office for the second time, the interrogation was to be questioned in the autopsy of the victims of the Smolensk disaster.
In addition, it came to the substitution of bodies in coffins.
Families were forbidden to open coffins, and there had to be some reasons for this.
And the reason was that they were afraid of the scandal, because they would has imposed the Polish-Russian relations.
"Maintaining good relationships at all costs, despite such terrible events, should serve to make Donald Tusk become someone very important in the EU," said Kaczynski in Catholic television Trwam.
He added that a possible conflict with Russia would frustrate tusk the chances of acquiring the most important seat in the Union, of which Poland has absolutely nothing.
Kaczynski also claimed that he had warned German Chancellor Angela Merkel that Donald Tusk might have been in different ways, but did not take that into account.
Tusk underwent eight interrogation on the prosecutor's office already 19. April.
Even then he did not testify as a suspect, only as a witness.
However, many of his summons to questioning were considered as part of the blatant efforts of the Polish government and chief PiS Kaczynski discredit Tusk as a political opponent by merging with various scandals.
Prosecutor's office is subordinated in Poland to the Minister of Justice, who holds the role of the Attorney general.
The summons for questioning came shortly after election of Tusk to the head of the European Council, which Kaczynski struggled to do, but tried vainly to prevent, among other things, when he visited Merkel in Warsaw.
Only Polish prime Minister Beata Szydlová, in the end, alone protested at the EU summit against extending the Tuskova mandate.
In this case, the Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán left Warsaw in the lurch.

Moore's Ford Bridge massacre: Activists reminded of racist lynching
Ford Mercury from the year 1948 drove around the residents of Monroe, Georgia and kodrcal towards Moore's Ford bridge.
However, before a car with four black-skinned passengers and a white driver had been enough to reach the bridge, a group of white arms zahradilaed his way.
The leader of the group-a middle-aged man in a striped suit-took a long haul of cigarettes and stared at the windshield of the car.
Inside, the passengers trembled with fear.
"We want that n---and Roger!" shouted the man.
"Bring him to me!"
The silence breaks the roar of a young Negro who is pulled from the passenger seat.
Fortunately, this scene is simply a reconstruction of the events that occurred on 22. July.
But when one of the men throws a noose over the "Rogerův" neck, the audience vzdychne with excitement.
Since 2005, a group of activists regularly return to Moore's Ford Bridge, reconstructing the fateful night of 1946, when two black pairs-Roger and Dorothy Malcomová and George and Mae Murra Dorseyová-were killed by members of the Kukluxklanu.
No one has ever been tried for murder.
"It is surprising that all these years have not been arrested by a single person-despite being increasingly we see in our community; Even if we know their identity, "Let's hear Tyrone Brooks, who helps reconstruct the event to organize.
"It is a blot on our history and the burden in our souls."
Brooks is a 71letý former congressman of the state of Georgia and a lifelong civil rights fighter.
In his eyes, reconstruction of the event represents a dramatic challenge for action. Each year the Monroe community recalls that justice has not been done enough.
"We demand the prosecution and foreclosure of the case, we want peace of mind and reconciliation, but justice in particular," said Brooks.
"In the meantime, the healing and reconciliation process cannot be started."
The judicial doctor covers the 27. July 1946 one of the bodies of the victims lynching at Moore's Ford.
According to the FBI files, which received news from NBC News, lynching was supposed to take part in up to 50 men from Monroe and surrounding districts.
But no one has yet been prosecuted.
Despite the suspects remaining free for decades, the partisans of civil rights claim that both reasons lynching-politics and sex-were known to all residents of the city.
In April 1946, under the Supreme Court decision, the black-skinned people of Georgia had the first right to participate in elections scheduled for the summer.
And just during the summer elections, according to the FBI, the black-skinned farmer, Roger Malcom, during the skirmishes stab the landowners of white-skinned Barnett Hester-allegedly because of his wife.
In the city, according to Brooks, he tradovalo that Hester Obcoval and Malcomovoued Dorothy's wife and brought her to another state.
According to the FBI, he composed 25. July 1946 the then significant landowner of white skin Loy Harrison for a Malcoma bail of $600.
He was escorted to the prison by Dorothy and cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey.
On returning from the prison, just before the entrance to the Moore's Ford bridge, they zahradila a group of suspects.
"The murders have been planned and orchestrated by Harrison," the FBI inferred.
"It is also clear that there has been a secret agreement between state and local ombudsmen who have not only participated in the lynching, but have also gotten rid of the evidence and concealed all the identity of witnesses."
Brooks said Stručněji to the whole affair.
"It was a massacre for the electoral law," he said.
"The murders had a clear subtext for all the local black-skinned people: ' This is the way to go if you sign up and vote '."
The annual reconstruction of Moore's Ford Bridge has been organized for almost ten years by Cassandra Greene.
Her performance is figurative, engaging and concise. It shows deep-rooted racism that many would like to consider extinct in modern America.
Watching this reconstruction is not easy and even more difficult to avert sight, but Greene says it has its meaning.
"Nobody wants to talk about lynching, because we have to face the uncomfortable feelings that hide in each of us," said Greene.
"But there cannot be a relationship between us unless you listen to what I have to go through."
The main rehearsals of this year's reconstruction began in June and the very first day with approximately 30 actors-a dozen whites, the rest of the Negroes-flocked to the room where Greene met a very carefully scheduled performance.
Wade Marbaugh performs the position of Assistant director.
For many years he played the leader of the Kukluxklanu, but according to his words, the role is exhaustive.
"I feel bad about it because it contradicts who I am," Marbaugh said.
"I think it's very important to remind yourself about this part of history regularly, because we never want to go back to that time."
Actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, who play the role of Roger Malcoma, or Barnett Hester, practice their role.
The performance begins with a skirmish-Malcom argues with Hester and blames him for sleeping with his wife.
"Get off my land n---E!"
Rascona.
Skirmish occurs.
At that moment everyone (at least each black actor) explodes in laughter.
Greene laughs the most.
"What happened?" Otážeed Rascona.
He's confused.
Was I too rude?
"No," leading Greene cheerfully.
"I just don't think whites were saying ' n-R ' in such a tone."
"Exactly," Vyhrkne one of the black-skinned actors.
"You have to put more emphasis on R."
The energy in the room is suddenly better; The enemy will replace the feeling of rapprochement.
Everyone wants the show to be authentic. Only to be done for enough four victims of the massacre.
The actors repeat the scene.
Rascona this time emphasizes the correct pronouncement of a word on N.
No one's laughing now.
The performance ends violently and quickly.
Roar, shots... and the Silence.
A woman dressed in black stands above the bodies of actors and Pěje Truchlivou the song Billie Holiday "Strange Fruit".
Every word has a feeling of sadness in the room.
In the background of all this, a dozen bystanders wipes sweat and tears from their eyes.
There are practically the same number of blacks and Caucasians in the audience.
One couple traveled from New York Ithacy, many spectators from the nearby vicinity.
Each of them tolerates the local humid climate for almost eight hours, and Brooks is in the crowd leading to the tombs of Malcolm and Dorsey.
Until this moment, the murders could be viewed with a distance, but now, stojíc in the same place where the lynching occurred, the atmosphere is scary.
With the last words of the song, Greene will invite the crowd to inspect the bodies.
The children klekají to the heads of the victims, watching fake blood and immovable bodies, and whispering something in their ear.
"They're not dead," Utrousí the little boy.
Passes a few minutes and Greene would thank the audience. It's over.
The actors cleaned the rope and blur their tears.
Bradshaw embraces Marbaugha, a man in a suit played by the leader of the Kukluxklanu.
Nick Rascona embraces his two buddies-the actor and cries out in their arms; Finally, doléhají emotion.
"That's all right," whispered one of the women.
"We know you're in the same role.
But you had a reason for that. "
Later that day, the audience sits together with the actors for dinner.
At one table a young Bělošsky couple enthusiasm talking about a show with a black pair that they met today.
Denise Duplinskiová barely found words to express her feeling from today's performance.
"It is difficult to listen to those ugly words and look at those hideous deeds... which are held by people who look like you and do it because they look like you," she said to the reconstruction.
"It makes me realize that lynching is still a topical subject," she added, "just called police skirmishes."
On the other side of the room sits Tyrone Brooks in the courtroom. Relish dinner and talking about civil rights.
According to his own words, he already began planning a performance for another year.
"The reconstruction of these events is inspiring, as it describes the fear that we had to relive — but it is also a moment to ponder," he said.
"Unless we learn from it, who knows... it could happen again.
People who do not know and do not study the history of their country are doomed to repeat it. "
I love the instructions for use.
A friend of mine says that the instructions for use only read a chicken.
I disagree, on the contrary.
It is one of modern forms of art, often pure surrealism.
With nostalgia I remember the times long ago, where the instructions for use of anything was rather a guests raritným phenomenon.
For example, my first gramophone had only one paper on which there were hieroglyphs depicting the wiring of some components, and there were some secret brands.
When something inside had gone wrong for years, I offered the document to a shaman who was not afraid to unscrew the back plate.
With grin, he told me what the paper with the labyrinth of lines was suitable for.
Yes, it was an accustomed aid in the chronic depletion of toilet paper.
He found a disconnecteding wire and allowed me to listen to the precious vinyl pancakes again.
The new time has brought new instructions.
Even a relatively simple fruit juicer, where he simply held a cut grep, required about ten pictures.
A sketch with a description of how to insert one part into another was particularly useful.
The set was two-piece and another procedure was simply not possible.
To put it in reverse, it required considerable effort with the necessity of breaking certain plastic parts.
My disdain for the instructions ended at my Samohybu brand Seat Leon.
The year of manufacture 2003 still had such a book with instructions for minor repairs, among which were the replacement of turn signals bulb.
It was easy.
A total of three steps and work should have been done.
Unfortunately, the author of the manual neglected indicate that while the bulb on the right went to replace really only in three steps.
1. Take off the cover.
2. Crosshead a cracked bulb and našroubuj a new one.
3. Nasuň the cover.
The bulb on the left had a problem with the location of the battery cover.
At first I thought that by inserting the right upper limb into the bowels of the car našmátrám some spring, a screw, which redeployment the cover easily and then I will be guided by points 1-3 Economical author of the service book.
Error.
The cover had no place, no space, even a slender hand Popelčinu, let alone an obese Slezana.
I have lost half an hour of my life, completely without any success.
The state was augmented by the entrance of my wife to the garage, which he summoned to Ryk and the words that he hears in my mouth very rarely.
"What are you doing here?" she asked innocently.
My response lasted about 90 seconds, but if I omit profanity, only two Publikovatelná words left.
Changing the bulb.
"And why is it taking so long?" She risked a sentence that could be her last in a long-standing bunch.
I slowly explained the problem to her, and I placed the main emphasis on the of torture of the author of the instructions, where požehování hot iron on the hands that she wrote, then utětím her, that he could never write anything again, was a mere introduction to a wide range of hammer instructions Witches, including his komisionálníhos burned on top of the Losinským castle.
"How about dismantling the box?" the woman said the battery.
In sheer despair this occurred and then step 1-3 was as easy and fast as the right side.
I thought nothing could surprise me.
And until the day my colleague called me, who was just sifting through the collapse situation after checking two úřednic of the State Department for Drug Control.
I know him as a balanced colleague who has experienced both possible and impossible in the field and who can interpret wild stories with an unruffled voice.
"Imagine that I was fined for not having the instructions for cleaning my hands," he told me in a faint voice.
Gradually I dug outed from him the whole problem, which was in the fact that there is no picture instructions above the washbasin in the toilet, how to wash his hands.
His argument to the Commission úřednici that adults usually wash their hands, and that the need for pictograms to master the accustomed activity of decent people had no healing effect and cost him a little money.
"It's not just that," she told him.
He understood that simply rinsing the palm of the hand with running water is a primitive act at the level of kromaňonce that a man of modern, Homo sapiens sapiens, performs this ceremony in ten steps.
For example, it is necessary to tell that water must be released from the tap.
The whole process has a total of eleven points, but at the end it is a joyful finding that one washed his hands exactly as he ordered Hosudar from SÚKLu.
Finally, I must say that I was inspired and preparing a detailed plan for activity in the restroom.
In question defecation is the procedure uniform, there the problem does not arise, for urination, due to certain differences of both sexes, it will be necessary to hang the guides two.
The problem remains with these pictograms, for it is possible to create a perfect procedure with a precise sketch of all the anatomical details, which could arouse a certain outrage at the prudérního visitor, despite the fact that he can finally learn that during his entire life Vytíral the appropriate hole in a completely faulty procedure.
Pearson disallows an additional 3000 employees and reduces dividends in an effort to revive trade
British educational group Pearson on Friday said it would release an additional 3000 employees and reduce the provisional dividend by 72 percent in response to the next restructuring program in order to change the business model.
A further wave of redundancies, which, according to the director John Fallon's statement, will occur at the end of 2018 and at the beginning of the year 2019, followed by a previous decision by the company to dismiss 4000 employees in the previous restructuring.

Assault on a convoy in Kabul: NATO troops were killed in a suicide bombing
A suicide bomber attacked a military convoy in the capital of Afghanistan, Kabul. One NATO soldier died in the attack, and several others were injured, the officials said.
Five soldiers and an interpreter were injured, it is reported in NATO's observations.
According to anecdotal reports, three civilians also died in an attack in the Qarabagh district.
This month, Afghanistan hit the bomb--on Tuesday, more than 30 people were killed in an explosion in a Herátské mosque.
On Monday, the suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
NATO stated in its observations that the ÚTERNÍMU explosion occurred after the patrol, along with members of the Afghan army, had been attacked by a local person with homemade explosive devices.
The statement also states that all injuries to soldiers are beyond the threat of life and are found in the American military Hospital at the air base excavators.
According to the rapporteurs, the growing power of the Taliban and the group known as the Islamic State (IS) in the area of Qarabagh are an important source of NATO allied concern in the nearby Bagrámu.
According to the United Nations, at least 1662 civilians died in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, of which 20% of victims died in the capital.
At the end of July, Usmrtila bomb was placed in a car at least 30 people in Kabul's Shia district.
The Taliban volunteered to attack.
May 31st killed a great explosion in the center of more than 150 people. This is the deadliest militant attack in the country since the US troops toppled the Taliban government in 2001.
Violence undermines the already dubious situation in Afghanistan, and US President Donald Trump is considering increasing the number of US troops to assist military units and police officers in the country.
According to the rapporteurs, suicide attacks have been shaken by the schools in recent weeks by public confidence in the government, its regulation, and especially in President Ašrafa Ghanína's reputation.
In response to the action, Cepol revised its decision to waive the rules on smoking
America's Environmental Protection Agency has recalled its decision to delay the Obama administration's bill, which said states to reduce emissions, just one day after 15 states have sued the agency.
At Wednesday night, CEPOL announced its decision to transfer "ozone standards 2015" with the words that it presents an undertaking to the Agency for cooperation with the States.
"We believe in dialogue with our state partners and hear their views," said EPA director Scott Pruitt in a statement.
Pruitt announced in June that EPA's efforts to delay ozone standards--which measure actual air pollution in specific areas of the country--determine the limits to be met by October 2018.
A group of fifteen of the most democratic states, along with Washington, D.C., brought an action on Tuesday on the grounds that the EPA negotiations were illegal.
President Donald Trump's administration seeks to prevent many of the environmental regulations proposed by former President Barack Obama-by Trump words in an attempt to kick economic growth.
But the new Government's efforts have launched countermeasures by Democrats and conservative groups that fear the impact of emissions on public health.
EPA on its website states that breathing air containing ozone "can reduce lung function and increase respiratory symptoms", such as Asthma.
Vocalist Ladislav Bubnár got hit and blood flowed!
This, with us a fairly new singer, you may already have registered in June this year, when this so far the almost unknown singer has arranged in Czech ratios monstrous action, on which he hosted such prominent personalities as the master Karel Gott, Lucie Bílá, Simona Kabir and many others, and the action was not moderated by anyone other than Leoš Mareš.

Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomačenko spoke at a meeting about the possibilities of mutual duel
Vasyl Lomačenko and Mikey Garcia, two boxers who could zinscenovat the most exciting boxing match in light weight, first met on Tuesday's meeting.
Each one was in a separate room in the ESPN office in Los Angeles, until Garcia-the world boxing Council's undefeated light-weight champion-did not descend to the hall, where he welcomed Lomačenka, the world boxing Organization Spring Champion.
After Garciově victory on the basis of a unanimous decision against the former quadruple world champion Adrienovi Bronerovi on Saturday's match at Showtime, both boxers were given a list of the top five boxers in light weight.
Garcia reached out his right and said, "How's it going, champ?
Good luck. "

Posing boxers for photographers and manager Lomačenka Egis Klima adds that the potential duel of boxers would be a "perfect test".
"I'm a former champion in spring weight," says Garcia.
"Because of the struggle with Bronerem (67 kg) I had to put in, but I'm not that big.
I'm small on my 63 kg.
I'd like to go back to the light weight category.
Lomačenko has to be put to the light... then we can fight.
After that, fans crave.
Why not meet them? "
Lomačenko agrees.
"Boxing would benefit this match."
The climates made a request to pay for views-which is part of its strategy. Lomačenko should have graduated his debut in a light weight at the end of this year and next year he competed with Garciou (37-0, 30 knockouts), who also expressed interest in wrestling against the winner of Jorge Linares vs. Luke Campbell, who will compete on 23.

Garcia said his goal was to show strength and then the box.
The two boxers said they felt a rising tension before the duel.
"You won't forget this game.

And I will put a great deal on the fire, "said Garcia.
Lomačenko said: "I waited for the best boxers and this is Mikey."
It's gonna be a great match. "
The young couple, 12 years ago, disappeared without a trace.
Their car was now found at the bottom of Volga.
The pair of young Russians Ilya Žirnov and Kira Čerkasovová were Pohřešována from December 2005.
Started a sweeping search, but without success.
And the police finally ended the investigation for lack of evidence.
The families of the lost couple lived in uncertainty that they would not know what had happened to the couple.
After 12 years, a sad ending of the whole story came.
The wreck of their automobile was found by a lay diver at the bottom of the Volga River in Cheboksary, Čuvašsku.
Thanks to the documents that remained in the car, the police managed to identify the couple.
The documents survived a decade underwater, without them the police would take much longer to identify the identities found.
The couple was last spotted when Žirnov had borrowed a car from his father to pick up his girlfriend from work.
The diver who discovered the car has yet to remain anonymous.
He reported his discovery to the Čeboksarské police, who took the car to the beach the following day.
Investigators believe that the death of a young couple was the accident caused by the icy road leading around the river.
The investigation shall, however, continue to be published after completion of further details.
Latest test results to determine the age limit of asylum applications in Sweden
The latest test results of asylum seekers in Sweden who have undergone a new method of assessing their age show that over 80 percent of people have been surveyed as being over 18 years old, but not everyone believes their accuracy.
The Swedish Forensic Medical Agency (RÃ ¤ Ttsmedicinalverket) started to perform new tests at the beginning of this year.
The objective of the method is to assess the applicants more precisely in the framework of the evaluation of asylum applications. The measure was accessed after the Swedish Migration Agency (Migrationsverket) was criticised for failing to determine the correct age of some refugees who were lying about their age.
To date, the Swedish Migration Agency has forwarded 6880 cases to the investigation and the forensics agency has now published a total of 2481 tests carried out from mid-March to 31 December 2005. July 2017.
80 percent (2002) was considered to be at least 18 years old, while in a further 25 cases the forensic medical Agency considered that it was "perhaps 18 years or older".
In a further 423 cases, it was decided that the interviewee is "possibly under 18 years of age".
The tests are only accessed if the age of the interviewee is disputed.
According to Johan GÃ ¶ Ranssona of forensic medical agency results correspond with the previous month.
"As opposed to last month, statistics are held in a well-stocked dormitory, and the numbers are very similar," he said for the Local.
A higher number of applicants, whose age has been estimated to be over 18, does not necessarily mean that asylum seekers are lying about their age.
In May, the agency published the results of 581 tests and stated that in 442 cases it was found that "the questioned person is 18 years or older".
Newspapers Svenska Dagbladet investigated 581 published cases and found that in 243 cases the respondents said they would have 18 years of this year.
Critics also received a medical method of determining the age, which includes x-rays of wisdom teeth and an MRI scan of knee joints, which are then judged by dentists and rentgenologovés.
One of the skeptics is Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute, who, among other things, deals with judging the biological maturity of people to determine the age at which a teenager passed.
"I had reason to think about this issue and I don't think these types of measurements to assess age are correct.
The assessment of the biological age is, in a sense, very doubtful.
If we cannot determine the age with precision, we should not pretend otherwise, "he said for the Metro newspaper.
The Forensic Medical Agency agency's GÃ ¶ Ransson defended the decision by saying: "Generally speaking, the risk of an incorrect assessment of a child as an adult is small.
The highest risk is the fact that the questioned person is just below the 18-year threshold, which in this case corresponds to 10% of all respondents. "
Trump threatened the phone with the President of Mexico.
In a January call to Mexican President Enrique Peňovi Nietovi, US President Donald Trump threatened not to meet him if he publicly said that his country would not pay for the construction of a wall between the US and Mexico.
Trump in the interview said that funding will somehow arrange it, even if admitted that it will have to be secured from other sources.
Likewise, Trump has spoken openly with Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbullem.
It results from transcripts of interviews published by the American newspaper the Washington Post on Thursday.
Trump made the construction of the wall on the southern border for Mexican money by one of the main promises in his last year's election campaign.
In the first interview with the Mexican president shortly after embarking on the position of Trump Peňu, Nieta undiplomatically chastised to build critically for his plan to build the wall.
He portrayed the southern neighbor as a growing political problem and pushed the Mexican president to publicly say that his government would never pay for the wall.
"You can't say this to the press," Trump said repeatedly in an interview from 27. January and threatened to interrupt contacts with the Mexican president if he continues to issue a defiant statement.
The funding is supposed to come out, and it will end well.
"But if you say that Mexico will not pay for the wall, then I do not want to be with you gentlemen, because it is unacceptable to me," he said according to the American newspaper Trump.
The wall called it the least important thing we're talking about, but politically it's probably the most important.
The executive order to build the Trump wall was released shortly after the takeover of power.
Mexico rejects the construction and financing of a wall of 3200 kilometers, vyhrotily the relationship between the two countries.
At the end of March, Trump said the project will still pay the United States.
Trump finally met his Mexican counterpart for the first time at the July G20 summit in Hamburg.
The Washington Post also reported on the Trump phone interview with Australian Prime Minister Turnbullem of 28. January.
The head of the White House described the conversation as ridiculous.
To that end, it made him an exchange of views on the agreement that Australia would grant asylum to středoamerickým refugees in exchange for the United States to accept persons from internment facilities in the Pacific island States.
Trump thought he was a silly deal at first, but later he went on.
"I'm sure you can say that this is not the deal you created, but you'll have to stick to it," said Trump Turnbull.
In some passages, the telephone conversation with Turnbullem was almost jovial, for example when Trump appreciated as a good idea Australian refusal to accept refugees arriving in boats.
"You're worse than me," Trump joked.
But suddenly the tone of the conversation vyostřil.
"I hate accepting these people," Trump said.
I assure you they are bad.
That's why they're in jail now.
"They won't be great people to work for the local milkman," he said.
In an interview, he also noted that a fugitive could be a Boston assassin in five years.
Trump led at the end of January, roughly a week after coming to the White House, telephone interviews with a number of world statesmen, often several in one day.
The conversation with Turnbullem finally marked the least pleasant for the whole day.
Before he had finished, he emphasized that he had had a pleasant conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Before the crowd they executed the murderer getting infected.
Her father watched.
The execution took place on the square in the capital of Yemen Saná'í.
Muhammad al-Maghrabi chose the little Rana Almatari, who lived in his neighborhood, for his sacrifice.
Al Maghrabi kidnapped the girl, took him to the House of her father, where he raped her with his bare hands strangled.
He then raped her body, which he then threw near the mosque.
The violent death of a small girl hit the whole country that faces the threat of civil war.
Yahya Almatari stood in the first place by the tisícihlavého crowd, who met to witness execution.
Muhammad Al Maghrabi was condemned under the law of Sharia.
The victim's father, after execution, told the media his feelings.
I feel reborn.
I'm relieved.
It's a new day of my life.
Other members of the family were present, together with Dave shouting the motto "Long Live Justice".
The rapist on the square brought the police van from which he was dragged.
The policemen tied him down on his belly.
One of the members turned his weapon against him and opened fire from the immediate vicinity.
The present crowd glorified every blow that had been burned.
Mr. Al Almatari told the site MailOnline that justice was enforced in accordance with the legal system of the country.
"Justice, Aláh and the law of Sharia triumphed," he added.
I stood at the Liberation square of the sled and waited for the execution of my daughter's murderer.
Then we went to the morgue with the family.
We took Ranino little body and buried him in a nearby cemetery.
Me and my wife Jamileh we are grateful that justice has been done.
The police feared that the crowd collecteding in the square would flop hateful Madness, and the assassin would grab and zlynčuje.
The execution was ordered by a court which is under the administration of Shia Hútíů.
Originally, Maghrabi was sentenced to 100 after the arrest, but his act aroused such outrage that the judge decided on the death penalty.
Al Maghrabi was arrested two days after the girl's disappearance of 27. June.
Ranina family knew him well.
When the police search the cellar of his house, he discovered evidence that the man had planned his deed.
Mr. Almatari described him as a creature.
What could have been his motive?
Even an animal would be more merciful.
"Our family has no enemies, and the wounds that bore the Ranino body were dreadful," he said to the media.
"Rana disappeared in the afternoon, we reported it to the police that day, we told the news and all our TV stations, the posters with her picture hung everywhere," he continued.
They all believe that the police got a tip from the assassins ' parents who suspected their son from the horror Act.
Girl's mother, Jamileh, had to be hospitalized after she had learned that her daughter's body had been found.
Rana used to play with other children from the neighborhood.
After 10-15 minutes I came out to see where she was.
We searched everywhere, but Rana was gone.
We walked past our block, our friends took cars and drove around, but we searched in vain.
The inhabitants of Yemen were a crime of disgust and began to gather before the police station where Al Maghrabi was held, and demand an immediate punishment.
A deputy of the Ministry of Justice read the present crowd a record of the investigation to calm them down.
The accused seemed to have no regret for his act.
Just before the execution of the sentence, the police had read the verdict, but the convicted man glanced at his executioner.
The whole event was filmed for national television, but on the internet appeared many records, which took the crowd.
Governor of West Virginia announces change of political party
Democratic governor of West Virginia told them Justice on Thursday night to the meeting of President Trump, that he was going to another party.
"Whether you like it or not, the Democrats have turned their backs on me," the governor of Justice said.
"Today, after a long prayer and a announce... today, as a resident of West Virginia, I am telling you that I can no longer support you from the position of a Democratic governor."
The crowd of bystanders burst into joy.
"I'll join the Republicans tomorrow," said the Justice.
"As a coach, I can tell you it's time to jump into another match."
Trump has previously promised people at a congregation in West Virginia an important announcement.
Trump won in West Virginia with 42 points and the judiciary did not support Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
The judiciary, which, according to Forbes magazine, is the only billionaire throughout the country, was elected in 2016.
Forbes adds that the Justice has inherited great assets from his father and is the owner of several coal mines.
The value of his property is estimated at 1.59 billion.
Meanwhile, the Republican National Committee issued a statement on Thursday evening, in which it was said: "The governor of the judiciary is another blow to the Democratic Party that puts us in the way, rather than to make up for the uplift of our country."
"For the Democratic Party, which has only 15 governors and controls the least legislative bodies in history, the announcement of the governor of Justice is the last straw for an already Zbědovanou party without a leader who seeks to find a positive and unifying Report, "said President RNC Ronna McDanielová, in a statement for CBS News.
Sebastian Coe praises the "sincere" apology to Russia for the doping scandal
Former outstanding athlete Sebastian Coe commended Russia on Thursday for a sincere apology for the doping scandal, but again repeated that it has not yet been the right time to return Russia to the sports world.
The head of the Russian athletics Dmitry Shylakhtin said at the occasion of the Congress IAAF-which took place on the eve of the world Championships in Athletics-that the expulsion of his country from the world of sport was correct and that he was determined to fight doping.
He apologized to "all the athletes who lost gold and silver medals in this way."
Despite his comments, members of the Congress of IAAF voted to maintain the ban, which came into effect in November 2015, after the report of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) revealed that Russia encouraged doping from its athletes.
"I think today we have witnessed very sincere answers and presentations," said reporters president IAAF Sebastian Coe.
"All members of the Council and Congress were pleasantly surprised that Russia admitted its mistake and is working hard to correct and restore the proper functioning of the entire federation."
Coe said that he was also "pleased" that Russia had adopted criteria for his reintrodukci.
"I think that today was a very successful day and we advanced to the next stage, but Congress supports the crisis staff recommendation to maintain the punishment that has been thrown on Russia," added Coe.
"We must do everything in the coming months to stabilize the situation.
Our effort was always to separate honest athletes from those dishonest, "he finished his speech.
At the World championships in Athletics, which starts on Friday in London, will be under the neutral flag to compete 19 Russian athletes who met the strict rules of IAAF.
The chief of the crisis staff IAAF Rune Andersen said on Monday that Russia still needs to meet several criteria before it is accepted back.
Drug tests are still inadequate and exclusion trainers continue to operate, he told reporters in London after the end of the IAAF Council presentation.
The state order CzechTrade was acquired by František Savova, whose state prosecutes.
The public contract of the State export agency CzechTrade received the publishing of the young front of František Savova.
The officials gave him a hundred percent points in all the qualitative criteria.
They did not mind that the Czech state prosecutes Savova for tax fraud and requested its release to the Czech Republic.
The export agency of the Ministry of Industry and Trade CzechTrade announced in April a public contract for four years providing editorial content for the portal BusinessInfo.
The contract of a total value of CZK 30.8 million was awarded by the young front of entrepreneur František Savova.
In the year 2014, the Czech police accused him of tax evasion and prosecutes him on the run.
Savov fled to Great Britain and the Czech Republic asks for its release.
On the case, the Aktuálně.cz server warned.
According to the original criteria, the award of the contract was CzechTrade to decide from 60 percent of the offered price and from the remaining 40 beauty contest, the quality of the project.
While the second criterion was greatly helped by the Savovově company.
According to information, Dotyk.cz received a hundred points in all quality sub-criteria.
This was the result of the next candidate, publishing by Vltava Labe Media VLM, which offered a better price.
While the young front operated with an amount of 404 900 crowns a month, VLM offered 324 350 CZK.
However, unlike the young front, the tasters in all qualitative criteria received a Subaverage rating of a total of 62 points.
The tender was also attended by the consulting firm BDO Advisory Company and digital agency R-Media, which is the same as the server Aktuálně.cz under the publishing house Economia.
A number of objections were lodged against the outcome of the tender by the VLM publishers, with its assessment being considered Nza unfair and insufficiently substantiated.
After their refusal, they decided to contest the competition at the Office for the Protection of competition ÚOHS.
He believes that CzechTrade has proceeded in violation of the law.
' The applicant is satisfied that the contracting authority has reached a decision on the choice of a contracting contractor on the basis of purely subjective evaluations, clearly favorizujícího a participant of young front, A.S., at the expense of the claimant and other suppliers, ' says the proposal for Initiating the procedure filed at ÚOHS this week, which published the server currently.
According to the CEO and Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Klíma, the selection board scoring appears to be an unreliable and 100% evaluation of the project of the young Front for all its members as being extremely suspicious.
"Any independent observer must consider such miraculous success of one competitor as unlikely and suspicious," he said for the current Klíma.
CzechTrade has not yet commented on the situation.
The agency CzechTrade not, in principle, comment on public contracts before they are closed.
All information about the contract you have mentioned is in accordance with the law published in the sponsor's profile and in the public Procurement Bulletin.
"After the end of the contract a complete written report will be published, but we cannot express it during the duration of the contract," said the agency's Dotyk.cz media representative Štěpán long.
The young front responded with a statement that it considered it extremely problematic that the Economia publishing had affected the article in Aktuálně.cz to the competition where it had its own commercial interests.
However, that fact was mentioned in that article.
She was able to help her in the tender that she provided the portal BusinessInfo editorial services in the previous four years.
The order first competed in the year 2013, when the Ministry of Industry and Trade led Marti Cuba ODS.
František Savova blames the police on tax evasion in connection with excessive VAT deductions by its companies, which caused the Czech state alleged damage of up to 770 million crowns.
The Czech Republic has been asking Great Britain for its release since 2014.
According to Savova, it is worth his criminalisation head of the movement Yes Andrei Babiš, under whose influence the publishing house Mafra.
The London court dismissed the Savovovo last year, but the entrepreneur appealed.
"From our point of view, the case from last year did not go anywhere, from the United Kingdom we have not received any notice in the matter of obtaining the legal power of the judgment," said the Aktuálně.cz spokesman for the Prague city prosecutor Štěpán Zenklová.
In addition to the ownership of the young front, Savov was in the company Harvestor Limited, based in Cyprus, which dominated the České Budějovice brewery Samson, and in the Cypriot company Maraflex, which is profiled as an investment fund, the purchasing of endangered assets.
The failed company of Heavy Machinery Services, formerly Legios, which owes more than CZK 3 billion, should also be operated.
In the past, Savov was associated with the introduction of property from the former Socialist Union of Youth.
Biker bowled sidewalks and park, finished in somersaults.
The biker attracted attention by reckless driving on the streets, sidewalks and park paths in Úšovicích.
When the patrol began to chase him, he decided to ride it in the direction of the habitat.
"The police had been chased by a man with caution by the city, when he could not manage the steering on one of the side trips behind the Mariánské Lázně Bath and drove his motorcycle to the field where he crashed," said police spokesman Daniel Dvořák.
The accident eventually had to fly the rescue helicopter, which transported the injured biker to the Pilsen hospital.
Finally, police officers found that a biker's own driver's license, license plates on the motorcycle were stolen, its serial number cut and the production label itself removed.
It is so possible that the machine was stolen.
The origin of the motorcycle is subject to further investigation.
"The breath test was carried out at the site of the presence of alcohol, but a positive result on the substance methamphetamine was detected by the test," the police spokesman added.
How the financial rules of football will affect the transfer of Neymar to Paris
The rules restricting the funding of European football clubs do not disturb the Neymarův record transfer from Barcelona to Paris-Saint Germain, France.
Any penalization for Paris Saint-Germain will be realized by the EUFA organization, which oversees the European football teams and has the power to ban teams from participating in the prestigious Champions League.
The rules of Financial Fair Play (FFP), which introduced UEFA in 2011, stipulate that PSG will have to demonstrate that Neymarův transfer was not financed without major losses.
Barcelona paid 222 million euros only to redeem Neymar from its contract, and Neymar would demand a salary of tens of millions of dollars a year.
The following are several financial conditions Neymarova transfer to France.
As the team of PSG is funded by a rich Qatar family that Zbohatla to sell energy, it can afford to bring Neymar to an already stellar football family.
Clubs can spend a huge amount of money to buy players, but on the other hand they have to prove the legal sources of income, which allows them to cover the overhead costs of football-related business activities.
FFP was introduced by Michel Platina after being added to the chair of the director of the UEFA in the year 2007.
A former French player believed that clubs that would owe themselves in pursuit of new reinforcements would ultimately cheat and risk bankruptcy if the banks or owners refuse to secure them.
In 2011, the FFP rules rerouted their attention from club debts to monitoring their losses.
This change meant that the business model that was used by Roman Abramovich with Chelsea in 2003-Buy a club with potential and spent exorbitant sums for the player Y to build a global brand-suddenly was not so advantageous.
Within the current three-year trial period, which will expire in 2018, clubs can report a loss of up to EUR 30 million.
And despite the fact that Platinum had to leave his post in 2015, his successor, Aleksander Čeferin, was determined to advocate a ban on excessive spending.
"The FFP rules still apply and we are committed to reinforcing them in the future," said last week for the Associated Press Andrea Traverse, which oversees compliance with the FFP rules.
Although PSG pay the amount for redemption of Neymar in a lump sum payment, it may spread the amount to the entire duration of the contract for accounting purposes.
Neymar signed a five-year contract, so that the transfer can be broken down to EUR 44.4 million annually for five years.
The first wave of top-level FFP penalties hit the 2014 PSG together with Manchester City, which is owned by the Abu Dhabi group.
PSG took a fine of 60 million (82 million)-which was later reduced to €20 million-and an order to reduce the Champions League team to 21 players in the 2014-2015 season, instead of 25 players.
UEFA is looking out for teams that can try to circumvent the financial regulators raising their income through companies associated with club owners.
While, therefore, the Qatar company sponsors PSG as soon as financing exceeds the value of the standard market rate, UEFA has the right to prohibit the settlement of the amount.
A similar measure was approached by UEFA in 2014 after deciding that the amount of funds provided by the Qatar Tourism Authority to the PSG team was too high.
Some of the Neymarových revenues in PSG could be reimbursed by some reports from the organisational commission of the MS football 2022 in Qatar.
However, PSG and Ms 2022 in Qatar have denied fat that Neymat should become an ambassador to the FIFA World Cup, and that such a maneuver would easily be revealed by UEFY officials.
Previous sanctions thrown on PSG mean that UEFA will closely follow any attempt to circumvent the rules,
According to Tuesday's expressed by the insiders of UEFA did not commence in the case of the transfer Neymar to PSG no investigation.
The source of this report wished to remain anonymous, as it is not entitled to comment on PSG, the Associated Press said.
The latest published accounts show that PSG has closed the year 2015-2016 with a net profit of €10 million and a turnover of EUR 542.4 million.
The financial statements for the current financial year have not been published yet.
PSG expects the arrival of Neymar to be a huge opportunity for sponsors, merchandising and selling jerseys.
The club promises to increase its turnover by up to 30 percent from the signing of the contract.
Officials of the Spanish league, apparently concerned with the departure of one of the greatest stars, sought to thwart the Neymarova leaving, argumentujíc that PSG would violate the FFP rules.
"It's a clear case of ' financial doping ' to the club and state," said the president of La Liga Javier Teba for the Spanish newspaper AS, referring to the ownership of the club PSG rial Syndicate.
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, whose club owns an American sports tycoon, shares the same stance of the La Liga's funding club.
"It's the result of ownership that has changed the football world from the ground up in the last 15 years," Wenger had to hear on Thursday.
"Once the club owner becomes a state, everything is possible.
Adhering to the rules of Financial fair play is very difficult, because the state can have different interests on the participation of such players in their club. "
Spartan midfielder Rosicky: changes are painful, but we must believe.
Sixteen thousand aplaudujících fans on their feet.
Tomas Rosicky goes to the floor.
The same scene as the Sunday game against Bohemians.
The Spartan midfielder Rozhýbal against Crvené Zvezdě game, invented several gólovek, but his teammates did not aim for the black.
The Letenský team Napumpovaný the new Multimilionovými reinforcements after the opening dvojzápase in the European Cups ends.
Was it hard to do anything else to do after Belgrade's gate?
After Inkasovaném goal, four score were needed, which was difficult for us.
We wanted at least neprohrát, to pick up our self-esteem so that we should bounce to the next fights.
We had some chance.
We have to work together as a team and move our game.
Why didn't Sparta get into the game so long?
The game is terribly upracovaná.
The combination of opponents were much better than ours.
We didn't get a good one, and in half we shot once.
This is, of course, very little when you have to win by two or three goals.
The second half was much better, in the final third we managed to play with them.
But you have to push your opponent more often into such positions.
Is the problem a large number of changes to the report?
Of course, it's one of the pains when a new team is formed.
We played only three matches and the lineup is still changing.
It's about the coach finding the perfect eleven who sits down.
Is it an incentive for you to have already played part of two games in a row?
It's still part of the game.
I do not know how my condition will develop and when I could play at last from the beginning.
Are you still optimistic about the changes you made in Sparta occurred?
We have to be, or we can't.
It's the same as an injury.
If you don't believe, you can't go back.
Sparta has somehow decided, we have to be optimistic, otherwise the situation will be even worse.
Fans again came in large numbers, but they walked away in embarrassment.
What can you tell them?
There was once again an amazing visit, as well as with a boheme.
I'm terribly sorry we can't make them happy with better performance.
Show off something for what they come up with next.
We can thank them for having arrived.
I don't remember such visits when I played here fifteen years ago.
Can the season without cups at least have an advantage for the league?
So far we are fighting with ourselves, we are playing, so this is not an advantage for us.
For the extreme tax evasion, the entrepreneur has to sit for ten years.
The Constitutional Court dismissed the complaint by entrepreneur Jiří Tomana, who, for its tax evasion, odpykated a significant amount of ten years in prison.
The amount of damage is CZK 645 million.
In the complaint, the latter argued that the judiciary had infringed its fundamental rights, the factual findings of the courts in Zlín and Olomouc were said to be incomplete.
The constitutional judges, however, marked the complaint as unfounded, found ČTK from the database of the court.
TC is not another court of appeal.
"It cannot, as a fourth instance, assess the factual or legal misconduct allegedly committed by the general courts, if they do not constitute a violation of constitutionally protected rights and freedoms," it stands in a resolution.
He was tried as a fugitive.
The verdict was final since November 2015, when it was confirmed by the High Court in Olomouc.
At that time, he was in expended custody in Argentina, where, according to the resolution, he was in the TC decision-making.
The penalty imposed is on the upper limit of the statutory rate, which, according to the verdict, corresponds to the damage suffered.
The High Court described the case as an extreme tax evasion that has a macroeconomic impact on the state budget.
The man worked from 2005 to 2008 as Chairman of the Board of Directors of World service.
Škoda 645 million was created only for the period from January to July 2008, the total escape by connoisseur exceeded a billion.
For procedural reasons, however, it was no longer possible to judge Tomana for the whole amount.
According to the indictment, World service did not include any invoices in its tax returns.
Instead of monthly VAT and excise duties in the amount of at least tens of millions of crowns, taxes were paid in only statisících.
World service and some companies with which the company traded, have a relationship with the entrepreneur Radomíru chose, which the judiciary measured for the machining of VAT in fuel stores 13 years imprisonment.
His complaint was also rejected by the Constitutional Court before the time.
"Summer for Survival" and "Comrade Detective" play a nostalgic string
This iteration of the story is nostalgic for both the characters of the famous 80. Years; For Dirty 90. For years (when geniuses David Wain and Michael Showalter introduced to MTV comedy sketch "The State"); And of course for the modern time, namely the year 2001, before the stars like Elizabeth banks, Amy Poehlerová and Paul Rudd fled to larger projects.
As a cultural artifact, it is a light parody and also embodies our modern facebookovské era of permanent memories.
From the perspective of franchises, it seems that someone is running out of breath.
The "First Day of Camp" series worked surprisingly well-not only because of absurd humor (an example might be the story of the formation of talking cans with vegetables, which was spoken by H. Jon Benjamin).
The authors deviated from the main funny point-middle-aged actors who play teenagers who are randy children-and they could not be so teased from previous events.
The sequel to "Ten Years Later" in which adults play adults does not push so much on the emotional plain and satire is places up sporadic, including a parody of thrillers from 90. Years as a "hand in the Cradle".
At one time the figure finds on a pile of Apple powerbooks, roller skates and "lots of other things from the year 1991".
Many of the main story lines are repeated.
Hearted Coop (Mr. Showalter), now a writer, is still not transferred through his love for Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) is still a virgin.
Not to mention the crazy plot that includes Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter), whose instigates George H. W. Bush (very well occupied by Michael Ian Black).
As always, many side stories are the best part of franchises.
Especially amusing is to follow the eternally young rudda with long hair alias The character of Matt Dillon from the movie of Youth, whose once respektuhodná figure Andy is now behind the old paprika.
Frančízu could start the moments of random madness, such as Navrátivší with a series of "Seven Up" until it reaches what I presume will be logical by the Magic: "Wet hot American Summer: Twenty years Later," when in the last scene the whole group embarks on "Years to survive".
"Comrade Detective" on Amazon meanwhile appeals to another type of nostalgia: The Revivalismus Cold War series "Such normal Americans," the film "Atomic Blonde: Without regret", and even the "GLOW" series, in which the icons of eastern and Western wrestling Scene.
Comedy filmmakers Brian Gatewooda and Alessandra Tanaka directed by Rhyse Thomas to act as a television production: a drama on two bukurešťských police officers from Romania 80. The years of the last century who struggle for truth and atheism after the way of Marxism-Leninismism.
The main role-tenacious Gregor and Idealistického Iosefa-starring Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Street, which were dubbed the English language Channing Tatum (executive producer of the series) and Joseph Gordon-levitate.
It's an amazing idea.
Unfortunately, it's not much more than that.
For some jokes you will laugh (like policemen watching chess on TV-a parody of American football).
The series bestowed its voices on many well-known actors-among them Jenny slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny.
But the "Comrade Detective" focuses too much on the inept propaganda drama--which includes a killer with Reagan--and, accordingly, it looks.
Six long episodes are too wordy and comedial moments are not enough.
With shorter footage, the propaganda satire in "Comrade Detective" could work, such as In the scene, when Gregor and Iosef repeatedly visit the U.S. Embassy, in whose hall two chubs hltají burgers stacked in a large pile.
A clear message to an imaginary communist audience is the fact that Western culture can turn everything into food and.
Smyšlení Romanian creators were wrong: we do so with our own culture as well as with theirs.
Russian athletes have abolished the ban on starting from IAAF Nedočkali.
The International Athletics Federation IAAF at the London Congress confirmed the extension of the international ban on the launch of Russian racers due to the state-sponsored doping program.
The vote in the Theatres World Championship, which starts on Friday, turned out as expected very clearly.
For the extension of the ban held 166 delegates, against was only 21 votes.
The main reason for rejection is the fact that Russia fails to meet all the requirements for the introduction of the anti-doping system, as the head of the special investigative group IAAF Rune Andersen stated before Congress.
His group recommended that the ban be continued.
Some older doping cases remain unresolved, a number of suspected athletes have not yet been heard, and in the country are still working trainers with redress legends.
The Russian anti-Doping agency RUSADA, which does not meet the standards of the World Anti-Doping Agency, is not yet fully operational.
However, RUSADA can already carry out testing under the supervision of foreign experts and the British Anti-Doping Agency.
"Even though progress has been made, there is still a lot of work to be done," said IAAF chairman Sebastian Coe.
The Russian athletic Federation was suspendovánaed in November 2015, Russian athletes thus came out of the last year's Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
Despite the ban, the forthcoming MS will participate in 19 Russians who previously proved that they had been tested for a long time outside the Russian anti-doping system.
But they will not be able to start the championship in national colours and they won't play the Russian anthem in the event of victory.
The Bank of England holds the interest rate at 0.25%
The Bank of England, as expected, should announce that the interest rate will remain unchanged, followinging lackluster economic growth and weakening inflation, which has stifled speculation about rapid growth.
The Bank of England warned that economic growth would remain "in the background" in the context of maintaining interest rates--despite the squeezing of family budgets.
The political leaders of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the Bank of England voted six to two to maintain the interest rate at 0.25%. The results of the vote for the increase in the interest rate boosted the lackluster economic growth supported by the weak increase.
In its annual inflation report, the bank predicted growth to 1.7% in 2017 and 1.6% in 2018, and warned that family budget reductions would continue. The bank expects inflation to rise to 3% in autumn.
At the same time, the bank indicated that, over the next few years, growth would be due to inflation caused by Brexitem, and it also said that the rent from renting should rise more than expected on the financial markets.
Members of the Committee also voted for the withdrawal of part of the mammoth package, whose task was to support the economy and which was put into practice a year ago in response to Brexit.
As a result, the term financing plan, which will offer cheap subsidies to banks, should start on the next February, even though the Bank of England said it would now offer £ 15 billion less than the planned 115 billion.
Just before the decision, the bank said: "The MPC predicts that gross domestic product (GDP) will stagnate in the short term, with pressure on household real incomes and consumption burdens."
On the subject of rates, the bank said it would be necessary to "tighten money policy belts" to calm inflation, "to a greater extent" than the markets expect.
The markets are currently predicting the first growth in the third quarter of next year and a further increase in 2020.
However, the bank stressed that any increase would be "gradual" and "limited."
The bank reduced the growth forecast for this year and next year compared to 1.9% and 1.7% predicted in May.
The estimated growth of 1.8% in the year 2018 remained unchanged.
After the publication of the estimates, the pound fell against the dollar and the euro.
The pound fell by 0.5% to 1.31 dollars and by 0.4% to 1.11 euros.
The decision to maintain the current situation came after the zklamavší increase buried hopes for further growth--GDP stopped at 0.3% in the second quarter, compared to 0.2% of the previous three months.
The increase is likely to remain at 0.3% in the third quarter, although at the end of the year it should be slightly increased by the bank's observations.
The latest inflation report is a slight consolation to households hit by rising inflation and lousy salary increases. The bank said the situation would worsen before the increase.
The report further states that monetary policy "cannot prevent" the reduction of revenues in the coming years, but the wages are expected to "significantly" rise to the end of the three-year forecast.
Economics should also rise due to the great interest in British goods due to weak pound, which compensates for a lower percentage of consumer spending.
This decision came a year after the rate was reduced to 0.025% in August last year, in response to a shocking vote on the EU referendum, which caused the pound to fall.
The bank estimates that the full unification of prices and economy will last at least four years.
Before the bank's decision on the latest rates, many demanded a rise in rates, along with rising inflation, which exerted more and more pressure on households. Three policymakers demanded an increase of 0.5% in June.
Inflation last month fell back to 2.6% from June's 2.9%, even though the bank said it had expected such a change, and inflation should rise again over the next month.
The bank said that the crossing relative to the 2% target was "completely" due to the weak pound.
Andrew Montlake, director of Coreco Mortgage brokers, said: "Given the recent fall in swap rates, it seems that competition in the mortgage market will only soar once lenders start competing for contracts with a look at a good view towards the end of the year.
The market looks particularly good for those ending existing contracts and re-mortgages – the offer offers no fees, as well as the low rates that are gaining popularity. "
NHS prescribes controversial HIV medication to 10 000 patients
Patients receive from September access to the ' transformative ' treatment for HIV prevention based on the Supreme Court decision on the funding of the NHS.
The English National Health Service (NSH) announced that the pill pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), which is taken before sex and reduces the risk of infection in high-risk patients by up to 86 percent, will be offered through a health service of approximately 10 000 Patients within three years of the trial period.
NSH agreed to fund the probation period after the Court of Appeals supported the Supreme Court decision of last year with the statement that the NHS has financial means to pay PrEP despite a statement that the drug should be financed by local authorities.
The decision, which was announced on Thursday, was adopted by the NHS of England from the mouth of Simona Stevens's CEO as ' significant intervention ', while the National Aids Trust (NAT) decision described it as a ' decisive moment '.
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to begin receiving patients. Other clinics will join in October and until April 2018 a full implementation across England will take place.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a HIV medication administered before sex to reduce the risk of HIV disease.
Tests have shown that PrEP significantly reduces the risk of HIV transmission among patients at risk.
Pre-sex PrEP means that there is a sufficient amount of specific medication in the patient's body to prevent infection.
These medications can be taken every day or at least two hours before sex.
Among the patients tested are homosexual or bisexual men, transsexual people and people with HIV positive partners who are not treated successfully.
The clinics will identify eligible participants who sign their consent to participate in testing, including men, women, transsexuals and individuals with a partner whose HIV status is not yet controlled by the treatment.
People living and registered with GP in the UK can also sign up in their local sexual health clinic and apply for potential participation in testing.
The Program will come to the taxpayer at £10 million and the NHS England signed this week's contract to distribute drugs after obtaining an international public procurement.
The evaluation period is designed to gather clinical evidence and assess the full potential of PrEP, its targeting, use and implementation on a large scale.
Simon Stevens added: ' This important intervention should complement and fully factor the ever expanding and increasingly successful attempt to prevent HIV.
It is another milestone in more than thirty years of trying to stop one of the greatest challenges to human health. '
Deborah Gold, executive director of NAT (National Aids Trust) said: ' We are witnessing a decisive moment in the fight against HIV.
If PrEP is used properly and patients are at risk, it will offer a chance to transform an English HIV epidemic.
NSH will offer from September to patients who are at high risk of HIV infection a new powerful tool that is individually controlled and not subject to the necessity of persuading a partner, leading to an improvement in the quality of many lives.
We accept this statement with pleasure. '
Ian Green, Executive director Terrence Higgins Trust said: ' Number one priority must be rapid deployment of tests throughout the country; We must ensure its availability to any patient.
Now we have a trial drug PrEP and we are on track to protect more than 10 000 people who are at risk of HIV infection. '
The shadow Minister of Health Sharon Hodgsonová said: ' The beginning of PrEP's trial period is a welcome and long-awaited change after months of delay and delay by the government.
The evidence suggests how transformative can make this medication as part of our approach to HIV prevention and ending the transmission of this life-threatening infection.
Subsequent tests will lead us a step closer to fully understanding the PrEP benefits.
It is now important that we start the tests as soon as possible throughout the country to protect people who are exposed to HIV and thus end the spread of HIV in society. '
Life on the high leg: the mezzanine and clever design have transformed this little apartment into Earls Court in a spacious home
Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, exchanged a large house in Knightsbridge for a flat on Earls Cour in 2014.
Located on the first floor of the smart Terrace Queen Anne-A is an illustrative example of modern design, which uses the maximum available space.
"Before, I lived with my ex-husband in a much larger house in the Knightsbridge district," said Joanne.
"I've been looking for something more sensible price.
I stumbled upon this apartment in Earls Court and had the same height of the ceiling.
I fell in love with him, and I nodded to him the same day. "
Since then, the apartment has undergone a size of 1000 square meters complete renovation.
One bedroom apartment with a complicated layout-to get to the bedroom, you had to go through the kitchen-the Joanne wanted to add the storage spaces and the mezzanine to use the high ceiling.
"I longed for a high ceiling, large windows and lots of light.
These were my demands, "she said.
To this end, hired Erfana Azadiho from design and design studio, Duck & Shed, based in Notting Hill, and used an almost čtyřmetrový ceiling to create a home that was not just a project but also a place to live.
The ceiling did not reach such a height, so that two gaps could be climbed-the challenge for architects was to create a mezzanine on which to walk.
Erfan had to engage his creative thinking.
"The steel structure is quite complicated," he explained.
"We had to arrange both rooms so that we could walk upright.
It was not only to build a simple platform, but at the same time bend the steel structure so that at right height above and below the ceiling. "
This arrangement enabled Erfanovi to construct two full-fledged rooms on its own – and at the same time add to drama.
The mezzanine overlooks the magnificent living room of the old copper window frames in the design of Retrouvius.
The gold-coloured mirror, Silver Line, and Serge Mouille retro chandelier create a unique style.
The use of mirrors plays an important role in drama, Space and lighting.
The short corridor is equipped with mirrors on both sides and it looks so long.
The mirror bar in the kitchen looks like a window to another room.
Storage spaces with mirrors for storing cutlery and jars are located at the entrance door.
The advantage of the living room, which lends the impression of a significantly larger space, is the possibility of separating it from the kitchen, if not used.
Foldable kitchens are nothing new.
But what is unique about this solution is the folding door.
"We had to solve the technical side," Erfan speaks of the reinforced veneered doors.
"The door is equipped with a counterweight to odhrnovala very easily."
Thanks to the clever use of space and storage space Joanne has received another 16 square meters, second room and better overall layout of the apartment.
"When it comes to that, what you're selling is living space--the appreciation of your property," Erfan said.
"A real estate agent essentially when entering the apartment counts estimates its price on the basis of a residential area."
In this case, we managed to increase the living area while maintaining quality materials, which lend the space a luxurious appearance.
"The material is very important because you touch it and create an emotional bond with your home," added Erfan.
"You won't love the wiring in the walls.
Yes, they are important, but your heart will not gain. "
As it turned out, quality design and increased living space can transform an ordinary apartment into an exceptional work.
And like Joanne, you can finally decide to stay.
The United States is rozpojují.
The cultural and political divide between the blue and red states deepens.
California has declared a ban on the travel of its citizens to the state of Tennessee and other seven states.
The Tennessee state paided it and declared a retaliatory ban on the travel of its citizens to California.
Of course, this is not a full-term ban, US citizens can travel freely in all fifty states.
This is to say that California has banned state money for travel by its citizens to eight other states, such as Alabama, South Dakota, Kansas, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Texas.
Who's gonna stop this madness?
California is strongly for LGBT and any sign of disagreement with the LGBT lifestyle is considered to be discrimination.
However, Tennessee has enacted a law of conscience, according to which a psychotherapist who has a moral problem with the treatment of patients from the LGBT community is not obliged to provide it, but is obliged to provide those patients with another therapist who does not have such a problem.
Texas and other countries have enacted laws that allow religious charitable organizations that have received children from mothers after birth for adoption have no obligation to provide stejnopohlavním couples with these children for adoption.
Because of these laws, California's consciences have banned the financing of their citizens ' journeys to eight union states from their means.
In practice, this means that California professors are not allowed to travel to a scientific symposium in Texas, for example, from their universities, because they are co-financed by the State of California.
Similarly, school sports teams cannot travel to tournaments or competitions for example to Tennessee with financial support from their schools.
They must get either federal grants, but it is absurd for the federal government to finance the citizens ' journeys from state A to state B, or private sponsorship.
The state of Tennessee has received patience and its Parliament has adopted a law with a resolution that it also dislikes California's high-tax policy, high state spending, high deficits, and the tolerance of illegal immigrants, but still on California because of it's travel Embargo Neuvaluje.
Imposes is in retaliation for the California travel embargo on Tennessee.
(a) The same shall occur in respect of any other state of the Union which would have ordered a similar prohibition of travel for any reason whatsoever.
He also called on the parliaments of all states to stop this madness.
That's the facts, now a comment.
The situation is toxic.
First, all of this is constitutional, nothing is unconstitutional.
States have the right to adopt laws on a reservation of conscience, as well as to decide what their money will go on and what they are not allowed to do.
Secondly, what is wrong with a conscience?
If the butcher has a religious problem selling pork, why can't he just offer beef, lamb, poultry and fish?
Why do you force him to sell the pork under penalty when the butchers who offer pork are enough?
In the state of Colorado, one Baker faced an anti-discrimination lawsuit and a high fine, because he refused to bake the cake for a gay wedding.
But he refuses to bake cakes for Halloween or containing alcohol.
Why punish him and not leave them alone and do not order the appropriate cakes at hundreds of other bakers?
Third, the beauty of the federated system is that the constitutional rights of all citizens of the Federation are guaranteed, but individual states can adjust their internal, domestic policies to non-federal powers, i.e. by their own. According to the preferences of their inhabitants.
Then there are diversity, diversity, diversity.
California can be California and Texas can be Texas.
But California wants California to be California and Texas, and seven other states were California, too!
Fourth, members of the LGBT community once rightfully sought to tolerate their lifestyles.
Today, many members of this community are governed by the rule of live and let live, which should be managed by all sensible people, but some activists aspire not to tolerance towards themselves and others, but to extreme intolerance towards others.
According to them, no one should ever show moral, religious, or philosophical disagreements about LGBT lifestyles, and if they do, they should be Kriminalizován.
The mentality of these activists is totalitarian.
They are the modern enemies of liberty.
Fifth, I do not know the situation in American history, when States made such naschválys because of political issues, except in the case of one.
Even in the days of struggle for the civil rights of blacks, where the north and west were on the side of integration and the south on the side of segregation, the states neuvalovalyed the sanctions.
The only case was 50. Years 19. In the 20th century, the political mortified was slavery and time coming to the war of the North against the south.
Of course, there is no such thing now, but the situation is still toxic.
The cultural and political gap between the states of the blue Democratic and Republican red states is deepening, and the US is mentally rozpojujíed internally.
Unauthorised agitation.
The critic of Putin got a greasy fine.
Russian opposition politician Alexei Navalnyj got a fine of 300 thousand rubles for breaking the campaign rules before the presidential election, which will take place next year.
The court imposed a fine on him for calling people to participate in unauthorised demonstrations.
Navalnyj has orchestrated two major anti-governmental street protests over the past two months and announced that it wants to bid for the head of State in March next year.
The Kremlin's incumbent chief Vladimir Putin has not yet reported his candidacy, but is generally expected to do so and win again.
Navalnyj said police came to his house in the morning and took him to court.
He gave him a fine for calling people to demonstrations through videos placed on the YouTube Internet portal.
The fine is three hundred thousand.
"Later, charge is the judge's salary," he joked on Twitter to the Kremlin critic.
The Russian Electoral Commission recently concluded that Navalnyj was unable to participate in the presidential election because it was previously convicted of embezzlement.
But Navalnyj, who is considered to be a anti-corruption fighter, considers the judgment to be politically motivated.
Fines of 300 thousand rubles, or 25 thousand rubles, the court on Thursday also imposed two members of the general election team, Leonid Volkovovi and Nikolai Ljaskinovi.
Navalnyj joined Russia's policy as an anti-corruption blogger, and gradually became a dominant figure on the shattered opposition scene.
The authorities are trying to defend the general in the campaign.
In February he was sentenced to five years conditional punishment due to the fact that the robbed forestry company Kirovles.
In May the verdict was confirmed by the Court of Appeal.
The verdict is so final, which prevents the general under Russian law from running.
Brothers fighting for an empire worth over 500 million
Two brothers now, more than four decades after the foundation of the Empire by their Italian family, přetahují of one of the most expensive Victorian properties worth more than 500 million.
Former director of the Carlton Football Club and developer Colin De Lutis dwells in the dominion of Toorak, only three rooms from his younger brother Paul, who caught up with the controversy over common property and business property to the Supreme Court.
Paul wanted to leave the family business in the year 2014, but the sharp dispute is constantly propírán before the Supreme Court.
Together with his mother Anna, the brothers own a total of 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars. The first shop was bought by the family in 1973 at Smith Street in Collingwoodu.
At this point, the family founded the company Westco Jeans, which has grown into a chain with 160 stone shops.
In 1999, the family sold the entire company for 85 million.
For the money they bought another property and the portfolio of the family De Lutis now includes offices, building land in Brunswick and Sorrento, apartments on the Gold Coast and Mt Buller and commercial centers in the suburbs.
Paul owns about one-third of the company's assets, while his father, Colin, who is, according to Paul's words, "a significant driving force and dominant personality" of the De Lutis family, owns less than two-thirds of the assets.
The court papers reported that Colin owns a property worth 316 million, while Paul manages the property for 176 million.
The division of assets and funds has become a problem for Paula.
"The Colinův proposal sounded in my eyes greatly in his favor," Paul wrote in a certificate attesting statement in court in 2015.
Last Friday, after several failed attempts at conciliation, the first session of the Supreme Court held.
The brothers now compete also on who will control the existing business-from whom Paula, according to his expression, Colin cut.
Colin contradicts the fact that it is not true and accuses Paula of improper handling of some real estate.
In the previous certificate attesting statement, Colin said he believed in successful to resolve the conflict.
"My Italian origin dictates that the family is most important," he wrote.
The costs of court stalls are rising. Hundreds of pages of affirmations statements, e-mails and reports from companies including Deloitte, pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer are flooding lawyers, including Allan Myers, QC and defenders of both parties.
Ms. De Lutisová and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who ran milk bars and delicacies from 50. Years 20. century and in 70. They bought a shop in Brunswick in the years.
For the money gained by the establishment of property they bought a property in Collingwoodu, where Colin opened the first family business with jeans.
Colin said that when he was based Westco "in the last year of college, Paul was still a small, about 10letý boy."
Anna De Lutisová said that, along with Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped that the transfer of property to sons would take place after good.
"Luigi often used to say he never wanted his sons to end up in court," she wrote.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis family of companies. Colin said that Mark had been compensated with $10 million in his retirement and Luke was $26 million.
As Paul, Luke and Mark stated, "They were not satisfied with the terms of their financial compensation."
Colin has since held back, despite the fact that he is a former member of the board of Directors of AFL, as he stated in his autobiography of 2015, Eddie McGuire, a well-known television personality and best friend, Colin.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paula de Lutisovy and their lawyers on Friday.
Replied only Colin through a text message, in which he stated that, given the fact that the dispute was settled before the court, "I have nothing to say."
"It is very sad that my brother Paul decided to deal with the matter in court," he wrote.
In the middle of 2016 in one of the statements in the Court Colin stated that he tried to adapt to the requirements of his brother.
"Our father would be very dissatisfied if he could see our current situation," he said, adding to the fact that he was "still hoping for a successful solution."
On Friday, all hope was in sight.
"Our disputes will be solved in the early days of court hearing," wrote Colin.
The heat in the Czech Republic.
Teachers shower children.
Public transport drivers fasují water and summer clothes.
In kindergarten school in Prague 4, where there are now about 35 children, they walk out only in the morning.
The nursery is renovated and planted trees do not provide much shade yet.
There is no pool, but children's teachers shower in mlhovišti.
In the afternoon, the children remain in the classrooms, where blinds and curtains are pulled.
Air is trying to cool down the air purifier, because air-conditioners do not.
It is also challenging for teachers and cookbooks.
"The temperature, which is both indoors and outdoors, exceeds the hygiene limits for kindergartens, so in this period we should not even have open operations," said the director of kindergarten Miloslav Doug.
In kindergarten there is a glass corridor, where according to it the temperature is around 40 degrees.
Vyvětráme Morning after 6. Window is closed and we have blinds on the southern sides to protect.
"It doesn't help much," she added.
Better conditions are in the forest nursery on the dam in Hostivicích, where children spend most of the time outdoors.
We have grown trees on the land, so we're under them.
"We have a beautiful walnut, there's a table underneath, and we're doing different things," said the director of the nursery, Barbora Kompanová.
Teachers are trying to walk into the forest where the children are more cool.
Children wet Hats and on the program have different games with water.
"We have a manual pressure sprayer that is used to spray flowers, and we use it to shower children," said Kompanová.
Also the director of Nursery Kindergarten in the street Novoborská at the Prague Proseku Jitka Ameya said that the children of the teachers try to keep them in the shadows and sprinkles them with water.
"We have a fairly mature garden, so they're under the trees," she said.
He goes out in the morning and after 15. Hour.
Each child must have a headgear.
Teachers also remind children that they should drink.
They can choose, for example, low-sweetened tea or diluted juice and have a drinking fountains with water in the garden.
Every day they also have a vegetable salad and fresh fruit and vegetables that are sometimes brought to their parents.
"Maybe one of my mama's got a desetikilový melon for kids today," added Doug.
The drivers receive water or the summer uniform.
The Prague Transport company DPP provides them with water, ion drinks or summer uniforms on hot days.
The Cabs of tram and bus drivers are, in most cases, air-conditioned, said the spokesperson for DPP Aneta Řehková.
Air-conditioned are in addition to the cabs of some trams also in the passenger compartment.
The tram tracks of high temperatures have not been seriously damaged.
Minor damage occurred in a loop in Hostivař.
At current high temperatures, we take particular care to ensure that a sufficient amount of beverages is available to the driver.
"Chilled drinking water is available in all loops, střídacích points and vozovnách," said Řehková.
In Vozovnách and in some střídacích places, employees have at their disposal the so-called. Sodobary that produce chilled soda.
Drivers also receive soluble protective ion drinks.
"They can also use the summer uniform, which increases the comfort of drivers in their daily shifts," the spokesman added.
The hot and dry weather of the last days results in an increased number of fires.
On Tuesday, the firefighters in the Czech Republic Dispose 108, doubling the long-term daily average.
On Tuesday, during the day when the temperatures in the Czech Republic climb over 35 degrees Celsius, the fire brigade employeded mainly fire fighting.
"There are fires in the natural environment, as well as those associated with žňovými work," said the firefighter's spokesman Nicole.
The respite did not bring the evening change in the weather, when the heat in many places exchanged thunderstorms and torrential collisions.
In connection with the storm, firefighters went to 236 interventions.
This was particularly the removal of fallen trees and branches.
"The most encroaching in the Central Bohemia region," continues the oral.
The help of the fire brigade was also necessary in the Stvolínkách of Českolipsku, where, because of the storm, evacuated 60 people from the children's camp.
The tropical temperatures have also been reworked by Prague rescuers.
On Tuesday and night, ambulances rode out to the top ten cases of carbon monoxide poisoning from Karem.
So people should let their water heaters check, they warn the rescuers.
Carbon monoxide is a colourless, odourless gas which is released during imperfect combustion.
Symptoms of poisoning include nausea, vomiting, headache and feeling faint.
In case of suspicion of poisoning, the infested room must be abandoned.
Trumpův new chief of staff plans to limit president's media diet
Many of them tried before him, and they always failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.
If so, it will be the first.
The portal has said that the new chief of staff at the White House plans to limit the flow of information to President Trump, including reports on television news, hoping to keep Trump on the surface.
Here is part of the report of the reporter Josh Dawseye:
"When the new chief of the White House staff of John F. Kelly met the first day in a new job with the staff, he outlined the key problem of the Trumpova White House, which he intends to remedy: incorrect information that is being given to the president in his hands.
Kelly announced that he must personally approve all the information-whether on paper or the word of speech-because the president can make a better decision on the basis of the right information.
Kelly's diagnosis actually makes sense, but many of his predecessors have vylámala teeth on Trump's control and his presentation in the media.
The Trumpův relationship with the media dates back several decades — and now, when sitting in the White House, his habit of watching the television news is even more powerful.
"If the Trump was a candidate with an honorary coverage, it was convenient to show him that a lot of other media was talking about him in a positive light that was easier to persuade," said in February for the politician Sam Nunberg, a former campaign consultant.
Tara Palmeriová of the portal, politically, said that "the key to keeping Trump tweets at bay--at least in the words of the six former organizers of his campaign--is to ensure that Trump regularly observes the media that are raving about it."
Good.
However, the idea that the Trumpova tendency to publish their views on Twitter has ever been "under control" is ridiculous.
Perhaps these campaign organizers know something about what others have no idea-that Trumpovy tweets would be more outrageous if someone hadn't checked them out.
The tweets that Trump never sent are very likely to be never known.
If his employees managed to keep him at least a few times at bay, their efforts did not wasted.
But no one has ever been able to stop Trumpovy on a regular basis to stimulate controversial issues.
Part of this problem is that, in the White House, which consists of competing factions, people regularly try to strengthen their agenda by Trumpovying Podsunují Materials--which may or may not be reliable--that support their view of the world.
The policy portal, which covered the issue on all sides, published in May a report on the inclination of advisers to submit dubious information to the head of state.
This is an example of such information from pen reporter Shane Goldmacherové:
"The current and former Trump officials claim that the president often responds very angrilyly to the negative news from the media, especially the information disclosure reports, and seeks to find their origin.
This situation occurred at the end of February when someone gave the president a copy of the article from GotNews.com-the website of provocateur Charles C. Johnson-who accused the representative chief of staff Katie Walsh of being the ' source of many information leaks ' from the white House.
Regardless, Johnson was forever banned from Twitter for harassment; Or that his claim nepodložil no evidence; Or that he had already published false accusations in the past and later appealed.
Trump read the article and started asking Walsh. "
Goldmacher added that the then chief of staff Reiner Priebus and White House secretary Rob Porter "have tried to implement a system to manage and document the information that President Trump receives."
Would it work?
Kelly is now trying to enforce the same strategy three months later.
Perhaps it turns out to be a more effective manager than Priebus, but Trumpova impulsiveness is just not lost, and his helpers are still competing for power.
These unchanging factors of Kelly's mission certainly feel worse.
Tourists negotiate a ditch and return to ' Millionaire's quarter '
Several nejmovitějších owners of houses in the county of West Midland are again receding to the devoted tourists who negotiate with local authorities about the right to regain the field for their headquarters.
Tourists parked 20 caravans in the field by a thriving street in Solihull, which is dubbed ' The Millionaire's quarter '.
Bringing horses, children and the army of caravans, tourists return after they were reported in May. Nezalekli was not even a ditch that was duged by the regulations of the authorities in order to prevent their invasion.
The stroke group found gaps in defense and penetrated the field with the caravans unprotected by the gap that served the journey.
The rabid inhabitants of Solihull attacked the city's governing board with the fact that ' it is not able to solve the problem '.
One of the people who wished to remain anonymous said: ' They took the place on Monday night after they were moved to Bentley Heath, where they threw rocks at the other people.
The governing board should be ashamed of its failure to solve the problem.
All the tourists were moved to another place and now they have returned.
Last night the others arrived, and today it's going to be even more. '
She added that: ' The Birmingham Board of Trustees knows how to deal with this problem. It uses court orders to protect the parks.
I live on Streetsbrook and I continue to pay taxes until the board of directors settles with tourists. '
Another of the anonymous residents said: ' It's ridiculous. Just recently we were watching the last departing tourists and now they're back.
And this time there are more of them, and this time they brought their horses. '
The spokesperson of the city board of Solihull said: ' We are aware of an unlawful stay on land near Streetsbrook Road and, in cooperation with the local police, we take the necessary legal steps to successful the whole problem.
In order to gather as much evidence as possible, it is essential that as many local residents reported any nonsocial or illegal behaviour to the police on heading 101.
We will get the overall image we present in court. '

Two ambulances waited at the airport, and on board the aircraft was under constant control of Slovak doctors.
The long-planned flight went without complications.
According to the information TV JOJ, he Žitňanský a serious accident in Brussels in early summer.
He says he hit the car and he's in serious condition ever since.
He was transported to his homeland at a specialized workplace of one of the Bratislava hospitals.
The economic analyst is the husband of the Slovak MEP Jana Žitňanské by NOVA.
She didn't want to comment on the incident.
The couple has three children.
The Italians are in the fight against the rescue ships of NGOs with immigrants aboard
Italy has announced that it prevents NGO rescue ships arriveing to the coast of Italy with Mediterranean immigrants unless the NGO signs new rules regulating their operations.
"If NGOs do not sign new rules of conduct, it will be difficult for us to think that they could continue their operations," said the Interior Minister Marco Minniti in an interview with the Turin daily La Stampa.
Minnitiho warning came the day after the Italian authorities seized the ship of the German rescue organization Jugend Rettet because of suspicion of trafficking in human beings, which greatly facilitates illegal immigration.
The rescue organization, which works the first year, refused to comment on the matter because of allegations by the Italian prosecutor Ambrogia Cartosiose.
"For us is and always will be the number one priority of saving human lives. So we are very sorry that we cannot operate in rescue zones at this time, "the organization said in a social media statement.
"All the momentary accusations can only be commented after gathering all the information and evaluating the whole situation."
The Italian authorities followed the ship of the Iuventa organization Jugend Rettet from October.
Her crew is suspected of carrying yearlying immigrants on the ship, which were handed over by traffickers to people, repeatedly.
At least one of the meetings was allegedly only 1.3 miles from the coast of Libya, according to the applicant's file. The meeting progress has been published by Italian media.
The crew of the ship is suspected of breaking the law and skirting the Italian Coast Guard, which oversees rescue operations in this area-from humanitarian enthusiasm, rather than anything else.
The Code of Conduct establishes the presence of an Italian police officer aboard ships such as Iuventa to monitor activities.
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in rescue operations have yet agreed to adhere to the code: Save The Children, Maltese MOAS and Spanish Pro-Activa Open Arms.
On Thursday, the latter said that the new rules are not necessary, but acceptable, since they do not represent any "material change or obstacle" as far as rescue operations are concerned.
The adoption of a new code of conduct, for example, has rejected a Nobel laureate (MSF).
Meanwhile, Minniti has been told that the sharp decline of immigrants in recent weeks, go ashore in Italy as part of rescue operations, suggests that the effort to strengthen the patrols off the coast of Libya and the cooperation with local mayors bears fruit.
"In the last days we started to seen the light at the end of the tunnel," said the minister.
He also revealed plans for further negotiations, which will take place this month with the mayors of Libya on an economic development initiative, as well as with representatives of Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving these countries in hopes of reaching Europe.
Shameless Mesarošová: The playsuit has been made of silicone and cellulite.
The hot summer days are completely tempting to take on the most necessary thing to cover the most intimate parts.
Only Dominika Mesarošová is doing it on the contrary.
For an afternoon meeting at the Prague Zoo, where the actors, presenters, singers and all who have something to do with TV Prima, just there was, his body enveloped to the mini playsuit.
And only a few common movements and the model showed all their silicones, but also the buttocks.
As many times as she zařízled among the halves, she vykasaled so high that she had to keep adjusting it.
It certainly had no need for the attention of the Lords and the photographers present.
Michelle Carter condemned for sending text messages pobízejících to Conrad Roy's suicide
The woman of Massachusetts was sentenced to a two-year imprisonment for inciting her friend to commit suicide through text messages and phone calls.
Twenty years Michelle Carter will sit for 15 months from the two-year penalty behind bars and then spend five years in a Podmínečném release.
Carter was sentenced in June for the unintentional killing of Conrad Roy, who married his own life 13. July 2014.
Roy's father testified in court on Thursday: "The whole family is overwhelmed.
My son was my best friend. "
Carter was left to freedom until the decision.
She was threatened by up to 20 years of imprisonment, but her lawyers argued that she and Roy suffered from mental illness.
Dressed in red trousers and cream blouses, Carter stood in the announcement of the judgment on the spot with tears in his eyes, folded hands and eyes directed towarded to the ground.
"It killed Conrad Roy," the plaintiff said to the judge.
"She ended his life to Ulevila herself.
She failed to accept her own responsibility, "she said.
"No remorse."
But Carter's attorney said they were "unfortunate circumstances that he deeply regrets."
Judge Lawrence Moniz added that "her age or level of maturity or even mental disorder do not have a significant impact on her actions".
The applicant read the statement of Royovy mother Lynn Royové: "Neuběhne one day to netruchlila the loss of my son.
I want him to be proud of me-I care about his sisters and together we will endure the immense pain we will carry with us forever, "said the statement.
Roy's sister Camdyn Royová testified that she was "haunted" by the knowledge that she would never attend a brother wedding and never be an aunt of his children.
"The loss of a man I she from my birth is the pain he carry for life," she said.
The state of Massachusetts does not have a valid law to penalise a person helping to kill another person. That is why the case is based on legal precedent.
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found in 2014 on a car seat poisoned with carbon dioxide.
The case drew the attention of the entire nation after they were published text messages to Carter, which encourage suicide.
"Maybe hang, jump out of the building or strike, I don't care," she wrote in a text message that Carter sent only two weeks before his death when Roy was on a family vacation.
A few minutes before his suicide, he wrote, "You have to do Conrad" and "You just need to make a generator and you're free and happy".
Judge Moniz said that Carter yearned for attention through Royovy death and ordered to refrain from any comments in the press.
The case raised many questions.
One of the people who built on the Carter side was Amanda Knox, who was convicted of murdering her British roommate in Italy in 2007. Two years ago, the charges were acquitted.
Miss Knox (30) published a statement in the Los Angeles Times: "Michelle Carter deserves understanding and help, not jail."
Audi adjusts up to 850 000 diesel vehicles in response to a sharp response
Just prior to announcing the Audi automobile manufacturer, BMW said it would offer its customers a software update in more than 350 000 vehicles.
The president of BMW said the company believes that "there are more intelligent options than driving restrictions" in response to European cities – including Munich, which is the seat of BMW – which are considering banning or restricting diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it would adjust three million Mercedes cars across Europe to reduce diesel emissions.
None of the companies called this decision as a withdrawal.
European automobile manufacturers have widely promoted the use of diesel atuomobilůs in Europe and the United States to comply with the carbon dioxide regulation.
However, nitrogen oxide emitted by diesel engines is considered a carcinogen and can cause asthma.
At the same time, there is an increase in the cost of carmakers to install equipment to neutralize gas emitted by diesel engines, which makes it difficult to compete.
While German automobile manufacturers face careful exploration, Chancellor Angela Merkel is facing accusations of pamperinging powerful automobile companies and ignoring their problems.
The company tries to avoid Volkswagen errors, which, in an attempt to meet the emission limits, installed software in its vehicles that reduced the amount of emitted emissions during testing, but under normal conditions the software was deactivated.
Several senior Volkswagen representatives have been accused in the United States and others are being investigated on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former head of thermodynamics of the Audi engine Development department would be arrested in Germany.
Former manager Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio is of Italian nationality and does not apply to extradition, so he can face a lawsuit in the United States.
At the beginning of this year Audi joined the criminal investigation of the German police in the case of Volkswagen, after the authorities accused Audi of the installation of the system, which was supposed to circumvent the European emission limits-and thus expanded the allegations that Audi faces in the US.
The inclusion of an Audi car in an investigation can have an unfortunate impact on Volkswagen: Luxury car manufacturers make up a disproportionate share of Volkswagen's profits.
The plane crash landed on the beach.
The man and the little girl perished.
The accident occurred on the beach of Praia de São João in Costa da Caparica, about 30 kilometres south of Lisbon.
One of the witnesses of the TV channel SIC Noticias said that the plane before landing flew just above the people who opalovali on the beach.
Some people from the beach reportedly fled to sea danger.
Unfortunately, two people failed to escape from the machine.
On the beach, according to local media, 50letý man and eight little girl perished.
"The plane hit them and they were dead in the place," said the local police chief Pedro Coelho Dias.
Their nationality is not yet known.
There were two people aboard the plane, both of them escaped alive, and the cops took them for interrogation.
D11 or how not to build a motorway.
and are the motorways in the Czech Republic complete?
I'll give you a riddle.
It's a nedostavěné, even though it started to build in the year 1978.
Even if it's nedostavěné, it's always correct.
And it must not be built, even if it has a building permit.
What is it?
Yes, Hradecká motorway D11.
The construction of another part of its section, for at least a few months, has recently stopped the Earth Children movement.
We východočeši get a highway in pieces like cut salami.
Ukrojí the wheel and then see when and if we ever get another.
We don't want anything miraculous.
We just want to shorten the driving time and we want to get trucks going to Poland or from Poland from villages and cities.
Endless currents of truck go directly through the town of Jaroměř or Náchod, which is not as reasonable to go around.
But the last part of our dream Highway was still operational in 2008, an incredible nine years ago.
Since then, no knock.
Therefore, when the remaining four kilometres of the unfinished section to Hradec Králové began to build, and in other sections of the Jaroměř, the archaeological survey began with the fact that the building will begin at the end of this year, you could hear loudly in eastern Bohemia Banging špuntů.
No one ever believed it.
Last week it turned out that the build will not be this year.
And maybe next year.
Movement Children of Earth-Club for sustainable transport from Brno was decomposition.
The children of the Earth repeat their tactics from D1.
They have challenged the construction permit decision in its entirety.
In the decomposition, they require a review of all the binding opinions already issued by all the institutions concerned.
For example, the Hradec municipality, the Ministry of the Environment, but also the Ministry of Defence or the railway office.
So far, from D11 we run down near the village with an eloquent called Pohřebačka.
So, we run down, we're just going on the freeway and suddenly standing on a side road, and we prefer to join the column.
The worst thing is that you can see similar stories all over the country.
Scary, constantly clogged road to Benešov, motorway D1 or D8.
Everyone has their Pohřebačku.
What are the children of the Earth asking for?
What is the nature of the problems of construction of roads in the Czech Republic?
And why is it in the current system of the motorway network practically Nedokončitelná?

Lavender from Provence threatens climate change
Lavender has become a symbol of Provence in the southeastern region of France, but now they are threatened by climate change.
Lavender is shrinking as a result of dry climates and harmful insects, causing dismay on the faces of researchers and farmers seeking solutions.
Eric Chaisse, an expert at the CRIEPPAM Agricultural Research Institute in Provence, said: "The cultivation of lavender in Provence is at risk, because in the last few years this plant has been exposed to climate change, which brings with it less rainfall in spring and autumn.
This affects the life of lavender.
Cicadas and locusts carrying micro-bacteria, which thrive in dry climates, also have their guilt. "
There are many at stake.
Lavender attracts tourists and the oil produced by them is an important ingredient in perfumes and cosmetics.
Eric Chaisse said: "Instead of long and beautiful flowers grow smaller, undeveloped and often weak plants.
The amount of oil obtained from these lavenders is, of course, less. "
A possible solution can be more efficient distribution of water and a deceleration of the evaporation of water from the soil, as well as spraying lavender with a protective mixture of clay and water and breeding of several types resistant to dry weather.
The murder of a journalist emphasizes the growing threats in Mexico
Staff at Riodoce Weekly meet every Wednesday to discuss the news about the riots that take place in the Sinaloa area with the participation of organised criminals, corrupt officials, and persistent drug wars.
Today, however, the onslaught of recent events is largely missing because of its own safety.
Learn that it is important that they change their habits.
Two deserving journalists talk about what would be safer: taking their children with them to an office that someone attacked a grenade in 2009, or left them at home.
Safety experts wrote three simple words on the black Board: adversaries, neutrals and allies.
They ask journalists to put names on each word-no evidence is needed, just use imagination and foreboding.
Choosing them from – drug dealers, politicians, marketers and journalists are suspects of taking money from government or drug cartels – a catalog of criminals whose job is to cover up criminal acts.
The violence of the Neustává and the body pile up to a pile across the entire country; Journalists among them are continually increasing: according to the Committee for the Protection of journalists, there are at least 25 since the advent of President Enrique Pena Nieta to power in December 2012; 589 journalists are under federal protection after attacks and threats; And in all seven countries, seven were killed this year.
Among them also co-founder of periodical Riodioce, editor and inspiration for colleagues, Javier Valdez Cardenas.
"The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and work as a journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his many books on violence, which is linked to drug trafficking.
His loss is palpable, although his presence is pervasive-a great photograph of Valdeze with the inscription "Justice", on which he shows middle finger, hangs in the front of the building; Two journalists – Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez – age over 30, have a T-shirt with a photo of Valdeze with a smile on his face, goggles on his nose and cap Panama.
The meeting is held less than two months after his death; Journalists talk about reciprocal traumas, nocturnal nightmares, insomnia and paranoia.
Yet, in the year 2010, a special federal prosecutor's office was set up to address cases of journalists, so far, according to the Committee's opinion on the protection of journalists, the two suspects sued.
Most of the thousands of murders that occur every year are associated with drug trafficking and organised crime. Murder journalists are so very exceptionally getting to court.
Journalists from Riodoce insist that they will inform about the violence that is happening in Sinaloe; Even though the destruction of the grief and the given territory is currently very treacherous.
Without information about murderers and without the vision of justice, the security meeting is irrelevant, says Ibarra.
"It's foolish to waste time on such meetings," he adds.
"If we don't get more information, you can't trust anyone."
Morning of 15. May left Valdez headquarters Riodoce in Culiacánu, the capital of Sinaloy.
He managed to ride a few blocks when his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men who pulled him out of the car and usmrtili him 12 shots, presumably because of the title of the article-which can be translated as the Twelfth River.
The Gunners then stepped into his car and hacked him near the scene.
Valdez died at the age of 50 years.
He left behind a woman and two adult children.
The rumors seem to be spreading quickly in the Culiacanu.
In Valdezově case, however, there is a suspicious silence.
Since last year's arrest of Guzmána and his January release to the United States, Sinaloa has become one of the bloodiest battlefields countries, as the competing faction tries to fill the empty space.
Several people are killed every day in the streets of Sinaloi, and the cemetery is full of vyšperkovaných two-storey mausoleums for drug kings, many of which are larger than houses.
Forget for a moment that the word "truce" means that one drug cartel controls a coastal State with valuable ports and important routes to travel to the United States of drugs.
At the same time, as the fact that Valdez was intimately acquainted with the risks of his job, Ismail Bojorquez (60), co-founder and director of Riodoce, still obniňuje that he did not protect his friend.
He believes that two misconduct has contributed to his death.
The first was the February issue of an interview with Damaso Lopez, the leader of one of the competing drug cartels that led the war with the sons of Joaquín Guzmána.
The reconciliation could upset the sons; The suspect gang members Skoupili all copies of the newspaper at the moment they landed on the shelves.
The second mistake was to Nepřinutit Valdeze to leave the country for its own safety after the seizure of other newspapers in which the same story was published.
Valdez became a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his death is viewed as an important milestone in the battle of Mexican criminals against journalists.
He had been able to survive for so long, and all his friends and colleagues believed that it would never change.
In periodical Noroeste was practically a veteran, when in 2003 decided to sell his shares worth $50 and found together with five colleagues Riodoce.
In Sinaloe "It was impossible to run journalism and not mention the drug trade," said Bojorquez.
Riodoce gained a good reputation for brave and truthful news; The newspapers have begun to flourish.
Journalists like to going in search of problematic topics and publish texts without Censorship-the reader was fascinated to read stories that no one else dared to issue.
Eight years after the foundation, Riodoce won the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot Award for a report on Latin America.
The same year won the Valdez award of the International Freedom Press Committee for the protection of journalists for their brave reports on the Mexican drug trade.
Valdez, openly, admitted he was afraid.
"I was worried about my life," he said when accepting the price.
Drug trafficking in SINALOAE is a "way of life", said Valdez in October last year in an interview for Rompeviento TV.
"You have to take on the role of journalist-or to play silly.
I don't want someone to ask me, ' What were you doing face death... why didn't you say what was going on? '. "
Riodoce employees Miss Valdezovi. The man was known for his vtipkováním and indiscriminate language. He was a good friend who enjoyed giving advice and hugs – a teacher who knew how to survive.
They all relied on his daily routine.
He always wore his hat.
He often went to El Guayabo bar opposite the offices and sat at the same table.
Now they ask: caused this routine his death?
His death also raised questions about his own assumptions-how to do his job best and stay alive?
"They don't like to zaplétáte with their wives, children, clean shops, secret landing areas."
"These things were forbidden," said Bojorquez.
As a result, there is a high level of Sebecenzury and instinct.
You must trust your instincts.
If you feel something's not playing here, hands off.
The trouble is, said the editor Riodoce Andres Villarreal, that "the sense of smell is the meaning that can be fool... and then there was the thing with Javier."
The old rules according to him, as in others, Sinaloae no longer apply-as in the states of Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero, and other states that are home to the toxic mix of lucrative smuggling trails, weak governments, and corrupt politicians.
The landscape is constantly changing.
No mobile phones are allowed in the room where the RIODOCE staff meet; A few days ago, a spyware was discovered that bought governments to monitor Mexican journalists and activists.
In front of the building two policemen found relief from the forty-degree heat in the shade of a nearby tree.
They were selected by the state to protect the offices of Riodoce, which are located in a čtyřpatrové building in the Měšťácké district of Culiacanu.
Journalists are teasing about the fact that these cops don't belong to the those 50 percent of the defenders of the law, who, according to the government, are corrupt.
It has been several months since journalists last went to the mountainous areas, which essentially control drug cartels.
There are three main stories on the agenda of this week.
The first is the murder of the brother of former boxer Julio César Chávez in Sinaloe.
The candlestick also have a suspicious government expense that took place in the state governor's hometown.
Recently, there were several kidnappings in one of the most luxurious Culiacánu restaurants, just a block from the Public Prosecutor's office.
Officially, no one has announced the identity of kidnapped people or the circumstances of kidnapping, so journalists were wary of writing about what everyone in the city knew: that the restaurant is a popular destination for drug traffickers and politicians.
One of the journalists read from public records that the restaurant was registered under a name that is associated with a politician who is a member of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), controlling all levels of the political scene of almost the last century.
Several of the PRI's governors have recently been accused of corruption in high positions.
Villarreal asked journalists to write about past incidents that occurred in the restaurant, including an incident where one of the sons of Joaquín "El chap" Guzmána escaped the Army intervention Unit.
A month ago, readers would read about the subject in the Valdezově column, the best source of information on kidnappings.
"Valdez would definitely deciphered the case," said Villarreal (46), dubbed "El flac" for his slender figure.
"Now all the informers have turned their backs on us."
Valdezova office has turned into storage of signs and stamps to protest against the killing of journalists. The staff certainly did not expect them to become activists in the press representation.
Journalist Miriam Ramirez grabbed several signs and released the next morning to demonstrate in front of the Public Prosecutor's Office for another journalist.
Salvador Adam disappeared only three days after Valdezově murder in the west of the state of Michoacán.
Only charred body was discovered. The authorities claim that, based on DNA analysis, this is Adama.
The activity of journalists is intensifying throughout the country. Many of them organize protests and čmárají on sidewalks and buildings "SOS printing".
Bojorquez newspaper director is a day visiting Washington where he tries to get international support and achieve justice for Valdezově death.
At the meeting with Governor Sinaloy, who was held the day after the murder of Valdeze, Ramirez accused the authorities of watching journalists and their murders for preaching the truth.
Meanwhile, she asked for a transfer to another department from fears that her anger might endanger her impartiality.
Valdez repeatedly stated that Mexican journalists are "obehnáni" organized crime, corrupt officials, and indifferent public.
In his last book, "Narco-journalism," he wrote that journalists are dying not only by the hands of drug cartels, but also by the order of politicians and security forces working together with organised crime.
The media supervisory group Articulo 19 accused of more than half of all attacks on journalists by police officers and public officials.
"You're going to die in Mexico because they want to silence you," Ramirez added.
The murders obviously work.
No one will forget the death of blogger Marie Elizabeth Macíasové, which occurred six years ago at the northern borders of Tamaulipas.
Her body was found together with the message, which allegedly signed a cartel of Zetas: "This is how I ended up because of my reports."
Beside chopped off head lay a keyboard and headphones.
Some affiliates have decided to terminate their activity, such as The newspaper El Norte, based at the northern border of the state of Chihuahua in response to the March murder of rapporteur Miroslav Breachové.
The others still continue, just as they did El Manana of Nuevo Laredo after killing his director in 2004.
In 2010 Diario de Ciudad Juarez approached publicly drug cartels by article on the introductory page titled "What do You want from us"?
Some journalists have fled their homes or even across borders.
It's a difficult decision.
Finding a job in exile is difficult as well as getting rid of the feeling that someone is chasing you constantly.
And journalists are persecuted and killeded, such as. In the case of Rubena Espinosa, who was assassinated in the year 2015 along with four women in an apartment in Mexico City, three months after the escape from Veracruz.
For those who choose to stay and nevzdat their work, each day presents a great risk.
Ibarra, who wanted to be a poet, admits that writing about drugs frightens him.
"Mexico is heading to hell, so I became a journalist," he said.
It's Friday midnight and the staff Riodoce sits on the sidewalk in front of the office-the latest release sent to the printer-popíjejíc beer when it suddenly starts to ring the phone.
Learn that 19 people died in a shootout between gang members and policemen near the beach resort in the town of Mazatlán.
The war was intensifying, just as many messages left in this area by syndicate members.
Journalists publish this news from their mobile phone on the website Riodoce.
Neuběhne not one day and the opening title changes again.
The sounds of police sirens point to another shootout.
Bojorquez plunges a glance at the police patrol to see if they're watching.
If they're afraid, they don't make it clear.
Under a huge portrait of the fallen co-founder of their periodical-whose middle finger is the an eloquent slogan for the whole Sinaloe-all employees Riodoce follow his footsteps.
"How could we just think of leaving," Bojorquez said, "When Javier was killed on the same day, one an intern asked me to send her to the streets?"
Dinosaurs used camouflage to avoid enemies
At first glance, it looks like a statue, however scary.
The researchers have now unveiled the conclusions of the first findings of an amazing creature of the size of a rhino, whose perfectly preserved remains-which the experts called ' Mona Lisa the Dinosaurs '-was found by the Canadian miner.
The relics were preserved so high that the experts could determine the reddish brown color of his flaky skin and said that dinosaur had a ' troubled past '.
An article in the journal Current biologists stated that it is a ' nejzachovalejšího yet found armored dinosaur and one of the best species of dinosaur in the world '.
The fossil is a new species of the family Nodosauridae. Dinosaur lived in the Cretaceous Period, about 110 to 112 million years ago.
His perfectly preserved state was literally shocked by the researchers who described it as ' truly remarkable '.
The armoured Bíložravec is, according to National Geographic, the best preserved fossil of its kind.
Behind the award is Shawn Funk, who revealed the fossil 21. March 2011 when drilling in the mine Suncor Millenium near Canadian Albert.
He came across something that looked like a foreign object and decided to explore it closer.
The fossil was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of paleontologists.
Researchers spent the next six years working on uncovering an animal from a huge piece of land weighing 1100 kg.
After completion of the work the dinosaur is ready for detection.
' Just a little blind eyes and believe that sleeps, ' said Caleb Brown and naturalist of the museum Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the animal is exposed.
' It certainly will be written into history history as one of the most beautiful and nejdochovanějších species of dinosaur-Mona Lisa dinosaurs. '
By studying his skin the researchers found that this herbivor — despite being covered with armor and resembling a walking tank — was very likely to face a serious threat from the carnivorous dinosaurs.
Heavily armoured dinosaur used a red and white camouflage to protect against predators and used a camouflage system that uses many of today's animals.
The experts say that this has allowed him to blend in better with his surroundings and avoid enemies. The camouflage system indicates that it was a favorite food of the larger dinosaurs.
Reports of 110 million years old dinosaur family Nodosauridae first appeared in newspapers in May. It is currently available for viewing at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.
The researchers gave him the name Borealopelta Markmitchelli after the engineer of the museum, Mark Mitchell, who, together with the team, spent more than 7000 hours with careful disclosure fossils.
Thanks to the amazingly preserved state of fossils, Dr. Mitchell and the international team of scientists could document the patterns and shape of scales and armor throughout the body.
They unveiled the cloaking method commonly used by today's animals in defense – the upper part of the animal was darker than its lower part.
Although this camouflage effect is common in nature, the findings of researchers are surprising, because the Borealopeltaova size extends far beyond today's animals using the same technique.
It is therefore possible that dinosaur was such a multitude of predators that evolution gave priority to camouflage in the survival before confrontation.
Many contemporary animals with camouflage--for example, deer, zebra, and armadillo--are much smaller and also more vulnerable as prey, suggesting that Nosodaurus had to fight its outdated literally.
' The predation of a huge and heavily armoured dinosaur illustrate the dangers posed by predators in the Cretaceous period, ' said Brown.
Chemical analysis of the organic constituents contained in the scales also revealed that dinosaur skins had probably reddish-brown coloring.
Researchers continue to study the animal and searching after further knowledge of his life, including the preserved contents of the stomach to vypátrali his last meal.
He believes that dinosaur fell into the river after death and was taken to the sea, where it sank to the bottom.
In the Alberta region, the climate was the same as in today's Florida, and rivers and oceans stretched much farther inland than it is today.
' This nodosaurus is truly remarkable in that it is completely covered in perfectly preserved flaky skin while it is preserved in three dimensions and we can see its original size, ' said Brown.
' For these reasons the beast looks practically the same as in the time of chalk.
You don't have to use your imagination to renovate it; Just a little blind eyes, and it seems like he's just asleep. '
In the period of chalk, giant theropods, carnivorous dinosaurs, who moved on two legs walked down the ground.
Although the king of all dinosaurs-Tyrannosaurus Rex-lived several million years after Borealopeltaovi, this armored dinosaur could have been a favorite prey of his equally fearsome ancestors.
These include the Acrocanthosaurus, a 11.5 meter long monster with a weight of over 6 tons.
The researchers, whose latest findings were published in the journal Current biologists, believe that the body of Borealopelta was vyplavenoed into the sea after it was mumifikováned in the mud.
Behind the award is Shawn Funk, who revealed the fossil 21. March 2011 when drilling in the mine company Suncor Millenium near Canadian Albert.
According to the museum, it is the best-preserved armored dinosaur in the world, including leather and armour, which is also complete from the muzzle to the hip.
The animal reached an average of 5 metres in length and weighed up to 1300 kg.
protruded two 50 cm spines from his shoulders.
The researchers believe that this herbivore brázdiled the territory of today's Canada until it ended up in a river that sailed him into the sea.
His underwater tomb preserved the body in perfect condition.
The fossil remains of this species are preserved to the extent that the armored plates around the skull still cover the remnants of the skin.
As Michael Greshko wrote wrote for National Geographic, ' Finding this surviving individual can be compared to winning a lottery.
The longer I follow him, the shocking discovery strikes me.
The fossil remains of this species are preserved to the extent that the armored plates around the skull still cover the remnants of the skin.
At his side lies his right front leg with his fingers facing up.
I can easily count the scales on his feet. '
How one activist learned the answer to the question: ' Whose Streets? '
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrellová shook all over her body.
The day after she arrived in New York, native from St. Louis sat on the bed in the Airbnb room and went through the Facebook posts on her phone.
She came across the post of a high school pupil.
"The police just shot a 18letého young man whose body still lies on the street," it said.
She wondered if anyone else had written this post, so she closed Facebook and opened up Twitter.
The user @TheePharoah continually retweeted her posts to the wall.
Rapper from St. Louis released on Twitter his posts about the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed 18letého young man who shot a white-skinned cop in Ferguson, Missouri.
He published a photograph of the Brown's body, how lying limply on the street, where no one had taken it after four hours.
"That's crazy," Ferrellová thought.
But death was nothing new to her and her community.
She put down the phone to return to the evening, when she watched tweets about people who had gathered on Canfield Drive.
She watched the pictures of police tapes and roaring people. One of the men claimed to be the victim's father and held a sign with the inscription "Ferguson police killed my unarmed son"!
She watched the live news--one of the policemen faced a group of protesters, holding in his hand, and at the other end of the barking dog.
In another video he held another policeman, as she said, in the hand of the gun with which he was aiming at the crowd and yelling, "I'll kill you all... animals."
"That's not normal," Ferrellová said to himself.
"This is not the kind of murder we've gotten used to, and which we can call normal.
I felt goose bumps all over my body.
"I was angry and I cried."
She immediately booked the return flight and traveled home the next day.
After landing at 23:00, she picked up her liberty daughter from her father and decided to make it to Ferguson in the morning.
The story of what happened to Ferrellové and Ferguson over the next three years describes the new "Whose Streets?" document, which will be shown in cinemas on September 11, 2001. August.
It is a story of survival and protests, love and resistance, strength, and resilience narrated from the perspective of people living in the community who go to the streets and clamoring the answers.
On the way to Ferguson, Ferrellová introduced a dialogue with his daughter-dressed in floral jerseys and the same floral headband-on the subject that had been sifting through many times-"the experience of blacks."
"Remember how I taught you how Negroes had to fight for what they believed in?" he recalls.
"We're going to Ferguson right now, because the police killed 18letého young man and that's not right."
"It didn't seem that I wouldn't take it with me," Ferrellová said later.
"Today's events are the culmination... that has occurred in the past.
She had to know and see with her own eyes and grow up in it.
She needed to develop not only in activism and organization, but also to know the difference between different layers of experience with blacks and what we need to do to liberate ourselves.
Yet, I am able to assure her of the conditions in which she does not experience racism on her own, no different in any way from another black-child woman.
I feel that if I were to protect her from this experience, I would just uškodila her. "
Upon arriving at Ferguson, it was the first stop on the South Florissant Road Road, opposite the police department, which became a base of activists who had expected the words of Darren Wilson's officer about his eventual involvement in the incident.
Here, Ferrellová and his daughter met with a local entrepreneur who was preparing for the other food.
Together they prepared the food in sachets and helped it to be carried out by the Protestants.
In the eyes of Ferrellové, a new type of activism slowly began to give birth.
"My activism is after 9. August turned upside down, "said Ferrellová, adding that while studying at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, she was the president of the minority Student Nurses Assn. and sought to introduce health care and food in black communities.
"I had no experience with the organization.
It was natural. "
A few weeks later, Ferrellová became acquainted with the later codirector of the documentary, Sabaah Folayanovou, during the evening demonstration.
Folayan said that he and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar wanted to "only document" the ongoing events.
Ferrellovou, however, thought: "Are you working on a document or are you trying to find a story to use?"
Such a type of skepticism Saintes into the community through many people, often Caucasians, who wanted to capitalize on pain and decisiveness.
As Folayanová explained in Nedáném interview: "We have heard that the voices of people born and growing up in Ferguson are very often neglected, and we wanted to change that."
Folayanová has already established cooperation with co-director Damon Davis, who is a renowned local artist who deals with the topic of prisoners on death row.
His participation in the Zainteserovala project also Ferrellovoued and together with the other six locals who watched the "Whose Streets?" Team in the years following Brown's assassination.
"No one speaks for us in this document, but it's our testimony," Davis said.
"It was important to me-how will these people be represented-because I will be represented in the same way."
While the aim of the document was not to focus on the experiences of Ferrellové-in an attempt to show that the movement "is not about spasitelském leaders, but about the rapprochement of the community," said Folayanová-it turned out that she is the most open to participation in filming.
The document "Whose Streets?" thus describes the very personal aspect of the life of Ferrellové, for example, how she fell in love with her wife.
"I felt like naked," said Ferrellová, smiling on his face at the thought of the first moment Zhlédla the final version of the document.
"I understand, however, that in order to do this job and polidštit blacks, I have to open up."
The Ferrellové story also highlights the role of the eccentric black women in the broader aspect of the Black lives Matter movement.
Two of the three founders of the movement – who created in response to the killing of a teenager Trayvona Martina in 2012 on the social media campaign under #BlackLivesMatter – call themselves weirdos.
"Black eccentric women in leadership positions ultimately stand behind the movement," said Ferrellová, "because we are constantly fighting on multiple fronts.
Black eccentric women must tolerate the weight of these events. "
Folayanová agrees with this expression and adds that "the movement is in fact supported by black women and a large number of eccentric black women."
However, it insists that "this is not a mere affirmative affair" and Ferrellová is not the main heroine of the document because of its views.
"She was the driving force and power source," she said.
"That she was just found in the front lines is no coincidence, because life at these intersections in the skin of a black freaky woman is dangerous.
You feel the burst of energy in front of the screen. "
Meanwhile, back in Ferguson, the vyklidily cameras of the TV stations have their positions, but the heavy racial ties between the community and the police persist.
Ferrellová serving a two-and-a-half-year condition for blocking the highway in demonstrations.
The socially political atmosphere in the area called home described as "disorder."
Still, Neustává in her pursuit, which she undertook from the moment she went to Ferguson's streets three years ago.
"It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It is our duty to win.
We must love and support each other.
All we can lose is our chains. "
There was a fire in the Kolínsku.
In place vyjely Dozens of firefighters, also helped helicopter.
Near the Czech Brod na Kolínsku, between the municipalities Bylany and Liblice, burned from 14:00 field with an area of approximately 15 hectares.
Fire around 15:15 stopped spreading, firefighters declared third stage of fire alarm from four possible.
According to a spokesman for the firefighter Ladislav Holomčíka, the fire helped extinguish the helicopter.
At 18:00 the fire brigade was able to extinguish the fire, the fire caused damage for 700000 crowns.
With the flames on the spot fought dozens of professional and voluntary firefighters.
The fire originated due to a technical defect in the engine compartment of a combine harvester.
The extinguish also helped the helicopter, which in total made six shozů water.
"We passed the place of intervention to the owner until tomorrow 8:00 he will be guarded by a volunteer firefighter," Holomčík said today.
and Becoming Resemblance: Artist creates portraits using Chelsea Manning's DNA
There are several faces of different skin shades-white, black and swarthy-suspended from the ceiling on the wires in the centre of one of the New York Fridman Gallery. Each of them seemed to fall off the previous one.
All 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborgová from the oral swabs and hair that was sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent her samples from Fort Leavenworth, where the former analyst serving 35letý punishment for unauthorized disclosure of the secret kabelogramů to WikiLeaks.
The new exhibition, launched on 2. August, bears the name and Becoming Resemblance.
It is the result of a two-year correspondence between Dewey-Hagborgovou, which combines his experience of technology, informatics and art, and Manning-transgender and pioneering dissident, whose punishment has fallen Obama three days before his departure from the post President of the United States.
By algorithmic analysis of DNA Manning and using 30 portraits to illustrate how a person would look with this genotype, he created Dewey-Hagborgová trenchant, if not an intellectual commentary on the meekness of DNA-as well as many ways in which DNA can be Interpret-and Neodmyslitelném determinizmu these interpretations as well as identities.
Manning, who was born Bradley Edward Manning, has been talking since his youth about being considered a woman. She was convicted in 2013 on the basis of twenty indictments, including violations of six spy laws, computer fraud and theft.
All her photographs Zadržovali the staff of the prison. Only one black-and-white photograph of the lower quality was leaked to the public, and the Manning, visibly concerned, sits on the driver's seat in a platinum blond wig, which is now associated.
In 2015, he still doznívaly a positive reaction to the 2012 Dewey-Hagborgové project by Stranger Visions.
As part of this project, Dewey-Hagborgová used various forensic objects-such as. Cigarette butts cigarettes and chewing gum-to create an image of possible forms of these people.
And it was at this time that she received an email from Paper Magazine.
"They were about to interview Chelsea Manning in jail and wanted to make an article with a portrait," said Dewey-Hagborgová on the occasion of opening a new exhibition.
However, visits and photos were not allowed, so they turned to Chelsea asking if they would be interested in the DNA portrait.
The artist and her imprisoned muse hit it off in two years through correspondence.
They even created a comic book called Suppressed Images, illustrated by Shoili Kanungovou, who introduced a vision of what would happen if Chelsea was Omilostněna and could attend the exhibition in person.
Indeed, President Obama has asked for Manning for a few days after the comic's release, which was a welcome change after a few intolerable years spent in a Kansas military prison.
Indeed, it is interesting that the exhibition is underway at a time when Donald Trump is leading a war with people who seek to publish government information and TRANSGENDEROVÝMI soldiers while trying to find new ways to stimulate resentment in the areas that should Support.
In response to a question about this special timing, Dewey-Hagborgová said that "everything is going on for some reason".
Under the declaration of an artist on one of the walls of the gallery, Manning calls his huge signature (the letter "I" in the surname is dotted with the heart) after the end of the "automatic factionalism based on gender, race, sexuality and culture".
On the opposite side are the sequences of its mitochondrial DNA-centipede letters C, G and a recorded with a pencil.
By classifying 200 letters (or nucleotides, according to the sophisticated scientific vocabulary of an artist), Dewey-Hagborgová wanted to illustrate how surprisingly similar, at least after the biological page, we are all.
"I hope that people will take away that our genome doesn't matter who we are, and that the genetic data is subjective, and everyone can interpret them in their own way," said Dewey-Hagborgová. There is also her work Spurious Memories from the year 2007 on the theme of video.
"DNA tells many different stories, this is 30 of them."
The last specimen of the exhibition, located in a separate room, is the only page from the graphic amendment mentioned above.
Depicting Manning, how is emerging in the way of King Kong from United States Disiplinary Barracks, with a megaphone in his hand.
"They'll win," he says, as soon as they're prevented from speaking.
"Never let yourself be silenced."
"It's a direct transcript from one of the letters," said the Philadelphia artist.
"If I think of it, it's creepy."
So far, Manning has not personally visited the exhibition-which was foretold in the comic book-but when this happens, he will be welcomed in the center of the room with his masks, his own genomovými portraits, ordered as a mob of Protestants.
Which was also the purpose of the exhibition, including almost 160 cm high statue of Maningové, to which the pencil is recorded its genetic haplogroup.
"In the past, they were placed on the walls, but this time I wanted to make them sálal feel like a crowd," said Dewey-Hagborgová about portraits.
"I wanted to bring the impression of mass motion, which takes the form of Chelsea and liberates it."
Professor at Northwestern University and Oxford University staff search for murder
These days, a nationwide search for Professor Northwestern University and the staff of the University of Oxford who are prosecuted for suspicion of murdering a man found stabbed to death in a luxury Chicago apartment, the police said.
On Monday, a warrant was issued for first-degree murder on a man named Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) for their alleged complicity in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleaua, states the Cook County court file.
The document says that Cornell-Duranleau (26) died of the aftermath of several stab wounds.
Chicago police said the dead was found on 27. July.
The police were alerted to this fact by telephone. After arriving at Grand Plaza Apartments, they found a victim in one of the apartments with several tržnými wounds.
Cornell-Duranleau was declared in place for the dead and detectives investigating the case as a murder. Meanwhile, the police searching the two suspects, the authorities said.
Lathem worked at the position of Professor of microbiology and immunology of the Northwest University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, vice president of the Public Relations University, stated in his e-mail statement that Lathem is now on administrative leave and was banned from entering the university's school premises.
"The matter is now being by the competent authorities and the Northwest University is fully cooperating with them," said Cubbage.
Warren is a powerful financial manager at Oxford University.
A spokesman for the university and Somerville College said in a statement sent by e-mail: "The British police contacted us and we are ready to assist the American police as well."
The statement also says that Warren's colleagues were shocked and wished to join the police.
Anthony Guglielmi, head of public relations with the Chicago Police Department, said he invites suspects to surrender to the authorities.
"The police have information about the place of their stay and the effort to trace the suspects to intensifying," said Guglielmi.
Guglielmi added that the police are helping local, regional and national authorities to search for suspects.
According to Guglielmiho, the police received a phone call from the manager of the Grand Plaza building, which was alerted to events that were supposed to happen in apartment No. 1008.
The police described the whole scene as very violent.
Guglielmi stated that it is not clear if the incident occurred on 27. July.
He added that Lathem and Warren were captured by security cameras.
"We believe that Professor Latham knew his sacrifice," said Guglielmi.
The Grand Plaza Management has issued a statement for all residents: "The police are now working on compiling the timetable and profile of the victim and investigating various motives, including domestic violence."
"In the near future we will complete the WADA plan"-Vice-Chairman of the Russian government Mutko
The Vice-Chairman of the Russian government, Vitaly Mutko, said it would not take long to implement the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) and the znovuustanovení of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA).
"Part of the criteria of the new plan has already been completed and RUSADA has already acquired the right to planning and testing in cooperation with the British Anti-Doping Agency (UKAD).
In view of this fact, the WADA plan was updated, "said Mutko on Thursday.
The Vice-President commented on the second part of the WADA plan to comply with the code-which describes the criteria for the renewal of RUSADA-which was recently published on the organization's website.
According to the Mutka code, there is nothing that Russia should worry about.
"Everything has been announced and everything will also be implemented.
The results will be available to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA in the near future, "he added.
One of the above criteria nonetheless calls for a public announcement of the results of the WADA investigation, by Prošetřoval Richard McLaren, about the alleged sponsorship of the doping of Russian athletes by the government.
On the subject, Mutko said, "We conduct an investigation, because our anti-doping system has obviously failed.
All measures were accessed.
But there were no state programs in our country, and we cannot confess to something that never existed. "
The Mutkova words were confirmed by Vitaly Smirnov, director of the Russian independent public anti-Doping Commission.
In an interview with Russian RSport Smirnov, he admitted the problems of Russian anti-doping agents, but he added: "On many occasions, we have stated that the report contains controversial attitudes and regulations.
No one plans to accept the report entirely without reservation, "concluded Smirnov.
WADA Podezírala RUSADU from the performance of doping controls within Russia in November 2015 immediately before the doping scandal.
However, the organization has allowed the planning and unification of testing under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti-Doping Agency (UKAD) this June.
After a visit to the Moscow headquarters organization in July, CEO WADA Olivier Niggli stated that RUSADA is "on the right track" to renew validity.
The police accused three people, one is a teenager.
The police accused three men of establishing a Wednesday fire of a rare wooden church in Třinec-Gutech on Frýdek-Místek.
One accused is juvenile, all three are of Czech nationality.
There are 15 years ' imprisonment for a general threat.
For journalists, the Moravian-Silesian Police director Tomáš Cone said it today.
He was a deliberate offense.
"It's a very fresh affair and the police are currently on the motive of the matter working," the cone said.
He said the police would act on the possible taking of the accused into custody.
Further information according to the director cannot be published.
"I can't tell you more, because the criminal police and investigators and the prosecutor who supervises the matter are actually working on things," the cone said.
The wooden church of Corpus Christi in Gutech was from the 16th Century.
It was a valuable monument with many original equipment and paintings from the first half of the 16th. Century.
Material damage will go to tens of millions of crowns according to preliminary estimates, but the historical loss is incalculable.
Soon after the fire began to consider the restoration of the church.
Most of the costs should cover the insurance, the additional costs are prepared to share the Ministry of Culture and the city, the public collection is also being prepared and the contribution of the owner of the monument, i.e. the local parish, is envisaged.
Similar to the wooden church of St. Catherine of the 16th In the 14th century in Ostrava-the Earls also destroyed a fire fifteen years ago.
It caused the wiring to malfunction.
There was an exact copy in his place.
The state counts with citizens in defending the state.
They will support their training.
With financial support for state defense societies, with voluntary firing training or with a team of training trainers, it calculates the substantive intention of the Law on the readiness of citizens to defend the state.
The defence ministry, which was given the task of the Government, promises to increase the physical prowess of Czechs and their abilities, which could then be used in crisis situations.
This results from a proposal prepared by the Ministry.
If the law were adopted in the future, the state would incur hundreds of millions of crowns to support the Brannosti.
The basic objective of the proposal is, according to its authors, to create an effective system to help increase the readiness of the Czech population to defend the state, outside the performance of the conscription and on a voluntary basis.
The state would, for example, support the societies of radioamateurs, shooters or kynologů, financially or materially, and would allow their members to increase their capacities.
In return, it would obtain data on people who are willing, if necessary, to come to Earth in a time of crisis to help, and about their capabilities or material equipment.
There could also be accredited instructors who would help clubs and other interested parties in training or education.
It also counts with the organization of DISCUSSIONSS with war veterans or people who have survived heroically.
One possible option would be to create a new office that would be responsible for the administration and coordination of the project.
The authors emphasize that people's participation should be voluntary and that the State should take advantage of their ability only after the threat status has been reported.
"The whole concept must respect the gradual wiping of the previously obvious boundaries between the different types of threats," it is stated in the intention of referring to the dangers of the so-called hybrid threats.
Ministry officials noted that the focus must therefore be on supporting the widest set of capabilities, not just military ones.
"The basic aim of the project is to create a very broad basis to enable each citizen to respond appropriately to situations threatening the sovereignty of the State or the lives, health and property of persons, to protect themselves, or to contribute to the protection of others, and to the incorrect Conduct does not bother to carry out tasks of the armed forces of the Czech Republic, "states the intention.
The adoption of the law would yield considerable financial demands.
Their amount will depend on the chosen variant according to the ministry.
For example, the Office foresees financial support for projects to prepare citizens for the defence of the state up to 100 million crowns.
If an administrative and coordination Centre were established, its operation could cost around 60 million crowns a year.
More money would go to salaries or to build an information system.
The proposal also foresees that it would have to expand the scope of regional military headquarters, which would hired the other 42 soldiers together.
The ministries have already stated that the law should also help resolve the disagreement of some Czech politicians with the introduction of a European Union directive on arms ownership.
Its acceptance would allow the shooter, who will be part of the system, to retain some of the weapons that the directive says.
Startups that help your company not become another Uber
Amy Errettová wanted to measure the satisfaction level of employees of his e-commerce startup, but did not find a corresponding survey.
The answers were often inaccurate, unhelpful, or even misleading.
And despite promising the anonymity of the survey, some employees expressed their distrust in the entire process.
"I was looking for consistency and objectivity," said Errettová, the owner of e-commerce of Madison Reed's company, based in San Francisco, which employs 75 people.
So she asked for help from outside.
New human resources startups are constantly emerging in the market to help companies with employee satisfaction surveys.
By creating and licensing software with a specific intention of measuring employee responsibilities, startups allow companies to make quick votes, target specific teams and demographic groups, and offer total anonymity and a hotline for Complaints, and in some cases also allow whistleblowers to bypass the supervisors and contact the director directly.
"There are instruments on the market such as diet and Fitbit that monitor your health, but where is Fitbit for your company?" said Barnett, co-founder and CEO of Startup Glint, based in Reedwood City.
Errettová said that thanks to Glintu, she gained more awareness in three years about what her employees thought and what she felt.
In addition to the quick surveys and voting of specific teams, Glint offers a thermal map of the company and cursory overview of the groups with the highest number of complaints, as well as an overview of managers with low ratings-which allows the user to work on the axle.
Companies are beginning to realize that it is necessary to take care of the culture of the working environment-in case they would become another Uber-which is in the scandals after a former employee posted on his blog post describing the corporate environment and harassment Employees who dare to speak openly.
For startups like Glint, demand for corporate culture surveys is a lucrative business opportunity.
According to the Let's Talk payments website, which deals with technical and financial progress, the value of the global control, regulation and subject compliance sector can exceed 118.8 billion by the year 2020.
The Startup Convercent of Denver, Colorado, which helps companies to prevent and detect inappropriate behavior, saw a small increase in interest and activity early in the year, just before Uber scandals.
Nearly 600 clients Convercentu include Airbnb, Microsoft, and Tesla.
Recently, he also accepted Uber under his wings.
Like Glint, Convercent allows companies to send customizable "lightning" surveys, collect real-time confidential information, and display temperature maps of problem areas.
It also offers an anonymous text hotline that allows employees to report inappropriate behavior.
If the general Director is involved, complaints are sent directly to the board of directors.
"The Court of Justice has been empowered by regulators," said Patrick Quinlan, the founder and CEO of startup Convercent.
If the company is convicted of improper treatment of its employees or unethical behaviour-and if the regulators do not intervene-may face costly consequences due to a boycott of customers, exhaustion of employees or legal proceedings, added Quinlan.
The network of Ruby Tuesday restaurants, which employs over 25 000 people across 500 locations, uses Convercent more than a year to increase employee awareness about corporate policies and procedures and to provide an easy way to contact corporate leadership.
Previously, if an employee wanted to report any problem, he had to trace the phone number or email to the company's management to form a complaint and hope for successful resolution.
It was often a deterrent and unpleasant experience, said James Vitrano, General representative of Ruby Tuesday, according to which there was no reliable way to monitor employee complaints.
Now that the company uses Convercent, rapid detection and resolution of problems that have never been made to managers sitting in offices, miles away from the actual resolution of complaints-for example, discrimination, harassment or Unfair treatment.
"It is approaching a holistic, overall view of the experience of the employees," said Vitrano, who controls a group of Ruby Tuesdays who supervise risk management.
"At the same time, we protect shareholders from litigation by employees."
Companies have stopped taking ethics, value, and employee participation lightly in 2002, after Arthur Andersen collapsed after Enron's fall in abuse of ethical rights of employees, Quinlan said.
But when "the whole thing shone on social media", companies began to realize that they could not simply hide their skeletons in the closet in the online world.
"Before people started using the technology to track their ethics, they relied on faith," added Quinlan.
Glint and Convercent offer their software in the form of a service for which companies pay regular fees.
It is a business model and an opportunity approved by brave Kapitáloví investors, who supported both startups.
Convercent chose $10 million in the February campaign from companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, and eventually took the capital of 47 million.
Glint received $10 million from Bessemer Venture Partners in November and won 60 million throughout the campaign.
These investments are hardly surprising given the mutual nature of societies, cultures and venture capital.
The growing number of researches clearly confirms that today's employees expect more from their workplace than ever before.
And in competitive markets such as the Silicon Valley are not the main advantage of high salaries and interesting projects.
Employees want to perceive that they are accepted and appreciated, and that they devote their time to a company that strives for a positive mission.
"If people are happy in their work, they perceive that their voice is heard, and that their work is rewarding, striving for the success of the company," said Nina McQueen, vice president of global benefits and LinkedIn's employee benefits, which uses Convercent and Glint.
Investors earn if companies and companies thrive if they are satisfied by its employees.
And when an analytical tool appears on the market to ensure employee engagement and commitment to society, it is no surprise that a lot of investors will be found to support this effort.
According to experts in working culture it is important to have data on employee satisfaction.
But the data itself is useless if the company fails act the necessary steps.
The fact is that once the company has requested feedback from its employees, there can be major changes.
And if the change does not occur quickly-in the worst case at all-can evoke disappointment and disinterest of employees.
"Once you have asked for 4000 views, you must be prepared for 4000 conversations," said Russell Raath, director of consultancy at Kotter International, who has witnessed many companies that rely too much on data itself.
"Because once things nedotáhnete to an end, employees begin to wonder: ' Did they hear me at all?
Interested in me?
And if not, then why should it interest me? ' " "
Madison Reed, now regularly conducting a survey of employees every month, is able to solve the problem within one day by Glintu, said Errettová.
After gathering feedback from employees who were frustrated with slow decision-making and quality of communication, Errettová managed to reorganize several teams within the company and start training communication to successful solve the problem.
Ruby Tuesday acquires a very important view of its employees and hopes that, in the long run, it will achieve high employment in a field known as frequent redundancies.
"If you are not striving to create a transparent working environment, employees will not believe you," added Vitrano.
"And as soon as you start losing your employees, you will lose your customers.
And with the outflow of customers goes bankrupt the whole company. "
Thursday was the hottest day.
Thursday is with 38.3 degrees recorded in the military post on Hodonínsko the hottest day of the year in the Czech Republic.
He overcame so Úterek, which was originally the hottest day of the year with 37.3 degrees.
They informed the staff of the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute.
Not a lot of temperature records fell from Tuesday on Thursday.
The heat was mainly affected by Moravia, in Bohemia it was mostly cloudy.
On Tuesday, the records were surpassed or settled at 35 from 145 meteorological stations measuring over 30 years.
On Thursday, only nine long-term measuring stations recorded a record.
For example, the current temperature was the same as the previous record of the year 2013.
In Lednice on the Břeclavsku of today's 37.4 degree surpassed the original maximum by four tenths of a degree and in Pohořelicích on Brněnsku current 37.1 degree exceeded the record by three tenths.
Both records, like the military post, came from the year 2013.
High temperatures today appeared mainly in the south and East Moravia.
After the watch house was the most hot in Dyjákovicích on Znojmo region and Brod nad Dyjí on Břeclavsku, where Mercury climbed to 37.8 degrees, but the record did not surpass.
By contrast, for example, in western and northwest Bohemia, the site Chmi today's highest temperatures were only around 22 degrees Celsius.
"The temperatures started growing there later in the afternoon," the Weathermen said.
The current heat in the Czech Republic will be gradually odeznívat according to Chmi and more significant rains could come on Sunday.
At most places in Moravia, however, high temperatures will remain on Friday and southeast Moravia as well as on Saturdays.
We had a nešvar.
It is not enough for billionaires to have the same voice in the election as every single plnoletému man in the country.
They want to make decisions directly, and because not everyone is as insolent as Andrei Babiš, who wants to own the state, they buy political parties.
The owner of Penta Marek Dospiva, together with other colleagues behind the water, Martin Burdou and Antonín Fryčem sponsors Robejškovy realist.
The second life of the Civic Democratic Alliance is financed by the owner of the insurance company and the entrepreneur in the realities Pavel got it, who is his party also chairman.
The condemned Korupčník and King of Czech gambling Ivo Valenta took the party of Freeholders.
The political movement of Agrofert, as the project of Andrei Babiše was named by Kroměříž Mayor Jaroslav Němec, is a chapter to itself.
The mayors also recently caught their billionaires.
It is Dalibor the old man, the owner of the company on security equipment Jablotron.
In his own words, he enters politics so that he does good.
But the entree in Starostenském jersey did not Dědkovi much.
"I've never dreamed of small goals," he said at a press conference.
This means that my goal is to make the movement yes, so that the mayor's movement receives twenty percent of the election.
Some smiled.
But Dědkovo tongue is rather symptomatic.
The billionaire Dalibor old is a man of solid opinion.
Although he intends to bid for voters ' voices in the mayor's jersey, he continues to support Andrei Babiše.
The old man Babiše in the past parliamentary elections.
"Babiš is not a seasoned speaker and does not rule líbivou the rhetoric of political snakes," he wrote about him before the election of 2013.
But it certainly does not go into politics because it would like to personally improve.
For me, the Babiš hero will remain.
He is willing to step out of his world, who is under control, and do something for all of us.
Shortly after the mayors introduced him as a new reinforcement, he confessed his admiration for Babišovi again.
And he said that he wanted the mayors to learn the possible cooperation with Babišem to imagine.
Some can appreciate that the old man does not change his views and stands for his own regardless of the jersey he is wearing.
Others can speculate whether Babiš sends to the mayors to build his B someone like this nemotorného.
Others may ask if the Boss Jablotron mission to be with the boss of Agrofertu Nerozešel hard at the store and not looking for another way to defend his business rival.
The first Dědkova public appearance was not just around Babiše.
The old man promised that the mayor would send ten million crowns to the campaign.
And if they say they need more money, they'll send more.
A few years ago, a similar statement would have been hard to pause.
Indeed, the court-recognized Crook Zdeněk Bakala, before the elections in 2010, rozhazoval millions on all sides.
The political division of the Security Agency Vít Bárta, TOP 09 and civilian Democrats have come together to nearly thirty million.
But today is another time.
The law forbids anyone to give more than three million to a political party.
When the old man enters politics, he could at least study the rules of the game.
Perhaps he would not have to wonder why politics has such a bad reputation with us.
The Old man crowned his first days in politics with a proposal for a tax advantage of families with studovanými children.
People with a university degree will come to about fifty thousand a month.
Those with basic in less than twenty.
A man with fifty thousand is rich in the local situation.
The one with twenty poor.
In a Dědkově vision, the poor are honestly paying taxes, and the rich enjoy the benefits of working in a welfare state that is not much involved.
The rich are simply to help them not to toil misery with urgency.
The mayors can congratulate each other on their new acquisition and Babiš their hands.
The rest of us, thanks to Dědkovi, can confirm that billionaires are not good people.
There remains the question of whom to vote.
For me, those who know the rules of the game and want to follow them.
Those who are members of their parties, or citizens and nationals of the State, do not have their property as their employees and country.
And finally, those who want the rich country to live well to all people, not just some.
No one wanted Trumpův paradise.
The villa complex had to cheaper by 234 million.
Selling a property is sometimes not easy.
And often it doesn't help even 11 bedrooms, a magnificent view of the sea or the fact that the property is sold by US President Donald Trump.
At the sale of the villa complex Le Chateau des Palmiers, the price went down by an incredible 8 million pounds.
Informed about the Web Mirror.co.uk.
In the brochure, the plot reads: "Sincerely, Donald J. Trump."
Escape to a place like no other.
But the merger of a real estate company with the US president Neobhájilo an extreme price tag.
Donald Trump had to cut the price of his Caribbean mansion by an incredible 8 million pounds.
The original price of the property was 21.5 million pounds, the final price dropped to 13 million pounds.
Even after discounts, the villa complex stands about as 76 average apartments in the centre of Prague.
And it's not surprising.
The breathtaking 5-acre mansion on the Caribbean island of St. Martin has 12 full-size bathrooms, 11 bedrooms, many dining rooms, a gym and other facilities.
It consists of several buildings.
The property includes a swimming pool and a tennis court.
Dozens of palms are planted on the property.
The terrace has a magnificent view of the sea.
According to real estate experts, the price showed the fact that the connection with the President is not sufficient to attract potential buyers.
Now the property is closer to the normal prices of real estate on the island.
Trump bought the property in 2013.
According to speculation, he paid around £15 million.
The property was to be purchased for rental purposes.
Le Chateau des Palmiers was the most expensive property on the island of Saint Martin.
But the new price ranks second.
The property in the neighborhood was valued at 13.5 million. Pounds.
The NCAA has decided to put an end to two trainings a day. Long days for the Bruins
The eleventh morning and the players of UCLA's American football mačkají near the sidelines of the new school playground.
Some of them undressing jerseys and reveal a sweaty back, the unmistakable sign of the first day of the training camp.
For most members of the team these few minutes doing nothing supluje lunch break.
Players enrolled in the summer semester leave to the rooms after Tříhodinovém training to study at the final exam before returning to the Wasserman Football Center at the meeting, which takes place the coming morning at 6:30.
"These boys will be kwok for the next three days," said the Bruins coach to Jim Mora a moment before the Monday swung on Tuesday.
By decommissioning two workouts in one day, the NCAA wants to lighten the players – paradoxically, the training days are even longer – at least until Friday when the final exam ends.
That's why the first three UCLA trainings are scheduled for 19:15 – to vtěsnaly into the already crowded diary of many students.
For the first time in six seasons, which spent Mora on the position of a trainer in Westwood, the Bruins training camp starts a week earlier than last year and trainings are limited during the summer semester. It also has a decision to limit the number of workouts from two to one daily.
In total, eighteen trainings are scheduled until the 20th August, whereupon they begin the formal preparations for the first game against the Texas A&M team, which takes place in September.
Mora had been told that he supported the NCAA decision, despite having added another item to the already busy player diaries.
"Three or four days players are under great stress and it is very exhausting for them," said Mora.
"But nobody gave up, they all try. They're great.
I think on Saturday, when we have more time, everything will calm down. "
UCLA will be closed after the end of the training camp, which will not be easy looking at the clear lines of surrounding land from the adjacent parking lot and the luxury hotel Luskin Center, which was occupied by the players after harvesting the protective net behind the goal bar.
The Bruins should occupy the hotel starting this week, but Mora recognizes that when rooms are emptied during the season, there could be a problem.
"The land will guard the security service," added Mora.
"The safety is taken care of, but it is not excluded that someone can rent a room and record our trainings.
It is well traded with such material.
Fortunately, the Hotel will be guarded by security, as well as car park No. 8.
We will use our resources to the maximum.
I believe everything will be fine.
Everything is scheduled. "
Facebook is planning a more thorough fact check to limit the number of fake messages
Facebook will send more potentially fake articles to control third parties and display findings under original posts in an attempt to fight against the so-called "fake news", said the largest social network on Thursday.
The company says in a statement on its website that it will begin using updated machine learning to detect possible hoaxes, which would send to third parties for verification and potentially display survey results below the original posts.
Facebook was referred to as one of the main sources of false messages, and many believe that these unconfirmed reports influenced the last year's election of the United States President.
In Europe, political debates are being conducted on the whole issue. French voters are inundated with an avalanche of false messages about the May presidential election, and Germany plans to impose a fine on the social media network in advance of September elections if it does not rapidly remove angry contributions.
Facebook on Thursday in its next statement issued in Germany stated that it is about to launch testing a new feature of the control of fake messages in the US, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
"In addition to displaying messages verified by third parties, people ask for more content to be better informed and to make the right decisions about what they can share," said Sara Su, a Facebook News manager product.
She added that Facebook continues to test the "related articles" feature and also works on other changes in order to reduce the number of fake messages.
Making a graphic novel: A story about a Castle in England
The small castle of Scotney Castle recently played a major role in the Squeeze music video clip, and Margaret Thatcher also found its refuge during the 70. and 80. Years of the last century.
Scotney, however, had witnessed a 700 years of tumultuous history from his cosy spots by the Bewl River in British Kent, which inspired the curly Jamie Rhodes from York County-a famous hobby in historical documents-to create a graphic novel.
"Looking at the scriptures of a man who is 300 years after death fascinates me," Rhodes says with a serious face.
"I feel a personal connection when I hold a letter in my hands."
The graphic novel and Castle in England document the life of families who stayed in the castle Scotney from the Middle Ages to the Eduardovského period. Each story is illustrated by a different British artist, Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
It is not the first Rhodesova book inspired by archives: He is also the author of Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories (2014), a collection of British Library-inspired documents-a project that was very emotional for him.
"I was intrigued by an inch of a letter written by a double agent in 70. Years that worked for Jakobity, "he said.
"That's the fingerprint of his thumb!
And the letters always smell like smoke, because in those times you had to light a candle to read.
When you přičichnu to the letter now, about 300 years later, it's like I'm back in time.
How I love the archives! "
For someone who is so fascinated with old papers, the support of the National Trust and Arts Council England and the possibility to dwell almost four months in the castle is almost like a dream. ("To tell you the truth, I've lengthened my stay a little.")
Rhodes spent time exploring the Victorian "new" castle, browsing the archives and studying many treasures and curiosities, such as. Head hyenas on the wall and bottles that have been tossed for centuries in the ditch.
He walked over the land and examined the ruins of the old castle, spoke with Hajnými, gardeners, and occasionally with artists who worked on illustrations for his book.
At night "drinking whiskey and wrote".
The intimate History of Scotney is a relatively large unknown, as the National Trust has gained access to documents only in 2006 after the death of the last heir, Elizabeth Husseyové.
When Rhodes arrived ten years later, the employees began to penetrate into the archives that Rhodes described by saying, as "aristocrats of many centuries frustration hands with the words: ' Take it to the attic '."
Diaries, letters from the days of the British Empire, a map showing the estates: "You may think that the dispute over land is boring," said Rhodes, "but I came across one case where two families přetahovaly about Břízu.
Stop the People! "
Some stories in the book Use the castle as a springboard and delve deeper into English history, including a story called The Labourer, which tracks a man who leaves a newly built castle to join the English uprising of 1381.
"I found a record of rebellion in the castle from the year 1380, which was in the book called Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex," Rhodes said.
"The English uprising actually started in this area and it occurred to me that rebellion is a good starting point.
Maybe they are somehow connected together. "
Other stories are firmly linked to the history of the castle-for example, The priest, who tells the story of the Jesuit priest, whose hid Darrellova family for seven years during the English Reformation.
Or the Smuggler about a smuggler from the 18th A century named Arthur Darrell, who allegedly staged his own funeral when he filled the coffin with stones (which was discovered until several years after the uncovering of the coffin).
Rhodes's favourite family is Darrellovy: "I was intrigued by a man's generation-men were always indebted and spent money on things they couldn't afford.
The various generations of Darrell's family solved it by marrying a rich or old wives-I imagine that they were handsome gentlemen who liked Motali head dědičkám. "
With the end of their stay at the castle searching Rhodes after other adventures.
He recently returned from a two-week stand in the Finnish wilderness, where he sucked inspiration for his next book on Elämänmäki, a former sanatorium from the early 20th century. century, which was absorbed nature.
But it's a special place for Scotneyho.
"I was sad when I left," he said.
"I thought, ' Now to get the hell back to real life '."
Washington changes the conditions for Green Card award
The media has published the words of President Donald Trump about the new US immigration plan, which will also make a change in the award of the Green Card.
The number of legal immigrants is expected to fall by 50 000 a year, due to stricter rules on temporary work visas and family visa restrictions.
The new rules are proposed by the Republicans and the president.
The bill will soon be submitted to Congress.
"This law will reduce poverty, raise wages, and save billions of dollars for tax payers. We achieve this by changing the rules for issuing green cards to residents of other countries.
The law will limit the number of immigrants and replace the current scheme.
The new application process will give preference to English-speaking applicants who abound funds and demonstrate the capabilities that are to the benefit of our country, "Trump said, cited by the media.
Sexual robots are on the rise – we should be on the lookout
Just when it seemed that the year 2017 could not be bizarnější, a report on the technological development of sexual robots will appear on the Internet.
Yes.
Sexual robots are nowadays really popular.
Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) has recently issued a statement on the development of sex robots within the next five to ten years.
In the words of the former professor of Robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of FRR Noel Sharkeyho, The Rise of sex robots must be seen seriously.
Customers can choose the colour of the eyes, the shape of nipples and the appearance of the robot nails.
"People are teasing them, but sales are growing and we must be prepared to see them increasingly," said Sharkey, on the occasion of the publication of the report.
Modern sexual aids are changed from inflatable pan to robotic women with silicone skin, which is pleasantly warm to the touch-commonplace is artificial intelligence that mimics the behavior of man.
The user can "adjust" the robot to his/her image-from the colour of the eyes and the shape of the nipples to the appearance and color of nails.
Very disturbing is the fact that many robots have their own "personality" that would have shamede even Stepfordskou lady.
Modern inflatable virgins have evolved into robotic women with silicone skin.
The owner of a robot RealBotix can set different character traits, including modesty, among his spare woman.
And then there is the sexual robotic woman Roxxxy Gold company True Companion, which comes with pre-programmed personalities, including "frigid Farrah", which is characterized by a shy character and "wild Wendy" with an "adventurous" nature.
"The personality of Roxxxy Gold is set to suit your personality as much as possible," says True Companion, a Web site.
So she likes what you like and vice versa.
She's even moody, just like people.
It may be tired, talkative, or be "in the mood".
The rise of sexual robots is alarming for several reasons--among which there is no confusion for real interpersonal relations. Unsettling are rather inferior feminine traits and violent cues-eg. Frigid (read defying) Farrah.
The company True Companion on its website připodobňuje Roxxxy to a vibrator for men.
"If a woman can have a vibrator, why can't a man have a Roxxxy?" he says on the page.
However, sex robots are not mere fetishes or sexual aids.
Their emergence and almost perfect sophistication point to something darker and deeply ingrained in our culture-expulsion from ideal or gender equality toward a desire for captivating sex with an optional surcharge.
Most men, of course, do not buy a robotic woman, and while FRR talks about their growing popularity, sex robots still remain on the edge of interest to the general public.
However, this marginal interest can become a mirror set in contemporary modern times.
And most people are not freaky or violent until they nezavdá the excuse for the free market.
It is no coincidence that these sophisticated sexual robots appear at a time when women around the world vydobývají their rights and a president is sitting in the White House who often expresses a very vilified to the address of a woman.
Nejhrůzostrašnějším aspect of the series The story of servant is not what we see-hanged body and hollowing out eyes, as rather the reality of these visions.
Book template The story of servant represents a step in the right direction, but at the moment it seems that it is a tiny step away.
As far as possible, sex robots are to resemble real women (albeit with categories rates).
Their creators are konstruují so that they are pleasant to the touch and acted at first glance as a real woman.
But when it comes to their "personality," the robot cannot replace a real woman.
They can't break up with their partner or just leave.
They have no work or history. Nothing to encourage their independence or to disturb their devotion to their master.
In other words, they're nice slaves.

NBA star on the green Pažitu.
Curry fights in California by the cut.
The star basketball player Stephen Curry did not lose himself despite Zpackanému's first swing in the premiere launch among professional golfers.
Double the winner of NBA's Most Valuable Player award at the Ellie Mae Classic Tournament, the lower Web.com Tour in Hayward, Calif., the first round at 74 rounds and will fight for the cut.
Quarterback Golden State, who won the second NBA title in this season with his team of warriors, started a lot nervously, and his first hit was in a beverage holder in a golf cart parked by the fairway.
Even then, he was not as precise between the wells as under the basketball basket, but he left a dozen professionals behind him with a balance of four strokes above the par.
"It wasn't an ideal way to start, having to call the referee right after the first hit, but then a little saddle," Curry said, with a huge stage fright on him.
It was very nervous, to detonate the first blow to the tournament, but it was all I had hoped for.
"If you told me I'd play 74 in the first round, I'd take it immediately," he added.
If Curry manages to fight cute, which will probably set two wounds under par, he will become the first representative of another sport that can do it on the Web.com Tour.
"I want to play better next time, and now that I get rid of fright, I hope so," said the enthusiastic golfer, who had already played in celebrities ' tournaments and mixed competitions for amateurs and professionals in the past.
In Hayward, he starts for the first time in a tournament that falls under the PGA.
To participate in Ellie Mae Classic He received a sponsorship exception and retained his amateur status.
The Web.com Tour series is one category under the PGA Elite Tour.
Trumpovo great victory?
Against this, Mitt Romney is the embodiment of common sense
The unmisleading sign of the Trumpovy era are political divisions that divide American voters, and also zpřetrhávají entire families on a micro scale.
In the Christmas and Thanksgiving season, the American newspapers there was advice on how to deal with the relatives who elect Trumpa.
We're supposed to be just waiting for our nerves to be allowed.
However, less attention is paid to the Trump skills of the cementing family.
I'm talking about it because my cousin, a poet and a groupie of the left, who lives in Chicago and who has been paying for Republican hlupačku in our family for a long time this week, has visited me in New York.
She reminded me that semknutost in the face of a common enemy could have a strong effect.
Now, with Trump at the White House, the whole family is suddenly--including all the Republican siblings, with whom they hašteřila on politics for years--on a single wave.
Dinner at the family table is a good thing; But it strikes me that in a broader context this poses a significant risk.
Trump strengthens the left, but the negative effect of his presidency has the power to squeeze us all right.
When we speak of "normalization" and Trump, we refer to the terrifying possibility that his šaškárny may one day lose to attractiveness.
But there is still a hrůznější long-term scenario in which Trump "normalizes" Pravičácké Republicans, who, odporujíc to its standards, will suddenly be the embodiment of what can be called rational.
In these days, with nostalgia in the heart, I remember Mitt Romney and his version of Crazy action-a dog on the roof of a car, 14% income tax (at least we had an awareness of his tax return) – both examples look like a very mild offense compared to Trump.
After the Trump's departure, the ensuing Republican nominee is enough to be at least normal, which will be an immense improvement.
We used to visit my cousin and took the children to Central Park on the largest carousel, which is run by the New York Department of Parks-you will not find a better use for your three dollars, unless you need caffeine.
The horses are enormous, the center roller is covered with fiberglass-clowns and the animals are filming and in horror they gaze on their own shoulders-a completely gloomy look and cinkavá music surprisingly reminiscent of public transport.
Many clichés soon get tired: The view from high-rise buildings, the cityscape is Okouká, instead of breathing the atmosphere and the reality of the city does not get your ideas.
Thirty-five years later, I still did not carry over the fact that Swiss Cottage is not actually Swiss cheese-not counting the theme pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage-but a subway station in London.
The Carousel in Central Park, however, evokes a remarkably magical experience, to the extent that it amuses two years of children, as well as two mature women.
If I could rate the carousel, it would have deserved maximum points. Fortunately, no one asks.
This week, I experienced a similar experience in a shop when I was asked to evaluate my "experience" on my credit card payment on a scale of one to five.
It's the same in the café on the corner of my street, with the difference that I can throw a 15% gratuity on something I buy at the counter.
Not only does this slow down otherwise a quick sale, but the waitress is thus forced to rub in favor of shoppers when it is not needed.
The woman in the shop had me smiling she apologized when I reluctantly evaluated my credit card transfer by five stars.
Oscar Pistorius was transferred from prison to hospital due to chest pain
This is the second time that Pistorius had to be taken to the hospital.
Last year he was treated for the wrist cuttings, which, according to the prison, caused himself to fall in the cell.
Pistorius was convicted of murder after an appeal against the original conviction for manslaughter.
He killed his friend Steenkampovou in the early morning on Valentine's Day in 2013 with several gunshot wounds through the door of a toilet cupboard in his home in Pretoria.
Pistorius claimed to have mistook her with a thief.
The applicants announced their intention to re-appeal, this time against šestiletému punishment Pistoriuse, which, according to their words, is too mild.
The National Prosecuting Authority said it will appeal to the South African Supreme Court and the court will take place later this year.
If successful, there is a Pistoriusovi of up to 15 years of punishment.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
For the first time in history, she gave birth to a captive-bred cub who Spářila in the wilderness.
It's a huge success for the Panda rescue program.
The center is trying to expand the gene pool pandas bred in captivity.
Staff of Centre Chang-Taichung told the New China agency that the panda breed is at a high risk from inbreeding crossings.
In captivity, only 471 pandas lived at the end of last year.
Only two thousand survive in the wild.
The effort to let the mate of captured pandas with those savages is the first step in helping the panda breed to protect it.
Patnáctiletá Cao-Cao was released in the nature reserve at the beginning of the pandího mating period 11. March.
Thanks to the surveillance equipment on the neck, scientists were able to observe every step.
Her elect met Cao-Cao 12 days later.
Sexual intercourse with the male panda took a minute and a half and succeeded.
Even this can be considered a small miracle, because the pandas males are not considered the most successful lover of the animal kingdom.
Males quite poorly estimate the time when the female is prepared, moreover they are often confused and have no idea what to do.
The cub was born healthy and, even as the Chao-Chao had an extraordinary appetite during pregnancy, it weighed 216 grams in childbirth.
The average weight of a newborn panda is about 70 grams lower.
The illegal camping in Greece was detained by two Bulgarians

After the first round of the British Open, Semsema is in the 50th place.
The golfer Klára Semsema figures after the first round of major British Open on the split 50. Place.
The course in the Scottish Kingsbarns bypass to score one blow under par when she starred three birdie and twice bogey.
Dvaadvacetiletá Czech player thus has the hope that the famous major first passes cute.

Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands are withdrawing millions of toxic eggs from the market.
The Netherlands itself temporarily closed 180 poultry establishments because of the incident.
The Dutch Food Safety Authority, NVWA according to Reuters, has announced that it is investigating 20 percent of all Dutch poultry establishments, which, according to it, means that 80 per cent of the eggs on the market are safe.
The authority has stressed that the risk represents only a limited number of types of eggs, recognisable by specific figures.
According to the German authorities, the quantity of toxic substances in small and adult eggs does not pose, but the potential threat is for children.
Petr M, a spokesman for the Czech JRC, said that eggs and chicken from the Netherlands and Belgium, where the authorities also joined the closing of breeding, have not been imported to the Czech Republic recently.
However, sample samples of eggs and chicken from Belgium, the Netherlands, France, Italy, Germany and Poland, on whose markets the problem marks of insecticide have appeared, shall be taken by the veterinarians.
The eggs from Belgium were the last in April and the eggs from the Netherlands in May, according to the Veterinary administration on the Czech market.
Chicken meat from Belgium was last discovered in the Czech Republic in June.
However, in the Czech Republic there is a certain amount of chicken meat from the Netherlands.
Fipronil is a substance that is part of the flea, all and tick medicines.
However, they must not be administered to animals whose meat is consumed by humans.
The World Health Organization WHO considers the preparation to be mildly toxic.
Its high doses lead to nausea and dizziness.
Riga is beautiful, I will miss, says goalkeeper Sedláček and looking for engagement.
I still want to catch ten years.
"Maybe someday I'll come back," said 27letý Sedláček, who could start the season in Zlín jersey.
It depends on whether the new year starts gaining engagement.
What were the four years you spent in Latvia?
If I had to evaluate it at school, three.
I didn't catch the first year, I had an experienced goalie before me.
I was learning.
The second year I started to catch.
The third season I thought they'd give me more space.
But they brought a new goalie with whom I alternated again.
Last year, I assumed I was still catching.
But during the introductory ten games we only gained five points, so the coaches started to spin.
At the end, he was more caught by my colleague.
But that's how it's done.
They wanted to ohrát him for the next season.
How was life in Riga?
Wonderful.
It's a little Prague.
Beautiful, European, historic city.
I'll miss him.
I found a girlfriend there.
We're a third year together, we'll be married next year.
So I brought something up.
How challenging is KHL for goalkeeper?
The first ten teams are really good quality.
Then there are teams like us or Slovan that must change their playing style.
The skill is on the other hand, so you have to replace it with something.
That means playing more backwards, fighting harder.
I didn't see a problem in the pitch.
The difference is that the Russians want to play empty.
They shoot less, and even if they have a poloprázdnou goal in front of them, they'd rather upload.
In the Czech Republic, there is more to shoot.
Didn't you have a problem traveling and moving over seven time zones?
If a man has no family, it's not a problem.
He can sleep in peace.
The Program is usually made so that you play four matches outdoors and then you have two days off.
How do Latvians perceive their club in KHL?
As a national team.
The whole of Latvia is watching hockey, along with basketball it's a national sport.
Cheers everybody.
Even though it was not successful, a lot of people went.
Has the action of Dinama in KHL helped to ensure that Latvia almost progressed to the quarterfinals at this year's world championships?
KHL has been playing since 2008 and Dinamo is there from the beginning.
And from the same time their results on the world championships have begun to go up.
At the 2014 Olympics in Sochi they fell in the quarterfinals with Canada just 1:2.
That was an unreal result for them.
Thanks to KHL, they got to the next level.
More and more Latvian players head to the Czech major league.
Roberts Bukarts was promoted in Zlín, and he is Ralfs Freibergs before signing the contract.
Why do they come here so much?
They're no béčkoví players, they're really good.
The local teams are looking for cheaper and younger players from abroad, Latvians among them.
It's a natural direction.
KHL starts in three weeks.
Why are you still without engagement?
At the beginning of February I knew I would not continue in Riga.
That's why we started looking for something.
There was Sparta on the table.
But because they didn't have a budget for goalie, we agreed.
Then it was a classic.
We had fun with different teams, but they decided to do something for someone else in the final.
So practising home in Zlín and I'll be waiting for something to appear.
Aren't you nervous about this?
I was four years ago when I left here and didn't know what was going To be.
The current situation is not the best, on the other hand I am at home after a while.
I caught something in KHL, so I'm taking it differently.
The question only sounds when and where I sign.
How real is the variant that the new year will go in Zlín?
Anything can happen.
Let's see what will be in the month where you vyvrbí.
Now I can just wait for the agent to talk.
Do you prefer a contest?
The last season was not so much to choose.
So I'm waiting for the phone.
The government drift continues in the years.
In January of this year I am in an article with due diligence? He wrote MJ. And the camp in the years of Orlík.
The essence of the problem remains the same, so I allow the pivotal passages of the article to remind.
We've been talking about camp in years.
For readers who do not know exactly what is going on, it will probably be best if they look eg. On the official site of the Cultural Monument Memorial Place flights.
There, in the introduction of the historical overview, they learn that the camp was two kilometres east of the village years ago that from 8. 8.1940 served as a labour camp, from 1. 1.1942 was a collection camp and from 2. 8.1942 became a cikánským camp.
The next text describes the course of life in Tábor, including inhuman conditions, until March 1943, when the first Letští prisoners were included in the osvětimského transport.
On 4 May 2004. 5.1943 the largest transport to the extermination camp was transported 370 persons.
In total there were 420.
A very sad history of the immense hardships of human beings that caused them to turn human beings and perverse ideologies.
It is not disputed that these events must be constantly reminded.
There is no dispute or that such a reminder should take place at the memorial at the site experienced the suffering of these people.
The problem is elsewhere.
In socialism, the camp was somehow forgotten and at 70. Years 20. The century was in the vicinity and part of the former camp built Vepřín.
The history of Tábor was randomly discovered in 1992 by American Paul Lansky, in the year 1995 was a monument in the years.
In the middle of 90. Years 20. Century promised the government the buyout and demolition of Vepřína, but so far has not happened.
In 1998, the monument was declared a cultural monument, and since 2009 its administration falls under the Lidice memorial.
In July 2013 the United Nations Committee on Human Rights called on the Czech Republic to close the Vepřín.
So many very succinct facts about the postwar fate of the camp.
Until last fall, the government approved the buyout of Vepřína and decided to draw up an expert opinion to determine the price.
According to the Minister of Agriculture, the Vepřín government then buys.
According to the Minister of Culture Herman, "some numbers exist, but I would probably thwart those intentions if I went to the public with them."
Let's see what the expert opinion will bring.
Some unofficial estimates may be hundreds of millions, according to others, the price can reach as much as a billion.
Anyway, it's not going to be a cheap affair.
And only a few hundred meters from the former camp stands a monument, to which the state invested almost ten million crowns in 2010.
Even if the entire transaction was financed by the UN Human Rights Committee, which is probably not the case, it would have been the same way of throwing money.
Doesn't the government have other priorities?
The memorial, a dignified place of worship, is worth the will of history practically in the immediate vicinity of the tragedy and anyone who wants to be able to worship the memory of the suffering and the murdered.
I see no reason to change this!
Let's leave it as it is, and keep the place of piety with the utmost care.
Entrusted property, i.e. taxpayers ' money, should be treated by a responsible person, in this case the Government of the Czech Republic, with due diligence.
At least with such as in your own company!
Of course, the Treasury Secretary and Deputy Prime Minister are not the whole government.
But even so, from the perspective of the above, I perceive the password of the leader of the movement yes only as an empty electoral proclamation.
This may I have come to see the place directly.
Very decent driveway, modified car park, replicas of wooden camp houses.
In one exposition, in the second integrated WC with running water.
A small natural amphitheatre with a seating area and a view of its own sacred place, which is made from stones placed on a gentle slope.
Lots of flowers and wreaths.
All attributes corresponding to the meaning of this place as befits and belongs.
There is currently an archaeological research in the place of the original camp.
It would be reasonable to consider whether, for example, A part of the uncovered foundations to be preserved and at least visually accessible in an appropriate manner.
In this way, the culture minister Daniel Herman could strain his efforts.
In the event that he manages to push a buyout of vepřína for state money in the government, it will be just another unfortunate step in his already quite problematic tenure as Minister of Culture.
Red meat, dairy products and chocolate can alleviate the symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)
For your digestive system, red meat and dairy products can be a nightmare.
But the new study suggests the opposite: a diet rich in animal protein and dairy products could help relieve the symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease.
An incurable disease that affects up to 1.3 million U.S. residents and 300 000 patients in the UK, causes abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
Patients are usually reminded to alleviate the symptoms of nepožívali meat and dairy products. However, the researchers at Washington University found that the essential amino acid tryptophan contained in the protein helps create immune cells that support bowel resistance.
A study director, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells protect the intestines and ensure the degradation of harmful microbes from food.
The number of inflammatory cells is balanced by the number of cells that support tolerance and protect the body without impairs sensitive tissue.
Inflammatory bowel disease may occur once the scales have been tilted to the side of the inflammation.
As part of the research researchers found the presence of immune cells supporting body tolerance in the stomach mice with specific bacteria.
This bacterium requires the presence of tryptophan-one of the building blocks of proteins to create cells.
Professor Colonna said: "We found a connection between one species of bacteria-Lactobacillus reuteri-which is a common part of the intestinal microbiome and the development of cells that support body tolerance.
The more tryptophan they had mice in their diet, the more they had these immune cells. "
At the same time, he suggested that if it turns out that the same applies to humans, then the combination of L. reuteri and diet rich in tryptophan helped develop permissive and less inflammatory intestinal environment.
Postgraduate researcher Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barraganwasová in the study of a certain type of immune cells supporting body tolerance, it appeared that one group of test mice had these cells, while the other group of identical mice kept separate cells Lacked.
It deduced from the fact that one group of mice has different intestinal mikrobiom-a community of bacteria, viruses and fungi that commonly dwell in the gastrointestinal tract.
The intestines were tested by the method of DNA sorting and researchers found six types of bacteria in mice with immune cells that lacked a second group of mice.
Mice, which were bred in a sterile environment and lacked them intestinal mikrobiom-they did not develop this type of immune cells-they were given the bacteria L. reuteri-and they formed the immune cells.
To understand how the bacterium affects the immune system, the researchers have cultivated L. reuteri in the fluid and then transferred a small amount of fluid-free bacteria-to undeveloped immune cells that were kept in isolation.
The immune cells have evolved into tolerant cells.
After removal of the active ingredient from the liquid it was shown that it is a byproduct of tryptofanového metabolism known as indolyl acid-3-acetic.
When researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the mouse diet, the number of these cells rose by 50 percent. At the same time, recommends halving doses tryptophan decreased by half the number of cells.
Dr. Cervantes-Barraganová explained that people have the same tolerant cells as mice and most of us keep the bacteria L. reuteri in their gastrointestinal tract.
It is not known if by-products tryptophan from the L. reuteri bacteria cause cell development in humans in the same way as in mice, but defects in tryptophan genes have been found in people with inflammatory bowel disease.
Dr. Cervantes-Barraganová added: "Each of us should probably strive to develop these cells because they control the inflammatoryness of the inner surface of the intestines.
A potentially high level of tryptophan in the presence of L. reuteri may increase the population of cells. "
José Mourinho regards the signing of the contract with Nemanjem Matićem and his transfer to Manchester United for ' genius '
Manchester United got to his team "genius" in the form of Nemanja Matiće-at least he thinks José Mourinho after the midfielder debuted in the Wednesday's match against Sampdorii.
Matić, who signed a 40 million contract, said at the first match a 2:1 prize in Dublin-the last pre-season match before the UEFA Superpohárem, where United meeted on Tuesday with real Madrid-and acted as a midfielder alongside Paul Pogby and Andreas Pereira.
However, since he did not participate in the team's pre-season Asian Tour, Matić had no form and played for only 45 minutes, which, in the words of Mourinho, must be worked out before the start of the next Premier League season.
"He needs time, but he's experienced, intelligent and has genius thinking – he thinks football," Mourinho said.
"We'll help him get in shape as soon as possible."
Like Matić, his new teammates Victor Lindelöf and Romelu Luka also played the first game at Aviva Stadium, and Mourinho is slowly starting to shape his 11th for the next season.
An independent resource announced this week that Mourinho wants to continue to sign a contract with three other players, but insists that the club did a "fantastic job" and brought three of the four most important players to the team.
"Thank you to the club that helped me to get three of the four players," he added.
"Four of the four would please me more, but I accept that they did the best for me."
The life challenge of the King of chicken cuticles Lada pears.
He wants a lesson from Pohlreich!
The Mnohoslibný picture started take shape thanks to a new show on the TV Prima Zdeněk's Academy.
Pear immediately sniffed the chance.
"Dear Zdeněk, I would like to sign up for your cooking academy because you, my hand, I think I can learn a lot from you," he said in a video on the social network.
And since the two of them have been peaking for several years, Lada forgot to irritate him this time.
"In return, I can teach you Znojmo-based of diet chicken, American cucumbers, or invite you to water and show you why it's a favorite of fried cheese," rýpnul the pear.
His participation in Pohlreichově new show really means serious.
It's time to move up a level and learn from the master.
"The question is, what about the boss," said Lightning.
Pohlreich did not comment, because he filmed new parts of his next show Yes, Boss!.
For the participation of pears in the Culinary academy, she responded only Prima, taking the whole affair as his personal activity, which goes off the TV.
A great blow planted the pear Pohlreichovi in December 2004 with her first cookbook.
In a few days, she sold over 300 thousand pieces!
The new show, which was released yesterday Prima at a press conference for the autumn Broadcasting scheme, is the genuine school of cooking.
Pohlreich chooses his pupils from among spectators, and in twelve parts he acquaints with twelve toques techniques.
The last part of his show is now brewed by the boss in November 2014, Zdeněk he gave his trick to iron přeškrtnutoued pear on his back.
If he had my face there, I'd be laughing a lot.
"Just a smile over the pear-pear is a healthy fruit and has plenty of vitamins," replied Lada.
They think of Láďově culinary art.
"Cook by Lada Pears don't even come at home, because I don't let the Gastropunk," my boss is clear.
Zdenek Pohlreich I really appreciate it, even I'm making a chicken for honey.
But his recipes will not appear in my show, "forgive the pear.
He's a moron!
He's not a cook for me, he's a TV clown.
"A gastronomic illiterate or an idiot," said Pohlreich, about a pear in one lecture.
"I'm not twenty to wave the hands of them, but I don't solve them anymore," said vyřčených insults.
The British inventor uses the microchip in his hand to unlock the car and the house by wave
The British inventor became the first person in the country with a microchip vpraveným into the body. The simple wave of the hand can unlock the door from the house and office and even start the car.
Třiatřicetiletý Steven Northam left a tiny chip implant between his thumb and forefinger and currently offers the same service through his company to BioTeq companies and individuals who want to use technology to make life easier.
The procedure of implantation and compliance with medical procedures is supervised by Dr. Geoff Watson, the anesthesia Hospital for Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester.
The technology works on the same principle as microchips implanted dogs and cats and the whole procedure lasts 30 seconds.
Northamova Company also offers a service of door and car locks, compatible with the microchip. The price of one lock is £300.
The married father of one child had the technology integrated into his house and his car, the BMW Z4, which he started with a simple wave of his hand.
White House prop cost taxpayers thousands of dollars
The White House decision to fly with the Navy helicopter at South Lawn to commemorate the American manufacturing industry, which took place last month, came according to the records of the Navy, published by TIME magazine, at 24 000 $.
The greener Sikorsky VH-3d helicopter, also known as the Marine One in the presence of the President on board, was the culmination of a program from the 17th July in the White House, which was a showcase of American construction programs.
President Donald Trump, vice president of Mike Pence, and several senior White House officials obhlíželi a showcase of products from all 50 states.
The Connecticut helicopter was exhibited next to a yacht from Maine, a fire car from Wisconsin and a vidlicovitého button lift cart from Mississippi.
A White House military officer issued a fragmentary order or frag, and applied for a helicopter presence of less than 36 hours before the helicopter landed on South Lawn as part of an "extraordinary" event, the records reported Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1) Responsible for helicopter management.
"I wanted to make sure you had an awareness of such a significant event," wrote Commander HMX-1 in an email to his superior, deputy commander of the Navy's aviation day before the start of the event.
The report indicated that the helicopter would arrive at South Lawn 17. On 1 July 7:00, the show was scheduled to start at 15:00 and will remain in place until the complete clearing of the whole place, planned between 18:00 and 21:00.
In the e-mail, it was also said that if there was a delay in departure from the White House, a replacement crew will be sent for the return flight due to the working time regulations.
The original crew remained on the spot that evening, along with the helicopter, and together with them a unit of security workers.
From the records-which was won by TIME magazine-it was not noticeable if the second crew was finally seconded.
The Hatch ACT prevents state officials from using government property for political purposes.
Records indicate that HMX-1 investigates possible violations of this regulation.
"We were wondering if it was a violation of the Hatch Act and we were reassured that everything is in order," the commander wrote.
"It sounds like they've blocked you," the deputy commander wrote back.
This "Made in America" show was marked as an official event by the White House and the Hatch Act would not apply to it.
But even official events have political subtexts.
In his participation in the event, the president pursued a medical reform that was passed by the Senate and spoke of the effort to keep the government decrees at bay.
The use of air transport means such as Marine One or Air Force one for political purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.
Presidents use them when traveling.
But their presence purely for presentation reasons is unusual.
Trump ordered a check in February after the presidential plane drove in the background during his first first meeting in a campaign in Melbourne, Florida. His Twitter account is overwhelmed by complaints about the use of the presidential plane by his predecessors.
"The White House is delighted by the parade of ' Made in America ', which introduced products from all the 50 states that Americans produce from American materials," said Deputy press secretary Lindsay Walters.
The HMX-1 helicopter crews often train landing in the Washington area and South Lawn, and practice possible arrivals with the President of the United States to the White House with maximum precision.
While Trump took part in the G-20 summit at the beginning of July in Germany, HMX-1 made a 58 training landing at the White House.
A flight to show Made in America was part of the crew's current training, state officials said.
The same day, the helicopter unit flew another eleven hours in the "nonpresidential support missions".
The White House said the taxpayers ' money was not covered by any other props.
The Sikorsky spokesman said the company was not in any way engage in in the helicopter exposure negotiations at South Lawn.
HMX-1 does not keep a budget record for presidential flights and the exact costs in connection with the parade are difficult to determine according to the Navy's observations.
According to the Ministry of Defense, the hourly price for the fiscal year is 2017, reimbursement of DoD expenses for VH-3d 24 380 $ per flight hour.
The Unit records shall indicate a time of 30 minutes from the base of the Marine Corps Air facility Quantico in Virginia and back.
The White House argues that the actual operating costs of the helicopter are significantly below the stated amount.
"Putting taxpayers ' costs on the basis of estimates for reimbursement of expenses is very misleading," Walters said to the whole thing.
"These estimates include personnel, maintenance and many other hidden costs that are included in the annual cost."
According to a 2015 RAND study, reimbursement of DoD expenses does not include personnel costs, but includes fuel price, maintenance and contract costs.
Then the White House press Secretary Sean Spicer defended the use of the helicopter for parade purposes.
"The Idea of the show that takes place this week is to present the products produced in the U.S.," Spicer said.
"I am aware that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud of the fact that they contribute to the defense of our state and that they provide work to hundreds, if not thousands of people.
I think, like most Americans, that we pride ourselves on helicopters and other military facilities whose production is involved in countless American citizens.
This fact is to be recalled. "
It's not clear if Trump was to look for a helicopter during his walk to South Lawn. It is certainly only possible to say that he sat behind the wheel of one of the fire wagons.
Back in the White House Trump approached a representative of Sikorsky and quipped with the media about their own fleet of products.
"I know the Sikorsky very well," said the president, "his own three."
A young woman grounded off in a swamp near Macha Lake, the police brodila to her.
The girl set off to the beach on Sunday roughly around the second hour of the morning.
Instead of bathing, she remained trapped in wetlands.
When she decided to ask a mobile phone for help from a police officer, she had the last 12 percent of the battery.
"For that reason, the police soon lost their connection," said the police spokesman Ivan Jodie.
There were a few police patrols, but finding a young woman was not easy at all.
"Some of the policemen had to Wade Reed wetlands hundreds of meters before they felt solid ground again," Jodie approached.
And so was the missing.
The police were oriented according to the direction of her call for help.
"Not to lose this connection at least," said the spokesman, talking to her that he would be counted aloud.
The cops found the woman in the three quarters of five in the swamps of the born.
She was on the verge of physical and psychological forces and seemed to be undercooled.
That's why an ambulance převezla to Českolipské hospital.
Old man join the tent?
The wanted bride becomes a selling girl.
That's a little ironic.
His web-project hledameslusny.cz as though billionaire voters basically say that STAN suffers from a deficit of decent people.
And Stvrzoval, too, that a politically disparateed bunch of lesser-known mayors and Independents, in fact, has no national program for Sněmovní elections.
Her electoral candidate simply becomes a decent person after an interview with Dědkem, whatever political opinion he has.
This was the beginning of Vit Bárta, and it was very polite to nedopadlo.
Their quick on decent people and personalities, which Kandidátkách eventually replace some mayors, which also admitted Gazdík, the old man also abolished the popular argument of the head of STAN, that the greatest value of the movement is the political examination and experienced mayors, traditionally Most popular politicians as well as surveys.
Now they're gonna take a quick collected of the unknown personality.
A total breakup with the people, after which STAN changed the logo and slogan, Gazdík explained that the movement does not want to lose the kandidátkách lidovců its identity.
But if the suspected identity of the tent was no more than few, only a game of identity ends after the arrival of old man.
Not only Gazdík long defined against ANO Andrei Babiše, but at the first joint press conference, the old man, who Babiše publicly praised, said, as follows: "My goal is to make the movement yes, so the mayoral movement has won twenty per cent in the forthcoming elections."
Let's hope he didn't get confused with the movement.
The old man is a successful entrepreneur and the billionaire is certainly not by chance.
They often talk about politics like Babiš, but, unlike it, it does not build its own political brand.
The tent has been reminded of a reality show for some time than a real political party, and a Dědkova helping hand seemed to be making the wanted bride even more a sales girl.
For some time went STAN with TOP 09, then with the people and now for a change looking for decent people.
Hopefully someone will hear you.
Police dogs practised by helicopter in the bridge
Explosives search dogs and search dogs today rehearsed the bridge by helicopter over the lake.
The police dog must not be timid and be afraid of flying, said Petr Tomáš, head of police kynologů of the Ústí region.
The police dog's training lasts about two years.
At the bridge, both adults practise dogs, so those who are still trained.
In addition to the standard training, in which they were supposed to detect sharp samples of explosives in the vicinity of the lake and search for a lost figurant, all 12 animals had to get into the helicopter and fly over the lake.
The main purpose of the exercise is to test the dogs in the helicopter.
So that immediately, what the chopper can go, the dog could work to have no problem with the helicopter trip.
"The chopper will be there, the dog is looking," said Thomas.
A dog that is restless or on the way by a helicopter is not able to start working right away, is removed from training.
"They usually keep handlers for example in the garden," added Thomas.
The police have 76 dogs with various specializations in the Ústí region.
German sheepdogs, as well as the Belgian shepherds, are prevalent.
The handler cares for him from the puppy.
"He's raising it himself, preparing it for the service the dog will do for us," added Thomas.
The animal undergoes repeated veterinary examinations which may reveal potential health handicaps.
If the dog is healthy and nebázlivý, the first test consists of 20 months.
"It's about two and a half to three years into a sharp hit," added Thomas.
The length of service in the police depends on the health of the dog.
They usually serve within eight to ten years.
They usually live with their dog handlers.

According to the UN, Afghan democracy relies on women in politics
Elections can be credible only if all members of society, including women, participate in the centre of the UN representative in Afghanistan.
Nicholas Haysom, the head of the UN auxiliary mission, said the elections to local councils are attended by hundreds of women, three women aspiringing for the post of vice president and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women.

The local and presidential elections in Afghanistan are held on 5. April.
Taliban has published several threats against the electoral process that moves international combat activity to the second college.
In this year's election, one democratically elected government passes its power to the next government for the first time.
Haysom said the strong role of women will strengthen Afghanistan's democracy.
The Afghan Independent Electoral Commission said 1.2 million women in the total of 3.6 million registered voters.
The unique brewery boils beer again.
Good beer to the Znovuvzkříšeného brewery.
The enthusiasm and honesty of the new owners returned a few years ago to the life of the brewery in Lobči near Mseno.
The Připomínaný brewery for the first time in 1586 has a renaissance nucleus and in the nineteenth century was rebuilt to steam engine operation.
It was followed by years of heyday, when the brewery was famous mainly for dark beers.
Unfortunately, the production was stopped during the Second World War and in 1984 the brewery was nationalized.
Since then, the buildings have served the State farm.
The work of destruction was accomplished by the Brewers ' owners after the year 1989.
The abandoned area was Devastován and reassembly for building materials.
In 2007 but Svitla new hopes in the form of new owners, architects Jana and Pavel Prouzových.
They began repairing buildings with maximum respect for the spirit of the building and every detail.
They carefully dedicated and dedicated to the study of archival materials, trying to preserve the original materials and building elements.
The brewery has the same form as in the nineteenth century, when its golden era started.
Their work was appreciated by a declaration of the Brewery for Cultural heritage by the Ministry of Culture and the building was also part of European industrial heritage trails.
In 2015, they also inaugurated the tradition of brewing beer.
To taste the great Lobečské beer in the picturesque countryside of Kokořínsko, visit the pub in the brewery area.

In the bar you'll taste traditional pale lager as well as dark beers and specials.
And do not miss a tour of the brewery, it takes place on Saturdays and Sundays at noon and at half-second.
The largest artillery fortress in Czechoslovakia?
One of the biggest strengths of its type on a global scale?
This unique structure was to be the fortress Stachelberg between Trutnov and Žacléřem, on top of the terrain ridge above the village Indian.
It was originally intended to consist of up to twelve bunkers connected by an extensive underground.
There was supposed to be headquarters, barracks, ammunition storage, material, power plant, engine room and hospital.
But the Munich agreement ended the construction.
In less than a year, a single massive reinforced concrete bunker was erected and vylámányed underground spaces.
Thanks to enthusiasts from the Stachelberg, who began to reconstruct the unique construction in the beginning of the 1990s, you can also see here.

Get to know the plant with one click.
Students with the creation of herbářů and ordinary plant lovers will be assisted by a new Free Application Pl @ ntNet.
When they are interested in which plant they just ran into a walk, this application will advise them.
All they have to do is photograph the plant and the application itself recognizes what kind it is.
The new application, which is available for both IOS and Android, was presented on Tuesday by the representatives of the center of Ethical and Environmental education CEEV in Bratislava Mountain Park within the project secret Life of the city.
The project was also joined by pupils from 50 Czech and Slovak schools, who with teachers took photographs and added plants from their surroundings to the database of the application.
The newly formed French application is a free download on the site of the secret Life of the city.
The main goal of French programmers was to make as many people as possible contribute their images to the application, thus increasing the number of plants that the application can recognize.
"The children who keep the tablet or mobile in hand can go into the woods," said Ivan Pacana, the coordinator of this project.
Based on a sufficiently high quality photograph of flower, leaf or fruit of the plant, the application can recognize its name in a few seconds, which is then assigned under the photograph in Czech and Slovak.
The French allowed us to translate the application into Slovak and Czech in the secret Life of the city project.
It is therefore welcome for users to contribute a snapshot of a plant that is not yet present in the database when the account is created in the application.
"The French will evaluate if it is beneficial and then add it to the database," said Pacana.
Concerns GMB about investing in the McVitie's factory in Glasgow
Unions require assurance from the managers of the McVitie's biscuit manufacturer about the long-term commitment of production at the Glasgow factory.
The Scottish Trade union GMB stated that the company was silent for the time being in the Tollcross.
There are more than 500 employees in the factory who produce Hobnob and Rich Tea biscuits among other products.
The owner of McVitie's, the Pladis company, said it has invested more than £5 million in the entire area over the past few years.
She added that the employees and trade union representatives would be "among the first informed" in the case of changes in the plant's operations.
In a letter to the Stavbyvedoucímu Society, the Scottish unions GMB their fears that McVitie's "won't get its promises to finance and modernize production lines."
The main organizer of GMB Drew Duffy added: "The fact that we did not receive clear answers from assistant contract manager regarding the company's needs and the future investment plan in Tollcross is very troubling to our members.
Many families have worked here, and the majority of employees come from the local community and Glasgow, where work at the factory is a critical pillar of decent employment in the area of high unemployment and social separation.
From the perspective of labor, salaries, and benefits--and despite the outlook for Brexit, risinging the cost of living and decreasing slow production--the eastern part of Glasgow needs a desperately prosperous producer like McVitie's. "
A spokesman for Pladis said: "Supervisor Tollcross received a letter from GMB only yesterday and the company will issue a statement as soon as possible, as we value a continuing commitment to employees and union representatives.
Regular meetings with employees and representatives of the GMB in Tollcross took place two months ago and at this meeting was openly hovořeno about many problems.
We talked to employees that, as in all companies operating in extremely competitive and uncertain economic conditions, evaluate our operation on a regular basis, which is true for all our operations, so that we can continue to compete successfully Other.
It added: "In recent years, we have invested £5 million in the Tollcross area, especially in production lines and streamlining operations.
We highly value the heritage of Tollcrossu and locality and in case of any changes in operation of the factory, employees and trade union representatives will be informed immediately. "
Did PSG Barcelona warn about moving Neymar three years ago?
La Liga will perhaps regret your interest in Marco Verrattiho
Paris Saint-Germain will not permit in its attempt to acquire Neymar on its side after it has folded 189 million, the amount needed to redeem Neymar from the treaty, but has warned this French Barcelona team about its record raid three years ago?
This sensational transfer stirred the water of summer transfers. The Ligue 1 club is ready to surpass more than double the previous record amount for the transfer of Paul Pogby to Manchester United, who paid 89 million for him last season.
After confirming and completing the transfer, Neymar becomes the most expensive player in the world and the best-paid professional athlete in the world-after tax, PSG will receive 500 000 £ a week from the team.
Barcelona is outraged by the way Neymar unleashed his contract, despite the fact that the confidential source confirmed that the club had always tried to Neymarovi in everything from his arrival from Santos in 2013.
But was the football world alerted to this fact three years ago by the president of PSG?
When Manchester City expressed its interest in the year 2014 on Blaise Matuidiho, Nasser Al-Khelaifi warned all of the club that would be interested in avoiding one of the best PSG players.
"I'm not afraid, because once someone tries to get one of our players, then we certainly we address one of their players," said Al-Khelaifi.
"We respect all the clubs.
But if they try to get one of our players, they will face the consequences. "
It seems that Barcelona has crossed the imaginary border when she expressed interest in a backup by PSG Marc Verrattiho in the summer.
PSG has made a clear voice in the sense that it will not allow the departure of Italian representative under any circumstances. It is therefore possible that Barcelona for its presumptuous negotiations now with the departure of Neymar swallows a bitter pill.
Who explains the penalties?
Does political punishment have widely understandable rules?
Donald Trump nodded against Russian sanctions.
The day before, the US embargoed sanctions for Venezuelan President Maduro.
And a day earlier Trump wrote that China did nothing to North Korean the threat, and that it would not go on.
Even oozes thought of sanctions like straw from shoes.
These things can't be thrown in one bag.
Madurova Venezuela really set off on the path to dictatorship, even totalitarianism.
China will only leave the way that the US President wished.
Russia is a chapter to itself.
But if it were to be summed up so that even a normal voter, American, European, or otherwise, understood what it was and what rule system was based on sanctions, it would be almost impossible.
In the sanctions against Russia, Trump only renachystals what President Obama has already done, he just gave an implementing stamp.
So why the fuss?
Last year, Europe was terrified of winning America's Trump election, embracing Putin, and withdrawing sanctions.
A horrible idea.
In practice, however, it is the opposite.
With Trump, sanctions are not released but tightened.
But Europe is even more frightened.
German minister Zypries says that Trumpovy sanctions violate international law.
How kosher are the sanctions approved by the UN Security Council?
But the EU's Antirussian sanctions are not kosher.
European Commission head Juncker complains that Trumpovy sanctions endanger the EU's energy security.
Is it as if sanctions are to be used only so weak that they do not jeopardize anyone?
Common selector grope.
Three years heard that the fate of Antirussian sanctions depends only on the implementation of the Minsk ceasefire agreements in Ukraine.
It is now dovídá that this is the EU's energy security.
The grope selector is also wider.
Sanctions come to Russia for being too assembled where it doesn't.
China is hubována to be mounted poorly.
The Venezuelan president is punished for building a dictatorship in the borders of his country.
All those punishments, or just reflections, have their rationality.
But does anyone see a system, order or rule?
Andrei Babiš: I do not consider cooperation with Okamurou.
Andrei Babiš married, crosses Republic with his visionary book and is currently finalizing electoral program.
In addition to the Pardubice region, all the candidates are ready.
According to their words, they did not significantly interfere.
He even agreed to Moravskoslezskou the governor and the shadow Minister of Education Yes Ivo Vadhera.
"But if he succeeds, he will have to choose whether he wants to be a deputy or a governor," he confirmed his earlier opinion of Babiš.
A lot of representatives and national politicians have upset your theses that directly elected mayors and mayors should drive municipalities and cities themselves, only with managers.
You mean that?
It wasn't like that.
I am a fan of direct democracy, we choose the President directly, and I believe that we should also vote for mayors and mayors alike.
I'm not talking about canceling representatives in my book, they can be there.
The question is, how many will be.
In presenting your book about what I dream of, when I happen to sleep, I hear on my own ears that you talked about the abolition of councils.
I don't remember.
I was talking about the direct choice and reduction of the number of representatives.
New York, with nine million inhabitants, has five districts and 51 representatives.
Prague with 1.2 million citizens has 1171 representatives.
And the mayor is summing up that she has little to build and not prepare large projects, but she has no competence for it.
The same is true of the government, which was managed only by two people in our history, Klaus and Zeman.
I'm not saying they did it well.
But the current prime Minister does not obey anything, he merely moderates the debate.
So it can't work.
Is that why you want to enforce a majority system?
It would be ideal, but it's hard to get through.
In the program we have only a change to Jednokolovou choice in the Senate.
We have also proposed a sliding mandate for ministers and an adaptation of the chamber's rules of procedure to prevent unnecessary exhibicím of MEPs to work mainly in commissions and committees, not to show off at chamber meetings.
It is certainly not true that I want to destruovat the parliamentary system.
But that's exactly what your opponents are worried about.
That as a dictator you will manage the government, control the deputies with 101 deputies, cancel the shire and the Senate, and through grateful mayors and mayors you have mastered the whole country.
I'm sure it's not.
There's nothing wrong with debating the number of MEPs.
French President Macron reported the reduction of the legislature by one-third, while there are 57 thousand Frenchs per legislature, while in our country it is based on 17 thousand Czechs.
But no one accuses Macrona of endangering democracy.
Even if someone won the election majority in the Czech Republic, we have mechanisms that would prevent him from making any dramatic changes.
Leads for whoever has a parliamentary majority are great, just look into Poland or Hungary.
No such thing in the case of a movement yes.
We just need a team that will work in government for people, not for their parties or resorts.
I do not understand why we have failed to agree that only salaries of teachers, staff in culture and social services will be raised.
Why have they overvoted me and added 21% to the members of GIBS who already take 60 thousand?
Would you like a Prime minister?
The Prime Minister has to intervene when ministers behave imeconomically, confuse government with the travel agency, and for the money of the state would like to take as Marian Jurecka, who wanted to buy forests in Romania and land in Africa.
Ministers are not supposed to argue in government, and contradictions are to be called out.
There must be a finished material in the cabinet, where there is no room for a coalition split, a force vote and a deal, there is a decision to make.
How do you want to have a cohesive team when ministers behave mainly in the party?
The constitutional law is above the parties.
When it came to the breaking of bread, Sobotka said that the Coalition treaty did not apply and set off the Babiše of the government.
This can be done by every prime minister.
But if he is a personality and has managerial abilities, similar false gestures are not needed.
It measures everyone as well and requires perfect performance from all.
Do you know who you would suggest to the Treasury Secretary?
I don't think about it, because we don't think we'll even be in that government, nobody wants to work with us, even if I don't know what I've done.
So much skepticism is not in place.
The mayors have acquired entrepreneurs old man, who would like to cooperate with you, at Lidovců may win the wing to you inclined Jiří Čunek.
I don't think so.
The Social Democrats are led by Lubomir, who does not rule out the coalition, and in the ODS, Václav Klaus Jr., who will not be opposed, will be able to do so.
I'd leave it on the voters.
Deputy Prime Minister and vice chairman Yes Richard Brabec said that you have many common points with the SPD Tomia Okamury, for example in the field of economics.
So Okamurovci come into consideration as a coalition partner?
Mr. Brabec says he didn't say it like that.
Mr. Okamura has his political history, he ran as a puppet vít Bárta for VV, then he gained money for his company from the dawn, there was a coup.
He's a distinct personality, of course.
But rather brownish.
When I take his program, there is a wide involvement of people in the management of the company, a direct democracy that can be agreed.
I'm not asking you to do that.
Am I interested in whether you are an acceptable person who has xenophobic opinions, may rant on demonstrations with gallows and wants to get out of the EU?
We don't think about cooperation with Mr Okamury, I can't imagine.
Obviously, he went into politics to profit from it.
What about the silent support of the communists to your minority government?
I can't imagine that, but they decide the voters.
It will be about negotiating the winner with the second in order, but God knows who will be the winner and who the deuce.
Of course, it is important that they be able to agree on a coalition government program.
Let us return to your quest to manage the state as a company.
But the government just has to follow, Minister Sobotka left everything to rot, never decided.
Coalition issues such as CEB or EGAP did not work.
After all, Sobotka is his puppet, and that was the reason why he threw me out.
As soon as he did so, ČEZ dominated the Czech government.
It is unbelievable that the Prime Minister brought a resolution written by ČEZ Management, which obliges the Minister of Finance to vote at the general meeting of Čez.
If you become prime minister, you change the staffing conditions on the supervisory board and change the top management of ČEZ?
Christ, if I'm going to be prime minister, he'll see.
I'm not that yet.
Grapevine that ČEZ has already sent signals in your direction.
Good cooperation with the CSSD would like to exchange for even better with Yes.
For example, after the election, everything goes on.
I don't know anything about it.
I have no lobbyist of humble or Růžičku, I am a separate unit and I do not solve this at all.
Then answer directly.
If you become the head of the government, will you seek to exchange the leadership of ČEZ, Czech television or the general health insurer, the institutions you criticize?
I would like ČEZ to be a transparent company.
So far, he has been doing what he wanted for years, thanks to commissions for traditional political parties.
It is enough to trace the statements of Mr Schwarzenberg.
Although he has a state in ČEZ majority, he never drove him, he was only in number, which is wrong.
It's a trivial matter for me.
ČEZ has taken Dukovany, valued them, shove them into subsidiaries, arrange funding, make a supply competition or get a co-investor and build a new nuclear block.
The concept that the State has to fund and build new nuclear blocks is absurd.
and Czech television?
Some of her shows are leading a permanent purpose campaign against me, but I don't have any competence to throw someone out.
But to dominate yes.
I don't want to control anyone.
I'm just saying that citizens pay about 7.2 billion a year for public radio and television, but they don't really know how these institutions manage.
How do they not know?
The Chamber of Deputies approves the report on their management, which has a direct influence on the positions of the Directors-General of CT and Czech radio.
Look how these messages are discussed, the Super Power pact Sobotka Kalousek, who always worked.
This applies both to the current parliamentary Commission on the evasion of the investigative files and to the Lex Babiš.
and Sobotka was so stupid that he let Kalousek push to throw me out of the government, which won a percentage of TOP 09, but the CSSD is Ubralo.
They are afraid of disrupting their corrupt system, so they talk about the threat of Babišem democracy.
No one is immune.
What do you say to articles describing how the first Vice-president Yes Jaroslav Faltynek is building the power background by putting his son in the supervisory board of heating plants Brno and arranging a related lawyer Květoslavu clay contract with City and state companies, such as Prague Transport company or Czech railways?
We have a permanent dispute.
I don't like it, and I reproached it a few times.
Faltynek argues that the mentioned lawyer is working at significantly lower rates and is reliable.
I wouldn't do that.
As Treasury secretary, I didn't have anyone.
We, unlike socanů, have never had a corrupt affair, any Peltu, a Kratochvíl, a Březinu.
If there was any suggestion of cronyism, we were immediately fired.
In this way, I am uncompromising.
If something like this happens, we get rid of anyone, it doesn't matter who it is.
