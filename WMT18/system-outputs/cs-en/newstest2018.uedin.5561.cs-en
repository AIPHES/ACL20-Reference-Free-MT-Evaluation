Civil rights movement issued travel alert for Missouri
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) has released a warning for colorful people traveling to Missouri based on the state's discriminatory principles and racist attacks.
"The NAACP's travel recommendation for the state of Missouri, with effect from August 28, 2017, invites African-American travelers, visitors and Missouri residents to heed increased attention when traveling across the state as a result of a series of contentious racially motivated incidents that currently occur throughout the state," the association's statement reads.
The NAACP said it came to this step on the basis of Missouri's current laws that make it difficult to defend racist-motivated acts in court, as well as as a result of actions by law enforcement agencies that disproportionately target minorities.
"There are civil rights violations.
People are being stopped by police just because of the color of their skin, they're being attacked or killed, "said the NAACP president for Missouri Rod Chapel.
"We have the greatest number of complaints so far."
This is the first warning of its kind the organisation has issued for the US state.
Among the incidents the organization cited were racially motivated swearing directed toward black-skinned students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, a black-skinned man from Tennessee.
Sanders died in contentious circumstances at the start of this year after he ran out of gas while traveling across the state and police plunged him into custody without charge of committing a crime.
The travel recommendation also highlights a recent statement by the Missouri Attorney General's Office, which states that black-skinned drivers have a 75 percent higher chance of being stopped by police.
"The purpose of the travel recommendation is to alert people and warn their families, friends and co-workers about what might happen in Missouri," Chapel said.
"People have to be prepared - they should bring money with them for any payment of bail or alert their relatives that they are going to travel through the state."
According to current FBI program numbers to report hate crimes, there were hundreds of cases of hateful behavior in Missouri in 2015, putting the state in 16th place among all states.
At the same time, the travel alert is the answer to a new Missouri law that makes it difficult to sue a company for discrimination in providing accommodation or employment.
The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued travel recommendations for Texas and Arizona after states passed an immigration law that allows state officials to detain people based on a violation of that law, which is supposed to improve racial profiling, according to the ACLU.
Travel recommendations are usually issued by the State Department for foreign countries, but more recently, advocacy groups have resorted to these measures in response to specific laws and trends within the US.
The model was killed by a chef.
Her family has no peace after 12 years!
Murdered is model Sally Anne Bowman.
The girl, originally from Croydon, was murdered in 2005 by chef Mark Dixie directly at the restaurant she worked in, who planted her stab wounds.
Both the victim and the killer were supposed to have sex and smoke marijuana, then killed her.
The killer then sat in a nearby cafe and watched the careful criminal work of examining the crime scene.
Dixie, a former chef, was sentenced in 2008 to a jail term of 34 years for the murder and rape of model Sally.
The one in court only admitted assaulting the teen, and the lawyer argued that his client had already found the girl dead lying in the street.
After three years, police convicted him.
Dixie claimed that Sally and her ex-boyfriend Lewis Sprotson fought the fateful night.
The killer said: "He was seriously angry and after his attack the girl started screaming."
"It even attracted the attention of the taxi driver," he said.
The girl was supposed to defend herself, if she could, but to no avail.
Lewis should have stabbed her in the street.
Dixie's version was proven to be a lie and she accused him.
After the confession, Dixie talked about his horny and taste for a girl.
When he dressed her after sex, he felt content and had to smoke marijuana.
Before the incident, Sally was with his ex-girlfriend, drinking alcohol and taking cocaine, Dexie himself said.
He said he felt adrenaline.
Sally started screaming for help, which is why he attacked her from behind and put his hand over her mouth, 'the Mirror Linda added.
And after 12 years, the family faces further attacks by vandals destroying her grave.
He's been damaged four times in the last six months.
There are such cruel people at large who dig these graves.
'so our daughter is no longer there, 'the Mirror mother of the late girl Linda told the publication of the disappearance of the urn with the ashes.
Linda waited for the attackers, but they always had to attack when she left the cemetery.
Design vibrators also cost tens of thousands.
"Czechs are not prudish or conservative," says Martin Raj, who runs a Prague boutique of intimacy.
In it you will find design and luxury erotic aids.
Including those from Czech designer Anna Maresha.
It started subtly, roughly 12 years ago.
Martin Raj and his friends went on a cycling trip in Moravia.
One of them didn't just bring a bike, but also a box full of unruly-looking vibrators.
"Different burrows and Dolphins and it was all green and yellow and just completely different," he tells me over lunch.
His friend, with a companion, decided to work with the German manufacturer of the Fun Factory, which interested Martin, so he offered to help with the marketing.
When the companion left to pursue another profession, he replaced him.
Today, she runs a boutique of intimacy in Prague's Benedict Street, where she sells erotic aids in the way luxury handbags or shoes are usually offered.
Why not?
These are also design objects.
Wait, wait, this is what you're talking about at lunch, you think?
Come on, don't be such puritans!
Just the Berlin shop Fun Factory, designed by acclaimed designer Karim Rashid, has served for boutique intimacy as inspiration.
They opened it in 2010 and it was a completely different concept of erotic trade than everyone is used to here.
No covered expenses, all done in a beautiful, decent style, products exposed more like in parfumeria.
Martin and his business partner, Vienna Shebelka, began to consider how to accommodate the Prague shop, where it should be and what it should be called.
The name of intimacy took a liking to both.
"It has to do with intimacy, and it's also, you might say, gentle," he says.
This was followed by the purchase of an internet domain and a search for a suitable space that went in parallel with the various visualizations of the interior.
It was eventually won by a variant that unfolded the shop into a garden of pleasure and a bedroom dominated by a bed.
It was prepared by Dagmar Stephen from the FormaFatal studio.
We found space in 2013.
He didn't seem quite ideal at first, because he's not on the main street, but that's what made him sit in the name of intimacy.
It's intimate.
It's in the alley next to the main one, so no one's looking at the customers, "says Martin Raj.
We wanted to be first.
We wanted to do a business that would be different, with branded nice goods, in an environment where women who are predominantly our customers feel good.
And not to be ashamed of having entered such a business in the first place.
When I entered the boutique of intimacy half an hour ago, the street was empty.
Plus, I didn't even feel like going to a sex aid store.
Right at the door, I was surprised by the pure elegance of the interior I know from boutiques with fashion.
Even if there's only female service in the store, so that women don't shy away from asking for help, it doesn't mean a man's leg doesn't close.
Most of the time, gentlemen come here to buy gifts for their girlfriends.
"Men usually can't guess the right size and vote bigger," Martin smiles over a frequent mistake.
It's the preconceptions, the familiar clich√©s, that women need some big aids, and it's not true.
So a bona fide man chooses an unnecessarily large vibrator.
In the same way, men choose mostly black linen, while the woman usually gravitates more to the pink color.
The absolute bestseller is currently a product called Satisfyer.
It must be clear from the expression in my face that I don't know which beats because Martin immediately explains how it works.
It's kind of a clitoris pacemaker.
I have an adolescent need to chuckle with admiration at the serious tone of my interpretation.
It's like nothing's wrong.
And they don't like it.
It's at a good price and has the perfect user reference.
We didn't believe he would be so well received.
It's kind of the latest revolutionary news.
The first revolution was caused by a vibrator in the shape of a seahorse.
He made sure that women became more interested in the design of such products.
The second then was a vibrator for We-Vibe couples.
He has completely demolished the taboo that some men may endure, and that he sees competition in erotic aids.
"Different variants are being made," he continues.
With one engine, two engines, remote control.
That's a popular category.
In a love connection, a woman can have a control in her hand and determine the intensity of the vibrations.
On the contrary, a certain flop is the category of leaning vibrators.
At least with us.
Czech women seem to prefer multipurpose aids and buy classic vibrators, even if they use it only externally.
In Western Europe, especially for younger customers, it is very popular.
What about the men?
It's hard to say whether a similar concept would work exclusively for men.
It would have to be a little different.
The question is what to offer men, "Martin thinks.
"We also have aids for them, but to a limited extent." Most are sold primarily by the masturbator, in this case from the manufacturer Tenga.
It doesn't look like an anatomical imitation of a vagina, but "more like a shower gel or an egg or a futuristic object.
There is a lot of focus on functionality and experience in use.
It's very different in Japan.
It makes me wonder.
I thought the Japanese had a lot to do with erotic aids, I object.
"That's the internet reality," it is explained to me.
The mundane is completely different.
Here in Europe, erotic aids are more related to being used by women.
In Japan, they are perfectly normal for men, and on the contrary they are taboo for women. "Just for the sake of curiosity - what the Japanese brand Tenga, represented in the boutique of intimacy, will sell globally, is still about half of what is sold only in Japan.
In our waters
Czechs and Czechs are not prudish.
On the contrary, we are quite a welcoming nation.
Certainly unlike countries such as Catholic Poland or Italy.
The typical store client is between 35 and 50 years old and "already has some experience both with sex life and with some aids.
She will come for something nice, better, to complete her partner's life, or to herself. "For her to come back, Martin Raj and his business partner, Vienna Shebelka, are looking after each product to see if it is perfectly functional.
We also don't want to go into specialties like bondage and latex, because we don't have space for that, and it doesn't exactly fit.
Things like that could discourage the ones we're trying to target.
Which are the people who were always supposed to go to the sex shop because they were afraid of looking at them.
A lot of the products exposed on the shelves are actually kissing.
It is also given by the selection of represented reputable brands.
Some have even won design awards, including the Red Dot Design Award.
The first award was the mentioned seahorse "and this triggered a change in the whole industry.
It started to get away from cheap materials and, on the contrary, to work with the disabled, other designs, different colors began to be produced...
What is pleasant is that the Czech Republic is behind the design of some, namely the popular designer Anna Mare≈°ov√°.
I have to say, I was quite surprised by how many people are buying the Whoop.de.doo design stuff from Anna Maresha, even though they are relatively more expensive.
There are customers who go straight for Venus's marbles by Anna Maresha.
She has done a great deal of work by presenting, within the Czech Republic and abroad, exactly what we are trying to present - that erotic aids can be done differently, nicely, with a story.
Anna's story began as school work.
It is now a finished product which is also produced with us.
I wanted to have the production process under control and I also wanted to know what materials and how Whoop.de.doo products are made.
Because it's not a big production, but a small series, it's certainly more costly than a big series.
I may be going a little upstream, but I find it important to maintain our development in the Czech Republic.
It might well be that we won't be able to produce anything in a few years, "Anna tells me later, who agrees with Martin that our society is becoming more and more open.
He does not meet with a negative or dismissive attitude.
Most people are said to be embarrassed.
"But even those will then start to smile." Currently, Anna Mare≈°ov√° has a vibrator on offer, to which you can make a personal note, and this year she also plans her own lubrication gel.
Vibrating eggs and other news should be added in the year of the next.
The boundaries of healthy sex
I'm interested in where the boundaries of what's in order lie.
Is there anything that Martin Raj wouldn't sell anymore?
It's awfully hard to define.
What is normal to one may seem completely abnormal, so we are more likely to be defined by an assortment of branded producers.
None of them go to any extremes.
Before we say goodbye, I have one last question: What was the craziest demand they received?
Just now in the week came an email in which a lady demanded a masturbation aid for her friend with a natural long twenty-eight centimetres.
So we had to write that we didn't have anything like that.
It's still a question of whether or not someone made fun of us, "Martin measures me with a suspicious look.
Even that happens from time to time...
A blow for Karl Gott.
After two cancers, Alzheimer's!
His friend Charles Christmas is battling a serious illness.
Karl Gott's best friend is battling a disease that will steal people's memories.
"Yes, it's true," said the singer.
I know about my illness, and I'm handling it pretty well, given the circumstances.
"I take medications that have the accompanying phenomena of the disease slow down," he added, thanking the close for support.
The whole branched family came together to make Karl's life easier.
Wife Eva tries to be at home as much as possible, and the daughters of her first marriage, Susan and Teresa, are commuting to her father's house on White Mountain.
He had battled cancer twice, and had given his experience to Slavisa to support him in his demanding treatment.
He's got sixty chemo behind him.
He was able to get back to work on the tennis court and ski slopes.
"I have a prediction from the astrologer that I will be here by 90," said Karel Blesko.
He's a fighter.
He still wants to sing.
"I keep repeating the words of the songs so I don't forget them," Karl admitted.
With the same disease, the actress Ktheorem Fiala is now fighting in the institution.
Do you have an Alzheimer's patient in your family?
Look at how to treat him.
The Chilean parliament has lifted the ban on abortion, the law will be assessed by the CPVO.
An absolute ban on the artificial interruption of pregnancy is still in force in Chile, so it must not be done for health reasons.
"I am sorry that lawmakers have filed a complaint with the Constitutional Court and that there will now be 10 people deciding what we have been arguing in parliament for over two years," complained Socialist Senator Isabel Allende.
The Constitutional Court in Chile has ten members and in late August should get a new chairman who is close to the opposition, according to AFP.
The law canceling the absolute abortion ban, initiated by current President Michelle Bachelet, was passed by the Senate on July 19.
The right-wing opposition then announced it would challenge the law in court because it said it violates the unborn child's right to life.
MPs voted on the bill last month until it is analysed by a mixed parliamentary commission.
On Wednesday, MPs approved the proposal, and the Senate did so again.
Under the new legislation, it should cease to be a criminal abortion in three cases: If a woman's life is at risk, if the foetus has no hope of survival or if the pregnancy arose from rape.
Similar exceptions have existed, according to the Spanish newspaper El Pa√≠s in Chile, since 1931, that is, before the women got the vote there in 1949.
The absolute ban on abortion in 1989 was introduced by the right-wing dictator Augusto Pinochet, just months before he left the office of president.
Chile is one of the few countries in the world where an absolute ban on abortion applies.
Others are Nicaragua, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Haiti, Malta and Honduras.
In El Salvador, for example, about 20 women are now behind bars, serving up to 30-year prison sentences for interrupting their pregnancy.
In many cases, according to human rights defenders, there was a spontaneous abortion, which the court described as murder.
Is there anything else sacred?
Target of Trump's White House Is Now the Statue of Liberty
An unmistakable sign of regime change is criticism of the statues.
Americans could tell about it as well as everyone else - see the carefully staged overthrow of a statue of Saddam Hussein in Baghdad's Firdos Square in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the key supporters of the Trump regime, surely knew what was brewing when, in a heated debate with CNN reporter Jim Acosta on the subject of the president's proposals for drastic restrictions on legal immigrants, he lashed out with a symbolic axe at the Statue of Liberty.
It is fair to add that Miller did not attack the statue as such.
For that, he would be lynched by a crowd of cruise ship owners and imitators of the Statue of Liberty.
But it attacked its significance, namely the fact that, in 1903, a plaque with the famous poem Emma Lazarus was placed on the pedestal until 17 years after the monument was completed.
Miller rebuked Acosta with the words: "I don't want to make history here, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that casts light on the whole world.
The poem that was placed on the pedestal additionally, and to which you refer, is not part of it. "
Miller's really right, but as he put it, this isn't about history.
These are, above all, the startling words of Emma Lazarus that resonate these days - inviting them not only immigrants, but the poorest of the poorest: "Let it come to me, who is not, who is poor, who can barely breathe, who is a miserable worm in the midst of full cities."
And just in modern times, we can do better than ever to watch these "miserable worms" on our screens.
Miller made no effort to criticize poetry - he wanted to clarify that these people are not welcome in the US.
This conflict about the importance of the statue is part of a comprehensive political and culture war: It is essentially a conflict about the importance of America.
Emma Lazarus, like her friends who, after her death, sought to plant a plaque with a poem on the statue's pedestal, knew pretty well that she was embarking on a high political game.
The statue was meant to express the connections of the French and American Republican governments by representing a classic theme, that is, the female embodiment of freedom.
Emma Lazarus has altered this meaning: In her poem, the female character is not abstract, but she has her own voice.
It also has a very different name: The mother of exiles.
Merging a poem with the idea of a woman is a brilliant feminist pull and a devastating attack on American nativism.
And in the same way that Emma Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, the right-handers have long sought to reverse that meaning.
Known commentator Rush Limbaugh - John the Baptist in the matter of Trump's rise to power - argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty doesn't actually bring anyone into the country, but represents early neo-constructivism, bringing the American flame to a backward world: "The Statue of Liberty struts forward.
It brings out the torch of freedom from the United States and offers it to the rest of the world.
The torch is not meant to illuminate the path to the United States. "
Oddly, Limbaugh is hitting on an important thing.
The meaning of the statue depends on your point of view.
Emma Lazarus describes the statue from the perspective of an exhausted and damned passenger who often, after a long and terrifying voyage across the ocean, arrives with hope in her heart to a new land.
This is literally a view of the world through the eyes of people seeking refuge and a chance for a better life.
From this perspective, the statue expresses hope and listens to their needs.
And that, of course, is a perspective that neither Miller nor Trump will certainly acknowledge.
Their torch is not to illuminate the path, but to fuse the hatred that is their only source of power.
World Athletics Championships 2017: Neil Black heaps praise on Scottish members of British team
Eilidh Doyle recalls time when British team had only two Scottish members
UK Athletic Federation director Neil Black said the strong skater of 16 Scots in the World Cup squad would be a "huge asset to the team."
For MS at London 2017, which starts on Friday, a record number of Scottish athletes have been selected.
Black believes "something special is happening in Scotland" and British athletics could learn a lot from the Scots.
"We're trying to understand it and adapt - we're going to work on it," Black stated.
'I've spoken to people from the Scottish Sports Institute and they think it has to do with what they've done.
Scottish athletics officials think it has to do with what they have done.
British athletics: It has to do with what they've done.
People on the streets think so, too.
Whatever it is, it's absolutely amazing.'
Several Scottish athletes will be aiming for medals, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will rival Sir Mo Farah in the race for the 5,000m, while Eilidh Doyle has been elected as team captain.
"Eilidh is modest.
Her opening speech was amazing, "Black said.
'several athletes, whether Scots or athletes of other nationalities, were coming out of the room with a sense of tremendous pride and motivation.
The passion and undisguised feelings with which Eilidh spoke were unrepeatable. "
The Commonwealth Games silver medalist, who will compete in the run-up to the 400m hurdles at her fifth World Championships, said it was "incredible" there are 16 Scottish athletes in the British team.
The previous record from 1983 and 2015 is seven.
Mid-track runner-up Muir has only set five British and two European records in the last year.
MS will take part in runs of 1500 m and 5000 m.
Another of the great Scots is Chris O'Hare, who will run the track at 1500 m. this season he won the British team races and the Annual Games.
Doyle recalls her first championship, on which she was the only other Scottish member of the team, Lee McConnell.
The team captain has led that she is "very proud" of the fact that not only a large number of her team-mates have been brought into the team, but in many cases they will also be attacking participation in finals and medals.
"The extraordinary thing about the team captain's post is that I was elected by the other members of the team.... It was a great honour for me, but knowing that I was elected by members of the team is all the more gratifying," she added.
'I'm obviously very proud of all the Scots who got into the team.
It proves where I've moved.
It's the athletes who will be thinking about the front seats on the podium.
And my opening statement?
Yes, I think she did.
I merely drew attention to the fact that we can be proud of this year's championship because it is held on home soil.
It is important to use the support of the home fans and rejoice from the fact that we are back at the Olympic Stadium.
I've been given a second chance at the race and I'm going to enjoy an unreal atmosphere. ""
Blocking critics on Facebook: Don't take public office if you don't bear criticism from voters
The father of our country knew of his criticism.
The Americans loved George Washington, but it didn't take the newspaper long to start criticizing him for anything, starting with domestic politics and ending his political views.
Yes, this criticism did not leave him cold.
But he didn't try to silence the critics.
Because in 1783, Washington said, "freedom of speech can be taken away from us - and stupid and mute will be led like sheep to slaughter."
That brings me to Maryland's Governor Larry Hogan, whom he needs to work on to start acting like Washington.
Hogan's employees blocked and deleted the contributions of a minimum of 450 people who freely displayed their views on his official Facebook page.
This week, the American Civil Liberties Union sued him for those actions.
The governor's staff dismissed the lawsuit as groundless, and there were many "who cares" views in the comments online.
"It's just Facebook," many users said.
Still, it matters.
Especially when it comes to people like Hogan.
In an absolutely democratic state, this is a hugely popular Republican governor.
It can boast the second-highest popularity among all 50 governors.
Hogan is not hilarious.
As it is seen, it manages its state with certainty of its own and strictly adheres to the principles.
It turns out he is also skilful in using Facebook as the main means to connect with his constituents - the exception is not even the publication of the first photo with a bald head after undergoing chemotherapy.
Blocking people closing on the governor's page - which is a public forum, identified as official and managed by his staff paid from taxpayers "money - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
In an interview for The Washington Post, Hogan's spokeswoman Amelia Chasse defended the governor, saying that blocking the comments went from a position of modelling contributions.
However, using the image of internet trolls, spamers or angry people is too easy.
The Washington Post interviewed several real people to whom the posts were deleted.
And that's exactly what they are - real people who speak to their elected leaders; teacher, entrepreneur and pastor, no trolls.
As everyone reported, their comments were polite and considerate, not profane.
In his comment, the pastor cited the Bible, appealing to Hogan's Catholic faith.
Bowie's attorney Lakshmi Sarma Ramani, Md. asked about hate crimes, however, her comment was not hateful.
"I politely noted that I am disappointed by his lack of response to hate crimes and other up-to-date news," she wrote in a section with The Washington Post's journal commentary.
"I don't like the idea that once a certain number of people comment on the same subject, some people are identified as promoting a so-called collective effort, instead of being recognized as a larger group of interested citizens."
What the governor's employees called "focused spam interest" others would probably call a "defense."
The modern Facebook era allows us to easily manage contributions by blocking critics or deleting negative comments.
It's much more comfortable than in the past, when the same procedure would require sending staff to the streets, where they would pick up and burn all copies with criticism or arrest or silence Protestants.
And that's exactly what's happening, only in digital form.
Hogan is not the latest public official to be criticized for defaming Facebook and other social media users.
President Trump is facing a lawsuit by Twitter users who have been denied access to his account.
One of the first important regulations was born last week in Virginia.
The chairwoman of the Loudoun County Board of Supervisors violated, according to U.S. District Judge James C. Cacherise, the First Amendment in Alexandria, where she prevented the access of one of the voters to her Facebook pages.
Governor Matt Bevin (R) of Kentucky also received a visit from the ACLU because of his use of Facebook and Twitter.
That shouldn't be so difficult.
In the times of Washington, the low price of postage had virtually the same impact as the internet.
Between 1776 and 1800, the number of daily newspapers quadrupled and its position of leader was questioned by many anonymous writers.
And even in those days, Washington had to deal with anonymous trolls.
People, writing under pseudonyms like "Juricola," "Valerius," "Belisarius" and "Portius," wrote letters to the newspaper, questioning Washington's decision.
According to historical documents gathered by people as part of the online Project Papers of the George Washington Project, a petition criticizing his position on the Treaty of Amity, Commerce, and Navigation with Britain has been piling up in his office.
But he did not silence them.
Freedom of speech, dissent and intimidation lie within the very foundations of our nation.
And the real leader has to accept that.
The Czechs quickly took advantage of free roaming, using more data abroad than at home.
Abroad, Czechs consume more of their fare than at home.
They most often move in Austria, but the consumption of data in the summer season is dominated by Croatia.
On holiday, on the one hand, they have more time to grind on the web, under the parasol they usually don't have the option of joining Wi-Fi.
Beach, bathing and smart phone in hand.
This looks like a typical Czech holiday in Croatia after customers can use the services of their operators at home prices.
It follows from O2's fresh statistics.
Thanks to the new roaming rules, most Czech travellers abroad have more data available at a flat rate than at home.
It is not surprising, therefore, that in Croatia, where a minimum of our people go through the winter, data consumption has even risen 50 times in the summer season.
Italy then ranked second in the list of data consumed.
For the most minutes the Czechs are provoking from Germany, where many are going to work during the summer.
Croatia, according to data from the Association of Czech Travel Agents, will visit 800,000 Czechs annually, so it is our most popular holiday destination.
However, people here have swapped the book for sharing experiences using a mobile phone.
The record was this year's 7th of July.
"Tens of millions of photographs would fit into the transferred data," the director of the mobile segment at O2 Silvia Cieslar said.
Although Croatia leads in the volume of data, the highest number of Czech users is in neighbouring countries.
In first place is Austria, followed by Germany and Slovakia.
Croatia is up to fourth and Italy sixth.
We go to Austria for hiking and active holidays, for which we do not have so much time to bug on the internet.
"Through Austria, the Czechs are heading for the Adriatic," Cieslar explained.
While for data, the operator recorded high year-on-year growth after the release of roaming charges, for phone calls, growth is much lower.
The number of minutes released in roaming has risen to double compared to last year.
With a huge jump ahead of other countries, Germany dominates here.
"Calls in roaming are more used by corporate customers on work trips," Cieslar added.
Ronan Rafferty hopes for home atmosphere at Renaissance Club
Former golf number one Ronan Rafferty will be hoping for a breezy atmosphere over the next three days at the Renaissance Club in the Scottish administrative area of East Lothian, hosting the 25th annual Scottish Senior Open.
Ronan Rafferty, who is from Northern Ireland, last year at the nearby Archerfield Links golf course on his way to the final, succumbed to Paul Eales.
"I watched the Renaissance Club slowly grow before my eyes and this year's tournament will show the world of its beauty," Rafferty said.
'the players will be able to be humbled by the first-class quality of the pitch.
Jerry did a great job.
He is a keen defender of this game and is proud of his achievements.
This year's tournament is in the right hands.'
Englishman Eales will defend the championship for the first time, despite having won both the European Tour and European Challenge Tour during his 32-year career.
"I feel good about it," the Southport golfer said.
'I didn't have the chance to defend my victory at the Extremadura Open because the year after my victory the tournament was cancelled.
Returning to this part of the country is magical.
It's a beautiful place to golf.
I remember last year when, for me and my wife Sharon, a win meant really much.
These were beautiful times I won't forget.'
On home soil returns Gary Orr, who joined the European Senior Tour after celebrating 50 years from the county this year.
The event will be his first involvement since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
"I always like to play on home soil," Orr said of Helensburgh.
"You want you to thrive and feel a lot of pressure.
I really enjoyed playing again and I think I'm doing well.
I'm happy with the result. "
A trio of players will also be joined on the field by former Masters winner Ian Woosnam and senior tournament winners Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty..
ORR and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are among six Scottish players on the pitch; the others are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
Admission to the tournament is free. parking is ¬£5 for a car with one passenger and ¬£10 for a car with two and more passengers.
All profit will be donated to Prostate Cancer UK.
Poverty and death in Indonesia's land of gold
When Bardina Degei cooks dinner, she doesn't use the stove.
In fact, he rarely uses the pan.
In his wooden hut, located in the capital Paniai Enarotali in the Indonesian province of Papua, a woman usually simply throws a sweet potato - in the speech of a local "nota" - right into the fire.
After half an hour, remove the potato and taste it with unwashed hands.
Bardina sits on the muddy ground - the cottage is not equipped with furniture - where he also performs his daily work, such as washing laundry in cloudy water from a nearby swamp.
A bucket in a room without a roof vultures the toilet.
As the youngest of her husband's four wives, she was not assigned any fields to farm.
Polygamy is common here.
Working into the late-night hours poses a danger: Most men from the village are unemployed and often drink alcohol.
"In the afternoon after 5 p.m., no one is allowed to wander around the village," says Bardina.
It is a rare glimpse into day-to-day life in the highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony that was declared part of Indonesia in 1969 after a controversial referendum, when just 1026 elders were forced to vote in the form of a public uproar with their hands in front of an eye-catching army.
The current movement protesting against Dutch rules quickly reversed its anger against the Jakarta government, which controlled the entire region except for foreign journalists or civil rights supervisors.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua - an independent Papua New Guinea occupied the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is such a remote and ravaged city you get after a 90-minute flight from the capital of the province of Jayapura to Nabire, and then a five-hour stomach clutching a ride.
Mass traffic doesn't work in this place.
The city of 19,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences, roofs of wool sheets in shades of grey and rusty colour.
There were very few Indonesians, much less journalists, and virtually no foreigners.
Before the arrival of Christians, local residents worshipped a god named Uga Tamee.
And that's not all.
"We weren't used to wearing these clothes," says Bardina, showing off her colorful, hand-knitted turban, dark T-shirt and bright skirt.
"We used to wear only leaves."
Papua is Indonesia's poorest province - 28% of the population lives below the poverty line, and local infant mortality and literacy is one of the worst in all of Asia.
At the same time, however, it is the Indonesian country of gold.
The world's largest and highest-earning gold mine, Grasberg, owned by Freeport McMoRan of American Phoebe, is located only 60 miles from Paniai - a rocky province about the size of New Jersey that is home to about 153 000 residents.
In 2015 alone, Freeport mined gold and copper worth $3.1 billion.
In addition, Papua supports logging at an estimated $78 billion.
Nevertheless, this wealth is a source of suffering for the Papuans and a guarantee of oppression by the powerful Indonesian army.
An investigation conducted in 2005 by the New York Times reports that Freeport paid local army officials and troops about $20 million between 1998 and 2004, including a $150,000 settlement for one officer.
Papuans calling for self-government threaten this golden goose and are therefore hard-pressed.
According to human rights activists, more than 500,000 Papuans have been killed since 1969, and thousands more have been raped, tormented and imprisoned by the Indonesian military.
Mass killings in the Papua tribal region during the 1970s were equal to genocide, the Asian Human Rights Commission said.
In the past year alone, Indonesian police have arrested more than 3900 peaceful Protestants in the region.
We Will Lose Everything, a report by the brisbane archdiocese of 2016, describes the cruelty that occurred last year, like extrajudicial executions, torture - according to another report is especially popular rape and execution by electrocution - and the brutal suppression of peaceful protesters.
"It's difficult to count the death toll because incidents occur every week," said Andreas Harsono, an Indonesian research fellow at Human Rights Watch.
The whole situation was made worse by the fact that Papuan resources attract colonists to Indonesia.
Of the 3.5 million residents of the province here, 83% report to Christianity, but demographics change with the influx of Muslim immigrants from the Indonesian islands - Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Jamaican canines sell fried chicken and gado-gado, or a mix of vegetables with peanut sauce.
Local people are fighting for survival.
"Immigrants started selling chickens and vegetables in traditional markets at lower prices than local Papuans," explains 24-year-old Abeth You, who was born on Paniai and moved to work in the capital of Jayapura province.
'the original residents of Papua - mama-mama (women) - so they lost their job.'
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, nicknamed Jokowi, in his 2014 presidential campaign promised a solution to non-equality and rights violations.
The former carpenter secured and made his way to the presidential palace in Jakarta, 27 of Papua's 29 districts, including Paniai.
But very little has changed in Papua, and local people feel betrayed.
"Our hearts were broken because in 2014 we voted for Jokpwi with the hope of hearing our calls for justice," You said.
The reality is that just two months after Jakowi's October inauguration, Paniai experienced a major shock.
On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children sang Christmas songs at a campfire in the town of Enarotali, when two Indonesian soldiers on motorbikes emerged from the gloom of the night.
Two of the surprised children told them they should turn on their lights.
One of the soldiers made this rebuke and the tone she was spoken to and later returned with four other soldiers, said local vicar Yavedt Tebai.
Two of the soldiers in the busy state chased a group of children and beat them with the butt of their weapons, said the victims and witnesses of the event.
One of the soldiers then fired at a group of children.
One of the children, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was beaten so badly that he fell into a coma.
Hours later, someone burned down a nearby Electoral Commission building, and the following day, things still escalated.
About 1,000 young papuan men and women gathered on the football field outside the local police station and army headquarters, demanding justice.
They came with ceremonial hunting bows and performed a Waite dance - in which he runs in a circle and mimics the singing of the birds - the papuan tribe of Mee Pago.
Several Protestants began throwing stones at the buildings.
With escalating tensions, the soldiers were given an order over the radio: "If the crowd tries at least three times to resist, you have permission to shoot," it said, according to the weekly TIME in an official document, the contents of which were never published in local media.
Yeremias Kayame (56), head of the Enarotali Kego Koto district, recognized the looming danger and urged residents to break into their homes.
No one, however, was oblivious to his words.
"When I turned around, someone shot me in the left wrist," he told the weekly TIME on the porch of his pestle-painted wooden house.
Kayame does not yet know who the shooter was, but according to his words, the bullet belonged to one of the soldiers present.
"There were a lot of people around and there was a lot of shooting," he added.
One of the locals, Alfius Youw, was hit three times in the words of his cousin who witnessed the shooting.
"I ran to my body to make sure it was really him," she told the weekly TIME in a somber voice Yohanes, who like many Indonesians uses only one name.
"I saw he was dead... I kissed him."
A Papuan police inspector, Gen. Yotje Mende, told journalists that his officers had only "hedged" the station, which was under attack.
"We have to defend ourselves when people threaten us with death," a press spokesman for the Papuan police, Commissioner Pudjo Sulistiyo, said in 2015.
"It's a matter of life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five protesters were killed and many escaped with injuries.
News of the murders broke through the media the following day.
Three weeks later, Jokowi delivered an impassioned speech in Jayapura and expressed his sympathy for the families of the victims and promised to address the violence in Papua.
"I demand an immediate solution to this problem so that it can never be repeated," he said.
Homeland Security Secretary Wiranto announced in October 2016 that he would introduce an out-of-court mechanism to resolve acts of violence that have occurred in the past.
But almost immediately there were excuses.
"Most acts of violence occurred a long time ago.
Some of these occurred in the 1990s and some at the beginning of the 21st century.
What I am saying is that we are determined to punish these violent acts, but it will not be a simple task, "he said.
In an interview on June 5 for the TIME weekly, held in Jakarta, however, Wiranto said he was not planning to introduce any measures in Papua.
Instead, he said that "all cases will be presented to the court."
Wiranto, whom the UN accused of "crimes against humanity" based on more than one thousand dead during the 1999 independent election in East Timor - said that 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua have so far been settled, including the incident in Paniai.
The families of the shooting victims in Paniai welcomed his claims with disbelief.
"I've been interviewed a total of four times in the last three years, but I haven't received anything until now," Yohanes said.
"I'm tired."
As he says, a few years after that, he still lives in fear.
"I'm afraid," he says.
"I'm afraid the army will arrest me or someone will shoot me."
His brother Yacobus confirmed the sight of many Paniai residents who are afraid to talk about the incident.
In his words, he was beaten by members of the military after helping to bury four of the victims.
"After burying the bodies, the army started looking for me," he said.
And the shooting still doesn't happen.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police fired at villagers in neighbouring Deiyai.
The scuffle, in which one person died and another 17 were injured, occurred between villagers and a construction company manager who refused to provide assistance in transporting the unconscious man to hospital.
Ravianus Douw (24), who drowned while fishing in a nearby river, died en route to hospital.
Angry villagers protested outside the company building.
According to the police, the villagers threw rocks at the officers, and their answers were warning shots.
However, local residents claim the mobile brigade (Indonesian paramilitarist police) began firing into the crowd, killing one person.
"There was panic, we were afraid of retribution," said 29-year-old Dominggu Badii, who lives near the hospital and witnessed the arrival of the injured.
"I haven't left the house in two days."
The Deiyais parliament demanded the punishment of the participating police officers and the withdrawal of the mobile brigade from the area.
Paniai has always been a thorn in the eye for the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development only deepens the separation of the indigenous people of the tribes of Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal, who live in the central highlands.
Many of them joined the Papuai Liberation Movement (OPM) - an army of rebels that protects the rights of Papuans by attacking and kidnapping Indonesian policemen.
Some of the OPM leaders come from Paniai; they include not Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
In the wake of the attacks, the military has arrested and arbitrarily detained thousands of Paniai residents in recent years, all under the guise of "securing national sovereignty."
Some of them will never be seen again.
Paniai is known among Papuai residents as a "tragic and forgotten place."
The oil in the fire comes in poverty.
That little rice, which is sold in Enarotali, is too expensive for locals.
And bread is equally unattainable.
Residents here grow their food: Mainly sweet potatoes, fruit and leafy vegetables.
Women work in the fields; they each farm four or five fields with sweet potatoes.
Most of the harvest is for the needs of the family, the rest are sold on the local market.
Ten pieces of sweet potatoes cost just 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Since Nabire airport opened more air routes and new immigrants have begun to flow into the country, there has been an increase in economic inequality between native Papuans and immigrants.
So few jobs are usually occupied by more educated and wealthier immigrants.
Papuans rarely have the necessary capital and education to go into business.
"Young people are moving out of villages because of a lack of job opportunity and money," said John Gobai, chairman of the Paniai tribal council.
Thanks to isolation, the province of Papua is hidden from the world.
Strict rules for foreign journalists also contribute to this.
At the beginning of this year, two French journalists - Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp - were expelled from the papui because of a "lack of cooperation with the authorities," all despite the fact that they were given such a rare permit to film.
Phelim Kine, deputy director of the Asian branch of Human Rights Watch, Jokowi, in his election campaign, promised to repeal strict rules for journalists and achieve transparency and development.
"Foreign journalists working in the rebellious most eastern areas of Papua and West Papua are at great risk: Non-recognition of visas and blacklisting," it said in a statement.
The lack of news from per foreign journalists means that international pressure on Indonesia in the Papua case is largely limited.
In March, six Pacific nations - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - told the UN Human Rights Council about an investigation into "various and widespread acts of violence" in Papua, including the shooting in Paniai.
These countries have also supported OPM in the past.
Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesman Arrmanatha Nasir shook off the accusations when he told journalists in Jakarta that: "There is still a democratic system in Indonesia, and the media is free, so it is difficult to disguise the evidence of cases of human rights violations."
Local people are calling for the participation of foreign governments.
When an official delegation from the Netherlands, headed by human rights envoy Keesem Van Baar, visited Jayapurau on May 4, local people chanted, according to a source who also attended the meeting but wanted to remain anonymous, the motto "we want freedom."
Another election is scheduled in Indonesia for 2019, but the Papuans say they will not vote for Jokowi.
"Jokowi is a person who has good intentions but is surrounded by people associated with the shooting in Paniai," said Gobau, chairman of the tribal council.
He wants Jokowi to know that the residents of Paniai - in addition to living in constant fear of a heist army - are rolling in poverty, miserable education and the health system.
Gobai argues that the residents of Paniai, like other Papuans, regard their vote as a "debt" that Jokowi must repay.
"They don't want money, they demand justice," he added.
Despite the threats and intimidation of the family of the victims of the panicked shooting, they continue the latest symbolic act of defiance: They bury the bodies of victims at a property opposite a police and army station.
Knowing that justice will never be done, at least they won't let responsible people forget their crimes.
"A member of our family was killed," Yacobus said with his head down.
"What can we do?"
French Navy intercepts huge shipment of cocaine into Australia
The French Navy intercepted in the Pacific a yacht carrying 1.46 tons of cocaine worth about $256 million.
The shipment was headed for Australia.
A four-man crew of the ship, formed apparently by people from Lithuania and from Latvia, was arrested in the intervention.
The yacht, named as Afalina, set sail from South America and police dragged it to a port in the city of Noum√©a, a metropolis of the French overseas territory of New Caledonia in the Pacific Ocean.
The Australian Intelligence Service said it would seek, in cooperation with its international partners, to determine exactly where and where the drugs were headed, and to reveal a "Lithuanian syndicate."
"We are grateful to the French authorities for the measures that have stopped large quantities of drugs going to Australia," said its executive director, Col Blanch.
The drugs were destroyed in Noum√©e this week.
Australia is an attractive target for their smugglers because of high street drug prices.
The country is also grappling with the problem of a growing number of people suffering from drug addiction.
Thus, the current roundup is not the first one recently.
Last month, three men were charged with transporting a large quantity of drugs from the United States to Australia, which they attempted to smuggle across the Pacific Ocean in a small plane.
Seniors don't feel thirsty, they need to be reminded of drinking.
The problem may be in homes for the elderly, the solution, according to a doctor from the Geriatric Clinic of the General Faculty Hospital in Prague Pavly M√°dlova, could be an infusion of saline, which is injected with a thin needle under the skin.
But these are only applied in medical facilities.
The older a person is, the more the amount of water in his body goes down.
"And in addition, it loses the feeling of thirst, so seniors generally accept less fluid and become dehydrated very quickly," M√°dlova said.
They should drink two litres for sure.
"But getting so much fluid into an old person is a big problem," she added.
There is often no doctor in the home for the elderly.
In hospitals, dehydration is commonly infused.
"I think even there it should be gradually introduced so they can receive subcutaneous infusions," she said.
Up to two pint bottles of saline can be delivered to old people in a day.
Lack of fluids can cause malaise, headache and reduced performance.
Dehydration will manifest itself as a complete loss of self-sufficiency.
'one day the old man will say he can't get out of bed, he talks confused, 'she added.
In case of neglect, it can result in a stroke.
Blood thickens and clogs the blood vessel in the brain, also threatening kidney failure.
Lying patients should not be covered with covers, tops with cotton sheets.
Disposable nappies can also be a problem.
"It's nursing more challenging, but the ideal would be to uncover the patient occasionally and let the skin unwind," the doctor stated.
Skyscraper The Torch burned for the second time in Dubai
In Dubai, one of the world's largest residential skyscrapers went up in flames on Friday; firefighters had to evacuate all residents of the 337-metre-high and 79-storey building.
In the past two years, it has already been the second fire of this high-rise building, which bears the fitting name The Torch (The Torch).
All residents of the building were evacuated and there were no injuries - the cause of the fire is unknown.
'we were sleeping and we were woken by the alarm - we heard screaming.
It took us 10 minutes to run down from the 50th floor, "he said for Reuters Geroge, one of the residents of the skyscraper.
The Dubai Civil Defense said firefighters managed to get the fire under control around 4 a.m. (0: 00 GMT), whereupon they continued to cool the building.
Government officials have added that they are providing replacement accommodation for affected residents.
The incident could again spark a discussion about the safety of materials used to panelling high-rise buildings around the world.
The results of an investigation launched by the management of skyscraper Torch after a fire in 2015 showed that the most were damaged linings and external panels used for decoration or insulation.
British police said the system of insulation and panelling of London's Grenfell Tower may have contributed to the rapid spread of the fire in the June fire, in which nearly 80 people died.
Survey results showed that more than one in five passengers to the US deliver banned items on board a plane
A survey among passengers showed that more than twenty percent of them knowingly or unknowingly carried prohibited items through the checkpoint of the U.S. government's Transportation Security Administration to board the plane.... At least six percent of passengers entered the plane with a knife or other sharp object.
Less than one percent of passengers say they belatedly discovered they were traveling with a firearm, ammunition or explosive.
The results of a survey conducted by the airline Stratos Jet Charters Inc. - and to which more than 1,000 pollsters responded - showed that younger passengers were more likely to breach the rules.
Of the respondents who admitted they attempted to knowingly travel with an object that is banned by the TSA, 19.7 percent were passengers with a few thousand poured hours, compared to less than 15 percent of Generation X members.
Among the most common items that have escaped the TSA's attention include food and alcohol.
More than three percent of respondents knowingly carried a sharp object through security, while 2.2 percent of the women surveyed and 3.7 percent of the men surveyed also admitted that they deliberately carried banned drugs on board the aircraft.
The company said it had been conducting research among passengers around the world to see how many of them accidentally leaked unauthorized items through airport control and how much it did on purpose.
It's no surprise that most people who have transferred unauthorised items - whether consciously or unconsciously - travel by plane very often.
As the company pointed out, the TSA directives are somewhat complicated and confusing.
People often don't know what fluids and in what quantities they can deliver on the plane.
It is no surprise, then, that the TSA has seized in the largest amount of currently banned liquids.
For a time, people thought the TSA would dispose of the books in the same way it did with smuggled goods.
Fluid transfer is permitted within domestic flights, not international.
EPA chief Scott Pruitt on postponing planned directives to reduce Obama administration emissions
After the Environmental Protection Agency was sued by 15 states, its boss Scott Pruitt revoked his earlier decision to delay implementation of the former Obama administration's plan to reduce carbon dioxide emissions.
Pruitt introduced the changes as part of his plan; he reacts more briskly than previous governments to the needs of state environmental regulators.
But he did not mention a legal challenge filed against his previous position in a federal appeals court.
It concerns the latest deadline set for October 1, when states should begin to comply with a 2015 regulation to reduce the amount of ground-level ozone.
Pruitt announced in June that he would scrap the deal by one year and order a more detailed study of the plan to avoid "interference with local decisions or threatening economic growth."
Pruitt, who before reaching the role of EPA chief by President Donald Trump held the position of Oklahoma's attorney general, has long served as a reliable opponent of tougher environmental regulations.
Since settling in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly moved or delayed regulations proposed by the chemical and fossil industry.
The sudden Wednesday turnaround is the biggest legal failure for Pruitt's regulatory agenda.
Last month, a federal appeals court in Washington ruled that the EPA's executor had overstepped his authority in an effort to delay the inclusion of an Obama administration plan that required diesel and gas companies to reduce methane leaks.
In a statement issued Wednesday night, Pruitt proposed his version of ozone standards and reinforced the EPA's commitment to working with states through complex processes and meeting new standards within a given timeframe.
"Under the government of the previous administration, the EPA often failed to fill deadlines and waited to be sued by activist groups and others, agreeing to settle and further set plans," said Pruitt, who in his previous position filed more than a dozen lawsuits at the EPA.
'we don't believe in regulation through litigation and we take the fulfilment of the term seriously.
We never joke about our status and the authority that results from it. "
However, the EPA statement said Pruitt may at some point use "the possibility of delay and all other legally available authority" to ensure that regulations "are based on sound policy and the most affordable information."
Republicans in Congress are pushing for a more sweeping rewrite of ozone rules.
The White House budget approved last month seeks to delay implementing the 2015 rules by a minimum of eight years.
The measure still did not pass the Senate.
New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who was at the head of a coalition of states sued this week by the EPA, said the group did not intend to allow in legal coercion.
"The turnaround in the EPA's views - following our litigation - is an important victory for the health and safety of the 6.7 million New Yorkers and more than 115 million Americans directly affected by air pollution," Schneiderman added.
New York was joined by California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington and Washington, D.C.
Ground ozone arises when common harmful substances emitted by cars, power plants, oil refineries, chemical plants and other sources react in the atmosphere with sunlight.
The resulting smog can cause serious breathing problems in sensitive people, as well as thousands of premature deaths each year.
Public health advocates and environmentalists credit Pruitt's sudden change with gratitude.
"It's worrying what pressure needs to be developed to change the mindset of those responsible and protect the air we breathe," said Lori Ann Burd of the Center for Biological Diversity.
"We must continue to grapple with the ideological pull of the Trump administration, which seeks to assist polluters and special interests."
He doused the man with acid, yet he is not dangerous, according to the court.
You never know what can happen to you.
One minute you're at home with your family and you laugh, in the other you suddenly change your whole life from scratch.
And the worst part is, there's nothing you can do about it.
A similar fate met Andreas Christopheros of Great Britain, whose face was reformed with acid by an unknown assailant who was eventually acquitted.
The information was reported by the Reuters website.
In December 2014, someone at the Christopheros knocked on the door.
Andreas rose to open the door.
He thought there was probably a courier behind the door who was supposed to deliver Christmas presents for the family that day.
Instead, a cruel surprise awaited him.
The man he had never seen in his life had doused him with acid with the words, "This is for you, my friend."
The pain was indescribable.
The clothes fell on me like nothing and I just felt an unreal pain on my skin, 'Andreas stated.
The family rushed him to the hospital, but that's where his loved ones learned the terrible news - according to doctors, he didn't have a chance to survive.
A few weeks after the incident, doctors were constantly worried that their patient would succumb to an infection that threatened to penetrate his wounds.
His injury was very serious.
Ninety per cent were affected by the face that doctors tried to put together using skin from other parts of the patient's body.
A major complication for Christopheros was the loss of his eyelids.
It's probably the most excruciating thing I've experienced.
"You can't hide from an unexpected light, you can't close your eyes," he described his woes.
Today, Christopheros has 12 operations behind him that are far from the last.
Injuries that suffer victims of acid attacks may require hundreds of surgical procedures and years of treatment, according to plastic surgeons.
Even after challenging and long-term treatment, victims of tissue are scarred for life.
"Sometimes people don't recover and throughout their lives they fight against deformation and disfigurement," said Professor Peter Dziewulski, a spokesman for the British Association of Plastic and Aesthetic Surgeons.
The attacker was wrong.
As for the attack, Christopheros is sure the unknown man must have mistaken him for someone.
The perpetrator believed he was retaliating against a man who had sexually abused his close person.
The police properly investigated the case and then tracked down the attacker.
The man was originally sentenced to a minimum of eight years in prison.
However, later, the verdict to the amazement of Christopher's family fundamentally changed.
"The three judges ultimately concluded that the punishment should be lifted as the man is not considered a threat to the public," Christopheros stated.
In the last few years, the numbers of assaults by corrosive substances have increased considerably.
The Home Office has commented on the issue by planning to provide new guidance to prosecutors on the classification of corrosives.
These should be classified as dangerous weapons.
However, victims of similar attacks are not going to give up.
They are demanding that the UK government enforce stricter and longer prison sentences for people who attack their surroundings with acid or other corrosive substances.
They are also calling for tightened controls on the sale of dangerous substances, which are often commonly available in different stores, as they are different cleaning products.
In the largest city of the United Arab Emirates, Dubai, the famous skyscraper The Torch, which is one of the largest residential buildings in the world, burned at night.
According to the dubai Civil Defense, residents of the 80-storey building managed to evacuate in time and no one was injured.
According to a spokesman for the dubai police, the fire broke out on the ninth floor and spread upwards.
According to several residents of the house, however, it was the other way around.
"It started on the 67th floor, that's what they told us," one of the tenants stated.
Also, according to another tenant quoted by Reuters news agency, the fire broke out in the top floors and spread down with falling hot debris.
We slept.
We were woken by the alarm, people were screaming.
"We ran down the stairs, it took us from the 50th floor for about 10 minutes," tenant George described the events.
Another of the witnesses for CNN estimated that the flames had engulfed about 40 apartments.
On the ground, a fire destroyed at least two cars as burning parts of the building fell on them.
After about two hours, according to the Civil Defense Communication, they managed to bring the fire under control.
The cause of its emergence is not yet known.
According to witnesses in the surrounding buildings, the power went out.
A large-scale fire damaged the Dubai skyscraper The Torch also in February 2015, destroying over a hundred apartments.
There are about 680 apartments throughout the building.
Even then, no one was harmed as they managed to evacuate the residents in time.
Skyscraper The Torch was built in 2011 and that's when it became, with its 352 metres, the world's tallest residential building.
Another Bajoran skyscraper prepared him for the record the following year.
The bodybuilder had an incredible 14 doping substances in his body.
He didn't win anyway.
According to Corriere della Serra, a sample of 23-year-old Ippolita featured a colourful collection of illicit devices - from steroids to diuretics to drugs to Parkinson's disease or anorexia.
Paradoxically, even this wild mix didn't help him to the title, he finished fourth.
Now the bodybuilder is facing a four-year distancing and criminal prosecution.
The record was 11.
Last year, Italian rugby player Davide Vasta tested positive for 11 doping substances, which was, by then, a record amount for caught athletes.
According to his words, the three-pound player began taking steroids the year before when he fell through bodybuilding.
Lucka Vondrakova in the Czech Republic.
She was passionately hugging her ex-lover!
As soon as Lucka Vondrakova has set foot in the territory of the Czech Republic, she is in one round.
And it also draws attention wherever it comes.
The last time she fell into her arms was her former lover, Michal Long, with whom she had lived for three years.
The actor was 12 years older at the time and was already craving a family.
Lucia was only 19 at the time and certainly had no desire to hang her career on the nail.
So they walked away from each other, but they remained friends to this day.
Which they also proved at the TV Prima press conference, where they met for an extended period of time.
Coincidentally, they both celebrated in blue.
At first they ignored each other, then became close, and Lucie laughed at Michael's jokes until she grabbed her belly.
Then they embraced, and the photographers willingly posed.
Their meeting, however, was no accident, for they will play a lovers' couple together in the new Prima series Captain Exner.
Islamists have been given a life sentence in the UK for preparing an assassination.
A British court on Thursday sent to life behind bars four members of an Islamist cell calling itself the Three Musketeers and, according to the Crown Prosecution Service, planned a terrorist attack against police and the military.
The four men, two of whom attended a training camp in Pakistan and had previously been convicted of similar acts, were arrested last August.
At the time, authorities believed he was about to attack immediately.
In the car of one of the men, security agents found a partially finished pipe bomb, knives with signs that in Arabic mean "non-believers," and a mock-up of a handgun.
It happened when an MI5 Secret Service agent placed a listening device in the vehicle.
"Recent assassinations have shown what horror the defendants may have caused if they were not stopped," said deputy prosecutor Sue Hemming.
Three convictions, aged 28, 25 and 33, can apply for release after 20 years.
The fourth convicted, who is 38, can do so after 15 years behind bars.
The men during the trial in London claimed they were innocent and that the weapons found in the car were placed there by an MI5 agent.
The court also heard it, but then dismissed the defendants' claims.
Thursday was the hottest day of the year.
They measured 38.3 ¬∞ C on Hodonin.
Tuesday's temperature record of 37.3 degrees Celsius remained on top for just two days.
With 38.3 degrees Celsius recorded in the Guardian on Hodonin, it surpassed Thursday, which thus became the hottest day so far this year.
This was confirmed by the staff of the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute.
But as of Tuesday, not many temperature records fell on Thursday.
On Tuesday, records were surpassed or levelled at 35 of the 145 weather stations measuring over 30 years.
On Thursday, record temperatures recorded just nine long-term measuring stations.
Perhaps in the Guardian, Thursday's temperature was the same as the previous record from 2013.
It had surpassed the original maximum by four tenths of a degree, and had exceeded the record by three tenths.
Both records, as with the Guardian, came from 2013.
In the west, it was ten degrees less.
High temperatures occurred mainly in the south and east of Moravia on Thursday.
After the Guardian, the biggest heat was in Dyj√°kovice on Znogensk and Broda nad Dyji on Bclavsk, where the mercury dropped to 37.8 degrees, but the record did not pass.
By contrast, for example, in Western and Northwest Bohemia, Thursday's highest temperatures were only around 22 degrees Celsius.
"Temperatures started to grow there until later in the afternoon," the meteorologists said.
The current heat in the Czech Republic will gradually go away, and more rain could come on Sunday.
In most places of Moravia, however, high temperatures will still remain on Friday and in the south-east of Moravia as well as Saturday.
China is missing tourists.
Beijing is losing billions because of visa policy.
China has been trying for decades to exert its influence without using force resources.
It will spend $10 billion annually to support language schools and build universities abroad, pushing its entertainment industry into foreign markets and trying to attract Western tourists.
But that is not going well for Beijing.
Its state media is talking about a plan to make tourism a driver of economic transformation and modernization.
But the number of arrivals rose just 3.8 percent last year, and roughly 80 percent of tourists to China came from Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan.
This is because, despite all its global aspirations, China does not welcome foreigners with open arms, assessing the situation in the world's most populous country, Beijing University economics professor Christopher Balding said in an article for Bloomberg.
The example that speaks for all is China's visa policy.
Only 13 countries have visa-free travel with China, citizens of the others have to take a visa in advance.
At Chinese offices in the US, therefore, the crowds are comparable to the celebrations of the Chinese New Year.
A visa costs $140, but if a person doesn't want to wait long hours in a queue, they have to pay $100 and more for extra services.
Such restrictions build significant economic barriers.
A study by the Journal of Economics and Finance showed that the need for a visa reduces the country's visitor numbers by 70 percent.
In 2015, only two million Americans visited mainland China, while Hong Kong, which accounts for less than three percent of China's gross domestic product and lives there less than one percent of all residents, visited 1.8 million Americans.
China often deepens the problem itself when tourism uses it to implement its policy goals, such as in disputes with Taiwan and South Korea.
When China restricted traffic to South Korea in the spring as part of a rip-off around the South Korean anti-missile system, the South Koreans repaid it and avoided China.
In May, the number of visits fell by 42 percent year-on-year, while Japan recorded an increase of 85 percent.
All of this affects macroeconomic stability.
According to a recently published report by the US central bank, the Fed could leave China up to $190 billion as a result of foreign travel by the Chinese, while China gets about $35 billion in currency sales to incoming tourists a year.
According to official figures on balance of payments developments, China had a $217 billion deficit in tourism last year, equal to 44 percent of the entire Chinese surplus in trade in goods.
Thus, a small number of tourists strike a very painful blow to a country that is anxiously preventing capital outflows.
But the above factors are only one manifestation of a more general restraint against foreigners.
In many places in China, virtually no one has heard of immigrants.
Even in 2013, fewer than a million foreigners lived across China.
Some individual cities have more in the United States.
Even Japan, which is not exactly the intersection of immigration, has double that.
Meanwhile, a number of scientific works show that immigrants typically revive economic growth, business and innovation.
But you can hardly find them in China.
Resolving these problems will be politically challenging, but the step that is being offered is the simplification of the visa apparatus.
Other Asian states, particularly India and Vietnam, have recently been making a major effort to simplify and discount visa procedures.
If China wants more foreign tourists and their hard currencies, it should be easier for them to get there.
In the spa zoo, they breed deadly poisonous reptiles.
The Spa Kingdom of venom can enjoy the cubs of three rare, deadly poisonous reptiles.
In exposure, visitors will see only all nine newly born vipers of Turkey so far.
The species lives in northern Anatolia, even at an altitude of 2,000 metres.
"It grows a foot long," said zoo spokesman Martin Vobruba.
The cubs of the other two species, the reapers and the cobra red, are yet to gain strength in the breeding ground of the garden.
We can't say yet when people will see them.
"We'd hate to lose them," said zookeeper Miroslav Dohnal, saying it could take a year or two.
Australia's deadly vipers have come to world eight, they are the descendants of a breeding couple originally from a population in and around Sydney.
"The individual that visitors can see in the exposure belongs to the reapers from around Perth," Vobruba said, adding that in human care it is necessary to winter 6-8 weeks at a temperature of 13 degrees Celsius.
A hundred percent success was accompanied by an African spitting cobra of red.
A couple in a spa zoo hatched a total of four cubs out of four eggs.
"The incubation lasted 65 days," Vobruba said.
This species in nature cuts out poison on its victims, up to a distance of up to four metres.
It's aimed at the eyes, it can cause permanent blindness.
Cubs of all three species feed on mouse holats at the zoo.
Within 40 days in the garden they still expect the hatching of the cubs of the mamba black, the eggs are stored in an incubator.
According to unverified transcript of phone interview, Trump creates pressure on Mexico over payment for border wall
The American Journal of the Washington Post published a transcript of President Trump's phone calls with the leaders of Mexico and Australia.
In a telephone interview from January 27 with Mexican President Enrique Pe√±ou Nieto, Trump urged him to stop publicly reporting that he would not pay for the construction of the proposed wall.
The US president blamed him for publicly condemning the construction of the wall, reportedly with the words: "You can't talk like that in the press."
As part of his campaign, Trump vowed to build a wall along the southern border and reported that Mexico would pay for it.
A transcript of his first call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has also escaped the public, revealing a tense exchange of views.
President Trump told Turnbull that the US surveillance agreement over refugees heading to Australia is "ridiculous" and "stupid" and insisted that if he agreed to such a deal - which came under President Obama's administration - he would look like "drugged" after he proposed a ban on refugees entering the US.
Trump ended the call after explaining to Turnbull that "this is my most uncomfortable call of the day."
Tusk testified again at the Crown Prosecution Service for Smolensk.
"He has nothing to fear," the dead president's brother, President of the Law and Justice PiS Jaroslaw Kaczy≈Ñski, said at Tusk's address.
"I have nothing to fear, Kaczy≈Ñski will not intimidate me," Tusk replied, reading out the country's current leadership for trying to abuse justice against political rivals.
On leaving the office of the Crown Prosecution Service, he waited for Tusk, according to TVN 24, a crowd chanted by Donald Tusk! And wished the politician Sto flight!.
Tusk thanked for the support and assured that he had a clear conscience: "I have nothing to fear and Kaczy≈Ñski will not intimidate me."
Prosecutors say nothing, but he has no doubt that the judiciary should serve the current Polish rulers as a tool against rivals, opposition, or people they do not like, and I fear that I belong to this group.
He was in interrogation for the second time.
The ex-prime minister was questioned at the Crown Prosecution Service for a second time, this time the questioning was to relate to misconduct in the autopsy of victims of the pitch disaster.
In addition, there was a change in the bodies in the coffins.
Families were banned from opening coffins, and there had to be reasons for that.
And the reason was that they were afraid of scandal because it would burden Polish-Russian relations.
"Maintaining good relations at all costs, despite such a horrific event, was intended to help Donald Tusk become someone very important in the EU," Kaczy≈Ñski claimed on Catholic TV Trwam.
He added that any conflict with Russia would frustrate Tusk's chances of getting the most important chair in the union, from which Poland has absolutely nothing.
At the same time, Kaczy≈Ñski said he had warned German Chancellor Angela Merkel that with Donald Tusk it could turn out differently, but she did not take note.
Tusk underwent an eight-hour interrogation at the Crown Prosecution Service as early as April 19.
Even then, he didn't speak as a suspect, only as a witness.
However, many of his summons for questioning were seen as part of an obvious effort by the Polish government and boss PiS Kaczy≈Ñski to discredit Tusk as a political rival by linking to various scandals.
The Crown Prosecution Service is subordinate in Poland to the Minister of Justice, who performs the role of Attorney General.
The summons for questioning came soon after the election of Tusk by the head of the European Council, which Kaczy≈Ñski tried hard but in vain to prevent, including during Merkel's visit to Warsaw.
At the EU summit against the extension of Tusk's mandate, only Polish Prime Minister Beata Szydlo protested alone.
In this case, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb√°n also left Warsaw.
Both Burma and Senegal.
Where everywhere can the Czechs vote?
In the autumn parliamentary elections, registered voters will be able to newly vote on the composition of the House from Burma, Senegal or Luxembourg.
In these and several other countries, the Czech Republic has opened its representative offices since the last parliamentary elections held in 2013.
It follows from the decree that governs the delivery of ballots abroad.
The State Department has ordered its update, it is currently in a comment process.
Four years ago, 10,000 Czech citizens voted abroad.
"Since the last amendment of the decree in 2013, there have been some changes that need to be taken into account in these lists," the ministry reasoned.
"In some countries, new representative offices have been created, some offices have been closed, or there has been a change in the level of representation," the material says.
The decree contains two annexes, the first of which lists the representative offices to which paper ballots are delivered.
This group of offices includes the representation of the Czech Republic in neighbouring countries, namely Germany, Poland, Austria and Slovakia.
More than a hundred Czech authorities will receive a ballot in the print version.
Their list is being changed by decree.
Four years ago, the Czechs could vote, for example, at the Czech embassy in Libya or Zimbabwe.
Today, both embassies are closed.
The Czech Republic has also cancelled its representation in Malaysian Bamako and Japanese Kyoto.
There will be no vote at the Consulate General in Donetsk.
The Czech Republic closed in 2014 because of the war in eastern Ukraine.
They are newly on the list of embassies in Kenyan Nairobi, the Senegalese capital of Dakar and the Zambian Lusaka.
In Asia, since the last parliamentary elections, the Czech Republic has extended its representation to the Consulate General in Iraq's Irbil and Cheng-tu, the capital of China's S'chchuan province.
Ballots will also be available for registered voters at Czech embassies in Burma and Cambodia.
Czechs abroad have had the opportunity to select Members in polling stations at representative offices or consulates four times so far.
Before each election, the State Electoral Commission shall determine the country for which the candidates are voting abroad.
The first time was in 2002, when it was decided among South Moravian candidates.
In the next two elections, the Czechs voted abroad among the South's candidates.
In 2013, the Central Bohemian Region was selected as recently as this year.
The number of Czechs voting abroad is increasing steadily.
At its premiere 15 years ago, some 3800 people came to vote, in 2006 there were around 6700, four years later 8222.
To the early House elections four years ago, 10.571 voters came to the embassy.
Moore's Ford Bridge massacre: Activists recalled racist lynching
The 1948 Ford Mercury drove past onlookers residents of Monroe, Georgia, and scrabbled toward Moore's Ford Bridge.
But before a car with four black passengers and a white driver could reach the bridge, a group of white men with guns played the way.
The group leader - a middle-aged man in a striped suit - took a long dive from his cigarette and stared at the windscreen of the car.
Inside, the passengers shook with fear.
"We want that n---and Roger!" The man yelled.
"Bring it to me!"
The silence breaks the roar of a young black man being pulled from the passenger seat.
Fortunately, this scene is simply a redesign of the events that took place on July 22.
But when one of the men throws a noose over "Roger's" neck, the audience sighs with excitement.
Since 2005, a group of activists have been returning to Moore's Ford Bridge to reconstruct that fateful night of 1946, when two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and Mae Murra Dorsey - were killed by members of the Kucluxclan.
No one has yet been tried for the murders.
"It's odd that in all these years, not a single person has been arrested - yet we still see them in our community; even though we know their identity," Tyrone Brooks, who helps reconstruct the event, said.
'it's a stain on our history and the burden in our souls.'
Brooks is a 71-year-old former Georgia congressman and a lifelong civil rights fighter.
In his eyes, the reconstruction of the event represents a dramatic challenge to the event. every year the community of the city of Monroe recalls that justice has not been served.
"We demand prosecution and closure of the case, we want peace of mind and reconciliation, but justice first and foremost," Brooks stated.
"Until then, the process of recovery and reconciliation cannot be initiated."
The medical examiner covers on July 27, 1946, one of the bodies of the lynching victims at Moore's Ford.
According to FBI files obtained by NBC News, the lynching was to be attended by up to 50 men from Monroe and surrounding counties.
However, no one has yet been prosecuted.
Yet as suspects remain at large for decades, civil rights supporters say the two reasons for the lynching - politics and sex - were known to all residents of the city.
In April 1946, on the basis of a Supreme Court ruling, residents of the black skin of the state of Georgia had, for the first time, the right to participate in elections that had been scheduled for the summer.
And just during the summer election, according to the FBI, black-skinned farmer Roger Malcom was supposed to stab white-skinned property owner Barnett Hester during a scuffle - reportedly because of his wife.
In the city, according to Brooks, it was thought that Hester had been with Malcom's wife, Dorothy, and had brought her pregnant.
According to the FBI's statement, on July 25, 1946, the then-eminent white-skinned property owner Loy Harrison posted a $600 bond for Malcom.
He was accompanied to the prison by Dorothy and cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey.
On their return from the prison, just before entering Moore's Ford Bridge, a group of suspects played their way.
"As it turns out, the murders were planned and orchestrated by Harrison," the FBI concluded.
"It is also clear that there was collusion between state and local law enforcement officers who not only participated in the lynching but also got rid of the evidence and withheld the identity of the witnesses."
Brooks was more brief on the matter.
"It was a massacre because of electoral law," he stated.
"The killings had a clear subtext for all local black residents:" This is how you fall if you register and go vote. ""
The annual re-enactment of the event at Moore's Ford Bridge is organized for nearly a decade by Cassandra Greene.
Her performance is figurative, engaging and apt - it shows the deep-seated racism that many would like to consider in modern America to be extinct.
Watching this reconstruction is not easy and even more difficult to look away, but Greene says it makes sense.
"No one wants to talk about lynching, because in doing so, we have to face the uncomfortable feelings that are hiding in each of us," Greene said.
"But there can't be a relationship between us unless you hear what I've been through."
The main trials of this year's reconstruction began in June, and on the very first day, about 30 actors - a dozen white men, the rest of the blacks - recorded themselves in the room where Greene introduced them to a very carefully planned introduction.
Wade Marbaugh performs the position of assistant director.
For many years he played the leader of the Kucluxclan, but in his words the role is exhausting.
"I feel bad about it because it contradicts who I am," Marbaugh said.
'I think it's very important to remember this part of history regularly because we never want to go back to that kind of time.'
Actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, who play the role of Roger Malcom, coating Barnett Hester, rehearse their roles.
The show begins with a scuffle - Malcom is arguing with Hester and blames him for having sex with his wife.
"Get off my property n---e!"
There's no Rascona.
There's a scuffle.
At that moment, everyone (at least every black-skinned actor) bursts into laughter.
Greene laughs most of all.
"What happened?" Says Rascona.
He's confused.
Was I too rude?
"No," Greene says cheerfully.
"I just don't think that's when white people said" n--r "in that tone."
"Exactly," one of the black-skinned actors says.
"You have to put more emphasis on R."
The energy in the room is suddenly better; hostility will replace the sense of rapprochement.
Everyone wants the show to be authentic, just to be done for the four victims of the massacre.
Actors repeat the scene.
This time, Rascona emphasizes the correct expression of the word to N.
No one's laughing now.
The show ends violently and quickly.
The roar, the shots... and the silence.
A woman dressed in black stands over the bodies of actors, foaming Billie Holiday's mournful song "Strange Fruit."
With every word, there is sadness in the room.
Against the backdrop of all this, about a dozen onlookers wipe sweat and tears from their eyes.
There are virtually the same number of black and white people in the audience.
One couple arrived all the way from New York's Ithacy, many onlookers are from nearby.
Each bears the local wet climate for nearly eight hours, and Brooks is in the crowd leading to the graves of Malcolm and Dorsey.
Until now, the murders may have been viewed with hindsight, but now, standing in the same place where the lynching took place, the atmosphere is eerie.
With the final words of the song, Greene prompts a crowd of onlookers to inspect the bodies.
Children kneel to the victims' heads, watch fake blood and motionless bodies and whisper something in their ear.
"They're not dead," the little boy says.
It'll take a few minutes, and Greene will thank the audience.
The actors are cleaning the rope and shielding their tears.
Bradshaw hugs Marbaugh, a man in a suit played by the leader of the Kucluxclan.
Nick Rascona embraces his two fellow-actors and bursts into tears in their arms; eventually, emotions weigh on him.
"It's all right," one of the women whispers.
"We know you like the role.
But you had a reason. "
Later that same day, the audience sits together with the actors for dinner.
At one table, a young white couple are talking about a show with a black couple they met today.
Denise Duplinski barely found the words to express her feeling about today's performance.
"It's difficult to listen to those ugly words and look at those hideous deeds... held by people who look like you and do it because they look like you," she said of the reconstruction.
"It makes me realize that lynching is still a topical topic," she added, "just called police skirmishes."
Across the room, Tyrone Brooks sits in the courtroom, enjoying dinner while talking about civil rights.
In his own words, he had already started planning the show for another year.
"The reconstruction of these events is inspiring as it describes the fear we have had to experience - but it is also a moment for reflection," he said.
'If we don't learn from it, who knows... it could happen again.
People who do not know and do not study their country's history are doomed to repeat it. "
I love the instructions to use.
A friend of mine says only a coward reads instructions for use.
I disagree, on the contrary.
This is one of the modern forms of art, often pure surrealism.
With nostalgia, I remember a time long past, where the instructions for using anything were more of a rarity.
For example, my first gramophone contained only one paper on which there were hieroglyphics depicting the involvement of some components, all of which were secret tags.
When something inside me went wrong for years, I offered the deed to a shaman who wasn't afraid to unscrew the backboard.
With a grin, he told me what the paper with the labyrinth of lines was for.
Yes, it was a custom tool for chronic toilet paper depletion.
He playfully found the broken wire and allowed me to listen again to the expensive vinyl plaques.
The new time has brought new instructions.
Even a relatively simple fruit juicer, where it simply clung to a crossed grapefruit, required about ten pictures.
Especially taken was a sketch with a description of how to insert one piece into another.
The kit was a two-piece, and a different procedure just wasn't possible.
Putting it in reverse required considerable effort with the need to break off certain plastic components.
My contempt for instructions ended with my Seat Leon vowel.
The year of production 2003 still had a book of small repairs, which included, among other things, the replacement of a light bulb.
It was simple.
Three steps in total, and the work should have been done.
Unfortunately, the author of the instructions neglected to state that while the light bulb on the right had been replaced in only three steps.
1. remove the cover.
2. send out a cracked light bulb and screw a new one.
3. draw the cover.
The light bulb on the left had a problem with the location of the battery housing.
At first I thought that by inserting the right upper limb into the bowels of the car, I would find a spring, a screw that would easily push the cover away, and then I would follow the points 1-3 of the austerity author of the service book.
Bridge error.
The cover had no place, no space for the slender hand of Cinderella, let alone the obese Silesian.
I lost half an hour of my life, completely without any success.
The condition was exacerbated by my wife's entry into the garage, which was summoned by a ryk and words that hear from my mouth quite exceptionally.
"What are you doing here?" She asked guilelessly.
My answer lasted about 90 seconds, but if I skip the vulgar terms, there are only two published words left.
Changing the bulb.
"And why is it taking you so long?" She quipped in a sentence that, in a long-standing union, may be her last.
I slowly explained the problem to her, with my main emphasis on the torsion procedure of the author of the manual, where the blessing of the hot iron on her hand, which she wrote, then comforted her so that he could never write anything again, was a mere introduction to a wide range of Hammer witch instructions, including his comedian burn on the top of Losinski Castle.
"How about removing the box?" The woman said.
In sheer desperation it occurred and then the 1-3 step was as easy and quick as the right-hand side.
I thought nothing could surprise me.
And that's until the day I got a call from a colleague who was just coming out of a collared state after being checked by two officials of the State Department of Drug Control.
I know him as a balanced colleague who has experienced both possible and impossible in the field, and who can tell wild stories in an unenthusiastic voice.
"Imagine I was fined for not posting my hand-washing instructions," he told me in a weak voice.
I gradually got the whole problem out of him, which was that he didn't have a picture guide on how to wash his hands over the sink in the patients' bathroom.
His argument to the clerk, that adults can wash their hands as a rule, and that they did not need pictograms to handle the accustomed activity of decent people, did not have a healing effect and cost him little money.
"It's not just that," she told him.
He understood that the simple rinsing of washed palms with running water was a primitive act at the level of the chronicle that a modern man, Homo sapiens sapiens, performed this ceremony in ten steps.
It must be said that it is necessary to release water from the tap.
The whole process has a total of eleven points, but at the end there is a joyful finding that a man has washed his hands exactly as he is ordered by the hosudar of S√öKLu.
Finally, I must point out that I have been inspired and I am preparing a detailed plan for restroom activity.
On the issue of defect, the procedure is uniform, there is no problem, for urination, due to certain differences in both sexes, it will be necessary to post instructions two.
The problem remains with the pictograms, for creating a perfect procedure also means an accurate sketch of all the anatomical details, which might arouse some outrage at Pruder's restroom, despite the fact that he can finally learn that he has been mopping up the opening in a completely flawed manner throughout his life.
Pearson releases another 3,000 staff and cuts dividend in bid to revive business
British education group Pearson on Friday said it would release an additional 3,000 staff and cut the interim dividend by 72 percent in response to another restructuring programme to change the business model.
The next wave of layoffs, which CEO John Fallon says will occur at the end of 2018 and early 2019, follows the company's previous decision to lay off 4,000 employees under a previous restructuring.
Pearson announced a plan to cut costs by an additional 300 million pounds ($394 million) in May as part of a third cost-cutting programme in a bid to resurrect declining trade due to the sharp development of digital education.
The company, which last month agreed to sell its stake in Penguin Random House to Bertelsmann, said the outlook for this year remained unchanged after it reported a one per cent rise in underlying sales in the first half of the year to ¬£2.05 billion.
Kabul convoy attack: NATO soldiers killed in suicide blast
A suicide bomber attacked a military convoy in Afghanistan's capital Kabul; a NATO soldier died in the attack, and several others were wounded, officials said.
Five soldiers and an interpreter were injured, the NATO statement said.
According to unofficial reports in the attack in the city's Qarabagh district, three civilians also died.
This month, Afghanistan was hit by a bomb attack - on Tuesday, more than 30 people were killed in an explosion at a gambling mosque.
On Monday, a suicide attacker killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
NATO said in a statement that Tuesday's blast occurred after the patrol, along with members of the Afghan army, were attacked by "a local person with a homemade explosive device."
The statement further states that all of the injured soldiers are out of a life-threatening condition and are located in a US military hospital at Bagframe Air Base.
According to the rapporteurs, the growing power of the Taliban and the group known as Islamic State (IS) in the Qarabagh region is a major source of concern for NATO's allied forces in nearby Bagframe.
According to the UN, a minimum of 1662 civilians died in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, of which 20% of the victims died in the capital.
At the end of July, a bomb placed in a car killed at least 30 people in the Kabul neighborhood of Shia.
The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack.
On May 31, a large explosion in the city centre killed more than 150 people.... This is the deadliest militant attack in the country since U.S. troops toppled the Taliban government in 2001.
The violence undermines an already dubious situation in Afghanistan, and U.S. President Donald Trump is considering an increase in the number of U.S. troops who should assist military troops and police officers in the country.
According to the rapporteurs, they have been rocked by suicide attacks in recent weeks by public confidence in the government, its regulations, and particularly in the reputation of President Ashraffe Ghana.
In response to the lawsuit, the EPA revised its decision to delay smoking rules
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency rescinded its decision to delay an Obama administration law ordering states to cut emissions, just a day after the agency sued 15 states.
The EPA on Wednesday night announced its decision to refer the 2015 "ozone standards" with the words that it presents the agency's commitment to cooperation with the states.
"We believe in dialogue with our state partners and will hear their views," EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt said in a statement.
Pruitt in June announced the EPA's effort to delay ozone standards - which measure actual air pollution in specific areas of the country and, based on measurements, determine limits that need to be met by October 2018.
A group of 15 from most Democratic states, along with Washington, D.C., filed the lawsuit Tuesday on the grounds that the EPA's actions were illegal.
President Donald Trump's administration is seeking to avoid many of the environmental regulations proposed by former President Barack Obama - under Trump's words in an effort to kick-start economic growth.
But the new government's effort has launched countermeasures from Democrats and conservative groups worried about the impact of emissions on public health.
The EPA says on its website that breathing air with ozone content "can reduce lung function and increase respiratory symptoms," such as asthma.
Singer Ladislav Bubn√°r got hit and blood flowed!
This, with us a relatively new singer, you may have already registered in June of this year, when this almost unknown singer held a monstrous event on Czech affairs, hosted by leading personalities such as Master Karel Gott, Lucie White, Simon Krain and many others, and the event was not modelled by anyone other than Leo≈° Mare≈°.
The purpose was simple, to show himself to the public and to present his music video to the song Sara, whose baptism was hosted by just-appointed personalities.
Few who already know that the actual filming of the video, which took place in Russia, was without problems, and the singer Ladislav Bubn√°r himself had to be treated.
It was his first big shoot with the stars of the Russian National Ballet, and it did not go without a proper traverse.
The song Sara is very emotional and is based on the unfortunate love of two lovers.
For the drama of the scene, he had a slap shot in a video clip of the singer's rival.
At one point, however, he hit him so hard and straight up his nose that the young singer had to be treated by doctors.
"It was a blow, I didn't expect it, I immediately had blood coming out of my nose," Ladislav commented on the situation.
Colleagues and producers told the situation on set that it was an accident and Ladislaus could not react in time.
Luckily, the injury wasn't serious enough to affect the sequel to the next shoot.
The mentioned video clip of the young artist is now brought to you, you can also record the scene with the punch.
The failed blood version, however, was not used.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko spoke at a meeting about mutual duel options
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, two boxers who could stage the most thrilling light-heavyweight boxing match, met for the first time at Tuesday's meeting.
Each was located in a separate room at the ESPN offices in Los Angeles until Garcia - the undefeated light-heavyweight champion of the World Boxing Council - walked down the hall, where he welcomed Lomachenko, the featherweight champion of the World Boxing Organization.
Following Garcia's victory following a unanimous decision against former four-times world champion Adrien Broner in Saturday's game on Showtime, the two boxers went on to list five of the best light-heavyweight boxers.
Garcia extended his right hand and said, "How's it going, champ?
Good luck. "
Lomachenko defends his title against Miguel Marriaga on ESPN on Saturday at 19: 00pm.
Boxers pose for photographers and Lomachenko's manager Egis Klimas adds that a potential bout of boxers would be a "perfect test."
"I'm a former featherweight champion," adds Garcia.
'because of the match with Broner (67 kg) I had to gain weight, but I'm not that big.
On my 63 kg, I'm small.
I would like to go back to the light-heavyweight category.
Lomachenko has to gain weight again... then we can fight.
That's what fans want.
Why not meet them. "
Lomachenko agrees.
"Boxing would be good for this match."
Klimas made a demand for payment for viewing - which is part of his strategy. Lomachenko should make his light-heavyweight debut at the end of this year and next year face Garcia (37-0, 30 knockouts), who also expressed interest in the match against duel winner Jorge Linares vs. Luke Campbell, who will face off on September 23 for the light-heavyweight title at the Forum arena.
"The match should be a style of payment for viewing, that's what the fans are asking for," said Garcia, who later expressed that he was open to the possibility of airing the match through a television station that comes with the best deal.
"We are the main attraction.
No one else will attract such attention.
We'll wait for the right opportunity... "
Garcia stated that he recognises Lomachenko as an "amazing boxer" and could take part in his Saturday match.
But Lomachenko wasn't swayed by Garcia's praise when he said the three-division champion from Riverside looks "very slow... sorry Mike, but you're asking for a knockout."
Garcia said his goal was to show strength and until then boxing.
Both boxers stated that they felt the rising tension before the mutual duel.
"You won't forget this game.
No other match has garnered so much attention.
And I'm going to put a lot of weight on the fire, "Garcia said.
Lomachenko said: "I was waiting for the best boxers and this is Mikey."
It's going to be a great match.'
The young couple disappeared 12 years ago without a trace.
Their car was now found at the bottom of the Volga.
A pair of young Russians Ilya ≈Ωirnov and Kira Cherkasovova have been missing since December 2005.
There was an extensive search, but without success.
And the police eventually ended the investigation for lack of evidence.
The families of the lost couple lived in the uncertainty of not knowing what had happened to the couple.
After 12 years came a sad end to the whole story.
The wreck of their car was found by a lay diver at the bottom of the Volga River in the town of Cheboksary in Piggy.
Only thanks to the documents left in the car, the officers managed to identify the couple.
The documents survived an entire decade underwater, without them it would take the police much longer to establish the identities of the found.
The couple were last seen when ≈Ωirnov borrowed a car from his father so he could pick up his girlfriend from work.
Meanwhile, the diver who discovered the car remains anonymous.
He reported his findings to the Cheboksar police, who took the car to the beach the following day.
Investigators believe the young couple's death was an accident caused by the freezing road leading around the river.
However, the investigation continues, after its termination, further details will be released.
Latest test results to set age limit for asylum applications in Sweden
The latest test results of asylum seekers in Sweden who were subjected to a new method assessing their age show that over 80 per cent of people were surveyed as being over the age of 18, but not everyone believes their accuracy.
The Swedish Forensic Medical Agency (Ravi ttsmedicinalverket) started the new tests at the beginning of this year.
The aim of the method is a more accurate assessment of candidates in the evaluation of asylum applications.
To date, Sweden's Migration Agency has handed over 6880 cases and the Forensic Medical Agency has now released the results of a total of 2481 tests, carried out from mid-March to July 31, 2017.
80 percent (2002) were assessed as being over the age of 18, while in another 25 cases the Forensic Medical Agency judged that the polling was "possibly over 18 years old."
In a further 423 cases, it was decided that the polling was "possibly under 18."
The tests are only accessed if the age of the polling is questionable.
The results correspond to the previous month.
"As opposed to the past month, the statistics are kept in a tight track and the numbers are very similar," he stated for The Local.
The higher number of candidates whose age was estimated to be over the age of 18 does not necessarily mean that asylum seekers lie about their age.
In May, the agency released the results of 581 tests and said that in 442 cases it was found that "the person interviewed is 18 years or older."
The newspaper Svenska Dagbladet investigated 581 published cases and found that in 243 cases questioned, he said he would be 18 this year.
There was also a medical method of determining age, which includes an X-ray of wisdom teeth and an MRI scan of the knee joints, which are subsequently assessed by dentists and X-ologists.
One of the skeptics is Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute, who, among other things, deals with assessing people's biological maturity to determine the age at which the person in question went through puberty.
'I've had reason to think about this issue and I don't think these types of measurements to assess age are correct.
The assessment of biological age is, in a sense, very uncertain.
If we cannot determine age with accuracy, we should not pretend otherwise, "he stated for the Metro newspaper.
Forensic medical agency Agency's G√¨¬∂ ransson defended the decision with the words: "In general, the risk of misassessing a child as an adult is small.
The highest risk is that the person interviewed is just below the age of 18, which in this case is equivalent to 10 percent of all interviewed. "
Trump threatened on the phone to the president of Mexico.
U.S. President Donald Trump, in a January phone call to Mexican President Enrique Pe√±a Nieto, threatened not to meet with him if he publicly said his country would not pay to build a wall between the U.S. and Mexico.
Trump said in an interview that funding would somehow be arranged, though he admitted it would have to be secured from other sources.
Similarly, Trump spoke openly with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull.
It stems from transcripts of interviews released Thursday by the American Journal of The Washington Post.
Trump made the construction of a wall on the southern border for Mexican money one of the main promises in his last year's election campaign.
Right in his first interview with the Mexican president shortly after taking office, Trump undiplomatically scolded Pe√±a Nieto for being critical of his plan to build the wall.
He described the southern neighbor as a growing political problem and pressured the Mexican president not to say publicly that his government would never pay for the wall.
"You can't say this to the press," Trump repeatedly said in an interview on January 27, threatening to sever contacts with the Mexican president if he continues to issue defiant statements.
They say the funding will work out, and it will end well.
"But if you say Mexico is not going to pay for the wall, then I don't want to interact with you gentlemen anymore, because that's unacceptable to me," he said, according to the American Journal of Trump.
The wall marked the least important thing we're talking about, but politically it is perhaps the most important.
The executive order to build the wall Trump issued shortly after taking power.
Mexico rejects the construction and financing of the 3200 kilometer wall, and the relations of the two countries have escalated.
In late March, Trump said the project would be paid for by the United States so far.
Trump eventually met with his Mexican counterpart for the first time at the July G20 summit in Hamburg.
The Washington Post also reported on Trump's phone conversation with Australian Prime Minister Turnbull on January 28.
The White House chief of staff called the conversation ridiculous.
Such a conclusion prompted him to exchange views on an agreement under which Australia would grant asylum to Central American refugees in exchange for the United States accepting people from internment facilities in the Pacific island states.
Trump considered the deal stupid at first, but later approached it.
"You can certainly say this is not a deal you've created, but you're going to have to stick to it," he told Trump Turnbull.
In some passages, the phone conversation with Turnbull was almost jovial, for example, when Trump appreciated it as a good idea of Australia's refusal to accept refugees arriving in boats.
"You're worse than me," Trump joked.
Suddenly, though, the tone of the conversation escalated.
"I hate receiving these people," Trump noted.
I assure you, they're bad.
That's why they're in jail now.
"They're not going to be great people going to work for the local milkman," he said.
In the interview, he also noted that a refugee could become a Boston bomber in five years.
Trump conducted telephone conversations with a number of world statesmen at the end of January, roughly a week after coming to the White House, often several within a day.
The call with Turnbull eventually marked the least pleasant of the day.
Before ending it, he highlighted that he had previously had a pleasant conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
They executed Rana's killer in front of the crowd.
Her father watched.
The execution took place in a square in Yemen's capital, Sana.
For his sacrifice, Muhammad al-Maghrabi chose the tiny Rana Almatari, who lived in his neighborhood.
Al Maghrabi kidnapped the girl, took her to her father's house, where he raped her and strangled her with his bare hands.
He subsequently raped her body, which he then dumped near the mosque.
The violent death of a little girl has hit an entire country facing the threat of civil war.
Yahya Almatari stood in the front row of the millennial crowd who met to witness the execution.
Muhammad al Maghrabi was convicted under Sharia law.
The victim's father, after the execution, told the media his feelings.
I feel reborn.
I'm relieved.
It's a new day of my life.
Other members of the family were present, with the crowd shouting the motto "long live justice."
The rapist in the square brought in a police van from which he was dragged out.
The officers tied him to his stomach.
One of the members turned his weapon against him and opened fire at close range.
The present crowd celebrated every shot that was fired.
Mr al Almatari told the site MailOnline that justice had been done in accordance with the country's legal system.
"Justice, Allah and Sharia law have won," he added.
I stood at the Liberation Square in Sana, waiting for the execution of my daughter's killer.
Then my family and I went to the morgue.
We took Ranino's tiny body and buried him in a nearby cemetery.
Both I and my wife Jamileh are grateful that justice has been done.
Police feared the crowd gathered in the square would fall into a hateful frenzy, the killer grabs and lynched.
The execution was ordered by the court, which is under the administration of the Shiite Houthi.
Initially, however, Maghrabi was sentenced to 100 lashes immediately after his arrest, but his act aroused such outrage that the judge opted for the death penalty.
Al Maghrabi was arrested two days after the girl's disappearance on June 27.
Ranina's family knew him well.
When police searched the basement of his home, she discovered evidence that the man had planned his act.
Mr. Almatari described him as a monster.
What could have been his motive?
Even an animal would be more merciful to Rana.
"Our family has no enemies and the injuries that carried Ranino's body were horrific," he told the media.
"Rana disappeared in the afternoon, we reported it to the police that day, we told the newspaper and all our TV stations, the posters with her photo hung everywhere," he continued.
They all believe that the police received a tip from the killer's parents, who suspected their son of the horrific act.
The girl's mother, Jamileh, had to be hospitalised after learning her daughter's body had been found.
Rana used to play outside with the other kids from the neighborhood.
After 10-15 minutes I came out to see where he was.
We looked everywhere, but Rana was gone.
We walked around our block, our friends took cars and drove around the area, but we searched in vain.
The people of Yemen were disgusted by the crime and began to gather outside the police station where al Maghrabi was being held, demanding immediate punishment.
A Justice Department representative read to the present crowd a recording of the investigation to calm them down.
The accused did not appear to regret his actions.
Just before the execution of the sentence, officers read him the sentence, but the convict only gave a glimpse of his executioner.
The entire event was filmed for national television, but many of the records taken by the crowd appeared online.
West Virginia governor announces change in political party
West Virginia Democratic Governor Jim Justice on Thursday night announced at President Trump's rally that he was transitioning to another party.
"Like it or not, the Democrats have turned their backs on me," Governor Justice stated.
"I am telling you today, as a resident of West Virginia, that I can no longer support you from the position of democratic governor."
A crowd of onlookers exploded in joy.
"I'm going to sign up for Republicans tomorrow," Justice added.
'as a coach, I can tell you it's time to hop into another match.'
Trump has previously promised an important announcement to people at a rally in West Virginia.
Trump won in West Virginia with 42 points, and Justice did not support Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice, who according to Forbes magazine is the only billionaire across the country, was elected in 2016.
Forbes adds that Justice inherited a large property from his father and is the owner of several coal mines.
The value of his estate is estimated at $1.59 billion.
Meanwhile, the Republican National Committee issued a statement Thursday night that read: "Defeating Governor Justice is another blow for the Democratic Party, which puts obstacles in our way, instead of adding to the uplift of our country."
"For the Democratic Party, which has only 15 governors and controls the least legislative bodies in history, Governor Justice's announcement is the final drop for an already frenzied party without a leader who seeks in vain to find a positive and unifying message," RNC chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said in a statement to CBS News.
Sebastian Coe praises Russia's' sincere 'apology for doping scandal
Former outstanding athlete Sebastian Coe praised Russia on Thursday for a sincere apology for the doping scandal, but reiterated that it was not yet the right time for Russia's return to the sporting world.
Russian athletics chief Dmitry Shylakhtin said on the occasion of the IAAF congress - which took place on the eve of MS in athletics - that his country's expulsion from the world of sport was right and that he is committed to fighting doping.
He apologised "to all athletes who lost gold and silver medals in this way."
Despite his comments, members of the IAAF congress voted to maintain the ban, which came into force in November 2015 after a report by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) showed that Russia supported doping of its athletes.
"I think today we witnessed a very honest response and presentation," IAAF president Sebastian Coe told journalists.
"All the members of the council and congress have been pleasantly surprised that Russia has admitted its mistake and is working with all its strength to correct and restore the proper function of the entire federation."
CoE said he was also "pleased" that Russia had accepted the criteria for its reintroduction.
"I think today has been very successful and we have moved on to the next stage, but Congress supports the crisis staff's recommendation to maintain the punishment that has been thrown at Russia," Coe added.
"In the coming months, we must do everything we can to stabilize the situation.
Our effort has always been to separate honest athletes from the dishonest ones, "he ended his speech.
On MS in athletics, which begins on Friday in London, 19 Russian athletes will compete under a neutral flag to meet strict IAAF rules.
IAAF crisis chief Rune Andersen said on Monday that Russia still had to meet several criteria before being allowed back.
Drug presence tests are still non-compliant and exclusion coaches continue to operate, he told reporters in London after the IAAF board's presentation.
The state contract of CzechTrade was acquired by the firm of Franz Savova, whose state it is prosecuting.
The public contract of the state pro-export agency CzechTrade was won by the Young Front of Francis Savova.
Officials awarded him a hundred percent of points in all qualitative criteria.
They did not mind that the Czech State was prosecuting Savova for tax fraud and requesting his extradition to the Czech Republic.
The pro-export agency of the Ministry of Industry and Trade CzechTrade wrote a public contract in April for a four-year provision of editorial content for the BusinessInfo portal.
The contract with a total value of CZK 30.8 million was awarded to the Young Front of the entrepreneur Franz Savova.
In 2014, the Czech police accused him of tax evasion and prosecuting him on the run.
Savov has fled to the UK and the Czech Republic is asking for his extradition.
The case has been brought to the attention of the server.
According to the original criteria of CzechTrade, the award was to be decided from 60 percent of the price offered and the remaining 40 beauty contests, namely the quality of the project.
The second criterion was greatly helped by Savov's company.
According to the information, it received a hundred points in all sub-criteria.
That was what moved her ahead of another candidate, the Vltava Labe Media VLM, which offered a better price.
While the Young Front operated with an amount of 404 900 kronor a month, VLM offered 324 350 kronor.
But unlike the Young Front, it received a sub-average rating from assessors in all qualitative criteria, a total of 62 points.
The Tendra was also attended by the consultant firm BDO Advisory and the digital agency R-Media, which falls in the same way as the Economia website.
VLM submitted a number of objections to the result of the tender, stating that its assessment considered the NZA unfair and insufficiently reasoned.
Following their rejection, it decided to contest the contest with the Office for the Protection of Competition of the OHS.
He believes that CzechTrade acted in violation of the law.
"The appellant is satisfied that the contracting authority has reached a decision on the selection of the contractor on the basis of a purely subjective assessment, clearly favoring the participant Mlada Front, a.s., at the expense of the applicant and other suppliers," it says in a petition filed at the OHS this week published by the server Current.
According to the CEO and chairman of the board of VLM Michal Keys, the scoring of the selection board appears to be an implausible and 100% assessment of the Young Front project by all its members as extremely suspicious.
"Any independent observer must consider such a prodigious success of one of the competitors as unlikely and suspect," he stated for Current Key.
CzechTrade has not yet commented on the situation.
In principle, CzechTrade does not comment on public contracts prior to their conclusion.
All information about the contract referred to you shall be published in accordance with the law in the Profilu of the contracting authority and in the Public Procurement Bulletin.
"After the termination of the contract, a full written report will be published, but we cannot comment on it during the duration of the contract," said the agency's media representative, Stephen Long.
The young front responded by saying that it considered it extremely problematic that the Economia label had been hit by an article in Update.cz in a competition where it had its own business interests.
However, that fact was stated in that article.
It could have been helped by the fact that she had provided the BusinessInfo editorial service for the previous four years.
The contract first competed in 2013, when the Ministry of Industry and Trade was led by Martim Cuba ODS.
Francis Savova blames the police for tax evasion in connection with the excessive VAT deductions of his companies, which caused the Czech State alleged damage of up to CZK 770 million.
The Czech Republic has been asking Great Britain for its extradition since 2014.
According to Savova, the head of the ANO movement, Andrej Babi≈°, is behind his criminalisation, under whose influence Mafra's label falls.
Last year, a London court dismissed Savov's appeal against extradition, but the businessman appealed.
"From our point of view, the case has not moved anywhere since last year, we have not received any notification from the United Kingdom until today," said a spokesperson for the Prague City Prosecutor's Office, Stephen Zenkle.
In addition to the ownership of the Young Front, Savov was located in the company Harvestor Limited, based in Cyprus, controlled by Samson's Czech brewery, and in the Cypriot company Maraflex, which profiles itself as an investment fund, purchasing endangered assets.
It would also be controlled by the bankrupt firm Heavy Machinery Services, formerly Legios, which owes over three billion crowns.
In the past, Savov has also been associated with the removal of assets from the former Socialist Youth Union.
The biker ran along the sidewalks and the park, ending up in a cauldron.
The biker drew attention to himself by unscrupulous driving along the streets, sidewalks and park paths in √ö≈°ovice.
When the patrol began to chase him, he decided to drive her in the direction of the location.
"Police officers pursued the city with caution when he failed to drive on one of the side roads behind the Mariana Lakes and drove a motorcycle into the field where he crashed," said police spokesman Daniel Dvorak.
The accident eventually had to be flown by a rescue helicopter, who transported the injured biker to a spa hospital.
Eventually, officers discovered that the biker did not own a driver's license, the registration plates on the motorcycle were stolen, his production number sharpened and the production label itself removed.
It's possible the machine was stolen.
The origin of the motorcycle is under further investigation.
"Carried out by a breath test, the presence of alcohol in the driver was ruled out, but the test found a positive result on the substance methamphetamine," the police spokesman added.
How football's financial rules will affect Neymar's move to Paris
Rules restricting funding for European football clubs will in no way undermine Neymar's record transfer from Spain's Barcelona to France's Paris-Saint Germain.
Any penalty for Paris Saint-Germain will be realised by the EUFA, which oversees European football teams and has the power to ban teams from participating in the prestigious Champions League.
Financial Fair Play (FFP) rules introduced by UEFA in 2011 stipulate that PSG will have to prove Neymar's transfer was not funded without major losses.
Barcelona paid a calculated ‚Ç¨222 million just to buy Neymar out of his contract and Neymar will claim a salary of several tens of millions of dollars a year.
It follows several financial terms of Neymar's transfer to France.
Given that the PSG team is funded by a wealthy cathartic family who have grown rich in energy sales, he can afford to bring Neymar to an already stellar football family.
Clubs can spend huge sums on buying players, but on the other hand they have to prove statutory sources of income, allowing them to cover the overheads of football-related business activities.
FFP was introduced by Michel Platini after reaching the UEFA director's chair in 2007.
The former French player believed the clubs, in pursuit of new reinforcements, would ultimately cheat and risk bankruptcy if banks or owners refuse to secure them.
In 2011, FFP rules redirected their attention from club debt to monitoring their losses.
That change meant that the business model used by Roman Abramovich with Chelsea in 2003 - to buy a club with potential and spent horrendous sums on players y to build a global brand - was suddenly not so convenient.
Under the current three-year test period, which expires in 2018, clubs can report a loss of up to ‚Ç¨30 million.
And despite Platini having to leave his post in 2015, his successor Aleksander Cheferin is committed to defending a ban on overspending.
"The FFP rules still apply and we are determined to strengthen them in the future," he said last week for The Associated Press's Andrea Traverso, who oversees compliance with FFP rules.
Although PSG paid the amount for the redemption of Neymar in a one-off payment, he can spread the amount for the purpose of accounting for the full length of the contract.
Neymar has signed a five-year contract so the transfer can be circulated at ‚Ç¨44.4 million each year for five years.
The first wave of top FFP penalties hit PSG in 2014 along with Manchester City, which is owned by the Abu Dhabi group.
PSG took a fine of ‚Ç¨60 million ($82 million) - which was later reduced to ‚Ç¨20 million - and an order to reduce the Champions League squad to 21 players in the 2014-15 season, instead of 25 players.
UEFA is wary of teams that may try to bypass financial regulators by raising their revenue through companies linked to club owners.
So even if the cathartic company is sponsoring PSG, once the funding exceeds the value of the standard market rate, UEFA has the right to ban the billing of the amount.
A similar measure was approached by UEFA in 2014 after deciding that the amount of funding provided by Qatar Tourism Authority team PSG was too high.
Part of Neymar's revenue at PSG could, according to some reports, be paid from the organising committee of MS in the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar.
However, PSG and MS 2022 officials in Qatar have denied fat that Neymat should become an ambasador of MS in football and that such a manoeuvre would be easily revealed by UEFY officials.
Previous sanctions thrown at PSG mean UEFA will closely monitor any attempt to circumvent the rules,
According to Tuesday's expressed insider, UEFA has not launched any investigation into the transfer of Neymar to PSG.
The source of the report wished to remain anonymous as he is not authorized to comment on the situation with PSG, the agency told The Associated Press.
The latest published accounts show PSG closed 2015-2016 with a net profit of ‚Ç¨10 million and a turnover of 542.4 million.
The accounts for the current financial year have not yet been disclosed.
PSG expect the arrival of Neymar to be a huge opportunity for sponsors, merchandising and selling jerseys.
The club promises a turnover increase of up to 30 per cent from the signing of the contract.
Spanish league officials, clearly concerned with the departure of one of the biggest stars, sought to thwart Neymar's departure, arguing that PSG would break FFP rules.
"It is a clear case of 'financial doping' of both club and state," la League president Javier Teba said for Spanish newspaper AS, referring to the club's ownership of the PSG cathartic syndicate.
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, whose club is owned by the American sports mogul, shares the same La Liga stance on club funding.
"It is a consequence of ownership that has changed the football world from scratch in the last 15 years," Wenger was heard saying on Thursday.
'once a club owner becomes a state, anything is possible.
Complying with the rules of financial fair play is very difficult because the state can have different interests in the participation of such players in their club.'
Spartan reservist Rosicky: Changes are painful, but we have to believe.
Sixteen thousand applauding fans on their feet.
Tomas Rosicky goes to the set.
Same scene as Sunday's game against the Bohemians.
The Spartan reservist moved a game against the Cricket lift, made up a couple of goals, but his teammates did not aim for the black.
The Leten team pumped with new multi-million-pound reinforcements so after the opening double-match in the European cups ends.
Was it hard to do anything with the game after the Belgrade goal?
After the goal collected, four had to be absorbed, which was tough for us.
We wanted to at least not lose, lift our confidence so we have something to bounce back from in the next matches.
We had some chances.
We have to work together as a team and move our game.
Why couldn't Sparta get that long into the match?
The game is so worked up.
The combination of the opponent was much better than ours.
We didn't get to anything, we shot at half-time maybe once.
That is very little, of course, when you have to win by two or three goals.
The second half was much better, we managed to play with them in the final third.
But you have to push your opponent into such positions more often.
Is the problem a large number of changes in the lineup?
Of course, it is one of pain when a new team is formed.
We've only played three competitive matches and the lineup is still changing.
The point is for the coach to find the ideal 11th to sit out.
Is it a boost to you that you've already played parts of two games in a row?
It's still just parts of the game.
I don't know myself how my condition is going to evolve and when I could play at last from the start.
Are you still optimistic about the changes that have taken place in Sparta?
We have to be, there's no other way.
It's the same as with an injury.
If you don't believe, you can't go back.
Sparta has somehow decided, we must be optimistic, otherwise the situation will be even worse.
The fans again came in large numbers but left embarrassed.
What can you tell them?
There was once again a wonderful visit, as with Bohemka.
I'm so sorry we can't make them happy with a better performance.
Show something they'll come for next time.
We can thank them for having arrived.
I don't remember such visits when I played here 15 years ago.
Can a season without cups be at least an advantage for the league?
So far we're fighting ourselves, we're playing, so it's not such an advantage for us.
For extreme tax evasion, an entrepreneur is supposed to serve ten years.
The Constitutional Court rejected the complaint of businessman George Toman, who is serving ten years in prison for cutting taxes to a considerable extent.
The quantified damage is CZK 645 million.
TOMAN argued in the complaint that the judiciary violated its fundamental rights, the factual findings of the courts in Zl√≠n and Olomouc are said to be incomplete.
But constitutional judges branded the complaint unfounded, ƒåTK found from the court's database.
The CPVO is not another court of appeal.
"It cannot, as a fourth instance, assess factual or legal errors allegedly committed by ordinary courts if they do not constitute a violation of constitutionally protected rights and freedoms," the order reads.
TOMAN was tried as a fugitive.
The verdict has been final since November 2015, when it was upheld by the High Court in Olomouc.
At the time, Toman was in custody in Argentina, where, according to the resolution, he was also at the time of the CPVO's decision.
The sentence imposed is at the upper limit of the statutory rate, which, according to the verdict, corresponds to the damage suffered.
The High Court has described the case as an extreme tax evasion that has a macroeconomic impact on the state budget.
The man served as chairman of the Board of Directors of World Servis between 2005 and 2008.
The loss of CZK 645 million was incurred only for the period from January to July 2008, and the total leak, according to the expert, was over a billion.
However, for procedural reasons, it was no longer possible to judge Toman for the full amount.
According to the indictment, World Servis did not include any invoices in its tax returns.
Instead of monthly levies on VAT and excise duties of at least tens of millions of crowns, it paid taxes in only hundreds of thousands.
The World Servis, as well as some of the companies the firm has traded with, have a relationship with the entrepreneur Radrehar Vyb√≠ral, whom the judiciary has swapped for VAT machinations at fuel stores for 13 years.
His complaint was also rejected by the Constitutional Court ahead of time.
The series "Summer to Survive" and "Comrade Detective" play on a nostalgic chord
This iteration of the story is nostalgic both for the characters of the famous 1980s; so for the dirty 90s (when geniuses David Wain and Michael Showalter put on the MTV comedy sketch "The State"); and, of course, for modern times, namely 2001, before stars like Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd scattered to larger projects.
As a cultural artifact, it is a light parody and, at the same time, the embodiment of our modern Facebook era of lasting memories.
From the franchise's perspective, though, it looks like someone is running out of breath.
The series "First Day of Camp" worked surprisingly well - not just thanks to the ludicrous humor (an example may be the story of the emergence of a talking can of vegetables spoken by H. Jon Benjamin).
The authors diverged from the main funny point - middle-aged actors playing teenage horny children - and couldn't make fun of previous events.
The sequel to "Ten Years Later," in which adults play adults doesn't push so much on an emotional plane, and satire is places to sporadic, including a parody of 1990s thrillers like "Hand on the cradle."
At one point, the character finds an Apple Powerbook on a pile of junk, roller skates and "lots of other stuff from 1991."
Many of the main storylines are repeated.
The kind-hearted Coop (Mr. Showalter), now a writer, still didn't get over his love for Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) is still a virgin.
Not to mention the crazy plot that includes Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter), incited by George H. W. Bush (the very well-cast Michael Ian Black).
As always, the best part of the franchise are many side stories.
It's particularly fun to watch a perpetually young Rudd with long hair aka the character of Matt Dillon from the film The Youth, whose once-respectful character Andy is now behind the old peppers.
The franchise could kick-start moments of random madness, like the resurgent series "Seven Up," until it reaches what I suppose will be a logical denouement: "Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later," when, in the final scene, the entire group goes to the premiere of "Summer to Survive."
"Comrade Detective" on Amazon, meanwhile, appeals to a different type of nostalgia: The revivalism of the Cold War series "Such Normal Americans," the film "Atomic Blonde: No regrets" and even the series "GLOW," in which icons of the Eastern and Western wrestling scenes collide.
The comedy of creators Brian Gatewood and Alessandra Tanaka in director Rhys Thomas is meant to act as a television staging: A drama about two Bucharest police officers from Romania of the 1980s who fight for truth and atheism after a way of Marxism-Leninism.
The lead roles - the tenacious Gregor and the idealistic Iosef - are played by Florin piersic Jr. and Corneliu Street, who pitched into the English language Channing Tatum (executive producer of the series) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
It's a wonderful idea.
Unfortunately, it's not much more than that.
Some jokes make you laugh (like cops watching chess on TV - a parody of American football).
The series lent its voice to many well-known actors - among them Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chlo√´ Sevigny.
But "Comrade Detective" focuses too much on the awkward propaganda drama - which includes a killer with a Reagan mask - and that's what it looks like, too.
Six long episodes are too choppy, and comedy moments aren't enough.
With a shorter stoppage, the propaganda satire in "Comrade Detective" could work, such as in a scene where Gregor and Iosef repeatedly visit the US Embassy, in whose hall two fat men devour hamburgers stacked in a large pile.
A clear message to an imaginary communist audience is the fact that Western culture can turn everything into food and orgy.
The Romanian creators were not wrong: We do so with our own culture, as we do with theirs.
Russian athletes have not received the lifting of the ban from the IAAF.
The IAAF International Athletic Federation at a congress in London has confirmed an extension of an international ban on starting Russian racers because of a state-sponsored doping programme.
The vote in the world championships, which will begin on Friday, was expected to be very clear.
There were 166 delegates to extend the ban, against only 21 votes.
The main reason for the rejection is that Russia is failing to meet all the requirements for the introduction of an anti-doping system, as the head of the IAAF Special Investigative Group Rune Andersen noted before Congress.
His group recommended that the ban go further.
Some older doping cases remain unsolved, a number of suspected athletes have not yet been interviewed, and coaches are still working in the country with a trampled reputation.
The Russian Anti-Doping Agency RUSADA, which does not meet World Anti-Doping Agency standards, is not yet fully operational.
However, RUSADA can already conduct testing under the supervision of foreign experts and the British Anti-Doping Agency.
"While there has been progress, there is still a lot of work to be done," IAAF chairman Sebastian Coe said.
The Russian Athletic Federation was suspended in November 2015, the Russian athletes so came, among other things, about last year's Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
Despite the ban, the upcoming MS will be attended by 19 Russians who have previously shown they have been tested for an extended period of time outside the Russian anti-doping system.
But in the Championship they will not be able to start in national colours and, in the event of victory, they will not play the Russian anthem.
Bank of England retains interest rate to 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to announce that the interest rate will remain unchanged, following unmarked economic growth and weakening inflation, which has compounded speculation of sharp growth.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain "in the background" in the run-up to keeping interest rates on hold - despite juggling family budgets.
The policy makers of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the Bank of England voted six to two to keep the interest rate at 0.25%.
In its annual inflation report, the bank predicted growth at 1.7 per cent in 2017 and 1.6 per cent in 2018, and warned that cutting family budgets would continue - the Bank expects inflation to rise to 3 per cent in the autumn.
At the same time, the Bank has indicated that there should be growth over the next few years as a result of the inflation caused by Brexiteers, and has also indicated that affluent rents should rise more than expected in financial markets.
Members of the committee also voted to withdraw part of the mammoth package tasked with supporting the economy, and which was put into practice a year ago as a response to Brexit.
As a result of the above, the Term Funding Plan, which will offer cheap subsidies to banks, is due to start next February, although the Bank of England said it would now offer ¬£15 billion less than the planned ¬£115 billion.
Just before the decision, the bank said: "The MPC predicts that gross domestic product (GDP) will stagnate in the short term, along with pressure on real household incomes and the burden of consumption."
On the subject of rates, the Bank said it would need to "tighten the belts of monetary policy" to calm inflation, "at a higher rate" than markets expect.
Markets are currently forecasting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another increase in 2020.
But the bank stressed that any increase would be "gradual" and "limited."
The bank cut its growth forecast for this year and next year, compared with 1.9 per cent and 1.7 per cent predicted in May.
Projected growth in 2018 of 1.8 per cent remained unchanged.
Following the publication of estimates, the pound fell against the dollar and the euro.
The pound fell 0.5 per cent to $1.31 and up 0.4 per cent to ‚Ç¨1.11.
The decision to maintain the status quo came after a disappointing increase buried hopes of further growth - GDP stalled at 0.3 per cent in the second quarter compared to 0.2 per cent from the previous three months.
The increase is likely to remain at 0.3% in the third quarter, although it is expected to increase slightly by the end of the year.
The latest inflation report is a slight consolation for households hit by rising inflation and miserable pay increases.
The report goes on to say that monetary policy "cannot prevent" a reduction in revenue in the coming years, but wages are expected to "significantly" rise towards the end of the three-year forecast.
Economics should also rise thanks to a lot of interest in British goods thanks to the weak pound, which will offset a lower percentage of consumer spending.
That decision came a year after rates were cut to 0.025 per cent last year in response to a shocking vote on the EU referendum, which caused the pound to fall.
The Bank estimates that the full unification of prices and the economy will last at least four years.
Ahead of the Bank's decision on the latest rates, many have called for a rise in rates along with rising inflation, which has put increasing pressure on households. Three policy makers demanded an increase to 0.5% in June.
Inflation last month fell back to 2.6% from June's 2.9%, even though the bank said it expected such a change and that inflation should rise again over the next month.
The bank said the excess relative to the 2 per cent target was "entirely" due to the weak pound.
Andrew Montlake, director of Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: "Given the recent fall in swap rates, it looks like competition in the mortgage market will only rise once lenders start competing for contracts with a look at a good outlook towards the end of the year.
The market looks particularly good for those who end up with existing contracts and re-mortgages - there are no-fee options on offer, as well as the low rates they gain on liking. "
NHS prescribes controversial HIV drug to 10,000 patients
Patients will gain from September access to 'transformative' treatment to prevent HIV following the Supreme Court's decision to fund the NHS drug.
The English National Health Service (NSH) reported that the pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) pill, which is taken before sex and reduces the risk of infection in high-risk patients by up to 86 percent, will be offered through the health service to about 10,000 patients within a three-year trial period.
Nsh agreed to fund the trial period after an appeals court upheld a Supreme Court ruling from last year stating that the NHS had the funds to pay PrEP despite a declaration that the drug should be funded by local authorities.
The decision, which was announced on Thursday, was taken by NHS England from the mouth of chief executive Simon Stevens as a 'significant intervention', while the National Aids Trust (NAT) described the decision as a 'decisive moment'.
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to start accepting patients. Other clinics will join in October and by April 2018 there will be full implementation across the whole of England.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is an HIV drug given before sex to reduce the risk of HIV disease.
Tests showed that PrEP significantly reduced the risk of HIV transmission among endangered patients.
The application of PrEP before sex means that a sufficient number of specific drugs are found in the patient's body to prevent infection.
These drugs can be taken every day or at least two hours before sex.
The patients tested include gay or bisexual men, transgender people and people with HIV-positive partners who are not treated successfully.
Clinics will identify eligible participants who sign consent to participate in testing, including men, women, transgender people and individuals with a partner whose HIV status is not yet controlled by appropriate treatment.
People living and registered with a GP in the UK can also sign up at their local sexual health clinic and apply for potential participation in testing.
The programme will come to taxpayers for ¬£10 million and NHS England signed a contract this week to distribute the drugs after obtaining an international public contract.
The trial period is designed to gather clinical evidence and assess the full potential of PrEP, its targeting, use and implementation on a large scale.
Simon Stevens added: "This important intervention should complement and fully mop up the ever-expanding and increasingly successful HIV prevention efforts.
It's another milestone in a more than 30-year effort to stop one of the biggest challenges to human health.'
Deborah Gold, executive director of the NAT (National Aids Trust) said: "We are witnessing a decisive moment in the fight against HIV.
If PrEP is administered properly and patients at risk, it will offer the possibility of transforming the English HIV epidemic.
Nsh will offer from September to patients at high risk of HIV infection a new powerful tool that is individually controlled and not subject to the need to persuade a partner, leading to an improvement in the quality of many lives.
We accept this statement with pleasure. "
Ian Green, managing director of the Terrence Higgins Trust said: "The number one priority must be the rapid deployment of tests across the country; we need to ensure its availability to every patient.
We now have a PrEP test drug available and we are well on track to protect more than 10,000 people at risk of HIV infection.'
Shadow health secretary Sharon Hodgson said: "The start of the PrEP test period is a welcome and long-awaited change after months of delays and delays by the government.
The evidence suggests how transformative this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and ending the transmission of this life-threatening infection.
Subsequent tests will bring us one step closer to a full understanding of PrEP's benefits.
It is now important that we launch the tests as soon as possible across the country to protect those who are exposed to HIV and together so end the spread of HIV in society.'
High-end life: A cross-floor and smart design turned this tiny apartment on Earls Court into a spacious home
Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, swapped a large house in Knightsbridge for a flat at Earls Cour in 2014.
It is located on the first floor of Queen Anne's smart terrace - and is an illustration of modern design that makes use of the maximum available space.
'before, I was living with my ex-husband in a much bigger house in the Knightsbridge neighborhood, 'Joanne stated.
"I was looking for something for a more reasonable price.
I ran into this apartment in Earls Court and had the same ceiling height.
I fell in love with him, and I nodded to him the same day. "
Since then, the 1,000-square-foot apartment has undergone a complete renovation.
A one-bedroom apartment with a complicated layout - to get to the bedroom, you had to walk through the kitchen - wanted Joanne to add swap spaces and an intermediate floor to take advantage of the high ceiling.
'I longed for a high ceiling, big windows and lots of light.
Those were my demands, "she said.
To that end, she employed Erfana Azadi from the designer and design studio Duck & Shed, headquartered in Notting Hill, and used the nearly four-metre ceiling to create a home that was not simply a project but also a place to live.
The ceiling was not so high as to fit two gaps - the challenge for the architects was to create an intermediate floor on which to walk upright.
Erfan had to engage his creative thinking.
"The steel structure is quite complicated," he explained.
"We had to arrange both spaces so that we could walk upright.
It was not merely a matter of building a simple platform, but at the same time bending the steel structure to the right height above and below the ceiling. "
This arrangement allowed Erfan to construct two full-fledged rooms on top of each other - while also adding to the dramatic.
On the intermediate floor, the old copper window frames in the Retrouvius design look down on the beautiful living room.
Mirrored furniture in gold colour, silver line and retro chandelier Serge Mouille creates a unique style.
The use of mirrors plays an important role in drama, space and lighting.
The short hallway is fitted with mirrors on both sides and looks so long.
The mirror bar in the kitchen looks like a window into the next room.
At the front door there are storage areas fitted with mirrors to store cutlery and glasses.
The advantage of the living room, which gives the whole apartment the impression of a significantly larger space, is the possibility of separating it from the kitchen if not in use.
Drop-down kitchens are nothing new.
But what is unique about this solution is the folding door.
"We had to work out the technical side," erfan says of the reinforced veneered door.
"The door is equipped with a counterweight to pull back very easily."
Thanks to the clever use of space and storage space, Joanne gained an additional 16 square metres, a second room and a better overall apartment layout.
"When it comes down to it, what you're selling is a residential area - or a valuation of your property," erfan said.
"The real estate agent basically calculates his price on the basis of the residential area when he enters the apartment."
In this case, it has managed to increase the living area while maintaining quality materials that give the space a luxurious look.
"The material is very important because you touch it and you create an emotional bond with the home," erfan added.
"You don't love the power lines in the walls.
Yes, they're important, but they won't get your heart. "
As it turns out, quality design and an increase in living space can turn an ordinary apartment into an exceptional work.
And like Joanne, you, too, may decide to stay.
The United States is recognisable.
The cultural and political divide between the states of blue and red is deepening.
California has announced a travel ban on its citizens to the state of Tennessee and the other seven states.
The state of Tennessee repaid it and declared a retaliatory ban on the travel of its citizens to California.
Of course, this is not a ban in the full sense, US citizens can travel freely after all 50 states.
It comes as California has banned spending state money on the journeys of its citizens to eight other states, which are Alabama, South Dakota, Kansas, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, Tennessee and Texas.
Who will stop the madness?
California is strongly pro-LGBT, and any show of disapproval of the LGBT lifestyle is considered discrimination.
But Tennessee has adopted a conscience-only law that says a psychotherapist who has a moral problem with treating patients from the LGBT community has no obligation to provide it to them, but has an obligation to provide those patients with another therapist who does not have such a problem.
Texas and other states have adopted laws under which religious charities that have given birth to children after birth are under no obligation to provide these children for adoption.
Because of these laws of conscience, California has banned the financing of the travel of its citizens to the eight states of the Union by its means.
In practice, this means that California professors may not have trips to scientific symposia, for example, in Texas reimbursed from their universities, because they are co-financed by the state of California.
Similarly, school sports teams cannot travel to tournaments or competitions, for example, to Tennessee with the financial support of their schools.
They have to get either federal grants to travel, but it's absurd for the federal government to fund citizens' travel from state A to state B, or private sponsorship.
The state of Tennessee has run out of patience, and its parliament has passed a law with a resolution that it does not like California's policy of high taxes, high state spending, high deficits, and tolerance of illegal immigrants, but it does not impose a travel embargo on California because of it.
It imposes them as retaliation for California's travel embargo on Tennessee.
And the same will happen to any state of the union that would order a similar travel ban on another state for any reason.
At the same time, he called on the parliaments of all states to stop this madness.
That's the facts, now the comment.
The situation is toxic.
First, all of this is constitutional, nothing is unconstitutional.
States have the right to adopt laws on the reservation of conscience, as well as to decide what their money will go to and what they are not allowed to do.
Second, what's wrong with the reservation of conscience?
If a butcher has a religious problem selling pork, why couldn't he only offer beef, lamb, poultry and fish?
Why force him to sell pork under the penalty of punishment, when butchers offering pork is enough?
In the state of Colorado, one baker is facing an anti-discrimination lawsuit and a hefty fine because he refused to bake a cake for a gay wedding.
But he also refuses to bake cakes for Halloween or containing alcohol.
Why punish him and not leave him alone and the appropriate cakes not to be treated by hundreds of other bakers?
Third, the beauty of the federal system is that the constitutional rights of all the citizens of the Federation are guaranteed, but individual states can adjust their internal, domestic policies, which are not federal, according to the preferences of their citizens.
Then there are diversity, diversity, diversity.
California may be California, and Texas could be Texas.
But California wants California to be California and Texas, and seven other states were California, too!
Fourth, members of the LGBT community once rightly sought tolerance for their lifestyle.
Today, many members of this community are governed by the rule of live and let live, which all reasonable people should follow, but some activists strive not for tolerance for themselves and others, but for extreme intolerance towards others.
According to them, no one can ever show moral, religious or philosophical opposition to the LGBT lifestyle, and if they do so, it should be criminalised.
The mentality of these activists is totalitarian.
They are modern enemies of freedom.
Fifth, I do not know the situation in American history when, because of political issues, states did so on purpose, except in the case of one.
Even in the days of the struggle for the civil rights of black people, where North and West were on the side of integration and the South on the side of segregation, the states did not impose sanctions on each other.
The only case was the 1950s, the political case was slavery, and the North's war against the South was brewing.
Of course, nothing like this will happen now, but the situation is still toxic.
The cultural and political divide between blue-democratic states and red-Republican states is deepening, and the U.S. is mentally inward-looking.
Unauthorised agitation.
A critic of Putin received a greasy fine.
Russian opposition politician Alexei Navalny has been fined 300,000 rubles for violating campaign rules ahead of the presidential election, which will take place next year.
The court fined him for inviting people to participate in unauthorised demonstrations.
Navalny has staged two major anti-government street protests in the past two months and announced plans to bid for the post of head of state in March next year.
Acting Kremlin chief Vladimir Putin has yet to announce his candidacy, but is widely expected to do so and win again.
Navalny said police came to his home that morning and took him to court.
The latter fined him for inviting people to demonstrations through videos posted on YouTube's online portal.
The fine is three hundred thousand.
"We will later tear them out of the judge's salary," a Kremlin critic joked on twitter.
The Russian Electoral Commission recently concluded that Navalny could not participate in the presidential election because he had previously been convicted of embezzlement.
However, Navalny, who is considered a fighter against corruption, views the judgment as politically motivated.
A fine of 300,000 rubles, covering 25 thousand rubles, was also imposed on Thursday by two members of Navalny's campaign team, Leonid Volkov and Nikolai Ljaskin.
Navalny entered Russian politics as an anti-corruption blogger and gradually became a dominant figure on the fragmented opposition scene.
The authorities are trying to defend Navalny in the campaign.
In February, he was sentenced to a five-year suspended sentence due to stealing from forestry firm Kirovles.
The May verdict was upheld by the Court of Appeal.
The judgment is so final, which prevents Navalny from running under Russian law.
Brothers fight for empire worth over $500 million
The two brothers now, more than four decades after the founding of the empire by their Italian family, are dragging on one of the most expensive Victorian properties worth in excess of $500 million.
Former Carlton Football Club director and developer Colin De Lutis dwells on the Toorak estate, just three rooms away from his younger brother Paul, who has driven a dispute over joint property and commercial property to the supreme court.
Paul wanted to leave the family business as early as 2014, but the sharp dispute is constantly being profiled before the Supreme Court.
Along with his mother Anna, the brothers own a total of 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars - the first shop bought by the family in 1973 on Smith Street in Collingwood.
On this site, the family founded the company Westco Jeans, which has grown into a chain with 160 stone stores.
In 1999, the family sold the entire company for $85 million.
More properties have been bought for the money, and the De Lutis family's portfolio now includes offices, building grounds in Brunswick and Sorrento, apartments on the Gold Coast and Mt Buller, and business centres in the suburbs.
Paul owns about one-third of the company's assets, while his father Colin, who according to Paul's words is "a significant driving force and dominant personality" of the De Lutis family, owns less than two-thirds of the assets.
The court filing states that Colin owns properties worth $316 million, while Paul manages the properties for $176 million.
For Paul, the division of property and funds became a problem.
"Colin's proposal sounded significantly in his favor in my eyes," Paul wrote in an affidavit filed in court in 2015.
Last Friday, after several unsuccessful attempts at reconciliation, the first session of the Supreme Court was held.
The brothers are now also competing over who will control the existing business - from which Paul, according to his comments, Colin cut off.
Colin contradicts that this is not true and accuses Paul of mishandling some of the properties.
In a previous affidavit, Colin said he believed in a successful resolution of the conflict.
"My Italian origin dictates to me that family is the most important of all," he wrote.
The cost of the trial is rising. Hundreds of pages of affidavits, emails and messages from companies including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer are flooding advocates, including Allan Myers QC and barristers of both parties.
MS De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who had run dairy bars and delicacies since the 1950s, and bought a shop in Brunswick in the 1970s.
For money raised by building the property, they bought a property in Collingwood, where Colin opened his first family business with jeans.
Colin said that when he was founding Westco "in his senior year of college, Paul was still a small, about 10-year-old kid."
Anna De Lutis said that along with Luigi, who died in 2012, they hoped the transfer of the property to the sons would take place in a good way.
"Luigi often used to say that he never wanted his sons to end up in court," she wrote.
The other two brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis family group. Colin stated that Mark was compensated with $10 million and Luke $26 million when he left.
As Paul reported, both Luke and Mark "were not satisfied with the terms of their financial compensation."
Colin has since held back, despite the fact he is a former member of the AFL club's board of directors, as he stated in his 2015 autobiography Eddie McGuire, a well-known TV personality and Colin's best friend.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul de Lutis and their lawyers on Friday.
Only Colin replied through a text message in which he stated that due to the fact that the dispute is being settled before the court, "I have nothing to add to that."
"It is very sad that my brother Paul has decided to address the matter in court," he wrote.
In mid-2016, in one of the statements in court, Colin stated that he had struggled to adapt to his brother's demands.
"Our father would be very displeased to see our current situation," he was heard saying, adding that he was "still hoping for a successful solution."
On Friday, all hope was in sight.
"Our disputes will resolve a court hearing anytime soon," Colin wrote.
Heat in the Czech Republic.
Teachers shower children.
MHD drivers faze water as well as summer clothes.
At the nursery school Na Chodovec in Prague 4, where there are now about 35 children, they only go out in the morning.
The nursery is after reconstruction and the planted trees do not yet provide much shade.
There's no pool, but teacher kids shower in the nebula.
In the afternoon, children stay in classrooms where blinds and drawn curtains are drawn.
The air tries to cool the air cleaner because they don't have air conditioning.
It's challenging even for teachers and cooks.
"The temperature, which is both interior and exterior, exceeds the hygiene limits for nursery schools, so in this period we actually shouldn't even have open traffic," said kindergarten director Milcelebration Makovikova.
There's a glass corridor in the nursery, where it says the temperature is about 40 degrees.
We wind up the morning after 6: 00, the windows close, and we have blinds on the south sides that we protect.
"But it doesn't help much," she added.
They have better conditions in the forest nursery Na Hr√°zi in Hostivice, where children spend most of their time outdoors.
We have raised trees on the property, so we're under them.
"We have a beautiful walnut there, there's a table under it, and that's where we do different things," kindergarten director Barbora Kompanova described.
The teachers and the kids try to walk into the woods, where it's more cool.
Kids get wet caps and have different water games on the program.
"We have a hand pressure dispenser that is used to spray flowers, and we use it to shower children," Kompanova said.
Also, the director of the kindergarten at Novoborsk√° Street in Prague's Proseku Jitka Vilimovska said the children's teachers were trying to keep them in the shade and sprinkle them with water.
"We have a fairly buoyant garden, so they're there under the trees," she said.
He goes out in the morning and then after 15.
Every child must have a head blanket.
Teachers also remind children that they should drink.
They can choose, for example, low-sweetened tea or diluted juice, and have water fodder in the garden.
Every day they also have a vegetable salad and a snack of fresh fruit and vegetables, sometimes brought to them by their parents.
"Maybe a mother here today brought about a ten-pound watermelon for the kids," Makovikova added.
Drivers get water or summer uniforms.
The Prague transport company DPP provides them with water, ion drinks or summer uniforms on hot days.
The cabins of both tram and bus drivers are air-conditioned in most cases, said DPP spokeswoman Aneta Rivera.
In addition to the cabins, there are some trams in the passenger compartment.
The high-temperature tram tracks have not done any serious damage so far.
The minor damage occurred in a loop in Hostivar.
At the current high temperatures, we are particularly keen to have a sufficient number of drinks available to the driver.
"Chilled drinking water is available in all loops, cutting points and roadways," Rivera said.
In the roadways and in some shooting locations, employees have available so-called sodobars, which produce chilled soda.
Drivers also get soluble protective ion drinks.
"They can also use a summer uniform that increases the comfort of drivers in their daily shifts," the spokeswoman added.
The hot and dry weather of recent days has resulted in an increased number of fires.
On Tuesday, firefighters across the Czech Republic destroyed 108, double the long-term daily average.
On Tuesday, over a day when temperatures in the Czech Republic were climbing more than 35 degrees Celsius, firefighters were mainly fighting the fire.
"They outweigh the fires in the natural environment and also those associated with the granite works," said fire department spokeswoman Nicole Zaoral.
The relief to firefighters was not brought by the evening weather change, when the heat in a number of places was replaced by thunderstorms and torrential rainfall.
In the run-up to the storms, firefighters rode out 236 strikes.
It was, in particular, the removal of fallen trees and branches.
"They hit hardest in the Central Bohemian Region," Zaoral continues.
But the help of firefighters was also needed in Stvlick on Cheskolipsk, where 60 people from the children's camp were evacuated to safety because of the storm.
Tropical temperatures have also added work to Prague rescuers.
On Tuesday and at night on Wednesday, ambulances drove up to a dozen cases of carbon monoxide poisoning from the kar.
People should therefore have their water heaters checked, rescuers warn.
Carbon monoxide is a colourless, odourless gas that is released during imperfect combustion.
Symptoms of poisoning include nausea, vomiting, headache and feeling faint.
In case of suspected poisoning, it is necessary to leave the infested room.
Trump's new chief of staff plans to curb president's media diet
Before him, many tried and always failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.
If so, he will be the first.
The Politico portal said the new chief of staff at the White House plans to limit the flow of President Trump's information - including reporting on TV news - in hopes of keeping Trump afloat.
Here is part of reporter Josh Dawsey's report:
"When the new White House Chief of Staff John F. Kelly met on his first day in a new post with staff, he outlined a key problem Trump's White House plans to fix: Incorrect information getting into the president's hands.
Kelly told employees that he had to personally approve all the information - whether on paper or a spoken word - because the president "can make a better decision based on the right information."
Kelly's diagnosis actually makes sense, but many of his predecessors have drawn their teeth at the scrutiny of Trump and his presentation in the media.
Trump's relationship with the media dates back several decades - and now that he sits in the White House, his habit of watching TV news is even stronger.
"If Trump as a candidate was upset by honest reporting, it was fitting to show him that there was a lot of other media talking about him in a positive light that was easier to convince," he said in February for Politico's Sam Nunberg, a former campaign adviser.
Tara Palmero of the Politico portal at the time wrote that "the key to keeping Trump's tweets at bay - at least according to the words of six former organizers of his campaign - is to ensure that Trump regularly follows the media that heaps praise on him."
All right.
But the idea that Trump's tendency to publish his views on Twitter was ever "under control" is ridiculous.
Perhaps these campaign organizers know something that others have no idea - that Trump's tweets would be more outrageous if someone didn't check them.
We will most likely never know about the tweets Trump never sent.
If his staff managed to keep him at bay at least a few times, then their efforts did not go to waste.
But no one has so far been able to regularly prevent Trump from instigating controversial topics.
Part of the problem is that in the White House, which consists of rival factions, people regularly try to strengthen their agenda by letting Trump subvert materials - which may but may not be reliable - that support their worldview.
The Politico portal, which covered the issue from all sides, in May published a report on the tendency of advisers to submit questionable information to the head of state.
This is an example of such information from reporter Shane Goldmacher's pen:
"Current and former Trump officials say that the president often responds very angrily to negative news from the media, especially to news leaks, and seeks to find their origin.
That situation occurred at the end of February when someone slipped the president a copy of an article from GotNews.com - the website of provocateur Charles C. Johnson - who accused Deputy Chief of Staff Katie Walsh of being the 'source of many leaks' from the White House.
Regardless, Johnson was forever banished from Twitter for harassment; or that he did not substantiate his claim with any evidence; or that he had already made false allegations in the past and later retracted them.
Trump read the article and "started asking about Walsh."
Goldmacher added that then-Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and White House press secretary Rob Porter "were trying to implement the system to manage and dossier the information that President Trump receives."
Would it work?
Kelly is now, three months later, trying to push through the same strategy.
He may turn out to be a more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump's impulsiveness doesn't just go away, and his aides are still vying for power.
These immutable factors will certainly make Kelly's mission worse.
Tourists negotiate for ditch and return to 'millionaire neighborhood'
Several of the most affluent homeowners in the English county of West Midland are once again embarking on a dispute with determined tourists who are negotiating with local authorities for the rights to reclaim the field beyond their halls.
Tourists parked 20 caravans on a field near a thriving street in the town of Solihull, which is dubbed the 'millionaire neighborhood'.
Bringing horses, children and an army of caravans, tourists return after being banished in May.
The takeaway group found gaps in defence and penetrated the field with caravans unprotected by the gap that served for the trip.
Angry residents of the neighborhood attacked the board of the city of Solihull, saying it was "unable to solve the problem."
One of the residents, who wished to remain anonymous, said: 'They took the place on Monday night after they were moved to Bentley Heath Street, where they threw stones at other people.
The board should be ashamed of its inability to solve the problem.
All the tourists were moved to another location and now they have returned.
More arrived last night, and there will be more of them today. "
She added that: "The Birmingham Board of Directors knows how to deal with this problem - it is using court orders to protect the parks.
I live on Streetsbrook, and I'm not going to continue to pay my taxes until the board of trustees deal with tourists. "
Another of the anonymous residents said: 'It's ridiculous - we just recently watched the last departing tourists and now they're back.
And this time there are more, and this time they brought their horses with them. "
A press spokesman for the board of the city of Solihull said: "We are aware of an unauthorised stay at a property near Streetsbrook Road and, in collaboration with local police, we are taking the necessary legal action to successfully resolve the whole problem.
To gather as much evidence as possible, it is essential that as many locals as possible report any non-social or unlawful behaviour to the shelf at number 101.
We'll get the overall picture we present in court. "
EuroMP's husband hit by car in Brussels
He was brought in by a government special.
A government special delivered the injured R√≥bert ≈Ωitanian to Bratislava on Wednesday after noon.
Two ambulances were waiting at the airport and he was under constant scrutiny by Slovak doctors on board the aircraft.
The long-planned flight went around without complications.
R√≥bert ≈Ωitanian had a serious accident in Brussels in early summer, according to TV JOJ.
He is said to have been hit by a car and has been in a serious condition ever since.
After being transported to the country, he was transported to the specialized workplace of one of the Bratislava hospitals.
The economic analyst is the husband of Slovak MEP Jana ≈Ωitanian of NOVA.
She did not want to comment on the incident.
The couple have three children together.
Italians toughen up in fight against NGO rescue ships with immigrants on board
Italy has announced that it will prevent the arrival of NGO rescue ships coming to the coast of Italy with immigrants from the Mediterranean if the NGO does not sign new rules regulating their operations.
"If the NGO does not sign new rules of conduct, it will be hard for us to imagine that they could continue their operations," Interior Minister Marco Minniti said in an interview with Turin's La Stampa newspaper.
Minniti's warning came a day after Italian authorities seized the ship of German rescue organisation Jugend rettet on suspicion of human trafficking, significantly easing illegal immigration.
The rescue organisation, which operates in its first year, declined to comment on the matter because of allegations made by Italian prosecutor Ambrogia Cartosios.
"For us, it is and always will be the number one priority to save people's lives.... We are very sorry that we cannot currently operate in rescue zones," the organization said in a statement on social networks.
"We can only comment on all current charges after gathering all the information and evaluating the whole situation."
Italian authorities have been tracking the Iuventa organization's Jugend rettet since Oct.
Her crew is suspected of carrying immigrants on the boat, handed over directly by traffickers, repeatedly.
At least one meeting, according to the applicant's file, was allegedly only 1.3 miles off the coast of Libya. Italian media published the course of the meeting.
The ship's crew is suspected of breaking the law and bypassing the Italian Coast Guard, which oversees rescue operations in the area - out of humanitarian enthusiasm, rather than anything else.
The code of conduct establishes the presence of an Italian police officer on board ships such as Iuventa to monitor activities.
Only three of the nine non-profit organisations involved in rescue operations have so far agreed to comply with the code: Save The Children, Maltese MOAS and the Spanish Pro-Activa Open Arms.
The latter organisation said on Thursday that the new rules were not necessary but acceptable as they did not represent any "substantial change or obstacle" to the rescue operations.
The adoption of the new code of conduct was rejected, for example, by the organisation Doctors Without Borders (MSF), which holds the Nobel Prize.
Meanwhile, MINNITI let it be heard that the sharp decline in immigrants in recent weeks disembarking in Italy as part of rescue operations suggests that efforts to boost patrols off the coast of Libya and cooperation with local mayors bear fruit.
"In recent days we are beginning to see the light at the end of the tunnel," the minister stated.
He also revealed plans for further talks to take place this month with the mayor of Libya on an economic development initiative, as well as with representatives of Chad, Niger and Mali over measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving those countries in the hope of reaching Europe.
Shameless Mesarosh: Silicone and cellulite crawled out of her overalls!
The hot summer days are completely tempted to take on only the essentials that cover the most intimate parts.
Only Dominika Mesaroshi does it the other way around.
At an afternoon meeting at the Prague Zoo, where the actors, presenters, singers, and all who had anything to do with TV Prima were just swarming, she draped her body in a mini overalls.
And all it took was a few routine moves, and the model showed everyone her silicones, but also her posterior.
He had cut it in half a number of times, and it was so high that she had to adjust it all the time.
She certainly had no need for the attention of the gentlemen and the photographers present.
Michelle Carter sentenced for sending text messages urging Conrad Roy's suicide
A woman from Massachusets has been sentenced to prison in the amount of two years for inciting her boyfriend to commit suicide via text messages and phone calls.
Twenty-year-old Michelle Carter is serving 15 months of a two-year sentence behind bars and will then spend five years on parole.
Carter was sentenced in June for the involuntary manslaughter of Conrad Roy, who took his own life on July 13, 2014.
Roy's father testified in court on Thursday: 'The whole family is devastated.
My son was my best friend.'
Carter was left at large until the decision.
She was facing up to 20 years in prison, but her lawyers argued that she and Roy suffered from mental illness.
Dressed in red trousers and a cream blouse, Carter stood at the scene with tears in her eyes, her hands clasped, her eyes on the ground.
"Her actions killed Conrad Roy," the applicant told the judge.
"She ended his life to relieve herself.
She could not accept her own responsibility, "she stated.
"She showed no remorse."
However, Carter's attorney said these were "unfortunate circumstances which he extremely regrets."
Judge Lawrence Moniz added that "her age or level of maturity or even mental disorder did not have a significant impact on her doing."
The applicant read a statement from Roy's mother Lynn Roy: "It will not take a single day not to mourn the loss of my son.
I want him to be proud of me - I care for his sisters and together we will endure the immense pain we will carry with us forever, "it said in a statement.
Roy's sister, Camdyn Roy, testified that she was "haunted" by the knowledge that she would never attend her brother's wedding and would never be an aunt to his children.
"The loss of the person I have been seeing since my birth is a pain I will carry with me for life," she said.
The state of Massachusetts does not have a valid law affecting the person assisting the suicide of the other person.
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found in 2014 in the seat of a car, poisoned with carbon dioxide.
The case drew the attention of the entire nation after Carter's text messages were published that encouraged suicide.
"Maybe hang yourself, jump out of the building or stab yourself, I don't care," she wrote in text messages Carter sent just two weeks before his death, when Roy was on a family vacation.
A few minutes before the suicide, she wrote to him, "You've got to do it Conrad" and "You just kick the generator and you'll be free and happy."
Judge Moniz said Carter longed for attention through Roy's death and ordered her to refrain from any comments in the press.
The case raised many questions.
One of the people who sided with Carter was Amanda Knox, who was convicted of murdering her British roommate in Italy in 2007. Two years ago she was acquitted of the charges.
Ms. Knox (30) posted a statement in the Los Angeles Times: "Michelle Carter deserves understanding and help, not prison."
Audi adjusts up to 850,000 diesel vehicles in response to sharp response
Just a day before the announcement, Audi car maker BMW said it would offer its customers a software update in more than 350,000 vehicles.
The BMW chairman said the company believes "there are more intelligent options than driving restrictions" in response to European cities - including Munich, which is the seat of BMW - which are considering banning or restricting diesel vehicles.
Daimler on Tuesday announced it would adjust three million Mercedes cars across Europe to reduce diesel emissions.
None of the companies called this decision as a withdrawal.
European carmakers have promoted much of the use of diesel-powered atuomobos in Europe and the United States to meet regulations on carbon dioxide emissions.
However, nitrogen oxide released by diesel engines is considered a carcinogen and can cause asthma.
At the same time, there is an increase in the cost of cars to install equipment to neutralise the gases emitted by diesel engines, which makes cars more competitive.
While German carmakers face careful scrutiny, Chancellor Angela Merkel faces accusations of spoiling powerful car companies and ignoring their problems.
Companies are trying to avoid the mistakes of Volkswagen, which, in an effort to meet emission limits, installed software in its cars, which in testing reduced the amount of emissions issued, but under normal conditions the software was deactivated.
Several senior Volkswagen officials have been charged in the United States, and others are being investigated on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, a former head of thermodynamics of the engine development department at Audi would be arrested in Germany.
Former Zaccheo manager Giovanni Pamio is of Italian nationality and is therefore not subject to extradition, so he may face trial in the United States.
At the start of this year, Audi engaged in a criminal investigation into German police in the case of automaker Volkswagen after authorities accused Audi of installing a system that was supposed to circumvent European emissions limits - and expanded the charges that Audi faces in the US.
The inclusion of automaker Audi in the investigation may have an unfortunate impact on Volkswagen: Luxury car makers make up a disproportionate share of Volkswagen's profits.
The plane made an emergency landing on the beach.
A man and a girl perished.
The accident occurred on Praia de S√£o Jo√£o beach in the Costa da Caparica area, some 30 kilometres south of Lisbon.
One of the witnesses to the TV channel SIC Noticias said the plane before landing flew just above people sunbathing on the beach.
Some people from the beach reportedly ran from danger into the sea.
Unfortunately, two people failed to escape from the machine.
A 50-year-old man and an eight-year-old girl died on the beach, according to local media.
"The plane hit them and they were dead at the scene," described local police chief Pedro Coelho Dias.
Their nationality is not yet known.
There were two people on board the plane, both escaped from the accident alive and officers took them away for questioning.
D11 or how not to build a highway.
And are the highways in the Czech Republic even complete?
I'll give you a riddle.
It's unbuilt, though it started building as early as 1978.
Even if it's unbuilt, it's constantly being repaired.
And it can't be built any further, even if it has a building permit.
What is it?
Yes, the D11 motorway.
The construction of another section for at least a few months had newly stopped the Children of the Earth movement.
We East Czechs get the highway in pieces, like cutting salami.
Then we'll see when and if we get another one.
We don't want anything miraculous.
We just want to reduce the driving time and we want to get trucks going to or from Poland from villages and towns.
The endless streams of trucks go right through the cities of Jaroalmost or Near, which is not to be reasonably discovered.
But so far, the last section of our dream highway was operational in 2008, an incredible nine years ago.
Nothing since then.
That is why when the remaining four kilometres of the unfinished section to Hradec Kralove began to build, and on the other sections to Jarome began with an archaeological survey that the building would begin at the end of this year, you could hear a loud banging of plugs in the eastern Bohemia.
Nobody believed it anymore.
Last week, it became clear that building would not be this year.
And maybe not even next year.
The Children of the Earth-Club movement for sustainable transport from Brno has brought decay.
Earth's children repeat their tactics from D1.
They challenged the building permit decision in its entirety.
In decomposition, they request a review of all binding opinions already issued by all the authorities concerned.
For example, the castle magistrate, the Ministry of the Environment, but also the Ministry of Defence or the Railway Office.
So far, we are coming down from D11 near the village with the eloquent name of the Cup.
So we're going down, we're just going down the highway, and all of a sudden we're standing on a side road, and we prefer to be included in the column.
The worst thing is that you see stories like this all over the republic.
A terrifying, constantly clogged road to Bene≈°ov, highway D1 or D8.
Everybody's got their Cup.
What do the Children of Earth demand?
What is the nature of the problems of the construction of communications in the Czech Republic?
And why is the motorway network virtually imperfect in the current system?

Lavender from Provence threatens climate change
Lavender has become a symbol of Provence in the southeastern France region, but they are now threatened by climate change.
Lavender is dwindling due to dry climate and harmful insects, causing consternation on the faces of researchers and farmers looking for solutions.
Eric Chaisse, an expert at agricultural research institute CRIEPPAM in Provence, said: "Growing lavender in Provence is at risk because over the past few years this plant has been exposed to climate change, bringing with it less rainfall in the spring and autumn.
This affects the lifespan of lavender.
The cicadas and grasshoppers carrying the micro-bacteria that thrive in the dry climate are also to blame. "
There is much at stake.
Lavender attracts tourists, and the oil produced from them is an important component of perfumes and cosmetics.
Eric Chaisse said: 'Instead of long and beautiful flowers, smaller, undeveloped and often weak plants grow.
The amount of oil obtained from this lavender is understandably smaller. "
A possible solution may be more efficient water distribution and slowing the evaporation of water from the soil, but also spraying the lavender protective mixture of clay and water and breeding more species resistant to dry weather.
Journalist's murder highlights mounting threats in Mexico
The Riodoce weekly staff regularly meet every Wednesday to discuss the news about the unrest that is taking place in the Sinaloa region, involving organized criminals, corrupt officials, and persistent drug wars.
But today, under the brunt of recent events, it meets mainly for its own safety.
They learn that it's important that they change their habits.
Two deserving journalists talk about what would be safer: Take their children with them to an office that someone attacked with a grenade in 2009, or leave them at home.
Security experts wrote three simple words on the blackboard: Opponents, neutral and allies.
They ask journalists to put names to every word - no evidence is needed, just use imagination and foreboding.
Picking them out of what - drug traffickers, politicians, traders and journalists are suspected of taking money from the government or drug cartels - a catalogue of criminals whose job it is to cover criminal conduct.
Violence does not stop and bodies are piled up across the country; journalists are constantly growing among them: According to the Committee to Protect Journalists, there are at least 25 since President Enrique Pena Nieto came to power in December 2012; 589 journalists are under federal protection after attacks and threats; and in all seven states, seven have been killed this year.
Also among them is the co-founder of the periodicals Riodioce, an editor and inspiration for colleagues, Javier Valdez Cardenas.
"The biggest mistake is living in Mexico and working as a journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his many books on violence linked to drug trafficking.
His loss is noticeable, though his presence is all-pervasive - a large photograph of Valdez with the word "Justice" on which he shows his middle finger hangs in the front of the building; two journalists - Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez - age over 30, have a T-shirt with a photo of Valdez with a smile on his face, glasses on his nose and a Panama cap.
The meeting takes place less than two months after his death; journalists talk about mutual traumas, nightmares, insomnia and paranoia.
Yet a special federal prosecutor's office was set up in 2010 to address the cases of journalists, so far, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, it has sued two suspects.
Most of the thousands of murders that occur every year are associated with drug trafficking and organized crime.
The journalists of Riodoce insist that they will report on the violence that is happening in Sinaloe; even though they are destroyed by grief and that territory is very treacherous at the moment.
With no information about the killers and no vision of justice, the security meeting is irrelevant, says Ibarra.
"It's foolish to waste time on such meetings," he adds.
"If we don't get more information, no one can be trusted."
On the morning of May 15, Valdez left the headquarters of Riodoce in Culiac√°n, the capital of Sinaloa.
He managed to drive several blocks when his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men who pulled him out of the car and killed him with 12 missiles, apparently because of the title of the article - which can be translated as the Twelfth River.
The gunmen then boarded his vehicle and crashed it not far from the scene.
Valdez died at the age of 50.
He left behind a wife and two adult children.
In Culiacan, the rumors seem to be spreading fast.
In Valdez's case, however, there is a suspicious silence.
Since Guzm√°n's arrest last year and his January extradition to the United States, Sinaloa has become one of the country's bloodiest battlegrounds, as rival factions try to fill an empty seat.
Every day, several people are killed in the streets of Sinaloa, and the cemetery is filled with embroidered two-story mausoleums for drug kings, many of which are larger than houses.
Forget for a moment that the word "ceasefire" means that one drug cartel controls a coastal state with precious ports and important routes through which drugs travel to the United States.
Despite this, as well as the fact that Valdez was intimately familiar with the risks of his employment, Ismail Bojorquez (60), the co-founder and director of Riodoce, is still obfuscating from failing to protect his friend.
He believes two misconduct contributed to his death.
The first was the February edition of an interview with Damaso Lopez, the leader of one of the rival drug cartels that waged a war with the sons of Joaqu√≠n Guzm√°n.
The conciliation might have upset the sons; the suspected gang members had bought all the copies of the newspaper the moment they landed on the counters.
The second mistake was not to force Valdez to leave the country for his own safety after the seizure of other newspapers in which the same story was published.
Valdez has become a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his death is viewed as an important milestone in the struggle of Mexican criminals against journalists.
He managed to survive for so long and all his friends and colleagues believed it would never change.
In Noroeste's periodicals, he was practically a veteran when, in 2003, he decided to sell his shares worth $50 and set up along with five of Riodoce's colleagues.
In Sinaloe, "it was impossible to run journalism and not mention the drug trade," Bojorquez said.
In time, Riodoce gained a reputation for brave and true news; the newspaper began to thrive.
Journalists liked to embark on the search for troubled topics and published texts without censorship - the reader was fascinated to read stories that no one else dared to pass.
Eight years after its founding, Riodoce won the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot Award for reporting on Latin America.
The same year, Valdez won the International Freedom of the Press Award to the Committee to Protect Journalists for his brave reporting on the Mexican drug trade.
Valdez openly admitted he was scared.
"I feared for my life," he stated in accepting the award.
Drug trafficking in Sinaloae is "a way of life," Valdez said in an interview for Rompeviento TV in October last year.
'you've got to take on the role of a journalist - or play dumb.
I don't want anyone to ask me, 'What were you doing in the face of death... why didn't you say what was going on?'. "
Riodoce's employees miss Valdez - the man was known for his jokes and indiscriminate language - he was a good friend who liked to give advice and hugs - a teacher who knew how to survive.
They all relied on his daily routine.
He always wore his cap.
He often went to the El Guayabo bar opposite the offices and sat at the same table.
Now they ask: Has this routine caused his death?
His death in them also raised questions about his own assumptions - how to do his job as best as possible and stay alive?
"They don't like it when you get involved with their wives, children, clean shops, secret landing areas."
"These things were forbidden," Bojorquez said.
As a result, there is a high level of self-censorship and self-preservation.
You have to trust your instincts.
If you feel there's something wrong here, hands off.
The trouble is, said Riodoce editor Andres Villarreal, that "smell is a sense that can be fooled... and then there was that thing with Javier."
The old rules, as according to others, no longer apply in Sinaloae - as in the states of Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states that are home to a toxic mix of lucrative smuggling trails, weak governments and corrupt politicians.
The landscape is constantly changing.
No mobile phones are allowed in the room where Riodoce employees meet; a few days ago, spyware was discovered, bought by governments to monitor Mexican journalists and activists.
Outside the building, two police officers find relief from the forty-degree heat in the shadow of a nearby tree.
They were chosen by the state to protect Riodoce's offices, which are located in a four-story building in the bourgeois district of Culiacan.
Journalists are making fun of the fact that these police officers don't belong to the 50 percent of law enforcement officers who, according to the government, are corrupt.
It's been months since journalists last made their way to mountainous areas that essentially control drug cartels.
There are three main stories on this week's agenda.
The first is the murder of the brother of former boxer Julio C√©sar Ch√°vez in Sinaloe.
They also shine a light on suspicious government spending that took place in the hometown of the state's governor.
Recently, there have also been several hijackings at one of Culiac√°n's most luxurious restaurants, a mere block from the prosecutor's office.
Officially, no one announced the identity of the kidnapped people or the circumstances of the kidnapping, so journalists were wary as they prepared to write about what every resident of the city knew: That the restaurant was a popular destination for drug traffickers and politicians.
One of the journalists read from public records that the restaurant was registered under a name associated with a certain politician who is a member of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), controlling all levels of the political scene for almost the whole of the last century.
Several PRI governors have recently been accused of corruption in high-profile posts.
Villarreal asked journalists to write about earlier incidents that occurred at the restaurant, including an incident in which one of the sons of Joaqu√≠n "El Chapo" Guzm√°n escaped an Army task force.
Even a month ago, readers would have read about this topic in Valdez's column, which was the best source of information about kidnappings.
"Valdez would certainly have cracked the case," said Villarreal (46), who is nicknamed "El Flaco" for his slim build.
"Now all the informants have turned their backs on us."
Valdez's office turned into a warehouse of signs and stickers to protest the killing of journalists.
Journalist Miriam Ramirez grabbed several signs and set out the following morning to demonstrate in front of the attorney general's office for another journalist.
Salvador Adam disappeared just three days after Valdez's murder in the western part of the state of Michoac√°n.
Only the charred body was discovered.
The activity of journalists is escalating across the country - many of them organizing protests and scribbling on the sidewalks and buildings of the "SOS press."
Newspaper director Bojorquez is on a day visit to Washington, where he is trying to win international support and achieve justice for Valdez's death.
In a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa, held the day after Valdez's murder, Ramirez accused authorities of monitoring journalists and their murder for reporting the truth.
Meanwhile, she requested a transfer to another department out of concern that her anger could compromise her impartiality.
Valdez has repeatedly stated that Mexican journalists are "surrounded" by organized crime, corrupt officials and an indifferent public.
In his latest book, "Narco-Journalism," he wrote that journalists die not only at the hands of drug cartels, but also on the order of politicians and security forces that cooperate with organized crime.
Media supervisory group Articulo 19 blamed more than half of all attacks on journalists by police officers and public officials.
"In Mexico, you die because they want to silence you," Ramirez added.
Murders obviously work.
No one will forget the death of blogger Marie Elizabeth Mac√≠as, which occurred six years ago near the northern border of Tamaulipas.
Her body was found along with a note allegedly signed by the Zetas cartel: "This is how I ended up because of my messages."
A keyboard and headphones lay beside the severed head.
Some branches have decided to cease operations, such as the El Norte newspaper located near the northern borders of the state of Chihuahua in response to the March murder of rapporteur Miroslava Breach.
Others are still continuing, just as El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did after killing its director in 2004.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juarez addressed the public drug cartels with an article on the front page entitled "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists have fled their homes or even across the border.
It's a difficult decision.
Finding a job in exile is difficult, as well as getting rid of the feeling that you are constantly being pursued.
And journalists are persecuted and killed, such as in the case of Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered in 2015 along with four women in an apartment in Mexico City, three months after fleeing Veracruz.
For those who choose to stay and not give up their work, it poses a big risk every day.
Ibarra, who wanted to be a poet once, admits that writing about drugs scares him.
"Mexico is headed to hell, that's why I became a journalist," he stated.
It's Friday midnight, and Riodoce employees are sitting on the sidewalk outside the office - the latest edition sent to the printer - drinking beer when the phone suddenly starts ringing.
They learn that 19 people died in a shootout between gang members and police officers near a beach resort in the city of Mazatlan.
The war is escalating, just like the many messages left in this area by members of the syndicate.
Journalists publish this news from a mobile phone on the Riodoce website.
Not a day goes by and the opening headline changes again.
The sounds of police sirens point to another shootout.
Bojorquez casts a glimpse at the police patrol to see if they are paying attention.
If they're scared, they don't show it.
Under a huge portrait of the fallen co-founder of their periodicals - whose middle finger is an eloquent slogan for the whole of Sinaloe - all Riodoce employees follow in his footsteps.
"How could we possibly think of leaving," Bojorquez said, "when on the same day Javier was killed, one intern asked me to send her to the streets?"
Dinosaurs used camouflage to avoid enemies
At first glance, it looks like a statue, however terrifying.
Researchers have now revealed the findings of the first findings of an amazing creature the size of a rhino, whose perfectly preserved remains - which experts have dubbed the 'Mona Lisa of dinosaurs' - found the Canadian miner.
The remains were preserved at such a high rate that experts were able to pinpoint the red-brown colour of his scaly skin and stated that the dinosaur had a 'troubled past'.
An article in the journal Current Biology said it was' the most preserved yet-to-be-found armoured dinosaur and one of the best dinosaur species in the world '.
The fossil is a new species of the Nodosauridae family.
His perfectly preserved condition literally shocked the researchers, who described it with the words' truly remarkable '.
According to National Geographic, it is the best preserved fossil of its kind.
Behind the find is Shawn Funk, who uncovered the fossil on March 21, 2011 while drilling at the Suncor Millenium mine near Canadian Alberta.
He came across what appeared to be a foreign object and decided to examine it more closely.
The fossil was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.
The researchers spent the next six years working to uncover the animal from a huge piece of land weighing 1100 kg.
After completing the works, the dinosaur is ready to be discovered.
"All you have to do is squint your eyes a little and believe they're asleep," said labor leader Caleb Brown and the naturalist of the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the animal is exposed.
"It will certainly go down in the history of history as one of the most beautiful and preserved species of dinosaur - the Mona Lisa of dinosaurs."
By studying his skin, the researchers found that this herbivore - despite being covered in armor and resembling a walking tank - was very likely to face a serious threat from the flesh-eating dinosaurs.
The heavily armoured dinosaur used red and white camouflage to protect against predators, using a camouflage system used by many of today's animals.
Experts say this allowed him to better blend in with his surroundings and avoid enemies.... The camouflage system suggests he was the favourite food of the larger dinosaurs.
Reports of the 110 million-year-old dinosaur of the Nodosauridae family first appeared in a newspaper in May.
The researchers gave him the name Borealopelta maroscilchelli after museum technician Mark Mitchell, who along with the team spent more than 7,000 hours carefully uncovering the fossil.
Thanks to the wonderfully preserved state of the fossil, Dr Mitchell and an international team of scientists could document the patterns and shape of scales and armor throughout the body.
They revealed the method of camouflage commonly used by today's animals in defence - the upper part of the animal was darker than its lower part.
Although this masking effect is common in nature, the researchers' findings are surprising because Borealopeltam's size far exceeds today's animals using the same technique.
It is possible, then, that the dinosaur was such a multitude of predators that evolution gave survival priority to camouflage before confrontation.
Many contemporary animals with camouflage - such as deer, zebra, or armadillo - are much smaller and also more vulnerable as prey, suggesting that the carrier had to literally fight for its survival.
"The predation of a huge and heavily armored dinosaur illustrates the dangers posed by predators in the chalk period," Brown said.
A chemical analysis of the organic ingredients contained in the scales also revealed that the dinosaur skin probably had a reddish-brown colour.
Researchers are continuing to study the animal and are searching for more knowledge about his life, including preserved stomach contents to track down his last meal.
It is believed the dinosaur after death fell into the river and was taken to the sea where it sank to the bottom.
In the Alberta area at the time, there was the same climate as in today's Florida, and rivers and oceans stretched much farther inland than is the case today.
"It is truly remarkable in that it is completely covered in perfectly preserved scaly skin and is preserved in three dimensions and so you can see its original size," Brown said.
"For these reasons, the animal looks virtually the same as it did at the time of the chalk.
You don't have to use your imagination to reconstruct it; just squint your eyes a little and it seems like he's just sleeping. "
In the chalk period, giant Teropodi, carnivorous dinosaurs, moved on two legs.
Though the king of all dinosaurs - Tyrannosaurus rex - lived several million years after Borealopeltao, this armoured dinosaur may have been a favourite prey to its equally fearsome ancestors.
They include the Acrocanthosaurus, an 11.5-metre-long monster weighing over 6 tons.
The researchers, whose latest findings were published in the journal Current Biology, believe Borealopelt's body was washed into the sea after being mummified in the mud.
Behind the find is Shawn Funk, who uncovered the fossil on March 21, 2011 while drilling in the mine of Suncor Millenium near Canadian Alberta.
According to the museum, this is the best-preserved armored dinosaur in the world, including skin and armor, which is additionally complete from snout to hip.
The animal reached an average length of 5 metres and weighed up to 1300 kg.
Two 50cm spines protruded from his shoulders.
Researchers believe this herbivore obstructed the territory of today's Canada until it ended up in the river that washed it into the sea.
His underwater tomb kept the body in perfect condition.
Fossil remains of this kind are preserved to the extent that the armored plates around the skull still cover the remains of the skin.
As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, "finding such a preserved individual can be compared to winning the lottery.
The longer I watch him, the more shocking I find.
Fossil remains of this kind are preserved to the extent that the armored plates around the skull still cover the remains of the skin.
At his side lies his right front foot with his fingers pointing up.
I can easily count the scales on his foot. "
As one activist learned the answer to the question: 'Whose Streets?'
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell shuddered throughout.
The day after she arrived in New York, the St. Louis native sat on a bed in an Airbnb room, going through Facebook posts on her phone.
She ran into the contribution of a high school pupil.
"Police just shot an 18-year-old young man whose body is still lying in the street," it read.
She wondered that no one else had written her this post, so she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
User @ TheePharoah constantly retweeted her posts on the wall.
The rapper from St. Louis posted to Twitter his posts about the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old young man shot by a white-skinned police officer in the city of Ferguson, Missouri.
He posted a photograph of Brown's body lying limp on the street, where no one had taken him after four hours.
"That's crazy," Ferrell thought.
But death was nothing new to her and her community.
She put down her phone to get back to him in the evening as she watched tweets about people gathering on Canfield Drive.
One of the men claimed to be the victim's father and held a sign saying "Ferguson police killed my unarmed son"!
She watched the live news - one of the police officers stood in front of a group of protesters, holding a leash in his hand and a barking dog at his other end.
In another video, another policeman, as she put it, held a gun with which he was aiming at the crowd, yelling, "I'm going to kill you all... animals."
"That's not normal," Ferrell told herself.
'this isn't the type of murder we're used to and which we can call normal.
I felt goosebumps all over my body.
"I was angry and I cried."
She immediately booked the return flight and traveled home the next day.
After landing at 2pm, she picked up her six-year-old daughter from her father and decided to go to Ferguson in the morning.
The story of what happened to Ferrell and the city of Ferguson over the next three years describes the new documentary "Whose Streets?," which will be shown in cinemas on August 11.
It's a story of survival and protest, of love and resistance, of strength and unbreakability told from the point of view of people living in the community who take to the streets demanding answers.
On her way to Ferguson, Ferrell introduced a dialogue with her daughter - dressed in a flower jersey and the same floral headband - about a topic they had previously discussed many times - "about the experience of black people."
"Remember when I taught you about how black people had to fight for what they believed in?" He recalls in an interview.
'we're going to Ferguson right now because the police killed an 18-year-old youngster and that's not right.'
"I didn't think I'd take her with me," Ferrell said later.
"Today's events are the culmination... that has occurred in the past.
She had to know and see with her own eyes and grow into it.
She needed to develop not only in activism and organizing, but she also had to tell the difference between different layers of experience with black people and what we need to do to free ourselves.
Despite being able to provide her with conditions in which she does not experience racism on her own, she does not differ in any way from another black child-woman.
I feel that if I were to protect her from this experience, I would only harm her. "
After arriving in Ferguson, the first stop was South Florissant Road opposite the police department, which became a base of activists expecting the words of police officer Darren Wilson about his possible involvement in the incident.
This is where Ferrell and her daughter met a local entrepreneur who was preparing food for others.
Together they prepared food in sachets and helped deliver it to the Protestants.
In Ferrell's eyes, a new type of activism began to grow slowly.
"My activism turned upside down after 9 August," Ferrell said, adding that while studying at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, she was president of the Minority Student Nurses Assn. and sought to introduce health care and food in black communities.
'I haven't had any experience with the organisation.
It was natural. "
Weeks later, during an evening demonstration, Ferrell met the later co-director of the documentary, Sabaah Folayan.
Folayan said he and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar wanted to "only document" the ongoing events.
However, Ferrell wondered: "Are you working on a documentary or trying to find a story to take advantage of?"
That type of skepticism seeped into the community through many people, often white people, who wanted to make a profit on pain and decisiveness.
As Folayan explained in an undisclosed interview: "We have heard that the voices of people who are born and raised in Ferguson are very often neglected, and we wanted to change that."
Folayan has already established a collaboration with co-director Damon Davis, who is a respected local artist who deals with the subject of prisoners on death row.
His participation in the project also interacted with Ferrell and along with the other six local residents watched by the team "Whose Streets?" In the years following the assassination of Brown.
"No one speaks for us in this document, but it's our statement," Davis said.
'that was important to me - how these people are going to be represented - because in the same way I'm going to be represented by me.'
While the aim of the documentary was not to focus on Ferrell's experiences - in an effort to show that the movement "is not about a saviour leader, but about the rapprochement of the community," Folayan stated - it turns out that she is the most open to participating in filmmaking.
The documentary "Whose Streets?" Thus describes a very personal aspect of Ferrell's life, such as how she fell in love with her wife.
"I felt like naked," Ferrell said with a smile on her face at the thought of the first moment she saw the final version of the documentary.
"I understand, however, that in order to do this job and policing black people, I have to open up."
In addition, Ferrell's story highlights the role of an eccentric black woman in a broader aspect of the Black Lives Matter movement.
Two of the movement's three founders - who created in response to the killing of teenager Trayvon Martin in a 2012 social media campaign under # BlackLivesMatter - call themselves weirdos.
"Black eccentric women in leadership positions ultimately stand behind preserving the movement," Ferrell said, "because we are constantly fighting on multiple fronts.
Black eccentric women must bear the weight of these events. "
Folayan agrees with that statement, adding that "the movement is actually supported by black women and a great lot of eccentric black women."
He insists, however, that "this is not a mere affirmative matter" and Ferrell is not the main heroine of the documentary because of his views.
"She was the driving force and source of energy," she said.
"That she was in the front lines is not a coincidence, because life on these intersections in the skin of a black queer woman is dangerous.
You can feel that rush of energy in front of the screen. "
Meanwhile, back in Ferguson, TV station cameras have cleared their positions, but heavy racial ties between the community and police persist.
Ferrell is serving two-and-a-half years probation for blocking the highway at demonstrations.
The socially political atmosphere in the area she calls home described as "Unorder."
Yet she does not stop in her quest, which she has committed to since she took to the streets of Ferguson three years ago.
"It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It is our duty to win.
We have to love and support each other.
All we can lose are our chains. "
A field was burning in Cologne.
Dozens of firefighters rushed to the scene, helped by the helicopter.
Not far from the Czech Brod on Cologne, between the municipalities of Bylany and Liblica, a field of about 15 hectares has been burning since 14: 00.
The fire stopped spreading at about 15: 15, firefighters declared a third-degree fire alarm from four possible.
According to fire department spokeswoman Ladislava Holom√®ek, a helicopter was also helping the fire from the air.
At 6pm, firefighters managed to extinguish the blaze, the fire causing damage worth 700,000 kronor.
Dozens of professional and volunteer firefighters were fighting the flames at the scene.
The fire started because of a technical malfunction in the harvester's engine compartment.
There was also a helicopter that carried out six shoals of water.
"Instead of intervention, we have handed over to the owner, until 8: 00 tomorrow, he will be guarded by a unit of volunteer firefighters," Holomcek said today.
A Becoming Resemblance: Artist creates portraits using Chelsea Manning's DNA
In the center of one of the rooms of New York's Fridman Gallery, there are several faces of different skin tones - white, black and dark - hanging from the ceiling on the wire.
All 30 portraits were created by artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg of swabs from the oral cavity and hair sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent her samples from Fort Leavenworth Prison, where the former analyst is serving a 35-year sentence for unauthorized disclosure of secret cables to WikiLeaks.
The new exhibition, which launched on August 2, bears the title A Becoming Resemblance.
It is the result of a two-year correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, who combines his experiences with technology, informatics and art, and Manning - a transgender and pioneering dissident whose punishment was reduced by Obama three days before his departure from the post of US president.
By algorithmic analysis of Manning's DNA and by using 30 portraits to depict what a person would look like with this genotype, Dewey-Hagborg created a razor-thin, if not intellectual, comment about DNA yielding - as well as the many ways in which DNA can be interpreted - and the inherent determinism of these interpretations, as well as identities.
Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward Manning, has spoken since her youth about being considered a woman.... She was convicted in 2013 on the basis of 20 indictments, including violating six espionage laws, computer fraud and theft.
All her photographs were held by prison staff; only one black-and-white photograph in lower quality escaped to the public, to which Manning, visibly concerned, sits in the driver's seat in the platinum blonde wig with which she is now associated.
In 2015, there were still positive responses to Dewey-Hagborg's 2012 Stranger Visions project.
As part of this project, Dewey-Hagborg used various forensic objects - such as cigarette butts and chewing gum - to create an image of the possible forms of these people.
And it was at this time that she received an email from Paper Magazine.
"They were going to interview Chelsea Manning in prison and they wanted to supplement the article with a portrait," Dewey-Hagborg explained on the occasion of the opening of the new exhibition.
However, visits or photography were not allowed, so they turned to Chelsea asking if she would be interested in a DNA portrait.
The artist and her imprisoned muse made friends over the course of two years through correspondence.
They even created a comic book called Suppressed Images, illustrated by Shoili Kanung, who presented a vision of what would happen if Chelsea were pardoned and could attend the exhibition in person.
Indeed, a few days after the comic's release, President Obama asked for Manning's release, which was a welcome change after several excruciating years in a military prison in Kansas.
Indeed, it is interesting that the exhibition takes place just as Donald Trump is waging a war of words with people seeking to publish government information and transgender soldiers while trying to find new ways for his tweets to incite resentment in areas he should support.
In response to a query about this particular timing, Dewey-Hagborg stated that "everything happens for a reason."
Under a statement from an artist on one of the gallery's walls, Manning calls her huge signature (the letter "i" in the surname is dotted with the heart) after the end of "self-inflicted fractionation based on gender, race, sexuality and culture."
On the opposite side are sequences of her mitochondrial DNA - a centipede of letters C, G and A recorded in pencil.
By listing 200 letters (or nucleotides, according to the artist's sophisticated scientific vocabulary), Dewey-Hagborg wanted to illustrate how surprisingly similar, at least on the biological side, we all are.
"I hope people take away from it that our genome doesn't matter who we are, and that genetic data is subjective and everyone can interpret them in their own way," Dewey-Hagborg said.
'DNA tells a lot of different stories, this is 30 of them.'
The last copy of the exhibition, located in a separate room, is the only page from the above graphic novel.
It depicts Manning emerging in the manner of King Kong from the United States Disiplinary Barracks with a megaphone in his hand.
"Once they prevent you from making a speech, they win," she writes.
"Never be silenced."
"It's a direct transcript from one of the letters," the Philadelphia-based artist stated.
"When I think about it, it gives me the creeps."
Manning has not yet visited the exhibition in person - which was predicted in the comic book - but when she does, she will be greeted in the center of the room by her masks, her own genome effigies, lined up like a crowd of Protestants.
Which was also the purpose of the exhibition, including a nearly 160-inch-tall statue of Maning, on which her genetic haplogroups are recorded in pencil.
"They've been placed on the walls in the past, but this time I wanted them to suck the feeling of the crowd," Dewey-Hagborg said of the portraits.
"I wanted to give the impression of a mass movement that takes the form of Chelsea and liberates it."
Northwestern University professor and Oxford University employee wanted for murder
These days, a nationwide search is underway for a Northwestern University professor and Oxford University staff who are being prosecuted on suspicion of murdering a man who was found stabbed to death in a luxury Chicago apartment, police said.
On Monday, a first-degree murder warrant was issued for a man named Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) for their alleged complicity in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, says a Cook County court filing.
The document says Cornell-Duranleau (26) died from the consequences of multiple stab wounds.
Chicago police said the body of the deceased was found on July 27.
Officers were alerted to this fact by telephone., upon arrival at the Grand Plaza Apartments, they found the victim in one of the apartments with multiple lacerations.
Cornell-Duranleau was pronounced dead at the scene, and detectives are investigating the case as a homicide; police are meanwhile searching for both suspects, authorities said.
Lathem has been working on the position of docent of microbiology and immunology of Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, the university's vice president of public relations, said in an emailed statement that Lathem is now on administrative leave and has been banned from entering the university's school premises.
"The whole matter is now being investigated by the relevant authorities and Northwestern University is fully cooperating with them," Cubbage stated.
Warren is an executive financial administrator at Oxford University.
A spokesman for the University and Somerville College said in a statement sent by email: "We have been contacted by British police and we are ready to assist the American police as well."
The statement also says Warren's colleagues were shocked by the whole fact and wish he had come forward to police.
Anthony Guglielmi, head of public relations for the Chicago Police Department said he was calling on the suspects to surrender to the relevant authorities.
"Police have information about their whereabouts and efforts to track down the suspects are escalating," Guglielmi said.
Guglielmi added that local, regional and nationwide authorities are assisting police in the search for suspects.
According to Guglielmi, the police received a call from the Grand Plaza building manager, who was alerted to the events that should have taken place in apartment No 1008.
Police described the whole scene as very violent.
Guglielmi said it was unclear if the incident occurred on July 27.
He added that Lathem and Warren were caught by security cameras.
"We believe Professor Latham knew his victim," Guglielmi stated.
The Grand Plaza management issued a statement to all residents: "Police are now working to compile a timesheet and profile of the victim and are investigating various motives, including domestic violence."
"We will complete the WADA plan in the near future" - Vice-President of the Russian government Mutko
Vice President of the Russian government Vitaly Mutko said it would not take long to implement the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) and the re-provision of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA).
'at present, part of the criteria of the new plan has already been completed and RUSADA has already acquired the right to planning and testing in partnership with the British Anti-Doping Agency (UKAD).
In light of this, the WADA plan has been updated, "Mutko said on Thursday.
The Vice President commented on the second part of WADA's plan to comply with the Code - which describes the criteria for the renewal of RUSADA - which was recently published on the organisation's website.
According to Mutko, the code contains nothing to worry Russia.
"Everything has been announced and everything will be implemented as well.
The results will be available to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA in the near term, "he added.
One of those criteria, however, calls for a public announcement of the results of the WADA investigation, investigated by Richard McLaren, about the alleged sponsorship of doping by Russian athletes by the government.
On the subject, Mutko said: "We are conducting an investigation as our anti-doping system has clearly failed.
All measures have been taken.
But there were no state programs in our country, and we cannot confess to something that never existed. "
Mutko's words were confirmed by Vitaly Smirnov, director of the Russian Independent Public Anti-Doping Commission.
In an interview for Russia's RSport, Smirnov admitted the problems of Russian anti-doping officials, but added: "On many occasions we have stated that the report contains controversial positions and regulations.
No one plans to accept the report entirely without reservation, "Smirnov concluded.
WADA suspected RUSADA of handing out doping controls within Russia in November 2015 immediately before the doping scandal.
However, the organisation has authorised planning and unification testing under the supervision of international experts and the British Anti-Doping Agency (UKAD) this June.
After visiting the Moscow headquarters of the organization in July, WADA chief executive Olivier Niggli said RUSADA was "on the right track" to resume.
Police have charged three people, one is a juvenile.
Police have accused three men of setting up Wednesday's fire of a rare wooden church in Tclanci-Gutech on Frhydecko-Misteck.
One accused is a juvenile, all three are of Czech nationality.
They face up to 15 years in prison for the offence of general endangerment.
The news media was told today by the Moravian-Silesian police director, Tomas Kalas.
He said it was an intentional offence.
"It's a very fresh issue and the police are currently working on the motive of the whole matter," said Unfortunately.
He stated that police would act on the possible withdrawal of the accused into custody.
Further information, according to the director, cannot be disclosed.
"That's all I can say, because the officers of the criminal police service and the investigation, and the prosecutor who's in charge of the case, are working on the matter," he said.
The wooden church of God's body in Gutech came from the 16th century.
It was a valuable landmark with many of the original equipment and paintings from the first half of the 16th century.
The material damage will go to tens of millions of crowns, according to preliminary estimates, but the historical loss is incalculable.
Soon after the fire, the restoration of the church began to be considered.
Most of the costs should be covered by insurance, other costs are prepared to be shared by the Ministry of Culture and the City, a public collection is also being prepared and the contribution of the owner of the monument, i.e. the local parish, is being prepared.
A similar 16th-century wooden church of St Catherine's in Ostrava-Hloot also destroyed a fire fifteen years ago.
It was caused by an electrical malfunction.
An exact copy was then created in its place.
The state counts citizens in defending the state.
They will support their training.
With financial support for associations usable in defending the state, with voluntary shooting training or with a team of training trainers, he counts the substantive intent of the law on the readiness of citizens to defend the state.
The Ministry of Defence, which has been tasked by the government, promises to increase the physical fitness of the Czechs and their capabilities, which the State could then use in crisis situations.
It stems from a proposal prepared by the ministry.
If the law were adopted in the future, the state would spend hundreds of millions of crowns to support the goal.
According to its authors, the basic objective of the proposal is to create an effective system to help increase the readiness of the people of the Czech Republic to defend the state, beyond the exercise of the duty and on a voluntary basis.
For example, the State would support, financially or material, the associations of radio amateurs, shooters or cynologists, and would make it possible to increase the capabilities of their members.
In return, it would obtain data on people who are willing, if necessary, to come to the country at a time of crisis to help, and about their capabilities or material equipment.
Accredited instructors could also be available to assist associations and other candidates in training or education.
It also counts on organizing bespoke with war veterans or people who have preserved themselves heroically.
One possible option assumes that there would be a new authority in charge of the administration and coordination of the project.
The authors of the proposal stress that people's participation should be voluntary and the state would use their powers only after a state of emergency is declared.
"The whole concept must respect the gradual shielding of previously obvious boundaries between different types of threats," the intent states, referring to the dangers of so-called hybrid threats.
Ministerial officials noted that there is therefore a need to focus on promoting the widest possible set of capabilities, not just the military ones.
"The fundamental objective of the project is to create a very broad base that allows each citizen to respond in a qualified manner to situations threatening the sovereignty of the state or the lives, health and property of persons, to protect themselves, or to contribute to the protection of others, and by improper conduct not to exploit the tasks of the armed forces of the Czech Republic," the intention states.
The adoption of the law would make small financial claims.
According to the Ministry, their level will depend on the option chosen.
For example, the Authority foresees financial support for projects to prepare citizens for the defence of the State up to CZK 100 million.
If an administrative and coordination centre were established, its operation could cost around CZK 60 million per year.
More money would go to salaries or to build an information system.
The proposal also assumes that the scope of the regional military headquarters would have to be expanded, which together would employ 42 more troops.
Ministry officials have previously said the law should also help resolve the dissent of some Czech politicians with the introduction of a European Union directive on gun possession.
Its adoption would allow the shooters, who will be part of the system, to retain some of the weapons involved in the directive.
Startups that will help your company not become the next Uber
Amy Errett wanted to measure the satisfaction rates of the employees of her e-commerce startups, but did not find a matching survey.
The answers were often inaccurate, unhelpful, or even misleading.
And yet, promising the anonymity of the survey, some employees expressed their disbelief at the whole process.
"I was looking for consistency and objectivity," said Errett, owner of e-commerce company hair care firm Madison Reed, based in San Francisco, which employs 75 people.
So she asked for outside help.
New human resources startups are constantly on the market to help companies with employee satisfaction surveys.
By creating and licensed software with the specific intention of measuring employees "obligations, startups allow companies to make quick votes, target specific teams and demographic groups, further offer total employee anonymity and a hotline for complaints, and in some cases also allow whistleblowers to bypass superiors and contact the director directly.
"There are tools in the market like Strava and Fitbit that track your health, but where is Fitbit for your company?" Said Jim Barnett, co-founder and CEO of startups Glint, based in Reedwood City.
Errett said that thanks to Glint, she has gained more awareness in three years about what her staff thinks and what she feels.
In addition to quick surveys and voting specific teams, Glint offers a temperature map of the company and a cursory overview of the groups with the highest number of complaints, as well as an overview of low-rating managers - allowing the user to work on the fix.
Companies are beginning to realize the need to heed the culture of the work environment - in case they become the next Uber - which is floundering in scandals after a former employee posted a post on his blog describing the corporate environment and harassment of employees who dare to speak openly.
For startups like Glint, demand for corporate culture surveys represents a lucrative business opportunity.
According to the website Let's Talk Payments, which deals with technical and financial progress, the value of the global sector of control, regulation and complication may exceed $118.8 billion by 2020.
Startup Convercent of Denver in the state of Colorado, which helps companies prevent and detect inappropriate behavior, saw a small increase in interest and activity at the start of the year, just before the Uber scandals.
Among Converse's nearly 600 clients are Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Recently, he has also taken Uber under his wing.
Like Glint, Convercent allows companies to send customizable "flash" surveys, collect confidential information in real time, and display temperature maps of problem areas.
It also offers an anonymous text hotline that allows employees to report inappropriate behavior.
If a CEO is involved in the problem, complaints are sent directly to the board.
"The court of public opinion has empowered regulators," said Patrick Quinlan, founder and CEO of startups Convercent.
If a company is convicted of improper treatment of its employees or unethical behavior - and does not rein in regulators - it could face costly consequences as a result of customer boycotts, employee exhaustion or lawsuits, Quinlan added.
Ruby Tuesday's restaurant network, which employs over 25,000 people across 500 locations, has been using Convercent for more than a year to raise awareness among employees about corporate principles and procedures and ensure an easy way to contact corporate leadership.
Earlier, if an employee wanted to report any problem, he had to trace a phone number or email to the company's management, officially file a complaint and hope for a successful resolution.
It was often a deterrent and unpleasant experience, said James Vitrano, general counsel for Ruby Tuesday, according to which there was previously no reliable way of monitoring employee complaints.
Now that the company is using Convercent, the rapid detection and resolution of problems that have previously never reached managers sitting in offices, miles away from the actual handling of complaints - such as discrimination, harassment or unfair treatment.
"It's coming up with a holistic, overall look at the experience of employees," said Vitrano, who manages Ruby Tuesday's group overseeing risk management.
"At the same time, we are protecting shareholders from litigation by employees."
The companies stopped taking ethics, values and employee participation lightly in 2002 after accountancy firm Arthur Andersen collapsed following the collapse of Enron over the misuse of employees' ethical rights, Quinlan said.
But it was only when "social media shone a light on the whole thing" that companies began to realise that in the online world they could not simply hide their skeletons in the closet.
"Before people started using it to monitor the ethics of technology, they relied on faith," Quinlan added.
Both Glint and Convercent offer their software in the form of a service for which companies pay regular fees.
It's a business model and an opportunity approved by bold equity investors who have backed both startups.
Convercent collected a total of $10 million in its February campaign from firms like Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, and eventually carried the capital of $47 million.
Glint acquired $10 million from Bessemer Venture Partners in November and raised $60 million throughout the campaign.
These investments are hardly surprising given the mutual nature of companies, culture and venture capital.
A growing body of research clearly confirms that today's staff expect more from their workplace than ever before.
And in competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are not the main advantage.
Employees want to perceive that they are accepted and appreciated and that they devote their time to a society that seeks a positive mission.
"If people are happy in their work, they perceive that their voice is being heard, and that their work is rewarding, they seek company success," said Nina McQueen, vice president of global benefits and employee benefits company LinkedIn, which uses both Convercent and Glint.
Investors earn if companies thrive and companies thrive if their employees are satisfied.
And when an analytical tool appears on the market to ensure employee engagement and commitment to the company, it's no wonder there are plenty of investors who will support the effort.
According to work culture experts, it is important to have data on employee satisfaction.
But the data itself is pointless unless the company takes the necessary action.
The reality is that once a company asks for feedback from its employees, there can be big changes.
And if change doesn't happen quickly - in the worst case at all - it can trigger disappointment and disinterest from employees.
"Once you ask for 4,000 views, you have to be prepared for 4,000 conversations," said Russell Raath, director of consultancy at Kotter International, which has seen many companies rely too heavily on the data itself.
"Because once you don't get things done, employees start asking themselves," Did they hear me at all?
Are they interested in me?
And if not, then why should I care? ""
Madison Reed, which now regularly carries out a survey among employees each month, can, thanks to Glint, solve the problem within a day, Errett said.
After gathering feedback from employees who were frustrated by the slow decision-making and quality of communication, Errett was able to reorganize several teams within the company and start communication training to successfully solve the problem.
Ruby Tuesday takes a very important view of its employees and hopes that in the long term it will achieve high employment in a field that is known for frequent redundancies.
"If you don't strive to create a transparent work environment, employees won't trust you," Vitrano added.
'and once you start losing staff, you lose customers.
And with a cast of customers, the whole company goes bust. "
Thursday became the hottest day.
Thursday is the hottest day of the year in the Czech Republic.
It surpassed Tuesday, which was originally the hottest day of the year with 37.3 degrees.
The staff of the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute have been informed.
But it didn't hit many temperature records compared to Tuesday on Thursday.
The heat mainly hit Moravia, it was mostly cloudy in Bohemia.
They were outlawed on Tuesday, or settled records at 35 of the 145 weather stations measuring over 30 years.
On Thursday, it recorded a record of just nine long-term measuring stations.
Perhaps in the Guardian, today's temperature was the same as the previous record from 2013.
Today's 37.4 degrees had surpassed the original maximum by four tenths of a degree, and it had exceeded the record by three tenths in Pohobellics on Brno's current 37.1 degrees.
Both records, as with the Guardian, came from 2013.
High temperatures occurred mainly in the south and east of Moravia today.
After the Guardian, the biggest heat was in Dyj√°kovice on Znogensk and Broda nad Dyji on Bclavsk, where the mercury dropped to 37.8 degrees, but the record did not pass.
By contrast, for example, in Western and Northwest Bohemia, today's highest temperatures were only around 22 degrees Celsius.
"Temperatures started to grow there until later in the afternoon," the meteorologists said.
The current heat in the Czech Republic will gradually go away, and more rain could come on Sunday.
In most places of Moravia, however, high temperatures will still remain on Friday and in the south-east of Moravia as well as Saturday.
There's been such a mess.
Billionaires are not enough of the same voice in the election as every single full-time person in the country.
They want to make decisions directly, and because not everyone is as cheeky as Andrei Babi≈°, who wants to own the state, they buy political parties.
Penty owner Marek Dospiva, along with other colleagues behind the water Martin Burda and Antonin Fryco, is sponsoring Robejshka's Realists.
The second life of the Civil Democratic Alliance is funded by the owner of the insurance company and the real estate entrepreneur Pavel Serushed, who is also chairman of his party.
The convicted corruption and the king of Czech gambling, Ivo Valenta, got himself a private party.
The political movement of Agrofert, as Andrej Babi≈°'s project has been named by the chronicle mayor Jaroslav German, is a chapter for itself.
The Mayor also caught his billionaire.
He is Dalibor Children, owner of the Jablotron security company.
In his own words, he enters politics to do good.
But the entr√©e in the mayor's jersey didn't go well for the old man.
"I never dreamed small goals," he said at a news conference.
This means that my goal is for the ANO movement to get the Mayor's movement twenty per cent in the election.
Some of them smiled.
But the child's rendition is rather characteristic.
Billionaire Dalibor Children is a man of firm views.
Although he intends to bid for the votes of voters in the Mayor's jersey, he continues to support Andrei Babi≈°.
The old man has supported Babi≈° in past parliamentary elections.
"Babi≈° is not a seasoned speaker and does not rule the kissing rhetoric of political snakes," he wrote about him before the 2013 election.
But he certainly doesn't go into politics because he wants to better himself.
For me, Babi≈° will remain a hero.
He's willing to step out of his world he's in control and do something for all of us.
Shortly after the Mayor introduced him as a new backup, he professed his admiration for Babi≈° again.
And he said he wanted the Mayor to learn a possible collaboration with Babi≈°.
Some may appreciate that the Children don't change their opinions and stand up for themselves no matter what jersey they wear.
Others may speculate whether Babi≈° sends to the mayors to build his beige of someone this clumsy.
Others may ask whether the boss of Jablotron may have broken up with the boss of Agrofert on offense at the store and is not looking for another way to defend his business rival.
But Children's first public appearances didn't just revolve around Babi≈°.
The old man promised to send the mayors ten million crowns for the campaign.
And if they need more money, he'll send more.
A few years ago, a similar anniversary would have been hard to stop.
After all, the court-recognised crook Zdenek Bakala squandered millions on all sides before the 2010 election.
The political division of the security agency V√≠ta B√°rty, TOP 09, and the Citizen Democrats have come together for nearly thirty million.
But today is a different time.
The law prohibits any political party from giving more than three million.
When Children enters politics, he could at least study the rules of the game.
Maybe he wouldn't have to ask why politics has such a bad reputation.
In his first days in politics, the Children crowned a proposal for a tax advantage for families with studied children.
People with a college degree come in at about fifty thousand a month.
Those with a base of less than twenty.
A man with fifty thousand is rich in this situation.
The one with 20 poor.
In the company's vision, the poor pay their taxes honestly, and the rich enjoy the benefits of the functioning of the welfare state, which they do not participate in.
In short, the rich need to be helped to avoid poverty.
The mayors can congratulate each other on their new acquisition, and Babi≈° will rub their hands.
The rest of us can confirm that billionaires are not good people.
There remains the question of who to vote for.
For me, those who know the rules of the game and want to follow them.
Those who are members and members of their party, as well as citizens and citizens of the state, do not have their own property for their staff and country.
And finally, those who want a rich country to live well for all people, not just some.
No one wanted Trump's paradise.
The villa complex had to be reduced by 234 million.
Selling a property sometimes isn't easy.
And it is often not helped by 11 bedrooms, a wonderful view of the sea, or the fact that the property is being sold by US President Donald Trump.
With the sale of the villa complex Le Chateau des Palmiers, the price went down by an incredible ¬£8 million.
He informed the website Mirror.co.uk.
In the brochure, the property says: "Sincerely, Donald J. Trump."
Escape to a place like no other.
But even the real estate company's connection with the US president did not advocate an extreme price tag.
Donald Trump has had to cut the price of his Caribbean mansion by an incredible ¬£8 million.
The original property price was ¬£21.5million, the final price dropped to ¬£13 million.
Even after the discount, the villa complex costs about 76 average apartments in the centre of Prague.
And it's no wonder.
The stunning 5-acre mansion on the Caribbean island of Saint Martin has 12 full bathrooms, 11 bedrooms, many dining rooms, a gym and other rooms.
It consists of several buildings.
The property also includes a swimming pool and a tennis court.
Dozens of palm trees are planted on the property.
There is a beautiful sea view from the terrace.
According to real estate experts, the price showed the fact that connecting with the president is not enough to attract potential buyers.
Now the property is closer to normal house prices on the island.
Trump bought the property in 2013.
According to speculation, he paid around ¬£15 million.
The property was to be bought for rental purposes.
Le Chateau des Palmiers was the most expensive property on the island of Saint Martin.
With the new price, though, it ranks second.
The property in the neighbourhood was valued at ¬£13.5 million.
The NCAA decided to end two practice sessions a day.
The eleventh morning is coming, and the players of UCLA's American Football League are squeezing at the sidelines of the new school field.
Some of them take off their jerseys and reveal a sweaty back, an unmistakable sign on the first day of training camp.
For most members of the team, these few minutes of doing nothing substitute the lunch break.
Players enrolled in the summer semester will leave for rooms after a three-hour training session to study for final exams before returning to Wasserman Football Center for a meeting that takes place on the upcoming morning at 6: 30 a.m.
"For these guys, the next three days are going to be a hell of a mess," Bruins coach Jim Mora said moments before Monday's reshuffle on Tuesday.
By taking out two practice sessions in one day, the NCAA wants to lighten the players - paradoxically, the training days are even longer - at least until Friday, when the finals end.
That's why UCLA's first three practice sessions are scheduled for 19: 15 - to squeeze into the already cluttered diaries of many students.
For the first time in six seasons, having spent Mora in the position of coach at Westwood, the Bruins "training camp begins a week earlier than last year, and training sessions are limited during the summer semester.
In total, eighteen training sessions are scheduled until August 20, whereupon they begin formal preparations for the first game against the Texas A & M team, which takes place in September.
Mora let himself be heard to support the NCAA's decision, despite adding another item to the already-charged diaries of the players.
"For three or four days the players are under a lot of stress and it's very exhausting for them," Mora said.
'but nobody's given up, everyone's trying - they're great.
I think on Saturday, when we have more time, everything will calm down.'
UCLA will be closed after the end of training camp, which won't be easy when looking at clear lines of surrounding land from the adjacent parking lot and the luxury Luskin Center hotel, which was seized by players after harvesting the protective net behind the goal pole.
Bruins players should occupy the hotel starting this week, but Mora acknowledges that when the rooms are emptied during the season, there could be a problem.
"The property will be guarded by the security service," Mora added.
"Safety is taken care of, but it's not out of the question that anyone can rent a room and record our training sessions.
Such material is well traded.
Fortunately, the hotel will be guarded by security as well as parking lot 8.
We will use our resources to the maximum.
I believe everything will be all right.
It's all planned. "
Facebook plans more thorough fact-checking to limit number of fake news
Facebook will send more potentially fake articles to control third parties and display findings under original posts in an effort to combat so-called "fake news," the largest social network said on Thursday.
The company says in a statement on its website that it will start using updated machine learning to detect possible hoaxers, which it will send to third parties to verify and potentially display survey results below original contributions.
Facebook has been dubbed one of the main sources of fake news, and many believe these unconfirmed reports influenced last year's choice of president of the United States.
In Europe, political debates are taking place in Europe. French voters are flooded with an avalanche of fake news about May's presidential election, and Germany plans to impose a fine on the social media network in advance of the September elections if it does not urgently remove angry contributions.
Facebook said on Thursday in its next statement issued in Germany that it was preparing to launch testing of a new feature of controlling fake news in the US, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
"In addition to displaying messages verified by third parties, people are asking for more content to be better informed and able to make the right decision about what they can share," Sara Su, Facebook's product manager, said on her blog.
She added that Facebook is continuing to test the "related articles" feature and is also working on other changes to reduce the number of fake news.
Making a graphic novel: The Story of A Castle in England
The small castle of Scotney Castle recently played a leading role in the Squeeze group's music video, and its refuge in it was also found by Margaret Thatcher during the 1970s and 1980s.
But Scotney has witnessed 700 years of turbulent history from his cosy spot at the River Bewl in British Kent, which inspired the curly-haired Jamie Rhodes of Yorkshire County - a known fondness for historical documents - to create a graphic novel.
"Looking at the writing of a person who is 300 years after death fascinates me," Rhodes says with a straight face.
"When I hold a letter in my hands, I feel a personal connection."
The graphic novel A Castle in England documents the life of the families who survived at Castle Scotney from the Middle Ages to the Eduardo period.
However, it is not the first Rhodes book inspired by the archives: He is also the author of Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories (2014), a collection inspired by documents from the British Library - a project that was very emotional for him.
"I was intrigued by a thumbprint on a letter written by a double agent in the 1970s who worked for the Jakobites," he said.
"That's his thumbprint!
And letters always smell like smoke, because in those times you had to light a candle to read.
If I smell the letter now, 300 years later, it's like I'm going back in time.
How I love the archives! "
For someone who is so fascinated by the old papers, the support from the National Trust and Arts Council England and the chance to dwell on almost four months in the castle is almost like a dream. ("To tell you the truth, I have extended my stay a little longer.")
Rhodes spent time exploring the Victorian "new" castle, passing through archives and studying many treasures and curiosities, such as the head of hyenas on the wall and bottles that had been dumped for centuries in a ditch.
Walking around the property and exploring the ruins of the old castle, he spoke to gamekeepers, gardeners and occasionally also with artists who worked on illustrations for his book.
At night, he "drank whiskey and wrote."
The confidential history of Scotney is a relatively large unknown as the National Trust organisation gained access to the documents only in 2006 after the death of the last heir, Elizabeth Hussey.
When Rhodes arrived at the site a decade later, staff were only beginning to penetrate the archives, which Rhodes described in words as when "the aristocrats of many centuries spread their hands with the words:" Leave it in the attic. ""
Diaries, letters from the days of the British Empire, maps depicting the majesty: "You might think the land dispute is boring," Rhodes said, "but I came across one case where two families were dragging on a birch.
Stop it, people! "
Some of the stories in the book use the castle as a stepping stone and delve deeper into English history, including a story titled The Labourer, which follows a man who leaves a newly built castle to join the English Uprising of 1381.
"I found a record of a riot at the castle from 1380, which in the book was dubbed the Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex," Rhodes said.
'the English uprising actually started in this area and I thought rebellion was a good starting point.
Maybe they're connected in the end. "
Other stories are firmly linked to the castle's history - such as The Priest, which tells the story of a Jesuit priest sheltered by the Darrell family for seven years during the English Reformation.
Or The Smuggler about an 18th-century smuggler named Arthur Darrell, who allegedly staged his own funeral when he filled the coffin with stones (which was discovered only a few years after the coffin was uncovered).
Rhodes' favourite family are Darrell's: "I was intrigued by the male generation - the then-men were always in debt and spending money on things they couldn't afford.
Different generations of the Darrell family dealt with it by marrying rich or old ladies - I imagine they were handsome gentlemen who liked to hang their heads with heiresses. "
With the end of his stay at the castle, Rhodes is searching for more adventures.
He recently returned from a two-week gig in the Finnish wilderness, where he was soaking up the inspiration for his next book about El√§m√§nm√§ki, a former nursing home from the early 20th century that was engulfed by nature.
For Scotney, however, it is a special place.
"I was sad when I left," he stated.
"I was like," Now to get the hell back in real life. ""
Washington changes green card award terms
The media has released President Donald Trump's words on a new US immigration plan, under which there will also be a change in the granting of a green card.
The number of legal immigrants is projected to fall by 50,000 year on year as a result of stricter rules on the granting of temporary work visas and restrictions on family visas.
The new rules are proposed by Republicans and the president.
The bill will be submitted to Congress soon.
"This bill will reduce poverty, raise wages and save billions of dollars for taxpayers.
The law will limit the number of immigrants and replace the current scheme.
The new application process will give priority to English-speaking applicants who are opting for funds and demonstrate capabilities that will benefit our country, "Trump said, quoted by the media.
Sex robots are on the rise - we should be wary
Just when it looked like 2017 couldn't be more bizarre, a report on the technological evolution of sex robots appears online.
Yes.
Sex robots are really popular at the moment.
The Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) recently released a statement on the development of sex robots within the next five to 10 years.
In the words of a former professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at Sheffield University and FRR co-founder Noel Sharkey, it is necessary to view the rise of sex robots seriously.
Customers can choose the eye color, the nipple shape and the appearance of the robot's nails.
"People are making fun of them, but sales are growing and we need to be prepared to see them more and more often," Sharkey said on the occasion of the report's publication.
Modern sex aids change from inflatable pan to robotic women with silicone skin, which is pleasantly warm to the touch - the obvious is artificial intelligence that mimics a person's behaviour.
The user can "edit" the robot to its image - from eye colour and nipple shape to the appearance and colour of the nails.
Very worrying, though, is the fact that many robots have their own "personality" that would shame even the Stepford missus.
Modern inflatable virgins have evolved into robotic women with silicone skin.
The owner of the RealBotix robot can set his spare wife different character traits, among them shyness.
And then there's the sex robot woman Roxxxy Gold company True Companion, which is delivered with pre-programmed personalities, including "frigid Farrah," which features a shy nature and "wild Wendy" with an "adventurous" nature.
"The personality of Roxxxy Gold is set to suit your personality to the maximum extent possible," the company's True Companion website says.
So she likes what you like and vice versa.
She's even moody, just like people.
She can be tired, talkative or be "in the mood."
The rise of sex robots is alarming for a number of reasons - which do not include confusion for real interpersonal relationships.
On its website, True Companion likens Roxxxy to a vibrator for men.
"If a woman can have a vibrator, why couldn't a man have Roxxxy?" The page reads.
However, sex robots are not a mere fetish or sexual aid.
Their emergence and near-perfect sophistication point to something darker and deeply rooted in our culture - a move away from ideal or sexual equality towards a desire for compelling sex with an optional premium.
Understandably, most men don't buy a robotic woman, and while the FRR talks about their growing popularity, sex robots still remain on the fringes of interest from the general public.
However, this fringe interest may become a mirror set by the current modern era.
And most people aren't weird or violent until the free market gives them an excuse.
It is no coincidence that these sophisticated sex robots are emerging at a time when women around the world are conquering their rights, and there is a president sitting in the White House who is often very derogatory about the address of a woman.
The most fearsome aspect of The Handmaid's Story is not what we see - hanging bodies and hollowed-out eyes, as rather the reality of these visions.
The book draft The Handmaid's Story represents a step in the right direction, but at the moment it seems a small step.
Sex robots should be as close as possible to real women (albeit with the balls of a porn actress).
Their creators construct them to be pleasant to the touch and act at first glance like a real woman.
However, when it comes to their "personality," a robot cannot replace a real woman.
They can't break up with their partner or just walk away.
They have no work or history - nothing to encourage their independence or undermine their allegiance to their master.
In other words, they are pleasant slaves.
The talk of the 21st century: Handmaids.
NBA star on green chives.
Curry is fighting in California for a cut.
Star basketball player Stephen Curry has not lost despite a botched first-round batting at a premiership start among professional golfers.
The two-time award holder for the NBA's most useful player played in the Ellie Mae Classic lower series Web.com Tour in California's Hayward first round on 74 shots and will fight for the cut.
The Golden State quarterback, who won his second NBA title with the Warriors this season, started a lot nervously, and his first tee shot ended in a beverage holder in a golf cart parked near the fairway.
Even then, he wasn't as accurate between the holes as he was under the basketball cosh, yet he left a dozen professionals behind him with a balance of four runs over par.
"It wasn't an ideal way to start, to have to call the referee right after the first hit, but then it took a bit of a saddle," Curry said, adding that a huge workout had fallen on him.
It was very nervous to blow the first shot at the tournament, but it was everything I had hoped for.
"If you told me I would play 74 in the first round, I would take it immediately," he added.
If Curry manages to fight through the cut, which is likely to be set two shots below par, he will become the first representative of another sport to do so on the Web.com Tour.
"I want to play better next time, and now that I've got rid of the training, I can do that," said the enthusiastic golfer, who has previously played in celebrity tournaments as well as mixed competitions for amateurs and professionals.
In Hayward, he is starting for the first time in a tournament that falls under the PGA.
He received a sponsorship exemption to participate in the Ellie Mae Classic and retained amateur status.
The Web.com Tour series is one category below the elite PGA Tour.
Trump's big win?
Against this, Mitt Romney is the epitome of common sense
The unmistakable hallmarks of the Trump era are the political divisions that divide American voters and, in the micro-scale, also tear apart entire families.
In the period of Christmas and Thanksgiving, it was peppered with advice in American newspapers about how to deal with relatives who elect Trump.
Supposedly, we're just waiting for our nerves to break.
Less attention, however, is devoted to Trump's family's ability to stint.
I'm talking about this because I was visited this week in New York by my cousin - a poet and a fan of the left who lives in Chicago and who has been paying for Republican noise in our family for a long time.
She reminded me that togetherness in the face of a common enemy can have a powerful effect.
Now, with Trump in the White House, there is suddenly a whole family - including all the Republican siblings with whom she has bickered about politics for years - on one wave.
At dinner at the family table, this is a good thing; but it strikes me that, in a broader context, this poses a significant risk.
Trump strengthens the left, but the negative effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right.
If we're talking about "normalization" and Trump, we refer to the terrifying possibility that his jesters may one day lose out on attractiveness.
But there is an even more gruesome long-term scenario in which Trump "normalizes" right-wing Republicans who, contrary to his standards, will suddenly be the embodiment of what can be called rational.
In these today with nostalgia in my heart, I remember Mitt Romney and his version of the crazy act - a dog on the roof of a car, a 14% income tax (at least we had an awareness of his tax return) - both of which look like very mild misdeeds compared to Trump.
After the departure of Trump, it will suffice for the subsequent Republican candidate to be at least normal, which will be an immense improvement.
We took advantage of my cousin's visits and took the kids to Central Park on the biggest carousel run by the New York Parks Department - you won't find a better use for your three dollars unless you need caffeine.
The horses are stunning, the centre cylinder is covered with glass laminate - clowns and animals are filmed, staring in horror at their own shoulders - an entirely somber sight, and the tinkling music oddly resembles public transport.
Many clich√©s soon get tired: The view from the high-rise buildings, the panorama looks on instead of breathing on you through the atmosphere, and the reality of the city doesn't get your ideas.
Thirty-five years later, I still haven't got over the fact that Swiss Cottage isn't actually Swiss cheese - not counting the theme pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage - but a subway station in London.
The carousel in Central Park, however, evokes a remarkably magical experience, to the extent that two two-year-olds are having a great time, as well as two mature women.
If I could evaluate the carousel, he would earn maximum points.
This week I experienced a similar experience in store when, while paying by credit card, I was asked to evaluate my "experience" on a scale of one to five.
In a cafe on the corner of my street, it's the same, with the difference that I can add a 15 per cent tip to the rating for something I buy behind the counter.
Not only does it slow down an otherwise quick sale, but the waitress is thus forced to joke in the favour of shoppers when it's not needed.
A woman in the store apologised to me with a smile as I reluctantly rated my transfer of a credit card to five stars.
Oscar Pistorius was transported from prison to hospital due to chest pain
This is the second time Pistorius has had to be transported to a hospital.
Last year, he was treated for cuts to his wrist, which the prison said he inflicted on himself after falling in his cell.
Pistorius was convicted of murder after an appeal against the original manslaughter conviction.
He killed his girlfriend Steenkamp in the early hours of Valentine's Day 2013 with multiple gunshot wounds through the door of a toilet closet in his home in Pretoria.
Pistorius claimed he mistook her for a thief.
Prosecutors announced their intention to re-appeal, this time against Pistorius' six-year sentence, which they say is too lenient.
The National Prosecution Authority said it will appeal to the South African Supreme Court and the court action will take place later this year.
In the event of success, Pistorius faces an extension of his sentence of up to 15 years.
They don't pay the death penalty in South Africa.
For the first time in history, a cub in captivity has given birth to a bred panda that has mated in the wild.
For the pand rescue program, this is a huge success.
In fact, the center is trying to expand the gene pool of pand bred in captivity.
Centre worker Zhang Zu-chung told the New China news agency that the breeding of the pand was at great risk from the kinship crossing.
In captivity, only 471 pand lived at the end of last year.
Only two thousand survive in the wild.
Trying to let captive pandas mate with the wild ones is such a first step for breeding pand to help protect this species.
The 15-year-old Cao-cchao was released into the nature reserve at the start of the panda mating season on March 11.
Thanks to the tracking device on her neck, scientists could observe her every move.
Her chosen one met Cao-cchao 12 days later.
Sexual intercourse with a virgin male lasted a minute and a half and landed successfully.
This, too, can be considered a minor miracle because panda males are not considered the most successful lovers of the animal empire.
Males fairly misestimate the time the female is ready, plus they are often confused and have no idea what to do.
The cub was born healthy and, even given that Chao-chao had an extraordinary appetite during pregnancy, weighed 216 grams after giving birth.
The average weight of a newborn panda is 70 grams lower.
Two Bulgarians detained for illegal camping in Greece
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced the detention of two Bulgarian tourists on the territory of Greece for illegal camping, the statement quoted BTV as saying.
A group of tourists, including two Bulgarians, were detained on August 1 in the early hours of the morning by Sithonian police.
All were released the same day, however, the investigation continues.
The Foreign Office said for BTV that the Bulgarian tourists were later released.
Greek authorities have tightened free camping rules and impose strict fines on anyone caught in a place where camping is not allowed.
The checks will run throughout the season.
The ministry said the court could impose a fine.
Spilk is in 50th place after the first round of the British Open.
Golfer Clara Spilk figures after the first round of the majors British Open in a divided 50th place.
The pitch at Scotland's Kingsbarns went round with the score one stroke under par as she played three birdies and twice bogey.
The 22-year-old Czech player thus has the hope of passing a cut at the famous majors for the first time.
Entering the competition with a $3.25 million subsidy came out best to American star Michelle Wiese, who won the first round in a record-breaking 64 rounds, that is, eight under par.
Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands are withdrawing millions of toxic eggs from the market.
The Netherlands itself has temporarily closed 180 poultry plants because of the incident.
The Dutch food safety agency NVWA, according to Reuters, reported that it is investigating 20 percent of all Dutch poultry plants, which he says means that 80 percent of the eggs on the market are safe.
The Authority stressed that the risk represents only a limited number of types of eggs recognisable by specific numbers.
According to the German authorities, the amount of toxic substance in eggs is small and does not pose a danger to adults, but the potential threat is for children.
A spokesman for the Czech JRC, Petr Majer, said that eggs and chicken from the Netherlands and Belgium, where the authorities also joined to close the farms, had not been imported into the Czech Republic recently.
However, veterinarians take random samples of eggs and chicken meat originating in Belgium, the Netherlands, France, Italy, Germany and Poland, on whose markets the problem brands of the insecticide have appeared.
Eggs from Belgium were, according to the veterinary administration, on the Czech market for the last time in April and eggs from the Netherlands for the last time in May.
Chicken meat from Belgium last appeared in the Czech Republic in June.
In the Czech Republic, however, there is a certain amount of chicken meat from the Netherlands.
Fipronil is a substance that tends to be part of flea products, everything and ticks.
However, it must not be administered to animals whose meat is consumed by humans.
The WHO's World Health Organization considers the preparation to be slightly toxic.
His high doses lead to feeling sick and dizzy.
Riga is gorgeous, I will miss him, says goal-scorer Seven, looking for engagement.
I still want to catch ten years.
"Maybe I'll go back there one day," smiled the 27-year-old Seventies, who could start the season in a Zl√≠n jersey.
It depends on whether he gets an engagement at the start of the new year.
What were the four years you lived in Latvia?
If I had to rate it like I did at school, three.
I didn't catch much the first year, I had an experienced goalkeeper in front of me.
I was learning.
The second year I started catching.
Before the third season I thought they would give me more space.
But they brought in a new goalkeeper, whom I alternated with again.
Last year, I assumed I'd catch all the time.
But we only scored five points during the opening 10 games, so the coaches started filming it.
My colleague was more caught up in the end.
But that's how it's done.
They wanted to pen it for next season.
What was life like in Riga?
Beautiful.
It's a little Prague.
A beautiful, European, historic city.
I will miss him.
I found a girlfriend there.
We're together for the third year, we're getting married next year.
So I brought something.
How challenging is the KHL for a goalie?
The top ten teams are really quality.
Then there are teams like us or Slovan who have to change their playing style against them.
The skill is on the other side, so you have to replace it with something.
That means playing more backwards, more fighting.
I didn't see a problem in the width of the pitch.
The difference is that the Russians want to play into the empty.
They shoot less, and even if they have a half-empty goal in front of them, they prefer to record.
There's more shooting in the Czech Republic.
Didn't you have a problem traveling and moving through seven time zones?
If a person doesn't have a family, it's not a problem.
He can sleep in peace.
The program is mostly done by playing like four games outside and then you have two days off.
How do Latvians perceive their club in the KHL?
As a national team.
All of Latvia is watching hockey, along with basketball it's a national sport.
Everybody's cheering.
Even though it wasn't going well, a lot of people were walking.
Did Dinama's performance in the KHL help Latvia almost advance to the quarter-finals at this year's World Cup?
The KHL has been played since 2008 and Dinamo is there from the start.
And from the same time, their results at the World Cup began to go up.
At the 2014 Olympics in Sochi, they fell in the quarter-finals with Canada just 1: 2.
That was an unreal result for them.
Thanks to the KHL, they got to a higher level.
More and more Latvian players are heading to the Czech extraliga.
Roberts Bukarts was seeded in Zl√≠n, and before signing the contract is Ralfs Freibergs.
How come so many come here?
They are no beige players, they are really quality.
The teams here are looking for cheaper and younger players from abroad, Latvians among them.
It's a natural direction.
The KHL starts in three weeks.
Why are you still uncommitted?
I knew at the beginning of February that I would not continue in Riga.
So we started looking for something.
Sparta was on the table.
But because they didn't have a budget for a goalkeeper, we didn't agree.
Then it was a classic.
We had fun with different teams but they opted for someone else in the final.
So I train at home in Zl√≠n and wait for something to come up.
Doesn't that make you nervous?
That's what I was four years ago when I left here and didn't know what was going to be.
The current situation is not the best, on the other hand I am at home after a while.
I caught something in the KHL, so I take it differently.
The only question is when and where I sign.
How real is the option to start a new year in Zl√≠n?
Anything can happen.
We'll see what happens in a month.
Now all I can do is wait for the agent to set up.
Do you prefer a contest?
The past season was not one to choose from.
So I'm waiting for the phone.
The government fling at Flight continues.
In January of this year, I wrote in an article with the care of a proper housekeeper?
The nature of the problem remains the same, and so I allow myself to remind myself of the central passage of the article.
They've been talking about the camp in Letech for many years.
For readers who do not know exactly what is going on, it is probably best to look at, for example, the official site of the cultural monument Piete instead of Lety.
There, in the introduction of the historical overview, they learn that the camp was two kilometres east of the village of Lety, that from 8. 8. 1940 it served as a work camp, from 1. 1. 1942 it was a collection camp and from 2. 8. 1942 it became a gypsy camp.
The next text describes the course of life in the camp, including inhumane conditions, until March 1943, when the first lethal prisoners were placed in a refresher transport.
On 4. 5. 1943, the largest transport to the extermination camp was transported by 370 persons.
There were 420 in total.
A very sad history of the immense woes of human beings, caused to them by human beings and perverted ideologies.
There is no dispute that it is necessary to be constantly reminded of these events.
Nor is there any dispute that the commemoration should take place at the memorial at the site of the suffering of these people.
The problem is elsewhere.
For socialism, the camp was somewhat forgotten, and in the 1970s it was built in the vicinity and part of the former camp.
The history of the camp was randomly discovered in 1992 by American Paul Polansky, in 1995 a memorial was unveiled in Lets.
In the mid-1990s, the government promised to buy-and-bust the veg, but it has not yet done so.
In 1998, the monument was declared a cultural monument and since 2009 its administration has been under the Lidice Memorial.
In July 2013, the UN Human Rights Committee called on the Czech Republic to close the row.
So many very brief facts about the postwar fate of the camp.
It was not until last autumn that the Government approved the purchase of the veto and decided to draw up an expert report to determine the price.
According to the Minister of Agriculture, the government will then buy it.
According to Culture Minister Herman, "some numbers do exist, but I would probably frustrate those intentions if I went public with them."
Let's see what the expert opinion brings.
According to some unofficial estimates, it may be hundreds of millions, according to others, the price can reach up to a billion.
Either way, it will in no way be a cheap business.
Yet only a few hundred yards from the former camp stands a monument to which the state invested almost ten million crowns in 2010.
Even if the entire transaction was funded by the UN Human Rights Committee, which is not likely to happen, I think it would be a waste of money anyway.
Doesn't the government have other priorities?
The monument, a dignified piecemeal place, stands by the will of history practically in the immediate vicinity of the tragedy, and whoever wants it may bow to the memory of the sufferers and the murdered.
I see no reason to change this!
Let's leave it as it is, and maintain the piecemeal place with the utmost care.
The responsible person, in this case the government of the Czech Republic, should be treated with the care of a proper housekeeper.
At least with your own company!
Of course, the finance minister and deputy prime minister is not the whole government.
But even so, from the point of view of the above, I see the motto of the leader of the ANO movement only as an empty election proclamation.
In May this year, I went to look directly at the site.
A very decent driveway, customized parking, replicas of wooden camp barns.
In one exposure, in the second integrated WC with running water.
A small natural amphitheatre with seating options and a view of its own piecemeal location, which is created from rocks placed in a gentle slope.
Lots of flowers and wreaths.
All attributes corresponding to the meaning of this place as it suits and belongs.
Archaeological research is currently underway at the site of the original camp.
It would be reasonable to consider whether, for example, a part of the uncovered foundations could be preserved and at least visually accessible in an appropriate manner.
In this direction, Culture Minister Daniel Herman could have strained his efforts.
It will be another unfortunate step in his already troubled tenure as Minister of Culture.
Red meat, dairy and chocolate can ease symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)
For your digestive system, red meat and dairy products can be a nightmare.
But a new study suggests the opposite: A diet rich in animal protein and dairy could help relieve the symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease.
The untreatable disease, which affects up to 1.3 million US residents and 300,000 patients in the UK, causes abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
Patients are usually reminded not to use meat and dairy products to alleviate symptoms. Washington University researchers found that the essential amino acid tryptophan contained in the protein helps to create immune cells that support bowel resistance.
Study leader Dr Marco Colonna explained that immune cells protect the gut and ensure the degradation of harmful microbes from food.
The number of inflammatory cells is balanced by the number of cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissue.
Once the bowls of the scales tilt to the side of inflammation, an inflammatory bowel disease can occur.
As part of the research, researchers found the presence of immune cells promoting body tolerance in the stomach of mice with specific bacteria.
This bacteria requires the presence of tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to create cells.
Professor Colonna said: 'We found a link between one type of bacteria - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a common part of the gut microbiome and the development of cells that promote body tolerance.
The more tryptophan the mice had in their diet, the more they had these immune cells. "
At the same time, he suggested that if it turns out the same applies to humans, then a combination of L. reuteri and a diet rich in tryptophan would help develop a more tolerant and less inflammatory gut environment.
Graduate researcher Dr Luisa Cervantes-Barraganwasa, as part of studying a certain type of immune cells supporting body tolerance, discovered that one group of test mice had these cells, while a second group of the same mice kept separate cells missing.
She deduced that one group of mice had a different gut microbiome - a community of bacteria, viruses and moulds that routinely dwell in the gastrointestinal tract.
The mouse's gut was tested by the DNA-sorting method, and researchers found six species of bacteria in mice with immune cells missed by a second group of mice.
The mice, which were bred in a sterile environment and lacked the gut microbiome - thus did not develop this kind of immune cells - were given the bacterium L. reuteri - and formed immune cells.
To understand how the bacteria affects the immune system, the researchers grew L. reuteri in fluid and then transferred a small amount of fluid - without the bacteria - to undeveloped immune cells that were kept in isolation.
Immune cells evolved into tolerant cells.
After removing the active ingredient from the liquid, it turned out to be a by-product of tryptophan metabolism known as indolyl-3-acetic acid.
When the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the mouse diet, the amount of these cells increased by 50 percent.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that humans have the same tolerant cells as mice, and most of us store L. reuteri bacteria in their gastrointestinal tract.
It is not known if the byproducts of tryptophan from L. reuteri cause cell development in humans in the same way as in mice, but defects in tryptophan-related genes were found in people with inflammatory bowel disease.
Dr Cervantes-Barragan added: 'Each of us should probably aim to develop these cells because they control the inflammation of the inner surface of the bowel.
A potentially high level of tryptophan in the presence of L. reuteri may increase the cell population. "
Jos√© Mourinho considers signing contract with Nemanj Matiƒá and his transfer to Manchester United as' brilliant'
Manchester United have acquired a 'genius' in their team in the form of Nemanja Matiƒá - at least that is what Jos√© Mourinho thinks after the midfielder made his debut in Wednesday's match against Sampdoria.
Matiƒá, who signed a ¬£40m deal, featured in the first match by winning 2: 1 in Dublin - the last pre-season match before the UEFA Super Cup, where United meet on Tuesday with Real Madrid - and impressed in his role as a back-up alongside Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira.
However, as he did not take part in the team's pre-season Asian tour, Matiƒá did not take form and played just 45 minutes, which, in the words of Mourinha, is needed before the start of the next Premier League season.
"He needs time but he is experienced, intelligent and has a brilliant mindset - he thinks football," Mourinho said.
"We'll help him get into shape as soon as possible."
Like Matiƒá, even his new teammates Victor Lindel√∂f and Romelu Lukaku have also played their first match at the Aviva Stadium and Mourinho is starting to slowly form his 11th for another season.
An independent source announced this week that Mourinho still wants to sign a contract with the other three players, but insists the club has done a "fantastic job" and brought three of the four most important players to the team.
"I thank the club for helping me get three out of four players," he added.
'four out of four would please me more, but I recognise they've done their utmost for me.'
The life challenge of the king of chicken skins.
He wants a lesson from Pohlreich!
The multi-promising picture has begun to take shape thanks to a new show on the TV Prima of Vienna's academy.
The pear immediately sniffed the chance.
"Dear Zdek, I'd like to sign up for your cooking academy because, hand on heart, I think I can learn a lot from you," he challenged in a video on the social network.
And since the two had been spiking for several years, he had not forgotten to irritate him this time.
"In return, I can teach you from dietary chicken meat, American cucumber, or invite you to water and show you why fried cheese is popular," Hrushka said.
He's really serious about his involvement in Pohlreich's new show.
It's time to move up a level and learn from the master.
"The question is, what does the boss have to say about it," he told Lightning.
But Pohlreich didn't comment because he was filming new episodes of his next show Yes, Boss!.
Only Prima responded to Hruka's participation in the culinary academy, taking the whole matter as his personal activity, which goes beyond television.
Hrushka Pohlreich was his first cook in December 2004.
Within a few days, she had sold over 300,000 pieces!
The new show, presented yesterday by Prima at a press conference for the autumn broadcasting scheme, is an unadulterated cooking school.
Pohlreich chooses his pupils from the audience, and at 12 he meets 12 cooking techniques.
In the latest installment of his show Now the Boss is cooking in November 2014, Zdenek had a striped pear on the back of his T-shirt.
If he had my face in there, I would have laughed a lot.
"I only laugh over the pear - the pear is a healthy fruit and has a lot of vitamins," Love responded.
He thinks of Love's culinary art.
"It's out of the question at home, because I'm not going home," the boss says.
I have a lot of respect for Mr. Pohlreich, and I even think I'm making chicken for honey.
But his recipes certainly don't appear on my show, "Hrushka said.
He's an asshole!
He's no cook for me, he's a TV clown.
"Gastronomical analfabet or asshole," Pohlreich said of Hhruk in one lecture.
"I'm not twenty to wave my hand at them, but I don't care about them anymore," said Hrushka.
British inventor uses microchip in his hand to unlock car and house by wave
A British inventor has become the first person in the country with a microchip injected into his body - with a simple wave of his hand he can unlock the door from the house and office and even start the car.
Thirty-three-year-old Steven Northam has kept the tiny chip implanted between his thumb and index finger and is currently offering the same service through his company BioTeq to firms and individuals who want to make life easier through technology.
Dr Geoff Watson, an anesthesiologist at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester, is supervising the procedure for implantation and compliance with treatment procedures.
The technology works on the same principle as microchips implanted in dogs and cats, and the whole procedure takes 30 seconds.
Northam's company also offers a service to exchange door locks and cars compatible with a microchip. The price of one lock is ¬£300.
The married father of one child has let the technology integrate into his home and his BMW Z4 car, which he starts with a simple wave of his hand.
White House prop cost taxpayers thousands of dollars
The White House's decision to fly a Navy helicopter on the South Lawn to the occasion of a celebration of the U.S. manufacturing industry that took place last month came, according to Navy records released by the weekly TIME, at $24,000.
The green-white Sikorsky VH-3D helicopter, also called Marine One in the presence of the president on board, was the highlight of the July 17 program at the White House, which was a parade of American design programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and several senior White House officials have touted a parade of products from all 50 states.
A Connecticut helicopter was exposed next to a yacht from Maine, a Wisconsin fire truck and a forked lift cart from Mississippi.
A White House military officer issued a fragmentation order, or Frago, and applied for a helicopter presence less than 36 hours before landing a helicopter on the South Lawn as part of an "extraordinary" event, said Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1) - the units responsible for helicopter management.
"I wanted to make sure you had awareness of such a momentous event," the HMX-1 commander wrote in an email to his supervisor, the Navy's deputy commander for aviation the day before the event began.
The report suggested the helicopter would arrive on the South Lawn on July 17 at about 7pm on the occasion of the parade, the start of which is scheduled for 15: 00 and will remain in place until the entire site is fully cleared, which was planned between 18: 00 and 21: 00.
In an email, it further said that if there was a delay in taking off from the White House, a replacement crew would be sent for the return flight because of working-time regulations.
The original crew remained at the scene that evening along with the helicopter and, along with them, a unit of security personnel.
From the records - obtained by the weekly TIME - it was not apparent if a second crew was eventually sent.
The Hatch Act prevents state officials from using government property for political purposes.
Records suggest HMX-1 is investigating possible violations of this regulation.
"We wondered if this was a violation of the Hatch Act and we were assured that all was well," the commander wrote.
"It sounds like you've been blocked," the deputy leader wrote.
This "Made in America" parade was designated by the White House as an official event, and the Hatch Act would therefore not apply to it.
But even official events have political subtexts.
In his attendance at the event, the president championed health reform going through the Senate and talked about trying to keep government regulations in check.
The use of aerial vehicles such as Marine One or Air Force One for political purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.
Presidents use them when they travel.
However, their presence purely for presentation reasons is unusual.
Trump ordered scrutiny in February after a presidential plane taxied in the background at his first-ever rally during a campaign rally in Melbourne, Florida.... His Twitter account is overwhelmed with complaints about the use of the presidential plane by his predecessor.
"The White House is pleased with the parade of" Made in America, "which introduced products from all 50 states made by Americans from American materials," said deputy press secretary Lindsay Walters.
HMX-1 helicopter crews often train landings in the Washington area and the South Lawn, and rehearse possible arrivals with the President of the United States to the White House with maximum accuracy.
While Trump attended the G-20 summit in Germany in early July, HMX-1 conducted 58 practice landings at the White House.
The flight to the Made in America parade was part of the current crew training, a state official said.
The helicopter unit on the same day urged an additional eleven hours under "non-presidential support missions."
The White House said no other props were paid out of taxpayers' money.
A spokesperson for Sikorsky said the company was not in any way involved in negotiations over the exposure of the helicopter to the South Lawn.
HMX-1 does not keep budget records for presidential flights, and the exact cost in connection with the parade is difficult to determine, according to the Navy's statement.
According to the Department of Defense, the hourly price for fiscal 2017, reimbursement of DoD expenses for VH-3D is $24380 per flight hour.
The unit's records list a time of 30 minutes from Marine Corps Air Facility Quantico in Virginia and back.
The White House argues that the actual operating costs of the helicopter move well below that amount.
"Putting the cost to taxpayers based on estimates for reimbursement of expenses is very misleading," Walters said of the whole thing.
"These estimates include staff, maintenance and many other hidden costs that are included in the annual cost."
According to a 2015 RAND study, DoD spending refunds do not include the cost of personnel, but include the price of fuel, maintenance and contract costs.
Then-White House press secretary Sean Spicer defended the use of the helicopter for parade purposes.
"The idea of the parade taking place this week is to introduce products manufactured in the U.S.," Spicer said.
'I'm aware that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud of the fact that they contribute to the defense of our state, and that they provide work to hundreds, if not thousands, of people.
I think, like most Americans, that we are proud of the helicopter and the other military facilities that countless American citizens are involved in.
This fact must be remembered. "
It is not clear if Trump, during his rounds on the South Lawn, was also to look at the helicopter.... It is certain to say only that he sat behind the wheel of one of the fire trucks.
Back in the White House, Trump addressed a representative for Sikorsky and joked with the media about his own fleet of products.
"I know Sikorsky very well," the President said, "I own three."
A young woman stuck in a swamp near M√°cha's lake, police wading towards her.
The girl headed for the beach on Sunday at about 2 a.m.
Instead of bathing, she remained trapped in the wetlands.
When she decided to ask a mobile phone for help from a police officer, she had the last 12 percent of the battery.
"For that reason, police officers soon lost contact with her," said police spokeswoman Ivana Balak.
Several police patrols went to the place she had described, but finding the young woman was not easy.
"Some of the police had to wade through the marshes hundreds of yards before they could feel the ground beneath their feet," Balak said.
And so was the missing.
The officers focused on the direction of her call for help.
"For them not to lose at least this connection, they agreed with her that she would be counting out loud," the spokeswoman said.
The cops didn't find the woman until a quarter to five in the swamps at Borna.
She was on the verge of physical and mental strength and showed signs of hypothermia.
That's why the summoned ambulance took her to the Czech hospital.
What's with the STAN?
The desired bride becomes a sales girl.
That's kind of ironic.
It was as if the billionaire was essentially telling voters that STAN was suffering from a deficit of decent people.
And he also affirmed that a politically disparaging bunch of rather lesser-known mayors and independents didn't actually have a statewide agenda for the House elections.
Her election candidate simply becomes a decent person after an interview with her grandfather, whatever political opinion she has.
He used to start out like that, and it didn't work out very well.
With his quick attention to the decent people and personalities who might even replace some of the mayors on the candidates, as Gazthanks admitted, he also repeals the STAN boss's popular argument that the greatest value of the movement is politically scrutinized and experienced mayors, traditionally the most popular politicians, according to the polls.
These are now easily replaced by hastily gathered unknown personalities.
A total breakup with the people, after which STAN changed both the logo and the slogan, Gazthanks explained that the movement did not want to lose its identity on the candidates of the people.
But if few were suspected of identity then, after the arrival of the Children, the mere game of identity ends.
Not only has Gazthanks long been defined against the YES Andrei Babi≈°, but at the first joint press conference, the Children, who publicly praise Babi≈°, stated as follows: "My goal is that the ANO movement, the Mayor movement, will gain twenty per cent in the upcoming elections."
Let's hope he didn't mistake the movement.
The old man is a successful businessman and the billionaire is certainly not by accident.
He often talks about politics in a similar way to Babi≈°, but unlike him, he doesn't build his own political brand.
The tent had been more of a reality show than a real political party for some time, and Children's helping hand seemed to make the desired bride even more of a sales girl.
For a while, STAN went with the TOP 09, then with the people, and now he's looking for decent people for a change.
Let's hope someone gets in touch.
Police dogs trained in Mosta overflights by helicopter
Dogs specialising in explosives search and search dogs today rehearsed at Lake Most overflights by helicopter.
A police dog must not be timid and afraid of flying, said the head of the police cynologists of the Sanctuary Region, Petr Tommy.
Training a police dog takes roughly two years.
At Mosta, they trained both adult trained dogs and those who were only going through the training.
In addition to the standard training in which to detect sharp samples of explosives around the lake and search for a lost figure, all 12 animals had to board a helicopter and fly over the lake.
The main purpose of the exercise is to test the dogs in the helicopter.
As soon as the helicopter came down, the dog could go to work so he wouldn't have a problem with the helicopter.
"The helicopter sits down, the dog goes and searches immediately," Tommy said.
The dog, which is restless or after a helicopter journey is unable to start work immediately, is removed from training.
"They usually keep them in the garden, for example," said Tommy.
Police have 76 dogs in the Sanctuary county with various specializations.
German sheepdogs are prevalent, but there are also Belgian sheepdogs.
The dog takes care of it from the puppy.
"He's raising it himself, preparing it for the service the dog will do for us," Tommy said.
The animal is undergoing repeated veterinary examinations that can detect possible health hendikeps.
If the dog is healthy and unassuming, it consists of the first tests at 20 months.
"It takes about two-and-a-half to three years for a sharp hit," Tommy added.
The length of service with the police depends on the health of the dog.
They mostly serve within eight to 10 years.
They usually live with their dogs.
Trailer for the 3rd season of Narcos: Pablo Escobar is out of the game and Cali Cartel becomes the centerpiece of Netflix's hit series
Despite the conclusion of the second season of Narcos, when Pablo Escobar's killer is revealed, the Netflix series is far from over.

Now in its third season, the DEA is focused on the world's richest drug cartel: Cali Cartel.
Under the guidance of four influential godfathers, they operate "like a Fortune 500 company," only with the difference that they escalate violent acts and bribe more government officials.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) is the cartel's leader, Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) plays the brain of operations, Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) is in charge of joining Mexico, and Chepe Santacruz Londono (Pepe Rapazote) controls New York.
In the new Trailer, Pedro Pascal returns as Javier Pe√±a, the character of the verging American and Colombian enforcer of rights in the fight against drugs.
Other actors include Matias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bish√© and Arturo Castro.
The third season of Narcos will unveil its premiere on September 1.
According to UN, Afghan democracy relies on women in politics
Elections can only be credible if they are attended by all members of society, including women, a U.N. representative in Afghanistan said on Wednesday.
Nicholas Haysom, chief executive of the UN Auxiliary Mission said hundreds of women are taking part in local council elections, three women are applying for the post of vice president, and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women.
"The role of women cannot be ignored," he said in his Wednesday statement.
Elections can be fully representative and credible only if women participate, as well as all related processes related to the election.
The local and presidential elections in Afghanistan take place on April 5.
The Taliban has posted several threats against the electoral process moving international combat activity to the other track.
In this year's elections, for the first time, one democratically elected government passes its power peacefully to the following government.
Haysom said the strong role of women will strengthen Afghanistan's democracy.
The Afghan Independent Electoral Commission said that of the total 3.6 million registered voters, 1.2 million are women.
Unique brewery cooks beer again
For a good beer to a resurrected brewery.
The enthusiasm and honesty of the new owners was brought back to life a couple of years ago by a brewery in the Lobchi near Mila.
The brewery commemorated for the first time in 1586 has a Renaissance core, and in the nineteenth century it was rebuilt into a parochial operation.
Years of bloom followed, when the brewery was famous mainly for dark beers.
Unfortunately, in World War II, production was stopped and in 1984 the brewery was nationalised.
Since then, the buildings have served the state estate.
The work of destruction was completed by the owners of the brewery after 1989.
The abandoned compound was devastated and dismantled into building material.
But there was new hope in 2007 in the form of new owners, architects Jana and Pavel Prouz.
They began to repair the buildings with the utmost respect for the spirit of the structure and every detail.
They have been carefully dedicated and dedicated to studying archival materials, trying to preserve original materials and building elements.
The brewery has the same form as in the nineteenth century, when its golden era took off.
Their work was appreciated by the brewery's declaration of cultural memory by the Ministry of Culture and the construction became part of the European industrial heritage trails.
In 2015, they solemnly restored the tradition of brewing beer.
To taste the great footy beer in the picturesque landscape of Koko√∏nska, visit the saloon at the brewery site.
When cooking beer here, they use coconut water stemming from the protected landscape area, the malt from the lobech fields and the granite hops.
In the bar you will taste the traditional light lager, but also dark beers and specials.
And don't miss a tour of the brewery, it takes place on Saturdays and Sundays at noon and at half past two.
Czechoslovakia's largest artillery fortress?
One of the biggest strongholds of its type on a global scale?
This unique building was to be the Stachelberg fortress between Trutnov and ≈Ωacl√©r, at the top of the terrain back above the village of Bab√≠.
It was originally to be made up of up to twelve bunkers connected to the vast underground.
There was supposed to be a headquarters, a barracks, ammunition warehouses, materials, a power plant, an engine room and a hospital.
But construction ended the Munich agreement.
In less than a year, a single massive iron concrete bunker had been built, and underground spaces had been lured away.
Thanks to the enthusiasts of Stachelberg, who began to reconstruct the unique building in the early 1990s, you can also look here.
The underground is available from 75 percent!
Part of the compound is in addition to the infantry cabin T-S 73 with exposure and sub-ground as well as a weaponized light-fortifying object, two set-up infantry cabins, trenches and a learning trail fortified by Trutnovsko.
Refreshments, cosy gazebo and stunning views of the countryside guaranteed!
This unique and beautiful Czech construction has made it onto the list alongside such monuments as the Great Wall of China, Traian's Port near Rome or the Assyrian Palace in Ninive and Nimrud.
Originally from the early thirteenth century, which today consists mainly of a massive four-wing convention building over a beautiful garden.
The list he got to, but unfortunately, it belongs to unique structures that are at risk of extinction.
But enthusiasts don't want to give up and hold a lot of events in support of the monastery.
One of these is the next year of Vechero for the Temple of Chou≈°ov this Saturday, the fifth of August, where Vladimir Mishik, Ivan the Voice, will see the swordsmanship and look at the places of the magnificent structure which are usually inaccessible.
But you will enjoy the atmosphere of this great place.
You want to look Neanderthals in the face?
The exhibition Welcome to the Neanderthals in the pavilion of the Anthropos Moravian Land Museum in Brno attracts an unremarkable excourse to the deepest ancient age to the Stone Age, to the world of our predecessors.
You will find out how the Neanderthals have managed to cope in a perfect way with a variety of extreme climatic conditions, mainly with alternate periods of ice and ice.
Despite their simple material culture, they were hugely successful predators of their time.
You'll also learn what they looked like, what their anatomy, technological skills and hunting um were, but also their aesthetic feel.
That you wouldn't tell the Neanderthals?
Be persuaded in Brno.
The fourteenth festival of KELT & WORLD MUSIC takes place on Saturday the fifth at Castle Vever.
In addition to great music, you will see the building of a Celtic village, try the Celtic way of life including crafts, games for children and adults, divination, magic or ritual painting on the body.
He won't miss La Quadrilla with Irish and Scottish dancing, drummer jams, a bagpipes game and an amazing fire surprise in a submission by Carpe Nocto.
What does Moravian-Silesia taste like?
The seventh year of the famous gastrofestival How to work Moravian-Silesia is held on Saturday, August 5, 2017, in the area of the mountain spa of Karlova Studanek.
Chef Miroslav Kalina will cook, taste culinary specialties and regional food, enjoy music and dance performances, a rich programme for children such as creative workshops, theatre, bouncy castle, Smurf competition path and, of course, a number of competitions.
Get to know the plant with one click.
The new free Pl @ ntNet app will help students with the creation of herbaries as well as ordinary plant lovers.
If they wonder what plant they just hit on a walk, this app will advise them.
All they'll have to do is photograph the plant, and the app itself will recognize what kind it is.
The new app, which is available for both iOS and Android, was introduced on Tuesday by representatives of the Center for Ethics and Environmental Education CEEV in Bratislava's Horn Park as part of the city's Secret Life Project.
The project also involved pupils from 50 Czech and Slovak schools who photographed and added plants from their surroundings with teachers in the application database.
The newly created French app is free to download on the city's Secret Life website.
The main goal of French programmers was to make as many people as possible contribute to the app with their images, thereby increasing the number of plants the app can recognize.
"Already children who keep a tablet or cellphone in hand can head out into the woods," said the project's co-ordinator, Ivana Pol√°kova.
On the basis of a sufficiently high quality photograph of the flower, leaf or fruit of the plant, the application can recognize its name within a few seconds, which is then assigned to the photograph in both Czech and Slovak.
The French have allowed us to translate the application into Slovak and Czech.
It is therefore welcome for users to contribute a picture of a plant that is not yet present in the database after setting up an account.
"The French will evaluate if it's beneficial, and then add it to the database," she said.
GMB concerns over investment in McVitie's plant in Glasgow
Unions are demanding assurances from cookie-maker manager McVitie's about a long-term commitment to production at a factory in Glasgow.
Scottish trade union GMB said the company was silent for now about any potential investment in a factory in the Tollcross area.
More than 500 employees work at the factory, producing, among other products, hobnob and Rich Tea cookies.
The owner of McVitie's, the Pladis company, said it had invested more than ¬£5 million in the entire area over several previous years.
She added that staff and union representatives would be "among the first informed" in the event of changes to the plant's operations.
In a letter to the company's chief executive, the Scottish GMB union expressed its concerns that McVitie's "will not get its promises on funding and upgrading production lines."
GMB chief organiser Drew Duffy added: "The fact that we have not received a clear response from the construction manager about the needs of the company and the future investment plan in Tollcross is very worrying for our members.
Generations of many families have worked here, and staff come mostly from the local community and the Glasgow area, where work in the local factory is a critical pillar of decent employment in the area from high unemployment and social separation.
From the perspective of work, pay and benefit - and despite the outlook for Brexit, rising living costs and falling slow production - the eastern part of Glasgow needs a desperately prosperous producer like McVitie's. "
A spokeswoman for Pladis said: "Construction manager Tollcross received a letter from the GMB only yesterday and the company will issue a statement as soon as possible as we value the continued commitment to staff and union representatives.
A regular meeting with staff and representatives of the GMB in Tollcross took place two months ago, and a number of issues were openly discussed at that meeting.
We have spoken to employees that, as in all companies operating in extremely competitive and uncertain economic conditions, we value our operations on a regular basis, which applies to all our operations so that we can continue to compete successfully with others.
To that, she added: "In recent years we have invested ¬£5 million in the Tollcross area, particularly into production lines and making traffic more efficient.
We greatly appreciate the heritage of Tollcross and the site here, and in the event of any changes in the operation of the plant here, employees and union representatives will be informed immediately. "
Did PSG warn Barcelona about moving Neymar three years ago?
La Liga may regret their interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain will not allow in their quest to get Neymar to their side after she folded ¬£189 million, the amount needed to redeem Neymar from his contract, but did he warn this French team Barcelona of their record-breaking raid already three years ago?
This sensational transfer has stirred the waters of summer offenses. The Ligue 1 club are set to overcome more than double the previous record amount for the transfer of Paul Pogba to Manchester United, who paid ¬£89 million for him last season.
After confirming and completing the transfer, Neymar will become the world's most expensive player and at the same time the best-paid professional athlete in the world - after tax he will receive ¬£500,000 a week from the PSG team.
Barcelona are indignant at the way Neymar has tied himself out of his contract, despite a confidential source confirming that the club has always tried to accommodate Neymar in everything since his arrival from Santos in 2013.
But was the football world alerted to this fact three years ago by the president of PSG?
When Manchester City expressed their interest in Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi warned all the club would be interested in overhauling one of PSG's best players.
"I'm not worried because once someone tries to get one of our players, then we will certainly address one of their players," Al-Khelaifi said.
'we respect all the clubs.
But if they're trying to get one of our players, they'll face the consequences. "
Barcelona appear to have crossed an imaginary line when they expressed interest in PSG midfielder Marco Verratti in the summer.
PSG have made clear in the sense that they will not, under any circumstances, allow the departure of the Italian representative - it is therefore possible that Barcelona, for their audacious negotiations now with the departure of Neymar, are swallowing a bitter pill.
Who will explain the sanctions?
Does political punishment have widely understood rules?
Donald Trump nodded to anti-Russian sanctions.
The day before, the US imposed sanctions on Venezuelan President Maduro.
And just a day earlier, Trump wrote that China was doing nothing with the North Korean threat and that it would not go on like that.
Even from that, the idea of sanctions is like the straw of shoes.
Those things can't be thrown in one bag.
Maduro's Venezuela really set out on a path to dictatorship, even totalitarianism.
China is not merely behaving the way the US president would have wished.
Russia is a chapter for itself.
But if anyone wanted to sum it up so that even a common voter, American, European or otherwise, understood what it was and what system of rules was based on sanctions policy, the task would be almost impossible.
In sanctions against Russia, President Trump is merely subsidizing what President Obama has already set up, just giving it an implementation stamp.
So why such a commotion?
Last year, Europe was terrified of winning the US election Trump would hug Putin and lift the sanctions.
Terrible idea.
In practice, it's the other way around.
With Trump, sanctions are not being released, but they are tightening.
But Europe is even more terrified.
German Minister Zypries says Trump sanctions violate international law
You mean that kosher are just sanctions approved by the UN Security Council?
But then there are no kosher or anti-Russian EU sanctions.
European Commission chief Juncker complains again that Trump sanctions threaten EU energy security
You mean they're supposed to use sanctions just so weak that they don't put anyone at risk?
The regular voter is groping.
For three years, he has heard that the fate of anti-Russian sanctions depends only on the fulfilment of the Minsk ceasefire agreements in Ukraine.
Now it is learned that it is the EU's energy security.
The voter is groping even more widely.
There are sanctions on Russia for getting too attached to where it's not supposed to.
China is being scolded for doing little.
The Venezuelan president is being punished for building a dictatorship within his country's borders.
All those punishments or just considerations have their rationality.
But does anyone see the system, the order or the rules?
Andrei Babi≈°: I do not consider cooperation with Okamura.
Andrei Babi≈° married, cruises the republic with his visionary book and finalizes the election program.
In addition to the Pardubice Region, it already has all the candidates ready.
According to his words, he did not significantly interfere with them.
He even agreed to be led by the general and shadow education minister YES Ivo Vondrak.
"But if he succeeds, he will have to choose whether he wants to be an MP or a general," Babi≈° said.
A lot of representatives and national politicians have upset your thesis that directly elected mayors and mayors should run municipalities and cities themselves, only with managers.
Are you serious?
It wasn't like that.
I am a supporter of direct democracy, we choose the president directly, and I believe that we should also vote for mayors and mayors.
In my book, I'm not talking about disturbing representatives, they might as well be there.
The question is how many will be.
In the presentation of your book What I dream about when I happen to sleep, I heard with my own ears that you were talking about abolishing the council.
I don't remember.
I was talking about direct choice and reducing the number of representatives.
New York, with nine million residents, has five districts and 51 representatives.
Prague, with 1.2 million citizens, has 1171 representatives.
And the mayor says she doesn't build enough and doesn't set up big projects, but she doesn't have the skills to do it.
The same is true of a government that only two people have managed in our history, Klaus and Zeman.
So I'm not saying they did it well.
But the current prime minister doesn't drive anything, he just moderates the debate.
It can't work that way.
Is that why you want to enforce the majority system?
It would be ideal, but it's hard to get through.
In the program, we only have a change to a one-round choice to the Senate.
We have also proposed a sliding mandate for ministers and an amendment to the Rules of Procedure of the House in order to avoid unnecessary exhibitions of Members who are supposed to work mainly in committees and committees, not to show up at House meetings.
It is certainly not true that I want to destroy the parliamentary system.
But that's exactly what your opponents fear.
That as a dictator you will run the government, control the House with 101 MPs, repeal the county and the Senate and, through grateful mayors and primaries, control the whole country.
It's not like that.
There is nothing wrong with debating the number of MPs.
French President Macron has announced a reduction of the legislature by a third, while there are 57,000 French for one lawmaker, while for us it is based on 17,000 Czechs.
But no one is accusing Macron of endangering democracy.
Even if someone wins a majority in the Czech Republic, we have mechanisms that would prevent him from making any dramatic changes.
But the welds for whoever has a parliamentary majority are great, you only have to look to Poland or Hungary.
There is no such thing in the case of the YES movement.
We just need a team in government to work for the people, not for their parties or resorts.
I do not understand why we have failed to agree that only the salaries of teachers, staff in culture and social services will increase.
Why did they overvote me and add 21 percent to GIBS members who are already taking 60,000?
Would you step on that as Prime Minister?
The Prime Minister is to intervene when ministers behave inexpensively, confuse the government with a travel agency and, for the money of the state, would like to do business like Marian Jurek, who wanted to buy forests in Romania and land in Africa.
Ministers are not supposed to argue in government, contradictions are to be said outside it.
There has to be finished material in the cabinet, there's no room for coalition rip-offs, force voting and business, that's where to make decisions.
How do you want to have a cohesive team when ministers are mainly partisan?
There is a constitutional law over the parties.
When it came to breaking bread, Sobotka said the coalition treaty did not apply, and knocked Babi≈° out of government.
Any prime minister can do that.
But if he is a personality and has control skills, there is no need for such false gestures.
It measures everyone equally and requires perfect performance from everyone.
Do you know who you'd propose to the finance minister?
I don't think about it at all, we probably won't be in the government, no one wants to cooperate with us, even though I don't know what I've done.
So much skepticism is misplaced.
The mayors have acquired the entrepreneur Children who would like to cooperate with you.
I don't think so.
The ƒåSSD is led by Lubomir Zaorlek, who does not rule out a coalition with ANO.
I'd leave it up to the voters.
Vice Premier and ANO vice-chairman Richard Brabec said you have many common points with SPD Tomia Okamura, for example, in the area of the economy.
So the gutters come into consideration as a coalition partner?
Mr. Brabec says he didn't put it that way.
Mr. Okamura has a political history, he ran as a figurehead for VV, then he got money from Dawn for his firm, there was a coup.
He is, of course, a distinctive personality.
A little brownish, though.
When I take his agenda, there's a broad involvement of people in corporate governance, direct democracy, you can agree with that.
I'm not asking you that.
I wonder if there is an acceptable person for you who has xenophobic views, greets at demonstrations with gallows and wants to get out of the EU?
We don't consider working with Mr. Okamura's party, I can't imagine.
Obviously, he went into politics to profit from it.
What about the quiet support of the communists to your minority government?
I can't imagine even that, but the voters will decide.
It will be about negotiating the winner with the second in the order, but God knows who will be the winner and who the two.
Of course, it is important that they are able to agree on a coalition government programme.
Let's go back to your quest to run the state as a firm.
But the government simply has to drive, Prime Minister Sobotka left everything to avoid, never decided.
Coalition issues like ƒåEB or EGAP did not work.
I mean, Sobotka is his puppet, and I think that's why he fired me.
As soon as he did, CEZ controlled the Czech government.
It is incredible that the Prime Minister has delivered a resolution written by CEZ management, which imposes on the Minister of Finance how to vote at the CEZ general meeting.
If you became prime minister, would you change the staffing situation in the supervisory board and replace CEZ's senior management?
Jesus, if I'm Prime Minister, we'll see.
I'm not one yet.
Word is that CEZ has already sent signals in your direction.
Good cooperation with ƒåSSD would like to trade for even better with YES.
Then, after the election, everything will go on.
I don't know anything about it.
I don't have any lobbyist Pokorny or Rose, I'm a separate unit and I don't deal with that at all.
Then answer directly.
If you are at the head of the government, will you seek to exchange the leadership of CEZ, Czech Television or General Health Insurance, the institution you criticise?
I would like CEZ to be a transparent society.
So far, he's been doing what he wanted for years, thanks to commissions for traditional political parties.
All you have to do is look into Mr. Schwarzenberg's statements.
Although the state has a majority in CEZ, it has never driven it, it has only been there in numbers, which is wrong.
For me, it's a trivial matter.
CEZ is supposed to take the Dukovans, appreciate them, push them into a subsidiary, arrange financing, do a supply competition or get a co-investor and build a new nuclear bloc.
The concept that the state is supposed to fund and build new nuclear blocks is absurd.
And Czech TV?
Some of her shows are running a permanent purpose campaign against me, but I don't and I won't have any competence to fire anyone.
But to control yes.
I don't want to control anyone.
I'm just saying that citizens pay about $7.2 billion a year for public radio and television, but they don't really know how these institutions run.
How come they don't know?
After all, the House approves the report on their management, which has a direct impact on the positions of the CEOs of ƒåT and ƒåRo.
Look at how those reports are handled, the super power pact of Sobotka Kalousek, which has always worked.
This applies both to the current parliamentary commission for leaks from investigative files and lex Babi≈°.
And Sobotka was stupid enough to let Kalousk push me out of the government, which added a percentage of the TOP 09, but the ƒåSSD took them.
They're afraid of disrupting their corruption system, and so they're talking about the threat to democracy by Babi≈°.
No one is immune.
What do you say to the articles describing how First Vice-President YES Jaroslav Faltenek builds a power background by putting his son in the supervisory board of the sweatshop Brno and arranging a related lawyer for Kvtoslava Watch for contracts with city and state firms such as the Prague Transport Company or the Czech Railways?
We have a persistent dispute in that.
I don't like it, and I blamed him several times.
Faltine argues that the mentioned lawyer works at substantially lower rates and is reliable.
I wouldn't go that way.
As finance minister, I had no one.
We, unlike the statues, have never had a corruption affair, no PELTU, Kratochenko, Brezina.
If there was any sign of clientelism, we fired such a person at once.
I am uncompromising in that direction.
If something like this happens, we get rid of anyone, it doesn't matter who it is.
