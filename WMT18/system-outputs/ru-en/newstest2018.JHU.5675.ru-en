Russian President Vladimir Putin signed the Law on the introduction of administrative liability for violation of the time and order of payment of goods (works, services) in the execution of procurement for state and municipal needs.
The law is designed to solve the very serious problem of failing to comply with its obligations by customers in the execution of public and municipal purchases.
Another two years ago, the situation in which entrepreneurs could not receive payment for already executed state and municipal contracts was widespread.
At that time, the President of Russia instructed the Prosecutor General of the Russian Federation to take the issue of special control.
Because the businessmen themselves could not cope with unscrupulous customers who were not supported by the Financing of the contracts, they tried to evade the payment obligations and included illegal conditions in the contracts.
The problem was systemic in the country.
Since 2015, in the interests of protecting the rights of entrepreneurs to receive payment on public orders, the Prosecutor's Office has made 9.7 thousand submissions, according to the results of their consideration of disciplinary measures involving 4.5 thousand officials, to administrative - 533, to the investigative bodies for the organization of legal proceedings, 75 materials have been filed, 46 of them have been initiated criminal cases.
As a result, the debt to entrepreneurs in the amount of more than 66 billion roubles was paid.
And these huge amounts have accumulated far beyond the non-payment of multi-billion contracts.
There have been numerous, systematic delays in the payment of services to entrepreneurs on the far more modest amounts.
Here is a typical case.
The head of the small Company won a competition for the provision of social services services for several million rubles.
The person invested all of his revolving funds, fully fulfilled the obligations, but the money was not received on time.
The result is an increasing financial balance of wages, taxes, loans that would lead to bankruptcy if the entrepreneur did not ask for assistance from the Prosecutor's Office.
Now, in a number of regions, the problem has managed to maximize the problem.
However, as of the first half of 2017, the total amount of debt on state and municipal contracts, identified by prosecutors of the subjects of the Russian Federation, amounted to about 27.4 billion roubles.
In regions where debt indicators continue to reach critical values, the Public Prosecutor's Office operates in a manual crisis management regime.
The Attorney General is personally conducting visiting meetings with representatives of the local authorities, where all public prosecutors have dealt with violations and measures to remove them immediately.
Such operational meetings have already been held in Yaroslavl and Yekaterinburg this year.
Qualitatively improving the payment discipline of public customers will be able to implement Federal Law No. 189-FZ "On Amendments to the Code of the Russian Federation on Administrative Offences in order to establish administrative liability of officials of the client for the violation of the period and order of payment of goods (works, services) in the implementation of the procurement for the provision of state and municipal needs," which was signed last week by the President of Russia.
The draft law was drafted by the Ministry of Economic Development of Russia on the initiative of the Prosecutor General.
The new law will supplement the Code of the Russian Federation on Administrative Offences, which provides for a fine of 30 thousand to 50 thousand rubles for the violation of the term and order of payment of goods, works and services in public and municipal procurement.
And if an official has already been subjected to administrative punishment for a similar offence, he is awaiting disqualification for a period of between one and two years.
All prosecutors of the constituent entities of the Russian Federation have already been instructed to ensure the application of these legislation in practice.
The Civil Rights Protection Unit announced a warning on movement in Missouri
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People published a warning for coloured people travelling in Missouri, due to discriminatory State policies and racist attacks.
The Group's statement reads: "warning for the travelling National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, valid until August 28, 2017, calls on African-American travellers, guests and citizens of the state of Missouri to be particularly careful and to exercise greater caution when travelling on a state of a series of questionable racist incidents, which have recently taken place throughout the State and cited here."
According to the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, to announce a warning on the movement of the Group, the Group has recently adopted a law recently adopted in Missouri, which makes it more difficult for people to win claims related to discrimination, as well as the fact that State law enforcement agencies are disproportionately targeted by members of minorities.
"You have human rights violations.
They stop on the roads due to skin colour, beat them and kill," said Kansas City star Star, the President of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People of Missouri.
"We hear complaints often as never before."
This is the first warning of this kind announced by the Organization in relation to the US state.
The group referred to incidents such as the humiliation of black students on racial grounds at the University of Missouri and the death of the 20-year-old Tori Sanders, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died in suspicious circumstances earlier this year after he had completed his petrol during his trip to the State, and the State Police of Missouri arrested him without charge of the crime.
Prevention also refers to the recent report by the Office of the Attorney General of the state of Missouri, according to which the probability of being stopped on the road for Black drivers is 75 percent higher than for whites.
"The purpose of the warning is to keep people informed of the situation and warn their relatives and friends and colleagues about what may happen in Missouri," said Chel.
"People have to be prepared in one way or another, whether they will take money to bail or inform relatives that they travel across the State."
According to the latest data from the FBI's report on hate crimes, in Missouri for 2015, 100 hate crimes have been recorded, making the state of the sixteenth in the State as such violations.
Also, the Movement warning is a response to the new law of the state of Missouri, after which it will be more difficult to prosecute the legal person in relation to housing or labour discrimination.
Previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) announced warnings for travellers travelling on Texas and Arizona after the States adopted new immigration controls, according to which local law enforcement agencies were required to arrest people for violation of immigration laws, which, according to ACLU, should have increased the number of racial checks.
Traffic warnings are usually issued by the Department of State for other countries, but lately, public organizations have resorted to this measure in response to certain laws and trends within the US.
Two people died as a result of shooting at a police patrol in Egypt
Unknown shots were fired at a police patrol in the Egyptian city of ISNA, Reuters reports citing the Egyptian Ministry of the Interior.
During the exchange of fire, two people, including one police officer, were killed, three people were injured.
All the injured were taken to hospital.
According to the Agency, the police stopped the vehicle, after which the two armed men in the car opened fire on law enforcement officers.
One of the intruders was detained, the second managed to escape.
Rosturism supports the Law on the Abolition of free baggage for non-return tickets
The head of rosturism Oleg Safonov said in an interview with RBC TV channel that "positive" refers to the adoption of the Law on the Abolition of free baggage allowance for non-return Airtickets.
"It is necessary to create conditions in which a person who does not have luggage can buy a ticket cheaper than the one whose luggage is," he said (quoted by TASS).
At the same time, Mr. Safonov noted that, despite the concerns of citizens, pay for the carriage of top clothes and mobile phone in hand baggage will not have to be made.
"It would be appropriate to calm all of our citizens and tourists and to say that it is to the top clothes, to the umbrella, to the mobile phone, to aipeu, or even to some computer, the relationship will not be", "the head of ROSTOURISM said.
Earlier, the Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a law providing for the right of airlines to exclude the norm of free baggage carriage at a non-return airticket.
This is the fact that airlines can determine the number of seats and the weight of baggage included in the non-return rate.
Vladimir Putin instructed to eliminate the pollution of Baikal
Russian President Vladimir Putin at a meeting on the Protection of Baikal reported that in recent years significant areas of the lake have been affected by extreme pollution.
He instructed to identify sources of funding, plans and performers for the elimination of pollution.
Mr Putin also instructed to carry out a full-fledged recultivation of contaminated areas.
"It is necessary to understand the facilities that continue to work here, the treatment facilities of the majority of them are worn out," the President quotes "RIA Novosti."
He also added that the General Prosecutor's Office of Russia should conduct an audit of the identification of environmentally harmful activities.
According to him, there are problems in the lake region related to the appearance of natural landfills and a number of environmental violations by the organizers of the rest.
"I want to stress this: not for all in a row, it is also necessary to know here, but it is also illegal and environmentally harmful, and take appropriate measures," he stressed.
Previously, the Prosecutor General's Office reported a decrease in fish stocks in Lake Baikal and proposed an increase in the number of facilities subject to environmental supervision.
Recall, on June 15, Vladimir Putin, in a direct line, announced the need to amend legislation to ensure the rights of citizens living in the natural territories of a special security regime.
The residents of Olkhon Island, who are part of the Baikal natural territory, were informed about problems with business management.
The head of the Ministry of Nature, Sergei Donskoy, immediately proposed to solve the problem by clarifying the boundaries of the water protection zone of Baikal, but in the government of Buryatia it was recalled that such a change is not enough, as the restrictions are related to a number of normative acts.
Earlier in the Ministry of Economy, it was proposed to solve the problem by amending the Land Code and the Law on the Protection of the environment.
A new temple will appear in Yugra
In the village of Sosva, members of the community from representatives of the small indigenous peoples of the North "rakhtynya," together with the residents of Berezovsky District, take part in the construction of an Orthodox temple in honor of Saint Nicholas the Wonderworker.
Its location is the river bank, the temple will be well visible, so it will serve as a beacon for the fishermen.
According to the representatives of the community, construction works will be completed this year, now the dome is installed, there are church bells.
The igrome river fleet has provided transport escorts.
The temple is named in honor of Saint Nicholas the Wonderworker, as he is revered by the Orthodox Church as a patron of travelers, including fishermen.
In the nipple, fishing gives the settlers work, feed them.
Local residents wait when the temple opens its doors, and children even write in school works about it as a local attraction.
Disneyland with the death penalty.
Why does Singapore comply with laws?
I speak with a local businessman Chang, sitting in the open air.
Commenting on the situation in Singapore, Chang smokes one cigarette for the other, the okures are carefully stored in a well-stocked iron box from the Office.
After the end of the conversation, the businessman is sent to the nearest urn - up to it meters - and thrown out there.
A fine for garbage in a public place - 500 local dollars, - said Chang.
You know, I've just got a reflex since childhood: you can't throw Fantik from candy on the bridge, instantly fine.
And now there is a video camera at all.
And indeed, the pavements of Singapore in the centre of the city of Chista, as if at the museum.
Chang says: Three months ago, the 18-year-old son of his neighbour painted graffiti with a wall of the old colonial building.
The Court found the guy guilty of vandalism and sentenced to flogging.
What?!
Imagine yourself.
He received ten blows with a wooden stick on the buttocks and spent a week in prison.
We have no physical punishment at all.
As Singapore combines the highest standard of living and tough laws, it has dealt with the site of the AiF.
No one thinks of abolishing the death penalty, explains the lawyer Victor Li Hong.
And the Government has long gone to the opinion of both the European Union and the US on this issue.
If a person is transporting a large lot of drugs or trading them, he is put on a visa.
In 2002, a 22-year-old Australian citizen was detained at Changi Airport, with 400 grams of cocaine.
His defence was defended by the Australian Prime Minister, threatening sanctions, international human rights activists and even the Pope.
However, the guy was eventually hanged.
After that, the drug couriers of our country are trying to make a side of the party.
The matter is: in Singapore, the laws are obliged to observe everything in a row, not just modest and unrich people.
It is not important who you are a millionaire, a deputy prime minister, a famous artist or a resident of the European Union.
The option in this case is one: If you find a cocaine shelf, you will be hanged.
When you go to Singapore and everywhere you meet with a sign of warning, you'll find out how much in this proud state of the forbidden state!
For example, a sign rubber is sold only in pharmacies, and it is possible to buy it strictly according to the prescription (!) of the doctor.
There is no departure from a tourist on arrival, but it is worth mentioning the "rubber" in the metro, a fine of 1 thousand local dollars.
In four days, I met two people with white plates on the neck: "I'm garbage."
In addition to the fine, the urns are often sentenced to "the reference to the palace": the week is to clean the parks and beaches.
6 thousand roubles pays "the offender," forgetting the water in the public toilet, and when trying to reverse the small need in the elevator, a special detector is locked - the doors are blocked and the Police sent a signal to the police.
Among the most exotic laws are prohibitions on the feeding of pigeons on the street, public performance of songs, and even excessive watering of the room plant (!): It is believed that the abundance of water attracts mosquitoes.
In order to avoid the fires, smokers cannot be beaten in the subway, otherwise they will be fined 5,000 Singaporeans.
In general, there appears to be a thought: How do you do something wrong?
This is not the case, trying to disbelieve me Mohammed qabbir kajaria, the owner of the local travel agency.
Especially fantastic laws exist only on paper, and over the past twenty years I have not seen anyone who has been involved in their violation.
Why do they persist?
For citizens not to relax.
Compliance with the basic rules is monitored strictly.
For example, if a minor is sold in a cigarette, it will be punished by all along the chain: the owner of the store will pay a huge amount, the offender will be hit by sticks on the "back of the back," and the seller will also be thrown into jail.
It is thanks to such harsh laws that Singapore is very rare.
Is this justified?
Even in the seventies, there was chaos on the roads - motorists ignored traffic lights, drove as they wanted, they were drunk behind the wheel.
After the introduction of fines, the year was calm.
Now the driver, who is drunk, knows: if he stops, a police officer will not release the bribe, a fine of the value of the apartment and for years will be sent to the bars.
Many foreigners in Southeast Asia seem to be a kind of concentration camp.
In 1993, the American writer William Gibson called Singapore "Disneyland with the death penalty" - a guest from the USA led to the horror of the universal wealth of the residents, the "frightening clean Airport" and "cultural nature."
Descarts, such things are unnatural, look artificial, and so in principle should not be.
The first days in Singapore, and it is right to throw paper on the pavement, stumble if you go through the Metro with ice cream.
But then you come to the "Little India" area, and suddenly - a "break of the box": the bus stop is packed with plastic glasses.
"and How?" you're surprised.
And so, Singaporeans are laughing.
Everything happens.
Not for every such "crime" will take place on the spot, but you have to know: If you are calculating, you will not get away - you have violated the law.
Most often, this is enough for the person to behave normally.
Of course, Singapore's power is entirely authoritarian.
But know what?
In the Vietnamese Ho Chi Minh City, I moved very cautiously - motorcyclists often snatched from the hands of tourists and cameras.
In the centre of Paris, there are dirty bombs and beggars.
In our streets, we do not all try to kidnap the garbage in the urns.
Singapore, thanks to the recruitment of draconian fines and ruthless (up to the death penalty), has become the most calm, clean and secure city on Earth.
Придумаешь.
This is the human nature: remember, and in Russia, no one was caught up behind the helm until they were fined.
Although the most important thing in Singapore is not fines, but voluntary compliance with laws.
And it is necessary to think that we in Russia would also be happy with clean streets, the lack of debris in the metro, and would welcome the arrest of those who put an elevator with a public toilet.
Here's the corporal punishment - Thank you, you don't have to do it.
In the rest of Singapore's laws, as a minimum, it is worth looking at them.
Nothing holy?
Now, the White House of Trump has focused on the Statue of Liberty.
The most reliable sign of regime change is when it starts to fight the statutes.
Americans understand this is not worse than all the others - hence the deliberate drama of the statue of Saddam Hussein on the FIRDOS Square in Baghdad in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the Government of Trump, knew no doubt that he had done a symbolic axe over the Statue of Liberty during a violent dispute with CNN's journalist, CNN, about the President's proposals to drastically reduce legal migration.
We will be honest, Miller did not attempt to attack the statue itself.
The owners of pleasure craft and artists who represent the Statue of Liberty would lynch him if he tried to do it.
But he attempted to make her sense, and especially on the meaning she was assigned in 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, when the poems of Emma Lazarus were added to the pedestal.
As Miller broke down on the chart: "I don't want to go deep into history, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom, which is puzzled by the world.
The poem, which you say, was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty."
Miller correctly described the facts, but as he himself said, it's actually not about history.
This is about the current sound of the striking words of Lazarus, the only ones in which the State invites not all immigrants, but the poorest: "your tired, your poor,/your crowds dreaming to breathe freely,/displacing your abundant shores."
Never again "accidents" weren't so visible on our screens.
Miller did not deal with literature - he made it clear that in America, Trump didn't expect these people.
This debate about the meaning of the statue is part of a wider political and cultural war: it is indeed a dispute about the meaning of America.
Lazarous - and her friends, bordered to put her words on the statue of the statue after her death - very well understood that he was committing a completely political act.
The sculpture was intended to mark the link between the French and the American Republics with the help of a banal classical figure - a female image of freedom.
Lazarus has changed its meaning: in her poem, the female figure is no longer abstract, she has a voice.
And she got a completely different name: the mother of expelled.
The connection of the poem and the image was a brilliant feminist movement and a crushing attack against American nativism.
And as Lazarus has changed the meaning of the statue, the right though to change it back.
The Lightning rush of limbo, a sort of John the Baptist, who heralded the coming of Trump, in 2010 reasoned that freedom does not invite anyone, rather, it is an early neo-cons, which is the flame of America lying in the darkness of the world: "Freedom goes forward.
It bears the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
The torch is not needed to cover the way in the USA."
Against the search of limbo, there was really a point in the point.
The meaning of the statue depends entirely on the angle of view.
The great creative achievement of Lazarus was to see her as she would be seen as being seen, unhappy, but full of hope people on ships' ships after long and often difficult navigation.
This means literally looking at the world through the eyes of people who seek refuge and chance for a better life.
Her statue responds to them with the words of hope and hospitality they dream to hear.
And, of course, this is not the prospect that Miller and Trump ever want to admit.
Their torch needs not to cover the way, but to incite hatred, which is the only source of their strength.
World Championships 2017: Neil Blake highly values Scottish members of the UK team.
Ailid Doyle recalls the time when the UK team was only two Scots
Neil Blake, Director of the UK Athletics Federation, said that the 16-person Scottish part of the team at the World Championships will make a "significant contribution to the team's game."
The record number of Scottish athletes was selected for the London championship of 2017.
Blake believes that in Scotland "something special" and the UK Athletics Federation should take this into account.
"We know this and try to understand and support, while they have the potential," Blake said.
"I spoke to people at the Scottish Sports Institute, and they think this is due to what they have done.
The Scottish Athletics Federation thinks that what they have done is to work.
The British Athletics Federation: what they have done is to work.
And people on the street think the same.
I don't know why circumstances have so developed, but it's perfectly brilliant."
Some of the Scottish athletes are competing for medals, including Laura myur and Andrew bicker, who will compete with Sir Mo farach at a distance of 5,000 m; and eild Doyle has chosen his captain.
"ailid modesty.
Her captain's speech was magnificent," Blake says.
"Many athletes, regardless of whether they are Scots or not, and from where they live or train, came out of the room, feeling pride and mood for victory.
The passion and the sincere feelings that have invested in it have been remarkable."
The winner of the silver medal of the Commonwealth Championship, which at his fifth World Championships will run a distance of 400 m with obstacles, says that 16 Scots in the British National Team are "incredibly."
The previous record for the number of Scots at the World Championships was seven, in 1983 and 2005.
There is Laura MEUR, who specialises in jogging at the medium distance, and who has passed five British and two European records last year.
It will run for 1,500 and 5,000 metres.
Chris O'Hare, who will participate in the race for 1,500 m, is another Scotland, where it is worth paying attention: behind his back he has a successful season, in which the victory in the qualifying competitions of the British National Team and at the annual competitions.
Doyle recalls his first world championships, when McConnell was the only Scots in the team.
The captain of the team says she is "incredibly proud" that so many of her countrymen are not only part of the collection, but in some cases they will compete for medals and fight for the final.
"The captain of the Team is choosing other members of the team, so it was in any case a great honor, but to know that your comrades voted for you and you have chosen," she added, "she added.
"Of course, I am very proud of all the Scots that have entered the Assembly.
This shows how much we have achieved.
And they all are the athletes who will try to get to the podium.
And what about my capital speech?
Yes, I think she was not bad.
I just drew attention to the fact that we were very lucky to host the World Championship.
So it's just about how important it is to receive support from the fans and take advantage of what we will once again at the Olympic Stadium.
I got another chance to get to his arena and take part in competitions, and the atmosphere there will be just wonderful."
Blocking critics in Facebook: not to be put on public office if you are not ready to listen to criticism from voters
The founder of our country understood that such a critical press.
Americans loved George Washington, but it didn't prevent them from criticizing him for everything from domestic politics to his political principles.
Criticism of him, of course, irritated.
But he did not shut his mouth to his critics.
Because, in 1783, Washington said: "You can take the freedom of speech and of us, deaf and dumb, will lead as sheep to the slaughter."
Now I turn to the Governor of Maryland, Larry Hogan, who should try to be more like Washington.
The subordinate Hogan blocked and erased the posts of at least 450 people who expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page.
And this week, the American Civil Liberties Union sued him for this.
The subordinate Governor called the claim void, and the comment on the Internet was written in the spirit "well and what."
"It's just facebook," Many say.
But it is also important.
And this is especially important when it comes to the Hogan parne type.
He is a surprisingly popular Republican governor in a democratic State.
He is second in the rating rating among the 50 governors of the country.
Hogan is not a perverted reactor.
He showed a firm hand in the management of the State and commitment to his principles.
He also uses Facebook as a primary means of communicating with his voters and with jokes on his home page after chemotherapy.
Therefore, blocking people who come to the Governor's page - which is declared as an official public forum and is being conducted by the Administration's staff on taxpayers' money - is unnecessary and ultimately harmful.
In an interview with Washington Post, the spokesman for Amelia Cess defended the Governor's actions, arguing that the blocking of the comments is just their modesty.
But it is too easy to use the image of trolleys, spammers and heifers who are angry on the Internet.
"post" spoke with some of the real people who blocked Hogan.
And it is real people, not trolly, a teacher, a businessman, a pastor who turn to their elected leaders.
They all say that their comments were respectful, meaningful and not gross.
The pastor quoted the Bible, appealing to the fact that Hogan is Catholic.
Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramana of Bowie, Maryland, did not express hatred, but asked about hate crime.
"I wrote a polite comment that I am disappointed by the absence of his reaction to hate crimes and other recent news," she wrote in the comments section to the article in the post.
"I also don't like the idea that when many people leave comments on the same subject, some immediately say that this is the so-called winding, instead of admitting that they are dealing with a large group of disgruntled citizens."
The fact that the subordinate governor is called "concentrated spam," others would probably call "active life."
In the Facebook era, it is easy to edit your image, simply blocking critics or stylized negative comments.
It is much less hard work than before, when it was necessary to send people, to collect and burn newspapers with critical editorials or to arrest and pull out the mouth of the protesters.
But it is exactly what is happening now, only in the figure.
Hogen is not the first official who criticises what he does not want to listen to Facebook and other social networks.
The President of Trump was sued by Twitter users who were trapped in his Twitter account.
One of the first, turning decisions on this topic was made this week in Virginia.
According to the U.S. District Judge of Alexandria, James K. keesheris, the Chairman of the Supervisory Board of the county of Ladon violated the first amendment, forgetting the voter in his account in the facecbook.
And in Kentucky, the Republican governor, Matt bwin, sued the American Union for the protection of civil liberties for his behaviour on Facebook and Twitter.
This should not be so difficult.
In Washington's time, the era of affordable postal spending has made an almost similar coup like the Internet today.
Between 1776 and 1800, the number of newspapers rose four times, and the authors of anonymous letters seriously damaged his authority.
Even then, Washington was dealing with anonymous trolls.
People under the pseudonyms of "juricola," "Valerius," "belizarius" and "portsius" wrote letters to newspapers that ridiculed Washington's decision.
According to historical documents collected by the online project "George Washington," his cabinet was sealed by petitions criticizing his position on the Treaty of Friendship, commerce and navigation.
But he didn't try to silence them.
Freedom of speech, dissent and speech lies at the very heart of our State.
And true leadership means agreement with this.
Ronan Rafferty looks forward to home amenities at Renaissance Club
The former European champion, Ronan Rafferty, looks forward to domestic amenities for the next three days, when the Renaissance club in east loane will host the twenty-fifth open Scottish golf tournament for older athletes.
A native of Northern Ireland, who was the leader in the "archerfield links" club, and moved towards the final round last year, has not lost the floor of ilsu, attached to the new place and serves as a representative of the tournament on behalf of the founder and director of the Club Jerry Sarvadi.

It's a great demonstration for this field."
An Englishman is looking forward to the first title of the Champion, despite the fact that for his 32-year-old career won in the European tournament, and in the European Challenge tour.
"It's really a special feeling," said the player from the Southport.
"I wasn't able to try again to win" Extremadura open, "because he was removed from the schedule a year after I won it.
To return to this corner of the world is magical.
It's a great place to play golf.
The memories of the past year are returning, and for me and my wife Cheron was a very special impression of winning last year.
It was really special time, and we will always remember it."
He returns to the battle on the native land of Gary Orr, who joined the European tournament for older athletes after he was 50 earlier this year.
This event will be his first appearance in the public in Scotland since the "Aberdeen Asset Management Scotland open" tournament in 2013.
"When you play at home, it's always more important," said resident of helensborough Orr.
"You want to speak well, but you feel this extra burden."
I was very pleased to play again, and I showed a good golf.
I am happy with how everything is going to happen."
On the field to this trio, the former winner of the tournament "masters" Ian wushnem and the champions of the mejorors for older athletes, Paul brokherst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark mcalty.
ORR and former captain Ryder Cup Sam torrans are two of the six Scots in the field; the rest are Andrew aldkorn, Stephen MacAlister, Bill longmüir and Ross Drummond.
Participation in the tournament is free of charge, and parking costs 5 pounds per hour if one person is in the car and 10 pounds if the person is two or more.
All incomes go to the British prostate cancer fund.
British roads learn to absorb harmful emissions
The kind of tunnels over the highways that are capable of absorbing carbon monoxide is already being tested on the UK's roads.
The Transport Agency of the country, according to the publication of Autocar, reported on the positive results of the tests of the 100-meter tunnel installed on one of the roads in the north of the country.
The tunnel is 6 metres high, built from the latest polymeric materials, which are capable of absorbing harmful substances contained in vehicle emissions.
However, the creation of a network of such tunnels is only part of the massive measures that the UK authorities intend to take to improve the atmosphere.
In addition to the tunnel network, the British plans to expand the network of charging stations for electric vehicles, implement a number of measures to reduce road traffic on the roads, expand the use of commercial transport on electric traction and modernize the fleet of heavy trucks.
According to official statistics, a quarter of all air pollution is on transport, and poor air quality is causing up to 40,000 premature deaths per year.
Mosgorcourt changed the punishment of a person with a disability of Mamaev to a fine
The mosgorcourt changed the punishment of the disabled person Anton Mamaev, sentenced to four and a half years of colony, to a fine of 200 thousand rubles.
TASS reports.
Previously, the Prosecutor's Office asked the Court to replace the term on conditional, explaining his request that Mamayeva's disease "prevents him from finding in prison conditions."
28-year-old Anton Mamaev was sentenced to four and a half years' imprisonment with a sentence of punishment in the general regime for the robbery, the victim of whom was the former Special Forces fighter.
On July 19, the Court released a man from custody at A visiting session in SIZO.
Poverty and death in the Indonesian "Golden earth"
Preparing for lunch, barrage of degei does not use the tiles.
It is not even a handful.
In his wooden house in Enarotali, the capital of panai district in the Indonesian province of Papua, a housewife usually simply places sweet potatoes, which is called "note," right in the hearth.
After half an hour, the stolen tuber will get and eat impatient, unwashed hands.
Degei sits on the ground floor - the furniture has no furniture - and it is here that she performs her work at home, such as the washing of clothes of the flour water from the nearby Bolta.
The Cleaner serves as a bucket in the room without a roof.
She was the youngest of four wives of her husband, and she was therefore not instructed to work in the field.
Polygamy is spread here.
Of course, it may be dangerous to work: many men from this village are unemployed, many drink, and there are soldiers.
"No one decides to walk in the village after five PM," she says.
This is a rare opportunity to look at the daily life in the highlands of Papua, the former Dutch colony, which was annexed to Indonesia in 1969 after a dubious referendum, when only 1,026 elders were forced to vote, having raised hands in front of the occupying forces.
The existing movement for independence from the Netherlands quickly turned its anger against the Government of Jakarta, which maintains strict control over the region, not allowing foreign journalists and human rights activists.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua, and the Independent State of Papua New Guinea occupied the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali - the city is as remote as abandoned; the road here includes a half-hour flight from Jayapura, the administrative centre of the province, in nabir, and then a five-hour shake on the car.
There is no public transport here.
The city with a population of about 19,000 people consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences; the roofs of corrugated steel have been painted in a wide variety of rusty colours.
There were few Indonesians, not to mention journalists, and almost none of the foreigners.
Before the arrival of Christian missionaries, Papuan Meye Pago worshiped God on behalf of UGA tamie.
There were other changes.
"We were not wearing this clothes," says degei, showing his bright, Woven Hand, a dark skirt, a dark skirt and a bright shirt.
"Before we were on the body only leaves."
Papua is the poorest province of Indonesia, 28% of its population lives below the poverty line, and the levels of child mortality and literacy among the worst in Asia.
But this is the Indonesian Gold Land.
The largest in the world and the most profitable gold mine, graberg, owned by the Phoenix McMoRan company, is just sixty miles from Paniai, a high mountain province of approximately New Jersey, where 153,000 people live.
Only in 2015, the company "Freeport" produced gold and copper at about $3.1 billion.
In addition, Papua can boast of forests, valued at $78 billion.
These wealth, however, lead to one misfortune for papasos, ensuring that the powerful armed forces of Indonesia retain their suffocating presence here.
According to the investigation of the New York Times in 2005, between 1998 and 2004, Freeport paid almost 20 million dollars to local troops and units, including up to $150,000 to one officer.
The demands of greater autonomy on the part of papaws threaten the existence of this golden vest and ruthless repression.
According to human rights activists, since 1969, the military forces of Indonesia have killed more than 500,000 papasos, and thousands have been raped, tortured and deprived of their liberty.
According to the Asian Human Rights Commission, the mass killings in the densely populated indigenous communities of Papua in the 1970s can be considered genocide.
Only last year, the Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful protesters in the region.
"We will lose everything," the report, published in 2016 by the Brisbane Diocese, contains evidence of atrocities committed in the previous year, such as execution without trial, torture - especially frequent reports, rape and electric shocks - and brutal repression of peaceful demonstrations.
"It is difficult to read the number of victims because the incidents take place every week," says Andreas Harsono, a research in Indonesia for Human Rights Watch.
Gaki has been delayed because the resources of Papua have attracted the influx of migrants from other parts of Indonesia.
The province's 3.5-police population consists of Christians, but demographic figures are changing as Muslim economic migrants arrive with densely populated Indonesian islands - Java, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Javanese," varungi," sells fried chicken and a mixture of vegetables "gadado Gado" supplied with peanut sauce.
Local residents try to compete.
"migrants have begun to sell chicken and vegetables in the traditional market, which is cheaper than the natives of Papua," explains abbet you, the 20-year-old panai, who moved to Jayapura, the province's administrative centre, because of its work.
"Because of this, the indigenous people of Papua, mama mama (women), have lost their marketing market."
The President of Indonesia, Joko Widodo, known as Jokowi, vowed to address inequality and violations of rights in Papua during his presidential campaign in 2014.
On his way to the presidential palace in Jakarta, the former Carpenter secured the support of 27 of the 29 districts of Papua, including panai.
But there has been little change in Papua, and locals feel betrayed.
"Our hearts are broken, because in 2014 we voted for jokov, expecting that he will fulfill our hopes of restoring justice," says you.
In fact, just two months after the October inauguration, jokov Paniai experienced a tragedy.
On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children was on the street and sang Christmas anthem AT THE KOSTRA in Enarotali, when two Indonesian soldiers on a motorcycle were pulled out of the dark.
The frightened children told them that they should be included in the headlamps.
As reported by the local pastor javat Tebay, one of the soldiers was offended on their tone and returned to four soldiers after a while.
According to the victims and witnesses, the soldiers who were drunk were driven for their children and beaten with rifle butts.
Then one of the soldiers shot in a group of children.
One child, aged 16, yulianus ayimo, was so badly beaten, which fell into a coma.
A couple of hours later, someone hung near the government building of the Electoral Commission, and the situation worsened the next day.
About a thousand Papuan men, women and children gathered at the football field in front of the local police station and the military command centre to demand justice.
They brought with them ritual hunting Luke and performed Vita, the dance of the Papuan tribe of Meye Pago: run by the circles and portrayed a bird singing.
Some protesters began throwing stones at the police station and military base.
When the situation was settled, the internal radio soldiers were given an order: "If the crowd will have resistance more than three times, shoot them," he said in an official document, who saw the correspondent of the magazine "Time," but which was not published in the local media.
The Pentecostal heimas Kayama, the head of the Khim Koto region in Enarotali, felt the approach of the danger and called for calm, asking the crowd to disperse the houses.
No one wanted him to listen.
"When I turned back, I was suddenly hit by the bullet," he told the magazine "Time," standing on the porch of his brightly painted wooden house.
Kayama still does not know who shot, but says that the bullet was flown from the side of the assembled soldiers.
"There was a crowd, there were many shots," he adds.
In the local resident of alfius yova, three times, as his cousin, who witnessed the shooting, was hit three times.
"I ran to him and examined his body to make sure that he was," said the magazine "Time" Yohannes, who, like many Indonesians, uses only one name.
"I saw him dead... I kissed him."
General jotje Mende, Chief Inspector of the Papua police, told reporters that his officers were only "defending" his base because she was attacked.
"We must defend ourselves when people threaten us to kill," stated in 2015 a police spokesman for the Papua New commissioner, Pujo susiliyo.
"It's a matter of life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and much more injured.
The news about the killings came to Jakarta only the next day.
After three weeks, jocovi spoke In jayapur in a dualistic speech, expressing condolences to the families of the victims and vowed to address the issue of historical abuse of power in Papua.
"I want this situation to be resolved immediately so that it will never again be repeated in the future," he said.
In October 2016, the Minister for Security, Wiranto, said that he would establish a non-judicial Organization to put an end to the historical violations of human rights.
But almost immediately they went away.
"Most of the violations occurred long ago.
Some of them took place in the nineties or at the beginning of the zero.
The matter is that we certainly want to address these violations, but there are procedures that need to be passed," he said.
Viranto then declined his words, referring to the Time magazine on June 5 in Jakarta, and said he did not plan to establish an organization to deal with complaints in Papua.
Instead, he said: "Everything will be decided through the court."
Viranto, whom the United Nations accused of "crimes against humanity" in connection with the death of more than 1,000 people during a bloody vote for the independence of East Timor in 1999, said that 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua had already been resolved, including the incident in Paniai.
The families of the victims from Paniai have met with such statements with grim mistrust.
"Over the past three years, I have been questioned four times, but there were no absolutely any changes," says Yohannes.
"I'm tired."
He says that years later still live in fear.
"I'm scared," he says.
"I am afraid that I will be arrested by the military, I fear that I will be shot."
His brother Jacobus also expressed the opinion that residents of Paniai are afraid to discuss the incident.
He said he was beaten by the military after he helped bury four victims.
"After we buried the bodies, the military came to me," he says.
The shooting did not stop.
On Tuesday, the Indonesian police shot at villagers in a neighbouring neighbourhood of deiyai district.
During a clash between villagers and the manager of the construction company, who refused to help the man who was unconscious to the hospital, one person died and 17 others were injured, including children.
A man, the 20-year-old ravianus Dove, who drowned during the fish caught in the nearby river, died on the way to the hospital.
The angry villagers protested in front of the construction site belonging to the company.
According to the police, the villagers threw stones at officers who responded with warning shots.
But local residents argue that the mobile brigade (Indonesian special forces) has begun to shoot on the crowd and killed one person.
"We were in such a panic, we fear retaliation," said the magazine "time" of the 20-nine-year-old Badia, who lives near the hospital and saw how the wounded were rushed.
"I hid at home two days."
The deiyai Parliament demanded that the officers involved in the incident called for a response, and the Mobile Police Brigade withdrew from the region.
Paniyai has always been a sick place for the Indonesian Government.
The lack of meaningful development is causing discontent with the Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal, spread across the entire territory of the Green central highlands of Papua.
Many have joined the Movement for Free Papua (OPM), the rebel army, who claims to protect the rights of papasov because of sporadic attacks and raids on Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the top leaders of OPM come from Paniai, including tadous yoga and Daniel yudas Koya.
As a retaliatory measure in recent years, thousands of people have been arrested and arbitrarily detained by the military under the pretext of "defending national independence."
Some have never returned.
Among the population of Papua panai is "a sad, forgotten place."
Poverty increases discontent.
A small portion of rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive for locals.
Bread is the same exactly as it is.
People are growing here than eating: mostly, a note, as well as some fruits and leafy vegetables.
Agriculture is the work of women, each of which can take care of five years of sweet potatoes.
Usually they retain a large portion of the crop for the family, and the rest is sold on the local market.
Ten tubers of the note are worth only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Over time, the economic inequality between the indigenous Papuan and new migrants, which has arrived in large amounts since the introduction of new flights to the airport of nabir, has increased.
Few existing vacancies are usually delivered to more educated and wealthy migrants.
Papasov rarely has enough money or necessary skills to conduct their own competitive business.
"Young people don't want to stay in the village... because there is no work or money," says John Gobi, Chairman of the panai Tribal Council.
Isolation keeps Papua away from the views of the rest of the world.
Moreover, restrictions on the work of the international media remain tough.
Earlier this year, French journalists Frank esjudy and Basile lonshan were deported from Papua for "lack of consistency with the relevant organisations" despite the fact that they have given rare permission to conduct video.
According to Felipe kine, the Deputy Director for Asia, Human Rights Watch, the promises made during the election campaign of jokovi, to lift restrictions on the work of the media in order to promote transparency and development, have not been implemented.
"Now foreign journalists trying to report from the rebel eastern Indonesian provinces, Papua and West Papua are facing new dangers: denials of visas and blacklist," he said in a statement.
The lack of media attention means that international pressure on the Government of Indonesia is mostly limited to the immediate neighbours of Papua.
In March, six Pacific States - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands - requested the UN Human Rights Council to investigate "diverse and widespread violations" in Papua, including the shooting in panai.
The same countries have supported OPM in the past.
The spokesman for the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, arramanata Nasir, has turned away from the Group's statement, telling journalists in Jakarta that "in Indonesia there is still a democratic system and there is a free press, so it would be difficult to hide evidence of human rights violations."
Local residents want more foreign Governments to pay attention to the situation.
When the official delegation from the Netherlands, led by the Netherlands Ambassador for Human Rights, kiysom van Baar, visited Jayapura on May 4, the local residents violated silence, MOL: "We want freedom," according to the source, who also attended the meeting, but wished to remain anonymous.
In Indonesia, new presidential elections will be held in 2019, but papasians say it is unlikely to vote again for jokov.
"jokoi is a person with good intentions, but he is surrounded by people involved in the shooting in Paniai," says Gobi, President of the Council of the tribe.
He wants jokov to know that the residents of Paniai, in addition to being living in the shadow of the threat from the army, are mired in poverty, and education and health are in a state of pity.
Gobay says the residents of Paniai, like other papasans, consider their voice to be given for jokov, a duty he must pay.
"They don't need money, they just want justice," he says.
Despite threats and intimidation, the families of the victims of the shooting in Paniai have carried out the last symbolic act of disobedience: the body of one of the victims on the ground is directly opposite the police and the military section.
Knowing that justice is likely to never triumph, they will at least not allow the guilty to forget their crimes.
"killed a member of our family," says Jacobus, not raising the head.
"What else did we have to do?"
The fire for the second time covers the Dubai skyscraper "Torch"
The fire covered one of the world's highest residential skyscrapers in Dubai on Friday, forcing hundreds of residents to leave the seven-nine-storey building in 337 metres out.
This is already a second fire, which has been pushed down by an undetermined building, which is called "Torch" in two years.
The building was evacuated, no casualties were reported, and there were no operational news about the cause of the fire.
"We slept and woke up from the fire alarm and the cries of people.
We ran down the stairs, and we took about ten minutes to descend from the fiftieth floor," said Reuters, a resident of neboskröb, called George.
According to the Department of Civil Defense of the city of Dubai, the firefighters have extinguished the fire at around 4:00 local time (00:00 GMT) and cooled the building.
The Government reported that it was working to provide asylum to the victims.
The accident may return to the agenda the safety of materials used in the exterior of high-rise buildings around the world.
In the course of an investigation by the "Torch" administration, after the fire there, in 2015, it turned out that the most affected was the damage - the external panels used for decoration and isolation.
In the United Kingdom, the police said that the isolation system and the plate-tower Of The grenfell-tower building in London could accelerate the spread of the fire there in June, which resulted in the death of about 80 people.

In Afghanistan, five military personnel died in the car explosion
At least five soldiers died in the bombing in the Afghan province of Helmand, RIA Novosti reports.
According to the police, a car bomb exploded on the evening of the evening next to the military checkpoint in the county of girišk.
Twenty dead are known.
On Friday morning, a new PC took place in giriška.
Armed criminals attacked the currency exchange point.
The shooting between the assailants and the security forces is ongoing.
Diver filmed a video attack on his camera
Diver and researcher Greg SKAL (Greg SKAL) captured the video of the shark, who attempted to assassinate his camera GoPro.
The video has released a branch of the American agency for marine fisheries in Massachusetts, a staff member of which is a scooter.
The incident took place on August 2 off the coast of the Cape code in the north-east of the USA, says necn portal.
A man during the underwater navigation attempted to remove the sharks to the camera, which was held on a special stick.
A man, an animal with a length of more than three metres, sailed to him.
The sharks took the camera, and did not try to attack the scientist.
Scomal explained that the predator had done so in order to determine whether gajet was eaten.
The researcher added that the sharks could easily destroy the instrument.
He also noted that such behavior of the marine animal turned out to be for scientists in novinka.
The reason for the mass drama in the Ural military centre
A working group of senior officers of the Central Military Region arrived in the Elan training centre, where a mass fight took place, to investigate the circumstances of the incident.
Some details of this side are already known.
According to the reports of the "Vkontakte," which appeared on the VKontakte page, the contractors of the Ural military unit No. 31612 were cruelly imitated due to an unordered bed.
Everything began with the fact that the private name of Sayan demonstratively ignored the order of the officer to correct the tormented sheets.
Soldiers from the sixth company were taken to the side of the officer.
Sayan supported the first company.
In half an hour, 140 young guys were defeated in the barracks of the bed and Rakovina, smashed glass.
More than 10 people were injured in the mass drama.
The CVO denied the information about the knife.
The study showed that at least one fifth of passengers in the United States are carrying prohibited items into the plane.
The study showed that more than 20 per cent of the air passengers were knowingly or accidentally injured in the luggage on board the plane through the inspection points of the U.S. Transport Security Administration, prohibited items, including at least 6 per cent boarded to the plane, with an inspection of prohibited knives or other sharp objects.
Almost 1 per cent reported that they were later discovered that they were accidentally carrying firearms, ammunition or explosives.
A study conducted by Stratos jet charters, Inc. and covering more than 1,000 people, also showed that young passengers are more likely to violate the rules.
Of the respondents who admitted that they were deliberately trying to fly with something that was banned by the ATB, 19.7 percent were millenals compared to less than 15 percent of the members of the Generation X.
Consciously past the staff of ATB are most likely to wear food and water.
More than 3 per cent admitted that it had been specifically carried out through inspections of sensitive subjects, while 2.2 per cent of female respondents and 3.7 per cent of male respondents admitted that they had knowingly carried out prohibited drugs.
The company stated that it had studied passengers throughout the country to find out how many of them had been involved in smuggling through inspections at airports, and how much it did.
It is quite expected that most often, consciously or unconsciously, the smuggling is carried out through the inspection of those who fly the most.
According to the company, the rules of the ATB are quite complex and complicated.
People often do not know exactly what liquids they can carry and in what quantity.
It is not surprising, therefore, that most of what is selected by the ATB is banned liquids.
Some time ago, people thought that the ATB could be considered prohibited by the book.
Liquids are allowed on domestic flights, but not on international ones.
Head EPA prüitt renounces the intention to postpone the implementation of Obama's Emission Reduction rules
The following day, after the action of 15 States, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency reversed its decision to postpone the implementation of the rules adopted under Obama to reduce the emissions of air pollutants and resulting in the formation of smog.
Prüitt explained his decision that his agency is now more than in previous administrations, listening to the needs of the environmental regulators of individual States.
He did not mention the lawsuit against his previous position, filed with the Federal Court of Appeal.
The dispute unfolded around the date on October 1, to which the States should ensure that the 2015 standards for ozone at the Earth level are in line with the 2015 standards.
In June, prüitt announced that it would report them to one year in order to give their agency more time to study the plan and avoid "the incompatibility of local solutions or obstacles to economic growth."
Prüitt, who, before being appointed by the President of Trump for his current position, was the Attorney General of the State of Oklahoma, has long been known as a consistent opponent of the toughening of environmental norms.
After moving to Washington, prüitt repeatedly blocked or delayed the introduction of norms that were opposed by the chemical or gas oil industry.
The unexpected change in the course on Wednesday is another legal defeat of the course of the course to return to the previous norms.
Last month, the Federal Court of Appeal in Washington ruled that the head of the EPA exceeded its powers by trying to delay the implementation of the Obama administration's rule requiring oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce the methane leaks.
In a statement issued on Wednesday evening, Pruitt suggested that, in a sharp change in the course on ozone standards, he simply fulfilled the EPA's duty to cooperate with the States in the integrated process of timely implementation of the new standards.
"In previous EPA administrations, it was often not possible to meet the scheduled deadline, after this was awaiting claims from groups of activists and others, and discussed the time frame in the course of the settlement," said prüitt, who filed more than a dozen claims against EPA at his previous post.
"We don't believe in regulation through trials, and we treat the deadlines seriously.
We also take seriously our Charter and the power he gives us."
However, the EPA statement says that prüitt can, at some point, again use its "power to delay and other data of the law," to ensure that the Rules "jcyjdfys on a clear course and on all available information."
Republicans in Congress insist on a wider revision of the rules on ozone.
The bill, approved by the House of Representatives last month, seeks to delay the implementation of the 2015 rules for at least eight years.
The Senate has not yet voted on this issue.
The Attorney General of New York, Eric Schneider, who led a coalition of the States that filed a lawsuit against EPA this week, said the Group intends to continue legal pressure.
"The changes in the EPA's course - after our claims - are an important victory in the fight for health and safety of 6.7 million New York and more than 115 million Americans who directly influence their cities," said schnederman.
New York City joined California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington, as well as the District of Columbia.
Ozone at the Earth level occurs when conventional pollutants from machinery, power plants, refineries and chemical plants and other sources are entering the atmosphere in reaction with sunlight.
The resulting could cause serious breathing problems with sensitive people, leading to thousands of premature deaths per year.
Health advocates and environmentalists welcomed the unexpected change of the prüitta course.
"It is sad to think about how much pressure it took to achieve this perfectly logical step from a person who is tasked to protect the air we breathe," said Lori Anne bird of the Centre for Biological Diversity.
"We must continue to resist the ideological campaign of the Trump administration and protect those who pollute the air and their special interests."
The IAAF Congress extended the suspension of the All-Russian Athletics Federation
Congress of the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) voted for the extension of the suspension of the All-Russian Athletics Federation (wfl).
Thus, the Congress supported the IAAF Council for the restoration of vfla, which issued a report on Monday, which recommended the suspension of the suspension.
For the extension of the suspension, 166 people voted, against 21, TASS reports.
The report of the Council of IAAF stated that wfl had made significant progress towards meeting the conditions set by the Council for the restoration of membership, but those conditions had not yet been fully implemented.
Due to the disqualification of wfl at the World Championships in London, Russian athletes were forced to act under a neutral flag.
The team included 19 people admitted to the IAAF Championship.
Wfl was subjected to indefinite disqualification from IAAF in 2015.
At that time, the report of the independent expert of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), Dick Powell, was published, describing the numerous violations of the WADA rules committed by Russian officials and athletes.
For more information on the latest report of the IAAF Council, read in the "Kommersant" the "IAAF extended sanctions against VfL."
Obese defeat
As part of the 3 tour of the Russian football championship among the teams of the PFL, the new Moscow "Chemist" conducted a visiting match against the "Kaluga" FC FC.
Just over 10 days ago, the opponents played among themselves in the Russian Cup, but this time the picture of the game was completely different.
"Chemist" didn't give way to the opponent, but a second relaxation at the end of the match led to a mansion and fiasco.
After the recent defeat from kalujan with the score 0:3, many have predicted a slight victory by the owners.
However, since the beginning of the meeting, the new Moscow people were forced to reckon with themselves and acted on defence, but from the position of force.
In the 1st half of the kalusian town, there was more building and had an advantage in the possession of the ball.
Another very qualitative match was held by Aleksei sirotin, who had several times affected the dangerous blows and his actions gave the partners confidence.
Unfortunately, in the "Chemist" attack, there was no effort and luck to put an end to the defence of "kalugi" and to score the first goal at the exit.
After the break, the game began to run on the oncoming course.
The new Moscow residents were more active in the attack.
The alarming calls for our team were the mistakes in the defence, which allowed the kalujans to create a series of sharp moments.
Ten minutes before the end of the Meeting," Chemist "intercepted the territorial advantage and carried out several dangerous attacks.
But the experience of kalujan played a role - they were more literate and cold-blooded by the ending, waiting for the moment to take the gate.
After a dangerous attack, the "Chemist" moved the ball to the corner, which the owner of the field without resistance moved to the gate.
The author of the Gola became Yuri Dubrovnik.
In the reporting meeting," Chemist "showed a bad game, but suffered a bad defeat.
Our team is waiting for another departure - On August 11, at 19 o'clock in Moscow at the stadium "torpedo" named after Eduard Streltsov, The novomoskovtsy will get off with the favorite group "center" of FC Ararat, which is composed of Roman Pavlyuchenko, Marat Izmailov, Igor Lebedev, Aleksei Reko.
Come to support "Chemist!"
The place and time of the Meeting of the new Moscow people - 6.30 p.m. near the store "Magnolia" (East, D.2, korp.
Composition of the "Chemist": sirotin, Manukhin (K), Romaschenko, shaunov, homotov, Goya (Oreshkin), dudago, ryzhhov, holy, Belyanin (adeevtsev), andreychenko (lygin)

According to published telephone conversations, Trump pressed Mexico to pay the wall on the border
The Washington Post newspaper has published telephone conversations between US President Donald Trump and the leaders of Mexico and Australia.
On January 27, during a telephone conversation with the President of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto, Trump insisted that he stop publicly saying that he would not pay for the planned wall on the border.
The President of the United States ran him for publicly speaking against the wall and, according to the leaked information, told him: "You cannot talk to the press."
Trump began his campaign with promise to build a wall along the southern border of the US and vowed to force Mexico to pay for the project.
In an published transcript of his first telephone conversation with the Australian Prime Minister, Malcolm ternbull also found a hot rebranding.
Trump said ternbulu that the Agreement, according to which the US should accept refugees travelling to Australia," ridiculous," and "tupoe," and insisted that, due to an agreement concluded by the Obama administration, he would look like an idiot, as it intended to stop the resettlement of refugees in the US.
Trump has completed the conversation, telling Turnbull that "it was the most unpleasant conversation over the whole day."

Russian influence on American elections will be studied by a large jury
The Special Prosecutor for Russia, Robert Müller, convened a grand jury in Washington, which will study Russia's influence on the election of the US president in 2016, the Wall Street Journal and Reuters agency reports.
A large jury is a group of ordinary citizens who collect evidence of potential criminal offences and have the right to question witnesses under oath.
The collected materials will examine the special prosecutor and decide whether they are sufficient to bring charges.
The convening of a grand jury gives Muller additional powers to collect testimony.
One of the topics of the investigation of the jury, which started working a few weeks ago, will be the details of the Meeting of the son at that time, Donald Trump, with the Russian lawyer Natalia veselnice.
To check the details of this meeting, held in June 2016, the Muller himself promised.
They have already been examined by the FBI.

Of course, in Mexico there is no launch site or launch vehicle.
But there is a space agency established in 2010 and the desire to develop its own space programme.
And the installation of Busta Yuri Gagarin is a tribute to the first person who has visited space.
Unlike the monuments of the Soviet period, which are demolished in some countries, the monuments of Gagarin, on the other hand, are "shaming on the planet."
In 2012, the monument was erected in American Houston near the former NASA headquarters.
In London, a monument on the territory of the Royal Observatory was established in honor of the 50th anniversary of the first flight into space.
There is a monument to Gagarin in Germany in Erfurt, where our cosmonaut visited 1963.
The monument in Karlovy Vary (Czech Republic) avoided demolition in 1992 thanks to protests from the public and was moved from the city centre to the area before the local airport.
In the year of the 70th anniversary of Gagarin, the monument to Yuri Gagarin appeared in Riga.
So, the name and name of the first cosmonaut in Latvia, and it looks like if he was 70 years old.
The murder of Mors Ford: activists will win the Lynch courts on stage to call for justice
"Ford mercury," 1948, drove past the audience in the village of Monroe in the State of Georgia, and with the river remembers the small bridge of Morse Ford.
When a car in which there were four Black passengers and a white driver came to the bridge, a group of white men with rifles blocked her way.
The chief - a middle-aged man in a suit in a thin strip - was delayed by a cigar and looked through the windscreen.
Sitting inside trembled from fear.
"We need this nigger, Roger!" the man shouted.
"get him out of the car!"
The propellants broke the silence when the young black man was dragged out of the front seat.
Fortunately, this terrible scene, which was played on July 22, is just a stage.
But when Rogers were hired at the neck, almost all the audience and the truth were breathing.
Since 2005, activists are returning to the Mors Ford bridge to replay the night, when in 1946, the kucklkclusters lynched two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and may Murray dorsi.
No one was convicted of these murders.
"It is amazing that, for all of these years, no person has been arrested - although we see them next to them; although we know who they are," says Tyron Brooks, who helped organize the production.
"It's a spot on our history and it's a stone on our souls."
The 71-year-old Brooks is a former member of the Congress of Georgia, who is fighting for human rights.
For him, the performance is a drama call for action and an annual reminder to the residents of Monroe that injustice has never been corrected.
"We want to investigate, we want to finish, we want healing, we want reconciliation, but we must first achieve justice," he says.
"We cannot move to healing and reconciliation until justice is achieved."
The Coroner covers a simple body of one of the victims of lynching from Mors Ford on July 27, 1946.
According to the FBI's BBC News, more than 50 people in Monroe and neighbouring counties were suspected of involvement in lynching.
But no one has been charged.
Although the suspects have remained at large for decades, human rights activists say, the city's STS have always been perfectly aware of the two associated vigilante motives: politics and sex.
In April 1946, the ruling of the Supreme Court for the first time allowed black citizens to vote for prime ones, which were due to take place in the summer.
Approximately during the same election, according to FBI reports, the black ispolter Roger Malcolm struck a knife in a fight with Barnett Hester, white landowner, apparently because of a woman.
Brooks said that, according to rumours in the city, Hester slept with his wife Malcolm Dorothy, and that the child she had to give birth was not from her husband.
According to the FBI, on July 25, 1946, la Harrison, a large white land owner, paid 600 dollars of bail to call Malcolm from prison.
He went to jail together with Dorothy and their cousins may Murray and George dorsi.
But when they went from prison and drove to the Mors Ford Bridge, the mob of The lynchers surrounded the car.
"It turns out that he organized and commanded the murder of Harrison," This conclusion is being done in one of the FBI's reports.
"It is also clear that there has been collusion between State and City law enforcement agencies, which not only took part in the killings, but also destroyed evidence and hid the identity of witnesses."
Brooks calls it shorter.
"It was an attempt on voting rights," he says.
"They all killed to send a signal to black in the city: If you register and vote, you will be the same."
For almost a decade, Cassandra green is leading an annual performance, reproducing the lynching at The Mors Ford bridge.
Her performance is looked at, he captures the spectator and tells about the deep racism, which, as many would like to say, is no longer in America.
It is difficult to watch and even harder to return, but green believes that this is the most important thing.
"We don't want to talk about the Courts of lynch because they show us our own exercise," she says.
"But I can't build relations with you if you don't hear me or hear what I've experienced."
The rehearsal of the performance of this year began in June, and on the first day almost 30 actors - a dozen white dozen, the rest of the Black - gathered in the room and listened to the polished pieces of play during the years.
Wade Marbo was a director with green.
He has played a few years as the chief Member of the clan, but says the role has never become easier.
"I think I was caught up because it's not the person I'm," says Marbo.
"But I think it is very important to remember this story because we don't want to return at that time."
In the premises of the actors darrius Bradshaw and Nick split, who play Roger Malcolm and Barnett Hester, repeat their roles.
The spectal begins with the fact that a Malcolm is angry that Hester sleeps with his wife Dorothy, shouting and pushes him.
"I said, nigga, killed from my home!"
There is a split in the answer.
A blow is struck.
And at the same time, all (at least all black actors) are razed to hoop.
Green is laughing at all.
"What is it," asks ascos.
He is worried and embarrassed.
Я переигрываю?
"No," says Green through laughter.
"I just don't think white then said 'nigga'. '
"Yes," one of the Black performers is laughing.
"You have to carry a solid 'R'." '
And so the energy in the room is changing: discomfort is replaced by a sense of partnership.
Everyone must do everything right, not only for the sake of the play, but also for the memory of the four people killed.
The scene starts first.
This time, when the split speaks to the letter "H," It turns out to be clear and sharp.
No one is laughing.
The performance ends cruelly and quickly.
Shouting, shots, and then silence.
A woman in black dress is above the bodies of actors and performs a Sad Song of Billy holiday "Strange Fruit."
Her voice is interrupted through the Word.
In hundreds of yards from her, half a hundred spectators will get out of the eye with tears and sweat.
Among the spectators, almost equal numbers of black and white.
One pair came from Ithaca, New York, to see the vision; many live quite near.
They almost eight hours were patient with Georgia's Hard dusts, while Brooks were driving them in the pilgrimage to Malcolm and dorsi.
Until that time, the murder remained only a story, but now, when they stand at the same place where people are lynched, it seems that their ghosts are vital in the air.
When the last note of the song is struck, green invites people to come closer and look at the bodies.
The children are bending to their heads, they touch the beauty of the blood, and the fixed bodies and the shroud of each other.
"They are not really dead," a small boy, as if it's to be reminded of himself.
After a few minutes, green thanks the audience, and suddenly everything ends.
The actors drop the rope from the neck and get tears.
Bradshaw takes over Marbo, a man in a suit, who played the main kucklklanovac.
Nick split into two other actors and suddenly, crying, falling into their embrace: the emotional burden of the performance finally hit him.
"Everything is in order," says one of the women.
"We know that your heart is good.
You have had reasons for this."
Later, the audience will sit together with the actors.
At one table, the White couple from Atlanta is busy discussing a performance with a black couple, with which they have just met.
Denise duplinski has difficulty looking for words to describe what she feels after the performance.
"It's hard to listen to these awful, horrible words, and actions... people who look like you, and who do it because they look like you," she says.
"After that, I think the lynching is still happening," she adds, "It's just now called the police."
In another corner of the room, the general attention was paid by Tyron Brooks, who remembers his work as a human rights defender.
He said he had already begun to plan the next year's submission.
"It is encouraging us, because it does not only describe the horror of what we have experienced, but also teaches us," he says.
"Because if you don't get out of this lesson, it can happen again.
Those who do not study their history, who do not know their history, are destined to repeat it."
The Court fined Navalny for violations on the "campaign Saturday"

Leonid Volkov and his lawyers Ivan Zhdanov and Aleksandr pomazuev applied for the termination of administrative proceedings due to the absence of the corpus delicti and pointed out that the police officers allowed certain promares in the drafting of the Protocol.
At the "campaign Saturday," Volkov was not detained, but he received an summons to report him to the police station to tell about an event conducted with his active participation.
The same summons was received by the Navalny and another associate of the opposition, Nikolai lyaskin.

The Environmental Protection Agency, after legal action, abolishes the decision to postpone the adoption of the Law on Air Pollution
The American Environmental Protection Agency reversed the decision to postpone the adoption of the Obama era law, according to which States should limit the air pollution, a day after 15 States sued the Agency because of this step.
On the evening of Wednesday, the Environmental Protection Agency announced its decision to implement the so-called "ozone measurements - 2015," stressing that this step shows the Agency's willingness to cooperate with the States.
"We believe in a dialogue with our partners in the states and responsiveness to them," the head of the Environmental Protection Agency Scott prüitt said in a statement.
In June, prüitt announced the intention of the Environmental Protection Agency to postpone the measurements of ozone in which existing air pollution is measured in different parts of the country to determine where it needs to be reduced to meet stricter standards of air cleanliness, for one year, until October 2018.
On Tuesday, a group of 15 States, mostly democratic, together with the Federal District of Colombia, filed a lawsuit alleging that this intention is illegal.
President Donald Trump's administration is trying to roll back a wide range of environmental protection orders imposed by the previous President Barack Obama, as part of a broader programme aimed at Trump's brilliant economic growth.
But actions in this direction have caused resistance from democratic and environmental organizations, concerned about the potential impact of large emissions on public health.
On the Agency's Environmental Protection Agency's website, it is written that the use for breathing air containing ozone," may impair the function of light and strengthen respiratory symptoms," for example, asthma.

They occupied separate rooms in the office space of the ESPN canal in Los Angeles, while Garcia, an undefeated champion of the World Boxing Council, did not go along the corridor to greet Lomachenko, the World Boxing Organization Champion in the second half weight.
After the unanimous victory of Garcia over the former world champion in four weight categories, Eric Broner on Saturday on the "Showtime" channel, both boxers are among the best boxers, regardless of weight categories.

Good luck to you."

New results of tests to assess the age of asylum seekers in Sweden have been published
The latest results of the tests of asylum seekers in Sweden, which have been subjected to a new method of medical evaluation of the age, show that more than 80 percent of tested persons have been evaluated as persons over the age of 18, but not all trust the accuracy of these results.
The Swedish National Forensic Medicine Agency (rättsmedicinalverket) has begun to conduct tests earlier this year.
They were designed to make an assessment of age in the asylum process more accurate after the Swedish migration agency (Migrationsverket) criticized the fact that it was unable to determine the real age of some refugees who claimed to be a minor.
At the moment, Migrationsverket rule 6,880 cases for testing, and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now published the results of 2,481 tests between mid-March and July 31, 2017.
Eighty per cent (2002) were evaluated as people 18 years or older, and in another 25 cases the Agency of forensic medicine made an assessment that the test is "likely to be 18 years or older."
In the case of 432 cases, the opinion stated that the person "is likely to be less than 18."
Tests are conducted only in cases where the age of a person is questionable.
According to Johan Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency, the results correspond to the results in the past months.
"We don't see a big difference with statistics in the past months, the numbers are quite appropriate," he said, "the local."
The high percentage of cases for which people have been assessed as having reached the age of 18 do not necessarily indicate that asylum seekers have lied about their age.
In May, the Agency published the results of 581 tests and reported that 442 cases are "likely to be the age of 18 years or more."
However, having considered 581 published results, the "Svenska Dagbladet" newspaper found that in 243 cases, a person had openly stated that 18 had been executed this year.
The method of conducting a medical assessment of the age, which is to make the X-ray of the teeth of the wisdom and the tomography of the knee joint and to give them to the analysis of dantists and radiologists, also caused criticism in some instances.
One of the sceptics is an endocrinologist from the Carolyn Institute Claude Marcus, a part of whose work is an assessment of the biological maturity of people to determine whether they have passed through puberty earlier or later.
"I have reason to think about it, and I don't think it is necessary to use the means of measurement that are used now.
The biological age is therefore very uncertain.
If we cannot define it with certainty, we should not pretend that we can," he said, "metro."
However, göranssen from the Forensic Medicine Agency spoke in favour of the accuracy of tests: "In general, it can be said that the risk is wrong to accept a child for an adult.
With the greatest risk we are facing when the person will soon be 18, in this case it is about 10 percent."
I think if you run for the post of President
During a working trip to Buryatia, Vladimir Putin announced that he was ready to think whether he would run for the post of President of Russia in the elections in 2018, Interfax reports.

During a videoconference dedicated to the liquidation of the fire in Buryatia and the Irkutsk Region, the interlocutor turned to Putin with the words: "Vladimir Vladimirovich, we have a request: when the next election of the President, we all ask you to run again for this post."
"Well, I think, thank you," said the President.
On July 28, Press Secretary of the Russian president Dmitry Peskov commented on the statements made by some media that Vladimir Putin's election headquarters will be headed by the head of the administration of the President of the Russian Federation Anton Vaino.
Peskov called these assumptions "nothing based, hypothetical, hypothetical."
"So far there is no headquarters, before the establishment of the headquarters, before the election campaign," said Peskov.
"So far this is not on the agenda," Peskov said.

Meanwhile, the National Committee of the Republican party on Thursday night issued a statement that "the transition of the Governor of Jastis to the other party is another blow to the Democratic Party, which is more difficult than working to make our country again great."
"Given the only 15 governors and control over the smallest number of state legislatures in history, the statement by the Governor of Jastis is just another rejection of the party, which does not have leaders from the top down and cannot find a positive, unifying message," said CBS News representative of the National Committee of the Republican Party Ronna McDaniel.

Cou praised Russia's sincere apology in connection with the doping scandal
The international specialist in athletics, Sebastián cou on Thursday, praised what he described as a sincere apology from Russia in connection with the doping scandal, but repeated that it was not right now to allow the country to participate in sports competitions again.
The Russian representative of the Athletics Federation, Dmitry shishchtin, announced at the Congress of the International Association of Athletics Federations, which was held on the eve of the World Championships in Athletics, that the removal of his country from sports competitions was just and that he is determined to fight doping.
He apologized to "all athletes, who were stolen gold and silver medals in the competition."
Despite his comments, the Congress of the International Association of Athletics Federations voted for the continuation of the suspension imposed in November 2015 after the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) published a report on the evidence of the use of doping, funded by the State.
"I showed that today's response, today's report was very sincere," said the President of the International Association of Athletics Federations of the International Association of Athletics Federations.
"The whole Council and Congress liked... that the Russian Federation itself admits that it was very hot times and is now doing everything possible to take care of the Federation's restructuring."
Cou said he also "liked" that Russia accepted the criteria for its recovery.
"I think it was a very constructive day and that we are moving forward, but Congress supports the recommendations of the Special Commission, according to which it is not time to restore Russia to rights," said Kou.
"In the next few months, we must do everything to resolve this situation.
Our leading principle was our desire to separate clean athletes from the tainted system," he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes, corresponding to the strict criteria of the International Association of Athletics Federations, will be under the neutral flag to participate in the World Championships in Athletics, which will begin on Friday in London.
The head of the Special Commission of the International Association of Athletics Federations, Rudy Andersen, said on Monday that a number of requirements have yet to be fulfilled for the restoration of Russia.
As he said in London after a report made at the Council of the International Association of Athletics Federations, the drug testing is still not being conducted in sufficient volume, and the suspended coaches are still working quietly.
The Court arrested a Ukrainian journalist suspected of treason
Detained by the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU), journalist Vasily Muravitsky has been arrested for two months, reports the SBU.
An employee of the Internet magazine "Zhitomir" is suspected of treason by posting his publications on Russian websites and infringing on the territorial integrity of Ukraine.
At the same time, Russia does not support the measures of the Ukrainian authorities against a journalist, considering this "barbaric policy" against the media.
Two years after the peak of the migration crisis in Europe, Italy decided on a limited military operation in the Mediterranean Sea.
A patrol ship "Commander borsini" entered the territorial waters of Libya to stop the influx of illegal migrants along with the country's Navy.
The decision to start the operation was adopted by the Italian Parliament on Wednesday.
Rome has agreed to it with the internationally recognized Government of Libya, which, however, does not control most of the country's territory.
The opposing cabinet and the Libyan parliament based in Tobruk accused Italy of violating Libya's sovereignty.
And the Commander of the Libyan National Army, feldmarshal Haftar, gave his subordinate order to oppose Italian ships.
In Rome, however, they stated that they do not believe these threats and intend to send another military vessel to Libyan territorial waters.
The situation was discussed last week in the negotiations of the Italian Prime Minister Paolo jentiloi and the head of the recognized Europe of the Libyan cabinet, Faiza Saraj.
The Italian authorities went to the establishment of a maritime mission to combat illegal migration after the publication of statistics on the number of illegal migrants arriving in Libya in July: 95,000 people since the beginning of the year.
The Government stated that resources for receiving migrants have been exhausted.

How the financial rules of football will affect the move of nemar to Paris
Rules aimed at preventing unlimited spending on the part of European football clubs will not prevent the world record from the Spanish "Barcelona" to the French "PARI Saint-Germain."
Whatever the consequences may come along the chain, for "PARI Saint-Germain" by UEFA, a steering body controlling European football, in whose power it is forbidden to participate in the prestigious "Champions League" tournament.
From the rules of the financial "fair-pass" introduced by UEFA in 2011, it follows that "PSG" will eventually have to show that the transfer of nemar was funded without major losses.
"Barcelona" paid 222 million euros (262 million dollars) only for the release of the Brazilian from the contract, and neida will receive a salary that will reach tens of millions of dollars a year.
Here are some financial aspects of the move of nemar to France.
"PSG" can be split up to hire nemar and add it to the galaxy of other stars, taking into account the financing of the team from the rich energy of the ruling family of Qatar.
Clubs have the right to spend large amounts on the purchase of players, but they have to balance them with legitimate sources of income to reach the threshold of profitability in their football business.
"FFP" led Michel Platini after his election by the UEFA President in 2007.
The former French footballer believed that clubs, which had to pay for huge debts in their pursuit of success, were in fact killing and risked ruin if banks or owners had stopped financing.
In 2011," FFP "ceased to focus on clubs' debts and instead shifted to tracking their losses.
As a result of this change, the business model originally used by Roman Abramovich in Chelsea in 2003 is to buy a club with a good potential, and then seriously spend time to improve the team and create a global brand - has become a difficult plan.
During this three-annual period of assessment, exciting 2018, clubs may suffer losses of 30 million euros.
And, despite the fact that Platini has been removed from the presidential post in 2015, his successor to UEFA, Aleksandr cheferin, is still determined to contain excessive spending.
"Of course," FFP "lives, and we move forward, we will toughen the Rules," said the Associated Press last week, Andrea Traverso, who controls the "FFP" in UEFA.
Although PSG will pay for the buyout of the nemar contract, it can distribute this amount over the entire term of his contract.
Neida signed a five-year contract, so the transfer costs can be shown in the annual report as a cost of 44.4 million euros over the next five years.
During the first wave of the "FFP" sanctions in 2014, the "PSG" as well as the Abu Dhabi city "Manchester City" were subjected to heavy sanctions.
"PSG" was fined 60 million euros (at this rate of $82 million), which was later reduced to 20 million euros, and it was ordered to limit the composition of its team to the Champions League during the 2014-1015 season, 21 players instead of regular 25.
UEFA tracks clubs that can try to redraw its financial inspections by inflating its revenue from companies associated with club owners.
Even though the Qatari company could propel "PSG," but if the amount of funding was considered to be higher than standard market rates, UEFA would not allow it to be considered legitimate income.
This was exactly what happened in 2014, when UEFA decided that the amount of funding for the "PSG" by the Qatar Tourism Authority was inflated.
It was reported that a portion of the earnings of nemar in the "PSG" could be made in the form of payments by the Organizing Committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.
But PSG and Qatar 2022 deny that neimar will become the Ambassador of the world championship, and such a maneuver could easily be found by UEFA inspectors.
Past sanctions imposed on "PSG" mean that UEFA will be more closely tracking any attempt to evade the rules.
According to Thursday, the people familiar with the situation, UEFA did not conduct preliminary discussions with the "PSG" on the transfer of nemar.
They communicated with the Associated Press Agency on the conditions of anonymity, since it was not authorized to discuss the situation of "PSG."
According to the latest reported Report, In 2015-1016, PSG received more than 10 million euros on turnover of 542.4 million euros.
Reports for the last fiscal year have not yet been published.
"PSG" expects the arrival of nemar to become a favorable ground for sponsorship transactions, the sale of attributes and T-shirts with the team logo.
The Club suggests that turnover will increase by at least 30 percent due to the hiring of a new player.
Undoubtedly angry, one of the best footballers, the Spanish League tried to prevent nemar's transfer, saying that "PSG" would violate the financial "fair-pley."
"This is an obvious case of" financial doping, "with the Club and the State," said the Spanish newspaper as "as" the President of La League Javier Tebas, in view of the fact that the final owner of "PSG" is Qatar.
Arsen venger trainer, whose club belongs to the American sports magnate, shares the doubts of the League about the financing of the club by the State.
"It's all the consequences of equity participation, and this has completely changed the football landscape over the past 15 years," said Thursday Wenger.
"When the club belongs to the country, everything is possible.
It is becoming very difficult to comply with the financial crisis, because the country can have many ways and many reasons to be represented by such a serious player.
The order and place of the oath will be determined by the President
Where and how new Russian citizens will be sworn in by the Russian Federation, the President will determine the president - such amendments to the second reading in the relevant law have developed a Committee of the State Duma on legislation and State construction.
A week ago, the deputies planned to directly define the procedure for bringing the oath to the law.
A solemn oath will be released to children under 18 years of age, as well as legally incompetent, from the revised text of the amendments to the draft Law on Citizenship of the Russian Federation (there is at the disposal of Izvestia), which the Committee on 11 July will consider before the second reading at its meeting.
The idea of introducing the oath on the entry into Russian citizenship instead of the formal signing of documents by President Vladimir Putin supported on June 6 during a meeting with the Speaker of the State Duma, Vyacheslav Volodin.
Deputies issued this idea in the form of an amendment to the second reading in the bill, which provides for the abolition of the decision to grant citizenship to those who were subsequently convicted for a number of crimes of a terrorist or extremist nature: for example, for public calls for terrorism or his public justification in the media or on the Internet (article 205.2 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation), as well as for the hijacking of an airplane, train or water transport, but only if the act is connected with terrorism (article 211 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation).
According to the bill, the logic of him was such: by issuing documents for citizenship, a person is signed under the promise of compliance with Russian legislation - rising on the path of extremism, he violates this promise.
The bill in April introduced the leaders of the Duma faction Vladimir Vasilyev ("United Russia"), Gennady Zyuganov (KPRF), Vladimir Zhirinovsky (LDPR), Sergei Mironov ("Fair Russia") and the Speaker of the DG Vyacheslav Volodin.
On May 19, Deputies adopted it on first reading.
Last week, the Committee on State construction and legislation approved the text of the bill to the second reading, but it has once again reworked.
Now it says that the President of the Russian Federation will establish the order of the oath.
Previously, Parliamentarians intended to describe the procedure directly in the Law "On citizenship of the Russian Federation," indicating that the ceremony should take place in a solemn setting before the state emblem and the Russian flag in the presence of a representative of the Ministry of Internal Affairs.
However, from the text of the bill, it was not clear where such an event should take place - a list of places where the emblem of the Russian Federation is possible is regulated by the relevant federal constitutional law.
These include courts, offices of heads of State authorities, municipal entities, judges, prosecutors, heads of federal executive bodies, etc.
It is most likely that this could be the civil registry.
To make a solemn oath, those who wish to acquire the citizenship of the Russian Federation will be after the officials will check their documents.
But the Russian passport will only be received after the oath is to be made from the finalized text.
A week ago, the draft stated that the oath should precede the signing of the decree.
The updated text states that Russia will be sworn in from 18 years, not from 14.
The rule has been preserved, according to which the oath of office will be exempt from legal incapacity or limited legal capacity, as well as those who cannot pronounce, read or handwritten the oath of office.
In addition, the President of the Russian Federation has the right to exempt from this procedure and "other persons,"
Also, the updated bill prescribes a special procedure for admission to Russian citizens of Ukrainian citizens who are considered as carriers of the Russian language.
They will have to officially renounce Ukrainian citizenship by providing a corresponding statement to the authorized body of Ukraine.
A notarized copy of the statement will have to be handed over to Russian officials.
The renunciation of "alien" citizenship, as it is now, will not be required if this is provided for by an international treaty, or if it is not possible "for reasons beyond the control of the person."
The corresponding amendment to the law proposed a group of deputies, among them the First Deputy Speaker of the DG Ivan Melnikov (KPRF), Natalia vitalskaya, Pavel krašeninnikov and Ayrat farrahov (all - "One Russia").
I think many of you know that it is impossible to get a certificate from Ukraine.
Accordingly, a lot of people are waiting for the decision of their fate regarding the citizenship of the Russian Federation, - explained the head of the Duma Committee on State construction and Legislation Pavel krašeninnikov (EP) on the eve of the head of the Duma Committee on State construction and legislation.
In addition, the text made it clear that restrictions on the occupation of certain positions for foreigners would not apply to those who refused to "other" Citizenship and gave up the previous passport in the Russian Ministry of the Interior, but "for reasons beyond his control," he was not considered to be a citizen of another country.
Now foreigners are prohibited from holding positions in the municipal service, to be accepted for work on facilities and in the Organization, whose activities are connected with the security of Russia.
Also, a person with dual citizenship or a residence permit of another country cannot become a deputy of the State Duma or a member of the Federation Council.
It is planned that the law should enter into force on September 1, 2017, by then the necessary by-laws must be prepared.
Nostalgia is becoming a niche in the "Hot American Lete" and "Comrade detective"
The current iteration of history nostalgic resembles the glorious days of the characters in the 80th; about the era of the grant in the 90s (approximately at a time when the outstanding masters David Wayne and Michael schovalter made a comedy of the "State" for MTV); and of itself - that is, 2001, before its stars, like Elizabeth Banks, Amy flight and Paul Rudd, moved to more serious things.
As a fact of culture, it is at the same time the elevation and embodiment of our epoch with its constant reminders from Facebook.
But as franchising it seems an anachronism.
"The first day of the camp" was surprisingly good, and not only because of the absurd humour (including the original story about the burning of vegetables, which was announced by H. John Benjamin).
The result doubles the main joke: middle-aged actors play sexually concerned children who have only reached the age of majority; thanks to this inability to return to becoming part of the joke.
"Ten years later," where adults have already played adults, they have less profound emotional roots, and their parody is more unsystematic and includes reefs from the stalker films of the 90s of the "hands of the cradle."
In one episode, the character brings Apple Powerbook, four-wheel roller races and "pieces of other things from 1991."
Many storylines are the same.
The dobroter, now a writer, is still not able to gain reciprocity from Katie (margerit Moro).
Victor (Ken Marino) still did not share with virginity.
And there is still a mad and fake plot in which Ronald Reagan is involved (also Showalter), who now incites George bus-senior (experienced parody in the execution of Michael Jan Blake).
As always, the best part of franchises is a departure from it.
It is especially fun to see the young rudder, who is singing the song of Matt Dillon of "singles," whose character, the former Big Man of Andy now looks like an old man.
To bring this franchise success could be random madness in the spirit of the type of recursive series "Seven up," as long as it doesn't come to what I think would be its logical conclusion: "Hot American summer: Twenty years later," where in the last stage the entire company would have been in film at the premiere of the film "Hot American summer."
"Comrade detectiv" in the Amazon turns to another type of nostalgia: Memories of the cold war from Americans, "explosive Blonde" or even "shine" with its images of the struggle of the East and West.
This comedy, created by Brian gates and Alessandro Tanaka with the Director of RIZ Thomas, depicts a television film: the Romanian Police drama of the 1980s about two police officers in Bucharest, struggling for truth, atheism and Marxist-Leninist way.
The main roles - who saw the life of Gregor and idealista Josef - performed Florin piersik-junior and Corneliu ulich, and announced their dialogues in English Channing Tatum (he is the executive producer) and Joseph gordon-lite.
It's a brilliant idea.
But only the idea.
There are several visual jokes (Police spend time for watching the chess match as Americans could watch football).
The team of famous voices for the frame - among them Jenny sleith, Nick offerman, mahershala Ali and Chloe Sevigny - makes it interesting to play in "Guess The Voice."
But "Comrade detectiv" is so kept behind the truth of the propaganda drama - there is even a killer in Ronald Reagan, which is often and looks like it.
Six Long episodes are long, and it's funny not to be too much and not often.
If he is to do the rest," Comrade detective "could better handle his satire in the spirit of agitpropa; for example, every time the Gregor and Josef come to the American Embassy, there are two thick people who absorb the humburgers in the lobby.
The imaginary spectator of this image says Western culture is capable of doing something like that.
The fictitious Romanian authors of the film are not right: we do so even with their own recent history, and with them too.
The prize fund for the Russian Football Super Cup between Sparta and the "locomotive" will be about 30 million rubles.

As TASS notes," Spartak "is the current champion of the Russian Federation, and" locomotive "is the owner of the country Cup.
The two young ufimen have cleaned up the furniture shop for 200 thousand rubles
A few days ago, a 37-year-old ufimetz, who had a Mebel firm, turned to the police.
The man claimed the theft of expensive tools from the shop, which caused serious damage to his production.
The miners have become instruments with a total value of almost 200 thousand roubles: two welding machines, percussion, hydraulics, winch.
The guards began searching for the criminals and soon went to the residents of the Blagoveshchensk district of Bashkortostan, friends 23 and 24 years old.
According to the press service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Republic, the accomplices entered the territory of the enterprise, broke the entrance door and made the tools.
Immediately after that, the guys sold stolen equipment to the first car service.
In relation to them, the theft has already been initiated, and law enforcement officials have succeeded in bringing only a portion of the stolen instruments to the rightful owner.
The State Duma commented on Medvedev's relations with Russia and the USA
The US and Russia must be able to work with each other.
This statement was made by the official spokesman of the State Department, Heather nauert, in response to the words of the Prime Minister of the Russian Federation Dmitry Medvedev about the relations between the two States.
Earlier, the head of the Russian Government said that by adopting new anti-Russian sanctions, the US put an end to the hope of improving bilateral relations and declared the Russian Federation a full-fledged trade war.
Commenting on these words, naerth admitted that Russian-American relations are at a "low level," but noted that it is necessary to look for "areas for interaction."
"Look at the truce in the south-west of Syria, which has been observed for almost a month."
"And this is an example of good cooperation between the USA and Russia," quotes the diplomat RIA Novosti.
At the same time, the representative of the Foreign Ministry declined to comment on the statement by the Russian Prime Minister that the sanctions amounted to a trade war.
The bill on new sanctions against Russia, Iran and the DPRK, U.S. President Donald Trump signed last Wednesday.
At the same time, he admitted that the document failed and ran counter to the American Constitution.

U.S. President Donald Trump made a sharp criticism of Congress members.
According to the American leader, their actions have led to a deterioration of relations with Russia.
Our relations with Russia are at a low and dangerous level.
"You can thank Congress, the same people cannot even give us medicine," the President wrote on Twitter.
Donald Trump signed the Law on new sanctions against Russia, Iran and the DPRK.

Belarusian businessman refused to buy a Ukrainian daughter of Sberbank
The businessman from Belarus Viktor Prozor withdrew from the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) an application for the purchase of a subsidiary of Sberbank.
The businessman's decision explained RBC's intention to "concentrate on other our planned investments and projects we are working on."
According to Mr pron, this step will be "The best investment of time," despite the investment attractiveness of the purchase of Sberbank's docks.
Mr pro I became the main contender for the purchase of a Russian bank unit in Ukraine after the application of the norvikbank consortium Grigory guelnikov and the Belarusian company said guzerieva in July.
Russian banks began to leave the Ukrainian market after President Petro Poroshenko imposed sanctions on their subsidiaries in March.
One of these financial organizations - in addition to VTB and Vnesheconombank - has become Sberbank.
Novak called the cause of blackouts in Crimea
In the Ministry of Energy of the Russian Federation, the cause of blackouts in Crimea was named.
The head of the Agency, Aleksandr Novak, spoke about the incident.
According to him, the peninsula remained without electricity due to an accident on the territory of Krasnodar Territory.
The truck caught in the accident of the electric transmission line, as a result, has resulted in the deactivation of the Kuban and associated Crimean networks.
Disruptions in the electricity supply of large Crimean cities were recorded last week.
Specialists removed the problems for several hours.
Initially, it was reported that the cause of blackouts could have been an anomalous heat.
The Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.25%
It is expected that the Bank of England will later announce that interest rates will not change after weak economic growth and weakening inflation have led to rumours of a possible increase.
The Bank of England warned that economic growth will remain elusive and left interest rates unchanged among the growing pressure on family incomes.
Specialists of the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted with the result of 6 versus 2 for maintaining the rate at 0.25%, with fewer members of the Committee in favour of an increase in the rate, because weak economic growth weakened support for the increase.
In its quarterly report on inflation, the Bank limited its forecast for an increase of 1.7% in 2017 and 1.6% in 2018 and warned that the pressure on family incomes will continue, while it is still expected that inflation will rise to around 3% in the autumn.
However, the Bank warned that the rise in rates over the next few years would be needed to control the inflation caused by inflation, and said that it is likely that borrowing costs will have to rise stronger than expected in financial markets.
The members of the Committee also voted in favour of abandoning part of a huge set of measures to develop the economy, which was launched a year ago as a result of breczita.
Starting next February, the Bank will close the emergency funding plan, which it grants to banks cheap loans, although he said that he is now expected to provide an additional 15 billion pounds to £115 billion.
In the Protocol on the decision on the rate of the Bank, the bank said: "According to the main forecasts of the MPC, the growth of the gross domestic product (GDP) in the near future remains slow, while the pressure on real incomes of families continues to affect consumption."
On the issue of rates, he reiterated that in order to suspend inflation, there would be a need for "some tightening of financial policies," in a "slightly higher" amount than expected markets.
At the moment, markets are predicting the first increase in the third quarter of the next year and another in 2020.
But the Bank stressed that all the increase will be "progressive" and "Limited."
The Bank's forecast for raising this and next year is lower than the forecasts made in May, which were equal to 1.9% and 1.7%.
The Bank left unchanged its forecast by 1.8% in 2018.
After these news, sterling fell against the dollar and the euro.
The pound fell by 0.5% to $1.31 and 0.4% to 1.11 euros.
The decision not to change the rate was made after the recent disappointing growth rates weakened the higher expectations of the rise; the GDP then rose by 0.3% in the second quarter, compared to 0.2% in the previous three months.
According to the representative of the Bank, growth appears to remain at 0.3% in the third quarter, although it will begin to increase at the end of the year.
The Bank's last report on inflation gave little water to households, which hit high inflation and very little wage hikes: according to the Bank, the pressure will increase before falling.
The Bank added that the financial policy "cannot prevent" the earnings from earnings over the next few years, but expects that wages "significantly" will rise by the end of his three-year-old forecast.
The economy is also committed to growth as a result of the growing demand for British goods, which is due to the low pound rate, which compensates some of the lower consumer spending.
The decision was made a year after the rate was reduced to 0.25% last August after the shocking results of the referendum on withdrawal from the European Union, which led to the fall of the pound.
According to the bank, it is likely that it will take four years to fully influence prices and the economy.
Before the bank made its final decision at rates, the noise surrounding the expected rate hike was growing, as inflation was increasingly dashed on and so heavily pressured by households: three of the experts in the Committee were asked to raise rates up to 0.5% in July.
Last month, inflation fell to 2.6% from 2.9% in July, though, according to the bank, this drop was expected and in the coming months again.
According to the Bank, the higher rate compared to the planned 2% is entirely due to the low rate of the pound.
Andrew montlake, the company's director of mortgage brokers, said: "If we take into account the recent drop in swap rates, the mortgage market will again become even more competitive, as creditors demand business opportunities and expect a good end of the year.
The market looks particularly favorable for those who are close to the end of their existing contracts, as refinancing loans, often with the possibility of the absence of a commission, as well as with a low rate, are becoming popular as never."
The Public Health Service will write about 10,000 people with HIV from HIV
Starting in September, patients will have access to the "revolutionary" drug to prevent HIV after the battle in the High Court on the financing of the drug from the public health service.
The National Health Service of England announced that the pre-exposure prophylaxis of HIV (prop), a pill accepted before the sex, which has been proven to reduce the risk of contracting people at risk, on average 86 per cent, will now be provided by the health service during the initial three-year trial period of about 10,000 people.
She agreed to fund the test after the Court of Appeal upheld the ruling of the High Court last year, which claimed that the National Health Service had the option to pay for the PRP, despite her claims that it should be funded by the local authorities.
This step, announced on Thursday, was called "the most important innovation" by the President of the National Health Service of England, Simon Stevens, and the National AIDS Control Authority (NAT) called him a "turning point."
Before the full launch of the program across England by April 2018, veneerologic dispensaries in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and scheffield are among the first to start registering people, and even more dispensaries will join the program in October.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (EPZs) is a HIV treatment course in front of sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
Studies have shown that EPZs significantly reduce the risk of HIV infection among people at risk.
When the prop is admitted to sex in the human body, a sufficient amount of certain drugs to prevent HIV infection.
Such drugs can be taken daily or not later than two hours before sex.
Patients who have the right to receive the drug are homosexual and bisexual men, transgender people and people whose partners are HIV positive and do not receive successful treatment.
Dispensaries will select suitable participants who have agreed to participate in the study, including men, women, transgender people and individuals, who are not aware of their HIV status as antiretroviral therapy.
People living and assigned to a general practitioner in England will also be able to apply for potential participation in the nearest Venerological dispensary, taking part in the program.
The program will cost 10 million pounds, and the National Health Service of England this week after the international tender for procurement has signed a contract for the provision of the drug.
The study is designed to assess all the possibilities of EPZs through the collection of clinical data on who is the target audience of the drug, its absorption and application on a large scale.
"This is an essential innovation to supplement and strengthen the widespread and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV.
This is another milestone for more than three decades in the fight against one of the biggest health threats facing humanity.
Deborah gold, President NAT (National AIDS Control Authority), said: "This is a turning point in the fight against HIV.
EPZs, if properly targeted to people in need of assistance and at risk, make it possible to change the situation of the HIV epidemic in England.
Starting in September, people in the HIV risk group, thanks to this study conducted in England by the National Health Service, will have access to a new window of opportunity, the use of which a person can control himself, without discussing it with the partner, which will lead to an improvement in many lives.
We warmly welcome this news."
Jan Green, President of the Terrence Higgins Foundation, said: "Now, first of all, we need to ensure that the test is quickly deployed throughout the country, and that no one of the HIV risk group will be forgotten.
Now, when we are provided with a pilot drug, we are going to protect more than 10,000 people in the HIV risk zone."
The shadow Minister of Public Health, Sharon Hodgson, said: "We very much welcome the start of the test, it has been seriously delayed due to months of delays and delays by the Government."
The data show how revolutionary could be the drug as part of our approach to preventing HIV and ending the transmission of this fatal infection.
This test will bring us closer to a complete understanding of the benefits of EPZs.
It is now important that the test be as soon as possible throughout the country to protect those who are at risk of HIV and move us further towards ending the spread of HIV in society.
The world congress of Tatars adopted a resolution on support for the Treaty of Tatarstan and Russia
The Sixth Congress of the World Congress of Tatar (VKT) adopted a resolution, which noted the importance of the preservation of the position of the President in Tatarstan.
According to the document, the post is "a positive form of organization of the highest State authority in the Republic and expressing the national interests of the entire Tatar People."
In addition, the Congress stressed in the resolution the importance of a treaty on the delimitation of powers between Russia and Tatarstan.
According to the document, he "played a positive role in the ethno-cultural, socio-economic and socio-political development of Tatarstan and the Russian Federation as a whole."
Let us recall that the treaty between Moscow and Kazan was concluded for 10 years since July 24, 2007.
On July 11, the deputies of the State Council of Tatarstan appealed to the President of Russia to extend the Agreement and to keep the title of the head of the region.
Now Tatarstan is the only subject of the Federation, which has a treaty with Russia.
The head of the region is the only one called "president."
Russia faces difficulties in obtaining international driving licenses
The gig units are experiencing a shortage of international driving permits (IDPs).
In order to obtain such rights, it is necessary to wait for a few weeks, which has become a real problem for holiday leave, who wish to leave abroad on his car or rent it there.
It is worth noting that the situation with international driving permits remains controversial.
The IDP was introduced to make it easier for the foreign police to understand what is written in the National Certificate, as the information is explained in five languages.
The requirements for international rights are recorded in the 1968 Vienna Convention on Road Traffic, but in countries that have ratified the Vienna Convention, Russian rights are recognized.
However, in reality everything depends on specific police or rental offices: some require the IDPs, and some of them have enough national rights.
In order to be insured, drivers of international law do receive, but it is worth considering that in the absence of ratification of the Convention (for example, the USA, Spain, Mexico, Indonesia), the authorities are free to recognize neither National Rights nor the IDP.
Now there is a problem with blanks in almost all units of the UN.GIFT, Kommersant reports, conducting a study in a number of regions.
For example, in Moscow, in the units of ugibd talonists are simply not issued, the forms are not enough for four months.
You can register for a reception on the website of the public service, but there's a queue up to mid-August.
In Krasnoyarsk, it is impossible to get "for technical reasons," without going into detail, in the Samara region, it is fair to say that there are no forms, a similar situation arises in other cities.
Many Muscovites have already faced the problem, and there are increasingly such reports in social networks:
Irina Burmistrova: "guess why in Moscow you cannot get international rights?"
Right, because in all branches of the UN.GIFT, forms have ended.
Elena Podkolzina: "The question to know people!"
International rights are urgently needed.
In Moscow, all the time has been scored far ahead, there is no place at the place of the talons at all (there is no sign, but the Talon cannot be given).
Like the portal of public services, it shows that in the St. Petersburg time free to Figa.
Has anyone tried to get in another city?
Does it work?
As explained in the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation, the requirements for the forms of international driving permits have changed, so the delivery of new forms is carried out in the units of the State Automobile Inspection.
It may also be related to the deficit, however, it is not clear what changes are in question, previously not reported.
The forms are purchased by the Centre for special use in the field of road safety (tssn) of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation and then supplies them to the units of the UN.GIFT.
In recent years, all contracts were concluded with "gosign" JSC: in 2014 - 2015, almost 200 thousand forms of IDP were produced, in 2016, 15 thousand forms were purchased, in 2017 - 90 thousand, but the last contract was concluded on July 18 with the "First Print Yard" LLC for the production of 70,000 forms.
There is a version that the TSN has just failed to hold a tender on time, which is why there is a deficit.
However, there are other versions of the shortage of forms: Due to the crisis, many people have begun to travel themselves not to Europe, but to the cheaper Asian countries - China, Thailand and so on.
Which rights are accepted there, it is not clear, therefore, people and reinventing, so there is a growing demand for international "Kings."
Recently it became known that professional drivers will have to pass an exam to confirm their qualifications.
This proposal was made by the Ministry of Transport.
The International Driving Permit (IDP) of the new model has been in force since May 31, 2011.
The Minister of Justice of Ukraine refused to believe in the construction of the Crimean Bridge
The Minister of Justice of Ukraine Pavel Petrenko said he does not believe in the ability of Russia to build a bridge in Crimea.
On Friday, August 4, he said in an interview with the "observer" portal.
No respectable international company, even a bolt or a Gael, will not put it, because it risks losing its business in the EU, the USA, Japan - in countries that have joined the sanctions against Russia on Crimea.
"That is, I am deeply convinced that there is no prospect of this project," Petrenko said.
He added that Russia considers Russia unable to implement a major infrastructure project on its own.
Russia cannot properly build and less scale facilities.
I know that after the Olympics in Sochi, entire stadiums have already begun.
"Therefore, I think the best instrument in this situation is sanctions against companies that have proved to be so short-sighted to join the project," the official said.
On July 31, builders completed the construction of a car arch of the Crimean Bridge.
On the Kerch bank, a massive ASSEMBLY OF THE ROAD arch of the Crimean Bridge has been completed: Its set is locked at a height of 45 metres from the base of the construction.
"At the same time, the bridge builders prepared for the installation on the channel of the railway arch," the information center of the project reported.
In April, the head of the Ministry of Transport Maksim Sokolov informed the President of Russia Vladimir Putin that the construction of the facility is ahead of schedule.
The Crimean Bridge will connect the Crimean peninsula and Krasnodar Territory.
Spain dismissed an official who was not going to work for 10 years
What angelic patience (or absolute indifference to the public service) was to have the head of the Spanish Official of carforest Resio?
Permanent walk stretched for 10 long years.
However, Mr. reacio was still dismissed.
But not his immediate boss.
What is only in the world of bureaucrats does not happen.
They seem to have been used to all of the "servants of the people" long ago.
And, however, officials are all the time to surprise those whose taxes they live well.
This time "sensation" complained from Spain.
There, a staff member of the archive of Valencia, Carles reicio, has gone up for ten years not to go to work.
At the same time, he received regular salaries.
And the entire solid - 50 thousand euros per year.
And that's the "miracle times" of Mr reacio.
He was dismissed by a decision of the Legislative Assembly of Valencia.
During the investigation, it turned out that a malicious walk each morning came to the office at 07:00 to mark the electronic system.
And then went home.
Once again, he was in the workplace at 16:00, again to mark in the system that he had gone.
And so 10 years.
It has also become known that all the free time of a truer was devoted to drawing comics at home.
Now the deputies of the Legislative Assembly of Valencia think how to punish and direct Mr. rescio's direct chief, who could not know how to "actively work" at his working place.
Judges propose to protect from Presidents
The Presidential Human Rights Council (HRC), on behalf of Vladimir Putin, has developed proposals to strengthen the independence of the judiciary.
The HRC proposes to limit the powers of the Presidents of the courts and to introduce their election.
For the Courts of Appeals and cassation, the HRC wants to introduce special districts that will not be tied to administrative and territorial division in the Russian Federation.
The Supreme Court should also present his proposals within the framework of a presidential mandate.
The HRC has completed the development of proposals that will strengthen the independence of Russian justice.
This work of the HRC was conducted on behalf of Vladimir Putin on January 3, 2017, which the President gave after a meeting with the members of the Council.
At a meeting with members of the Council on December 8, 2016, there were discussed some cases of judicial arbitrariness, as well as problems of public control in places of detention of citizens (see "Kommersant" of 9 December).
The HRC's work resulted in 25 proposals, which concern both the independence of judges and the identification of judicial errors and the financing of courts and legal education.
One of the ideas of the Kremlin human rights activists is to restrict the powers of the Presidents of the courts to increase the independence of the other judges.
If the candidate for the post of judge successfully passed the competition and received the support of the judicial community, the President of the Court, according to the HRC, must submit it to the appointment without the right to refuse, as the law currently permits.
It is also proposed to deprive the President of the right to allocate cases to judges.
To do this, allow experts, a specially written computer program can be written.
Also, the HRC considers that the President is not entitled to "predetermine the results of the qualification of the judge, to initiate his disciplinary proceedings, to make decisions on the establishment of additional material payments."
At the same time, the Presidential Council considers it necessary to move to "the election of the Presidents of the courts by the judges themselves" and "to give them powers for a relatively short period of time with mandatory rotation."
Now all the Presidents of the courts (from Republican to district) are appointed for six years by the President on the presentation of the President of the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation.
In order to protect judges from the pressure of regional administrations, the HRC proposes a reorganisation of appeal and cassation in the courts of general jurisdiction.
Now their structure is tied to administrative and territorial division in the Russian Federation.
The HRC says "it is necessary to ensure the organization of separate courts of appeal and cassation, not at the level of regional courts in the constituent entities of the Russian Federation, but in the courts."
Experts take the practice of arbitration courts.
There are "judicial districts" that do not coincide with the administrative division in the Russian Federation, but guarantee that this is a great independence from regional officials who are difficult to use "telephone law."
The justices of the HRC are proposing to strengthen the people's assessors so as to consider certain "categories of civil and administrative cases."
For example, the deprivation of parental rights, the restoration of work, the protection of honour and dignity, the deprivation of driving rights, etc.
"These are only our proposals," explained "Kommersant" member, Judge of the Constitutional Court, retired Tamara morshkova.
She also recalled that the President's mandate was not only to the HRC, but also to the Supreme Court (SC), which has not yet revealed his proposals.
The time to carry out an order from the armed forces (among the co-performers - the Prosecutor General's Office and the Human Rights Commissioner in the Russian Federation) is still there.
To report to Vladimir Putin about how effectively the independence of justice is ensured, the Chairman of the Armed Forces Vyacheslav Lebedev is due until September 1.
To live a high life: the semi-floor AND THE hytled design have turned this small apartment in the erls court into a spacious dwelling
Joan Lee, a former banker, who is looking for real estate repairs, moved from the spacious house in Knightsbridge to an apartment in erls court in 2014.
The apartment is located on the first floor of a nice model of Queen Anna, and in favour of the new design says Joan has not collected his belongings and has not moved again.
"I've previously lived with my former in knitbridge in a much larger area," says Joan.
"I was looking for something comparable for my money.
I've shown this apartment in erls court, and there were the same high ceilings.
I fell in love with her and offered the price on the same day."
Since the first viewing of the apartment, an area of 1,000 square feet has moved full reconstruction.
Originally it was a one-bedroom apartment with one bedroom complex - to get into the bedroom, it was necessary to go through the kitchen - and Joanna wanted to add space for storage of things and a semi-floor to make the maximum benefit from the generous height of the ceiling.
"I wanted high ceilings, large windows, a lot of light.
These were my requirements," she says.
To this end, she hired Erfan a Out Of The notting-hille architectural and design studio "Duck & shed" to use the ceilings of 12.5 feet high and created a dwelling that would not only be a successful project, but Joan for life.
The ceiling was not high enough to accommodate two rooms on the other, so the architectural task was to create a semi-floor, where it could be possible to stand in full growth.
Erfan had to think creatively to cope with the brif.
"Work with steel structures is very complex," he explains.
"We had to put the premises so that they were one over the other, and they didn't have to bend.
It was necessary not just to build a simple platform, but to wear the structures so that they were at the right height and allowed to use the rooms from the top and bottom."
This decision allowed Erfan to arrange two full-size rooms one above the other in the reserved space - and much more interesting.
From the half-floor, through the vintage copper Light window from "retrouvius," A look at the luxury living room is opened.
Mirror furniture with golden finishing, Silver accents and vintage lighting devices from Serge muy set the style of the project.
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding entertainment, spacious and light.
The short corridor is covered with mirrors so that it looks longer.
In the kitchen, the mirror protection Panel seems to be window to another room.
At the entrance of the mirrors, the mirrors serve to store all the dishes of Joan.
In order to create a sense of more luxury space, the beauty of the living room can set up a kitchen when it doesn't use it.
There is nothing new in the emerging kitchens.
The uniqueness of this cuisine is that it is moving up the door, as in the garage.
"There was an Engineering Art here," he will tell Erfan about the reinforced glass of wood fibre door.
"It is equipped with a counterweight, so when you push the door up, it is very easy to slide."
Thanks to the intelligent use of space and storage areas, Joan received an additional 16 square meters, an additional bedroom and an improved layout.
"After all, the floor area is exactly what you will sell, that is, what your property is valued," says Erfan.
"roughly speaking, the real estate agent will go and make calculations based on the floor area."
Here they were able to increase the floor area by using quality materials that give space to the shade of luxury.
"The materials are what we trove, so they help create an emotional connection with the home," says Erfan.
"No one is in love with electrical wiring in the walls.
It is important, but does not degenerate our hearts."
This is a testimony to the fact that, due to a good design and a larger scale, the apartment can make something amazing from something ordinary.
In fact, like Joan, you can decide to stay.
The Government approved the creation of a commission on cultural policy
The Government of Russia approved the creation of a commission on state cultural policy.
The relevant ruling is published on the Government's website.

The Commission will also develop draft cultural policy strategies, clarify tasks and prepare new programs for its implementation.
The head of the Commission was appointed Deputy Chairman of the Government of the Russian Federation.
The composition of the Commission will be approved separately.
The Prime Minister of the Russian Federation Dmitry Medvedev approved the plan for the implementation of the strategy of State cultural policy until 2030.

Inflation in the G20 countries fell to an eight-year minimum
The rise in consumer prices in the G20 countries has fallen to minimal over the past eight years, the Wall Street Journal reports citing the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) data.
According to OECD estimates, inflation in June 2016 was 2% - the lower values were recorded in October 2009, when the price growth index reached 1.7%.
Earlier, Rosstat reported a decrease in the consumer price index in Russia by 0.1%.
Thus, the Agency recorded the first week of deflation in 2017.
The inflation rate in Russia, according to calculations by the Ministry of Finance, is 4.1%.
The Ministry of Economy, however, believes that the target is already achieved - according to the Agency's version, the indicator is 4%.
Putin warned against illegal logging of Baykal Taiga
Russian leader Vladimir Putin during a meeting on environmental development of the natural Baikal territory warned against the illegal destruction of forests.
During the event, the Minister of Natural Resources, Sergei Donskoy, noted that a bill had previously been prepared.
It allows logging during the destruction of the fires, and the Government plans to adopt it in the autumn.
In turn, the President said that this project should be monitored to ensure that in the process of cutting it was "not profitable for all in a row."
The Donskoy noted that the draft law requires supervision by the MES and the supervisory agencies.
Media: members of the FAA secretly agree with the Donbass militia
On the line of armed confrontation in Donbass, regular telephone links have been established.
The fighters of the opposing sides are constantly communicating with each other on mobile phones, and this communication is not known in the headquarters.
The Fu and the Donbass militias have established communication on cell phones secretly from their high command.
On August 4, the "country .UA" reports referring to the participants of the military operation in Donbass.
According to the publication, the commanders of the units know perfectly well the names of their colleagues on the opposite side of the front and communicate with them on a daily basis.
Communication is not entirely domestic: commanders are trying to reach a "tactical agreement."
Often, the result of such conversations is the truce on a certain section of the front.
Journalists became aware of the cases when congratulating the officer on the occasion of the birth of a given officer from the front line, from his formal enemy.
The FPR and the DPR militia and the LDPR are sitting in trenches on the line between the spring of 2014, when Ukraine began a combat operation against Donbass.
MFA outraged the blocking of statements by the UN Security Council on attacks on the Embassy of the Russian Federation
The Russian foreign policy agency is outraged by the actions of individual Western diplomatic representatives who block statements by the UN Security Council in the press condemning the terrorist attacks of the Russian Embassy in Syria.
The Russian MFA reports this.
The Agency recalled that the Territory of the Russian Embassy in Damascus on August 2, the third time a month, was subjected to mortar fire from the terrorist groups "Hayat Tahrir al-Sham" (former Jabhat al-Nusra, banned in the Russian Federation) and "fayak Al-Rahman."
Taking into account that the international community is unanimous in the qualification of Nusra as a terrorist organization, and the UN Security Council resolutions call for opposition to this structure, the Russian Foreign Ministry noted that "it would seem, of course, that the Nusra terrorist attacks" should be met with universal unconditional and strong condemnation, and the estimates against diplomatic missions should not be any ambiguity. "
However, as pointed out in the diplomatic department," the diplomatic representatives of the United States, Great Britain, France and Ukraine in the UN Security Council, alternately, by changing the tone of objections, by covering the reasons for the alleged lack of information, blocked the proposal by the Russian Federation to adopt a standard short draft of the Security Council's statement to the press condemning terrorist attacks against Russian diplomatic representation in the Syrian capital."
The unwillingness to show diplomatic solidarity with us will remain on the conscience of these delegations.
"It is outrageous that the failure of the Security Council to condemn the acts of terrorists encourages them to become new provocations and acts of terrorism, gives them a sense of impunity," said the MFA and added that "they would not want those barbarians to be convinced that someone in the Security Council with them is one."
Vladimir Putin spoke for limiting the number of unscheduled inspections of business
Russian President Vladimir Putin, during the meeting on investment projects in the Far East, said that the number of unscheduled inspections of entrepreneurs should be reduced to 30% of the number of planned, and also said the need to limit the duration of inspections to ten days.
"exceptional checks are carried out, as a rule, without appropriate agreement with the Prosecutor's Office; only 2-3% is agreed with the Prosecutor's Office, all the rest goes on independently," the President of TASS quotes.
Vladimir Putin also said that it is necessary to ban investigators from removing servers and hard drives in enterprises.
In addition, according to the President, business associations should have the right to defend the interests of their members in court.
"This, I hope, will make a certain position in the consideration of business cases or related to the violation of the law in the sphere of entrepreneurship," the head of state said.
As "Kommersant" reported, the number of other types of inspections of entrepreneurs is increasing due to the moratorium on scheduled inspections.
In May, according to the order of the business ombudsman under the President of Russia, Boris Titov was conducting a poll, which revealed that there was actually a substitution of scheduled inspections of unscheduled inspections (the share of those facing them increased from 21.9% in 2015 to 30.8% in 2016), the Prosecutor (from 16.9% to 21.8%), the Prosecutor (from 7.9% to 13.3%), as well as checks on citizens' Claims (growth from 15% to 19.5%) and administrative investigations (10.8% to 15.5%).
For more information about business audits in the "Kommersant" material, "the Small Business went on on the other side."
Brothers fight for real estate Empire worth more than $500 million
Two brothers are fighting for one of the largest in Victoria empires in real estate trading worth more than 500 million dollars - Forty years after their Italian ancestors founded a dynasty.
The former Director of the Carlton Football Club and the developer Colin de lutis lives in the Palace of Tuak, through three doors from his junior brother, who filed against him in the Supreme Court a claim for the division of property and assets.
Paul wants to get out of the family business since 2014, but the Supreme Court still faces a bitter dispute about the conditions of divorce.
Together with his mother, the brothers owned 87 objects worth more than half a billion dollars, bought since in 1973 their family bought a store on Smith Street in Collingwood.
There, the family founded the Westco jeans firm, which has grown into a network of 160 outlets.
It was sold in 1999 for 85 million dollars.
The money was invested in real estate, and the list of family holdings de lutis includes today office buildings, plots for development in brunsvik and Sorrento, apartments on the Gold bank and in Mount Buller and shopping centres in the suburbs.
According to an agreement with the late father Colin, which Paul describes as "the main driving force and the dominant personality" of the Family de lutis, owns about two thirds of the company's assets, and the gender is about one third.
According to the Court, this means that the property of the Colina is 316 million and the gender is 176 million.
The division of property and money became a stumbling block for gender.
"The section proposed by Colin gives him, in my opinion, the best parts of the property," he wrote in his first testimony in 2015.
Last Friday, after several unsuccessful attempts of reconciliation, the first hearing before the Supreme Court was held.
The brothers are now arguing about who will control the existing business - of which, according to the gender, Colin was excluded.
Colin claims that this is not the case, but accuses the gender of the mismanagement of certain facilities.
In the testimony given by Colin at the beginning of the process, he says he hopes to resolve the dispute.
"My Italian roots make me think the family's top priority," he wrote.
The Court costs are growing as a snowy: hundreds of pages of testimony, emails and reports from companies such as Deloitte, Pitcher partners and charter Keck Cramer have been added to the case; both parties have attracted the most prominent lawyers, including the Royal Lawyer of Allan Myers, and the best solicitors.
Mrs de lutis and her late husband Luigi were immigrants from Italy; since the late 1950s, they managed dairy bars and gastronomy, and in the early 1970s bought a store in brunvik.
Under financial guarantees, they bought a store in Collingwood, where Colin opened the first family shop of jeans.
Colin says he launched Westco when he was "in the last classes of the school, and Paul was then a boy (about 10 years old)."
Anna de lutis said that they had been with Luigi, who died in 2012, had hoped to transfer his possession to sons without conflict.
"Luigi often told me that he does not want the brothers to be tried in court," she wrote.
Two other brothers, mark and Luke are no longer part of the Group of Companies de lutis; Colin says Marc has received 10 million when he came out of business, and Luke 26 million.
According to Paul, and Luke, and Mark were "unhappy with the financial conditions of his office."
Colin was not a public figure, although he was a former member of the Board of Directors of the AFL Club and, according to the biography of Eddie mcguira, published in 2015, the best friend of the television star.
"Fairfax Media" contacted Colin and Paul and their lawyers on Friday.
Only Colin replied, a text message stating that, since the case had not yet been dealt with in court," I really have nothing to say."
"I am very sorry that my brother, Paul decided to sue me and try to get the name of our family in court," he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote in the testimony that he tried to satisfy his brother's demands.
"Our Father would not like to see how we with Paul argue in court," he said, adding that "still hopes to resolve the conflict."
On Friday, this hope seems to have dissipated.
"The decision in our case will soon be delivered by the Court," Colin wrote.
The new head of the Trump Office plans to limit the flow of information to the President.
Others tried to do it and defeated.
Maybe John F. Kelly will really succeed.
In such a case, he will be the first.
"politician" reports that the new head of the White House's apparatus plans to limit the flow of information coming to the President of Trump, including news reports from the media, hoping to keep the chef in a more calm state.
This is what the reporter Josh donuzi reports.
"At a meeting held by the new head of the White House, John F. Kelly, with the leadership of the Office on his first working day, he identified the main problem in the White House under President Donald Trump, which he hopes to solve: Poor channels of information to the President."
Kelly told the staff that the information should pass through him - in paper form or through briefings - because the President would be better able to make decisions if he received the right information.
Kelly's diagnosis is quite good, but others have already failed in trying to persuade Trump to track the revenue to him.
Trump's relationship with television has developed several decades ago - and now, when he is in the White House, his habit of watching television remains strong.
"When Trump, as a candidate, was outraged by the unjust coverage of the campaign, it was useful to demonstrate to him that he had received fair coverage in the publications that could be retracted," said Sam nanberg in February, a former adviser to the electoral staff.
Tara palmeri wrote then in "politics" that "according to six former members of the electoral staff, to keep Trump's habit to write to Twitter, it was necessary to ensure that the information he received was a constant stream of praise."
Well.
But the idea that Trump's habit of writing into Twitter has ever been "under control," just ridiculous.
Maybe these members of the electoral staff know something that we don't know - for example, if not, Trump's tweets would be even more provocative.
We may never know about tweets that Trump has not published.
If his staff fled him from troubles at least several times, their efforts were not in vain.
But no one managed to keep Trump away from fueling the fire.
Part of the problem is that in a White House divided into rival factions, people are constantly trying to advance their agenda by pushing the tram material - reliable or not - which confirms their views.
"Politicians" - once in this story - wrote in May about the tendency of advisers to constantly subsume dubious information to the President.
Here is one example described by the reporter, shady Goldman:
"Current and former Trump officials say Trump can react very dramatically to negative media reports, especially dangerous leaks of information, and will not rest until he finds it.
This happened at the end of February, when someone jumped to the President to print the article with gotnews.com, the website of the Internet provocateur, Charles C. Johnson, in which the Deputy Chief of Staff, Katie Welch, was accused of being "behind a number of leaks" in the White House.
It is not important that Johnson is forever amusing in Twitter for aggressive behavior, that he did not provide specific facts, or that he had launched false accusations in the past and then refused them.
Trump has read the article and began to ask employees about Welch."
Goldmaher adds that the then Chief of Staff of rajns pribus and the Secretary of the Rob Porter apparatus "tried to build a system to manage the flow of paper that Trump receives and document them."
How did it work?
Three months later Kelly is trying to do the same.
Maybe he will be a more effective manager than pribus, But Trump still has an impulsive natures, and his associates continue to fight with each other for influence.
These permanent factors make Kelly's task very difficult.
Tyumen PROSECUTOR'S OFFICE fights with HIV dissidents
The prosecutor's office challenged the ruling of the Kalininsky District Court of Tyumen, which ended the criminal case against the local resident, who had died of a minor daughter from HIV.
According to the investigation, the child died because the mother is an HIV dissident and refused treatment.
However, the court released it from responsibility in relation to reconciliation with the affected father.
The Prosecutor's Office believes that the crime cannot be left unpunished in order not to set a precedent for other HIV dissidents.
The case against Tyumen was filed under article 109, paragraph 1, of the Criminal Code (causing death by negligence) in April, following the fact that her three-year-old daughter died from HIV infection.
According to the Prosecutor's Office, the mother herself is HIV infected.
"The woman was not treated herself and refused treatment of the daughter, believing that there is no HIV infection," explained the Tyumen Region Prosecutor's Office.
The criminal case came to the Kaliningrad district court of Tyumen, which decided on July 25.
The request for this was filed by the father of the deceased girl, explaining that "he had forgiven his wife, she had no claims, she had insulted and apologized."
The Public Prosecutor's Office did not agree and filed an appeal, demanding that the ruling on the termination of the case be revoked and that it be sent for further consideration.
The girl died, and the harm caused by the crime was impossible.
The HIV-positive mother, contrary to the doctors' recommendations, abandoned the screening of the baby and treatment of her from a dangerous infection," the press service of the Prosecutor's Office reported.
According to the supervisory authority, it should be punished, otherwise it will be followed by other HIV dissidents.
As reported in the Tyumen Center of AIDS, now in Tyumen Region about 12 children with HIV are not receiving medical care due to parents' refusal.
"And this situation has already improved - in the year of the work of the special group, half of the parents, who categorically refused to treat children from HIV, changed their opinion - allowed the diagnosis, began to take medication," said the spokesman for the AIDS Center Elena Loseva.
According to her, the legislative way of influencing parents is not possible, and as a result, not all HIV-infected children are able to detect - mothers do not give them a survey, hide, run away from children from hospitals.
What is the risk of HIV dissidents
At the end of last year, St. Petersburg sociologists presented the results of the first in Russia study of the so-called movement of HIV dissidents.
HIV dissidents call people who deny the existence of HIV and refuse to accept drugs.
Medics and activists of the AIDS service are referred to as antimedical views, and they see a serious threat in their distribution.

The Roma have overcome their faces and returned to the "Millionaire street"
Some of the wealthiest homeowners of the West Midland are again in conflict with the determined Roma who have overcome the dug municipal authorities in order to reoccupy the field next to their homes.
The Roma have parked 20 houses on wheels in the field bordering the rich Street of Solihull, which has received a joke called "Millionaire Street."
Bringing horses, babies, and many houses on the wheels, they returned after they were driven not further than in May, and they did not prevent them from being removed by the municipal authorities to prevent their invasion.
This tactical company found a gap in defensive structures and pushed its vehicles through a plot that left the fence to leave the trail.
The angry residents attacked the municipality of solhala, saying he was "unable to solve the problem."
The anonymous local resident said: "They came here on Monday evening after they were driven out of Bentley heath, where they threw stones at the bystanders."
The municipality should be ashamed and forced to act because they are completely unable to solve this problem.
The Roma were here in May, they were angry, and they returned again.
Last night, more Roma arrived, and today, perhaps even more.
"The Municipality of Birmingham knows how to solve this problem, they receive long-term court orders to protect their parks," she added.
I live on streetbrook road, and I don't like that I continue to pay the Municipal Tax, and the municipality cannot even put this end."
One local resident who wanted to remain anonymous said: "It is ridiculous, we have just seen how these Gypsies leave the previous time, and, please, this attack continues."
This time they became more, and we even saw how the horse was on the meadow."
The representative of the municipality of solhala said: "We know about the illegal camp on the ground near stritsbrook road and cooperate with the Solihull police; we are making the necessary legal actions to drive them as soon as possible."
To help us in collecting evidence, it is very important that as many local residents can report any anti-social or criminal behaviour to the police by phone 101.
This makes it possible to provide a picture of the situation that will be considered by the court when we present our case.
Crimea accepts the champagne wine factory "New light"
Gup of the Republic of Crimea "Factory of Champagne Wines" New Light "has been decided to accept, transformed into JSC" shampansky wine factory "New Light," it follows from the order of the Minister of property and land relations of Crimea Anna anyuhin.
100% of the shares of the company will remain in the State property of Crimea.
The authorized capital of the Joint Stock Company will amount to 595.5 million roubles and will consist of 5.955 million ordinary shares with a nominal value of 100 roubles each.
The Ministry of Agriculture of Crimea has said that if funds for the modernization of the enterprise are not found in the next three years, there will be a threat to stop the factory.
The depreciation of the main funds at the enterprise is about 60-70%.
The modernization of the enterprise requires 1.2 billion roubles, due to the peculiarities of the organizational and legal form, it is obliged to give 50% of the income to the budget.
What remains is not enough to implement the modernization plan.
"to get money from the owner is problematic, to talk about attracting loans from large credit organizations," said Deputy Head of the Ministry of Agriculture of Crimea, Sergei petelin, in April of this year.
The Parliament of Crimea included the enterprise in the forecast plan of privatization for 2017.
It was suggested that it should be accepted and put to tender.
The source "Interfax" in the authorities of Crimea assessed the possible value of the sale of the enterprise at $40 million, the investment of the investor in modernization - another $30 million.
"New Light" in 2016 increased the production of sparkling wines by 2.8% compared to the 2015 level - up to 1.52 million bottles.
In 2017, the new light intended to release 1.6 million bottles.
The company was founded in 1878 by Prince Lev Golitsyn as a factory for the production of sparkling wine in the new light acquired by them.
The plant is located on 11 hectares of land.
The Nizhny Novgorod Tretyakov Gallery defeated more than 40 supergrills
Employees of the Ministry of Internal Affairs in Nizhny Novgorod region have established the identity of citizens who have destroyed 46 supergrudy at the cemetery of the city of Lyskovo.
The perpetrators were third-class students.
The first statement that the graves were damaged by unknown persons came to the Omsk Region's Omsk region on June 27.
In total, 24 people were contacted by the police.
As a result, criminal proceedings were initiated under article 244 of the Criminal Code "destruction, damage or desecration of burial sites."
As a result of the investigation, police officers identified suspects, they turned out to be two schoolchildren aged 8 and 9.
Juvenile offenders told the police that they were interested to see how the monuments were falling, and that they had led them to hooliganism.
Prevention activities have been carried out with children and their parents.
Italy tightens the tone of the ships of NGOs that rescue migrants.
Italy warned NGOs that belong to rescue ships in the Mediterranean Sea that they will not be able to continue their work unless they are subject to the new rules governing their activities.
"If NGOs do not comply with the new code of conduct, it is difficult to say whether they will be able to continue their activities," said the Minister of the Interior, Mario minthread, in an interview with the Turkish daily newspaper "Stampa."
The warning of the mine was heard the following day after the Italian authorities confiscated a ship belonging to the German humanitarian organization, Jugend rettet, on suspicion that its crew actually cooperated with traffickers and facilitated illegal immigration.
The humanitarian organization, which has worked for the entire year, declined to comment on the merits of the detailed accusations against her by the Italian prosecutor Ambrogio cartography.
"For us, the saving of human life is and will remain the highest priority, so we are very sorry that we cannot continue to work in the search and rescue zone," the statement of the Organization in social networks reads.
"We will be able to assess all the accusations put forward now only after we gather all the information and we will be able to assess the situation."
The Italian authorities monitor the "juventa" ship belonging to "Jugend rettet," since October.
His crew is suspected of having taken place on board migrants who were sent directly to them by traffickers, and allowed smugglers to go along with boats that they could use again.
At least one such meeting is expected to take place only 1.3 miles away from the Libyan coast, which is said to be in the indictment, the content of which was published in the Italian media.
The crew is suspected of violating the requirements of the Italian Coast authorities, which control rescue operations in the zone, rather from humanitarian zeal than for any other reason.
The Code of Conduct suggests, primarily, that "juventa" vessels will have on board an Italian police officer who will monitor their activities.
So far, only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have agreed to comply with the Code: "Save the Children," The Maltese MOAs and pro-activa open arms from Spain.
The latter stated on Thursday that the new rules are unnecessary, but acceptable, provided they do not give rise to any "significant changes or interference" of its rescue operations.
Among those who refused to sign, there is also a Nobel Prize for Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF).
Meanwhile, the Ministry of the Interior said that the sharp decline in the number of migrants arriving in Italy as a result of rescue operations in recent weeks indicates that efforts to support the Libyan coast guard and the cooperation with local mayors are bearing fruit.
"In recent days, we have begun to see the light at the end of the tunnel," the minister said.
He announced plans for further negotiations with Libyan mayors on economic development initiatives and Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving those countries in the hope of reaching Europe.
"In Libya we do not want to be associated with any of the Parties to the conflict"
The Russian authorities have recently noticeably stepped up their policies in the Libyan direction, and with visits to Moscow, the delegations of the opposing Libyan parties have been partial.
The head of the Russian Contact Group on the internal Libyan settlement under the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation and State Duma, the Assistant Head of the Chechen Republic, Lev money, told "Kommersant," which goals are being pursued by Moscow in the region and who bet on whom.
The Contact Group on Libya, which you are leading, is almost unknown.
Here, let's say, the Contact Group on Ukraine - about it everyone knows.
And here is the veil of mystery.
What exactly do you do, what goals are being pursued?
The contact group was created at the initiative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation and the State Duma.
Its activities are overseen by Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Bogdanov and Adam Delimkhanov (Duma deputy from Chechnya).
The latter is authorized to work on the Libyan direction of the Speaker of the State Duma, Vyacheslav Volodin.
The formation of the Group was the arrest in Libya of a Russian tanker mechanic CHEBOTAREV (in September 2015, 11 people were on board).
We thought about how to help the crew.
At that time, a contact group from military specialists, representatives of the State Duma, our work was supported by the Head of Chechnya Ramzan Kadyrov.
And how did it happen that you were headed by it?
Since I have been working on Libya since 2008, I have asked me to lead the work of the Group.
Our activity was not limited to the release of sailors with "Chebotareva mechanics."
We have been able to establish contacts with representatives of all major groups opposing each other in the Libyan conflict - and from Tripoli (where the United Nations is based, headed by the United Nations, headed by faizom Saraj. - "Kommersant"), and with tobroum (the residence of Parliament, which is opposed to the Government and supports Marshal Khalifa Haftar, who controls eastern Libya. - "Kommersant.").
Thanks to the active participation of Ahmed Mega (Deputy Prime Minister of Libya," Kommersant "), we managed to quickly agree on the release of Russian sailors.
Then it was decided to make more effective use of these contacts, to create a contact group.
Its task is to analyze the situation, identify key factors and players, dialogue with all parties to the conflict.
I wish to emphasize: in Libya, we do not want to be associated with any of the Parties to the conflict, we are engaged in dialogue with all.
How many people are included in the contact group and how many of them are permanently in Libya?
Now the Contact Group is composed of five people.
Among them there are people who have experience in the security forces, including the Ministry of Defence.
We also want to introduce into the team of specialists in the region, representatives of the Institute of the Middle East.
No one is permanently in Libya, and there is no need to do so.
There are now Russian military advisers in Libya, trainers.
And if so, on whose side?
There are no Russian military specialists in Libya.
All conversations and publications do not correspond to reality.
But in your contact group, former military personnel are...
Yes, and their presence is necessary.
For example, when we visit hot spots.
Or those closed up to a certain point for US cities like Misrata (where the militias are based, which played a role in the overthrow of the Libyan leader Muammar Al-Qadhafi in 2011 and noticeably increased in the coming years." Kommersant ").
We arrived in Misrata in January of this year.
We were frightened, said that there were all the Islamists, terrorists.
But it was important for us to assess the situation there, to analyze the real military potential, who is responsible for what is responsible, why there are such rumours, what is the role of the Islamists in reality.
In Misrata, we met with all the representatives of the detachments who were carrying out the destruction of ISIS in Sirte (in December 2016, this city on the Mediterranean coast was defeated by militants banned in Russia by the Islamic State," Kommersant ").
We wanted to look at them, to get acquainted with these people, to check the information that they played a crucial role in the destruction of the yoke in Libya, and not Khalifa Haftar, who attributed these services to them.
And to what conclusion did you come?
"The Islamic State" in Libya won not Haftar?
He didn't do it.
Haftar conducted operations on the other front, in Benghazi.
And with ISIS in Sirte, the structures under the Government in Tripoli were fighting.
And, by the way, we invited people who conducted this anti-terrorist operation to Russia.
And they came - The visit lasted from 19 to 23 April this year, the Libyan delegation was admitted to the Council of the Federation, in Douma, MIDA and rosguard.
You, as we have understood, are in all Libyan regions and probably represent the sentiments of local elites and warlords.
How do you think it will be possible to implement the ceasefire agreements, the holding of elections, which reached the end of July in Paris, Khalifa Haftar and FAZ Saraj?
Or once again, as has happened in the past, the agreements will be thwarted, the fighting will resume, the parties will try to seize power alone?
For us a good signal was already the fact that Sarraj and Haftar agreed to a regular meeting, not so long ago it was impossible.
In the recent past, both leaders have reacted very negatively to each other.
And as regards Russia's position...
Often they write and say that Moscow is actively supporting Haftar, many in this believe.
We were faced with this situation when they were in Misrata, and Haftar was on this day on board the Russian aircraft carrier Admiral Kuznetsov.
It was a coincidence.
But in Misrata, the coincidence did not believe.
We said: "You are probably very courageous people who come to us today."
But our task is to show: we do not support only Haftar, we are engaged in dialogue with all key players in the conflict in Libya.
You have talked with Haftar.
Does the mutual understanding with Russian partners make it easier to understand the fact that he has twice studied in the USSR?
And, by the way, does Haftar know Russian?
Russian he is, if he knows, very relatively.
But what he has learned from us, of course, facilitates dialogue with him.
And among other things, not only with him.
When we communicate with the military in Tripoli and Misrata, we meet generals who have studied either in Russia or in the Soviet Union.
And that's what they're talking about in Russian.
And pull up to Russia, to some extent there is nostalgia for it.
Do you consider the possible lifting of the arms embargo imposed on Libya?
Are your Libyan interlocutors interested in supplying Russian weapons?
Of course, of course, but as I have said, we do not engage in this conflict and do not want to arm some to the detriment of others.
We would like everyone to be in an equal position.
As far as the arms embargo is concerned, there is a constant call from Libyans that Russia will somehow contribute to its withdrawal.
Currently, the process of drafting the constitution is being actively pursued in Libya.
We hope that the parties will reach compromise solutions, achieve an internal consensus.
Then the elections are to be held, as discussed at the Saraj and Haftar meeting.
If the elections are to be held and finally elected legitimate power (and now none of the Parties has such a status), it is possible to put the issue of lifting the arms embargo in the UN Security Council.
To raise this issue is now senseless and dangerous, it will only lead to an escalation of the conflict.
Recently, the media held information that Italy, faced with the problem of the influx of African refugees from Libya, feels abandoned to the fate of the EU allies.
Can Moscow in this situation help Italian partners, using their links with Libyans?
How, for example, is it realistic that the Haftar units will control the coast and put an end to the business of smugglers transferring immigrants to Europe?
A very timely question.
We are actively working on this.
Italians need Russia's support, because Moscow is engaged in dialogue at the same time and with Haftar, and with sarjam, and with Misrata and the south of the country.
In this regard, the tribes in southern Libya are playing a big role, and they are ready to cooperate with Russia.
This is the fact that southerners stop the flow of migrants on the far side of the border?
So, on the other hand, the buses in which Nigerian migrants travel?
We are striving for this.
But it is not just.
Some clans and groups are interested in these flows to continue.
We look forward to helping to unite Southerners in the negotiating process between Saraj, Haftar and tribes in the south.
But to begin, we would like to see the unity of opinion on this issue between Haftar and Saraj.
The head of the Government in Tripoli, FAA Saraj, is considered an Islamist supporter of the introduction of sharia law in the country.
How radical does he follow?
Will this be an obstacle to building relations with Russia or the West?
I will make my personal opinion about him.
In my opinion, he is, on the contrary, an opponent of radical Islam.
But Islamists are in its coalition.
Yes, but he maintains the position that Libya must be a completely normal country - a moderately Islamic, open world.
And he is also actively fighting terrorists.
Where does he have such a reputation?
It has been created by those countries that are not interested in Russia to communicate with Tripoli.
Tripoli is the capital, there is legislative, executive and judiciary.
There, the National Oil Corporation, the National Bank and other State structures.
Of course, some countries have been interested in seeing we don't get there.
And we all laughed and began to actively communicate with Tripoli, and with tobrom.
And already reaping the fruits of this work: Rosneft has concluded a cooperation agreement with the State Oil Company of Libya - NOC.
The Director of NOC Mustapha sanallah, with whom the head of Rosneft Igor Sechin concluded the deal, himself directly from Tripoli.
And two weeks ago, the first shipment of the Libyan oil company "Rosneft" took place.
What does Russia do with it?
I believe that resell.
And what are Russia's economic interests in Libya?
Plans to resign contracts concluded with Muammar Qadhafi.
These include, in particular, previous agreements in the transport sector (construction of railways), energy (electrification) and a number of others.
And Libyans have what to pay?
Well, they have oil.
So, as in the case of Iran, is the scheme of "oil in exchange for services"?
I don't know what the scheme will be, I don't do it directly.
In fact, the economy for Russia in Libya is not the most important.
We are, in effect, engaged in peacekeeping.
For us, the main thing is to stop the bloodshed, help the Libyans to agree between themselves so that they can establish the order and Libya has ceased to be a conducive environment for the development of terrorism.
For Russia, this is the main task - to help the Libyan people and to issue terrorists from there.
Do you have data about the presence in Libya (now or earlier) of radical militants from Russia or other countries of the former USSR?
One of the tasks of our contact group was to clarify this.
I met with a representative of the Libyan State Security Committee, who said that there is no one from Russia and other countries of the former USSR there.
He said he had about 50 thousand telephone conversations of Islamist and radical groups (in Libya." Kommersant ") and Russian speech there wasn't.
And from what States then these militants?
I wouldn't like to go into these details.
Then we will formulate a question differently.
How many of the Islamists in Libya are the Libyans themselves?
There are practically no Libyans among them, not more than 5%.
The rest are primed.
Can Moscow conduct the intra-libyan negotiations on the example of Paris?
There are such plans.
We are conducting intensive negotiations with Libyans, several delegations from Libya have already visited Moscow, and they have announced their readiness to come back to Moscow or in Grozny.
And when can such negotiations go?
Now it's hard to say.
There are still several visits, and I hope that there will be clarity about the time and place of negotiations.
In the Chekhov Museum, charity collected money on the expensive gift to the Sick Boy
In the Moscow Museum Reserve "Melikhovo," a nine-year-old boy, Sasha mazola, who has a DPC, hydrocephalia of the brain and full blindness, on August 5 will receive a specialized running track.
A useful presentation will be presented by the Minister of Culture of the Moscow Region Oksana Kosarev and the Director of the museum Konstantin Bokov.
Money on the simulator was collected during a charity marathon "don't get tired of doing good," which was held in Melikhov on July 15 on the Memorial Day of Chekhov.
On the eve of the Marathon, the Museum received from Sasha, living in the village of manushkino, Chekhov District, a letter: "I don't see eyes at all, so I asked mum to write this letter."
"I would like to get a bit of a running track so that my legs become strong, and I would be a little bit learning to walk."
And here's a dream come true!
After service in the Museum-Reserve, the "post-script concert" will take place - a well-known pianist, the Honored Artist of Russia, Aleksandr Gindin, will perform Parry from popular classical works.
During the charity marathon in mellikhov, the choir of the Voznesenskaya desert, zvonari's workshop, Ilya drozdikhin, students of the Moscow Conservatory named after P.I. Tchaikovsky and the Russian Academy named after gnesno, artists of mellikovsky Theatre "Chekhov studio."
There were auctions for visitors, a book fair and a charity sale of souvenir products with the marathon logo were organized.
The museum reserve "Melikhovo" took the initiative to make the Memorial Day of Chekhov 15 July a single day of charity in all the Museum of the Moscow region.
A 30-year-old resident of Olevsk Zhytomyr region near the local football stadium was shot several times in the direction of teenagers who were there.
According to the suspect, he was angry with the noise, reported "facts" in the police communications department of Zhitomir region.
After that, the man went to a café nearby.
He had a conflict in the building, during which the man used the device to shoot rubber bullets, injuring one of the visitors.
The 34-year-old victim received the necessary medical care, there is no threat to his life.
Police and Emergency Medical Care arrived at the scene, but the shooter had fled to that time.
The law enforcement agencies established his identity and detained on the same day, on August 2.
The man was unable to explain his actions.
He has seized a device for firing rubber bullets, which has been sent for expertise.
Criminal proceedings were initiated under article 296 (hooliganism) of the Criminal Code of Ukraine.
The detained person faces imprisonment for a term of between 3 and 7 years.
Recall, in Kiev, in lukyanovka, in the area of the street of Tatarstan on the night of July 28, a shooting attack took place.
Michelle Carter's sentence for messages that led to the suicide of Konrad Roy
The Massachusetts resident was sentenced to two and a half years of imprisonment for the fact that she was encouraged by text messages and phone calls to suicide by his boyfriend, Conrad Roy.
Michelle Carter, who is now 20 years old, will have to spend 15 months of his time behind bars and another five years of probation.
Carter in June was found guilty of the murder of Konrad Roy, who committed suicide on July 13, 2014.
Father Roy said at the hearing on Thursday: "My family killed GoM.
My son was my best friend."
Carter was allowed to remain at large before the appeal.
She was threatened with a maximum of 20 years, but her lawyers stated that she and Roy suffered from mental disorders.
Carter, dressed in red trousers and a cream blouse, listened to the sentence of standing, compressed hands and lowered his eyes.
"by her actions, she killed Konrad Roy," the Prosecutor told the court.
"She interrupted his life to improve her.
She did not accept responsibility," she said.
"She did not show repentance."
But Carter's lawyer said it was "a tragic case she deeply regrets."
However, Judge Lawrence Monis said that, in his opinion, her "age, maturity or even mental illness did not have a significant impact on her actions."
The Prosecutor read out statements by Mother Roy Lynn Roy, which says: "No day has passed when I would not have paid for the loss of my beloved Son.
I want him to be proud of me and how I am doing - I try to support his sisters, despite all the pain that will remain with us forever," he says.
Sister Roy camdin Roy said she's unassailable that she would never be able to attend his wedding or become the aunt of his children.
"The person who has always been with me since my birth is a pain that will remain with me until the end of life," she said.
This case appears to be a legal precedent, since there is no law in Massachusetts that would be responsible for the Council to commit suicide.
In 2014, when Roy was found in a car dead with symptoms of uggar-gas poisoning, Carter was 17 years old.
The case drew the attention of the entire country when it became known that he had been pushed into suicide by Carter's message.
"You can hang up, jump from the roof, kill yourself with a knife, don't know there are many ways," she wrote in several reports sent two weeks before his death, when he was resting with his family.
In a few minutes before the suicide she wrote: "You have to do it, Conrad" and "You need only to include healing, and you are free and happy."
Judge IHRA said Carter wanted to get attention to the death of Roy, and banned her from communicating with the press in order not to give her the desired.
The opinions of lawyers on this issue were divided.
One of the few who defended Carter was Amanda Knox, who was convicted in 2007 for the murder in Italy of his British neighbourhood apartment and acquitted two years later.
A 30-year-old NOx published his dissenting opinion in the Los Angeles Times, saying: "Michelle Carter deserves sympathy and help, not prisons."

"Audi" to be modified to 850,000 diesel vehicles
A day before the announcement by Audi, BMW announced that it would offer an update of the software for more than 350,000 vehicles.
The Chairman of the "BMW" said the company believes that "there are more intelligent ways than driving restrictions," referring to European cities, including Munich, where BMW is located, which considered the possibility of banning or limiting the use of diesel vehicles.
Daimler said Thursday that three million Mercedes cars in Europe are being modified to reduce their diesel emissions.
None of the companies called their withdrawal.
European automakers have actively promoted the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to promote compliance with the carbon dioxide regulations.
But nitrogen oxides that emit diesel engines are considered carcinogens and can cause asthma.
The cost of installing equipment, which neutralizes the exhaust gases of diesel vehicles, is also increasing, and it is difficult to maintain a competitive price for cars.
While German automobile manufacturers are under close care, Chancellor Angela Merkel's government has also been accused of pushing influential automakers and ignoring the signs of the problem.
Companies try not to repeat the mistakes of "Volkswagen," which has hidden the use of so-called "defeat devices," which during the test could be used to correct the amount of harmful gases emitted to comply with the rules, and under normal driving conditions.
In the United States, a number of "Volkswagen" leaders have been convicted, the rest are under investigation on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, in Germany, the former Chief of the thermodynamics division was arrested in the "Audi" Engine Development Group.
The former manager, zakkeo Giovanni pamio, Italian, is therefore not protected from extradition and can be brought before a court in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi came under German criminal investigation involving "Volkswagen" after the authorities accused "Audi" in the installation of the system to circumvent the European emission regulations and expanded the investigation, which was previously focused on the United States.
The inclusion of "Audi" in the investigation may create serious problems "Volkswagen": the manufacturer of elite cars is a source of a disproportionate share of "Volkswagen."
In Astrakhan, the visitor of the CAFE paid counterfeit money
The police received a report from the employee of the Bank's office on the discovery of the amount of money received from the point of the General Pita, a suspicious banknote of 5 thousand rubles.
A study conducted in the expert forensic Centre showed that she was a fake.
As reported by the umvd of Russia on the Astrakhan region, the banknote was paid by one of the visitors of the cafe, who bought Shaurma.
It should be noted that the cashier's office was not equipped with an instrument for determining the authenticity of the banknote.
Currently, the police are set up by the persons involved in the construction and marketing of a knowingly fake ticket by the Central Bank of the Russian Federation.
Such crimes are punishable by imprisonment for up to 8 years with a fine of up to 1 million roubles.
The Regional Directorate of the Ministry of Internal Affairs calls on the residents of Astrakhan Region to be careful in the commission of financial transactions; it is recommended that the workers of the trade facilities should establish instruments to verify the authenticity of the funds received.
Astronomers found the "hell" planet on which even iron could melt
For the first time, after studying the properties of the giant exoplanet under the name wasp-121b, astrophysicists were much surprised by its temperature, which is able to evaporate iron and other metals.
Specialists drew attention to the fact that the water molecules are so warm with the stars, which emit infrared radiation.
The Hubble telescope sealed the water molecules on this gas giant: This high temperature causes water in the atmosphere of the planet to glow in the infrared range.
Wp-121b refers to the so-called "hot southerners" - gas giants, in size and mass comparable to the largest planet of the solar system, but in dozens of times closer to the parent star.
This year, there is only 1.3 "Earth" days on the exoplanet, and its gas shell is almost up to 2,500 degrees Celsius.
Climate change threatens LaVende in Provence.
It became a symbol of Provence and South France, but there are now fears that it is threatened by climate change.
Lavender has become worse due to dry weather and vector-borne insects; this has led to a constant headache of scientists and farmers who try to find a solution.
Eric shees, an expert from the Provence Agricultural Research Institute, says: "Lavanda in Provence is really at risk because in recent years this plant feels the effects of climate change: in spring and especially in the autumn, the rains have become much smaller.
This affects the life expectancy of lavender.
And there are still small cycades that jump on the leaves of insects that carry micro-bacteria; in a very dry weather, they are very much."
Very much is at stake.
Lavender is not only attracted by the holiday; the avalanche oil is very popular in perfumery and cosmetology.
Eric shees says: "Instead of very long ears with a large number of large flowers we have small, underdeveloped, weakened or absent.
Therefore, we have fewer parts containing essential oils."
The solutions that are currently being considered include improving water distribution and slowing evaporation from the soil, as well as spraying plants with a protective mixture of clay and water, and breeding varieties more resistant to drought.
Ambassador winter universiade-2019 met with Krasnoyarsk schoolchildren
The two-time champion of the World Ice Hockey World, the Ambassador of the winter universiade-2019, Aleksandr Semin, met on the eve of the beginning of the Ice Hockey Championships and gave autographs to fans.
The meeting took place in the Shatra Winter Universiade in the framework of the thematic week devoted to ice hockey.
Any visitor of the Shatra could have been able to ride on the horses on the site with an artificial ice.
In addition to this, relay races, Victorians and games with the drawing of souvenir products of student games were organized, a smog from the Federation of aerobics Federation.
50 schoolchildren participated in the event.
Aleksandr Semin advised the guys as much as possible at sporting venues and stressed that the most important thing in the initial stage of the training is hard work and a huge desire to engage in hockey.
"It's great that in Krasnoyarsk there is such a platform, like the Winter Universiade 2019, where starting athletes can directly ask questions of the teams of teams," the champion said.
It should be noted that the promotion of student sports and healthy lifestyle among Krasnoyarsk is helping the ambassadors of the winter universiade-2019.
The Universiade will work for the entire summer season until September 25, the press service of the Directorate of the winter universiade-2019 reports.
Medvedev commented on Medvedev's words
The official spokesman of the U.S. Department of State, Heather nauert, commenting on the briefing by the Prime Minister of the Russian Federation Dmitry Medvedev, said the need to find "areas for interaction" with Russia.
According to her, such areas should be found to "improve bilateral interaction."
An example of such a successful cooperation, naert called the Syria Armistice Agreement.
We are two nuclear super-Powers.
"and people around the world agree that the US and Russia should be able to work with each other," the diplomat said.
At the same time, nauert declined to comment on Medvedev's approval of a full-fledged trade war between Russia and the USA.
"If Russia so said, it certainly has the right to speak, but more on this topic I cannot say anything," said the representative of the State Department.
Earlier, U.S. President Donald Trump signed a bill to tighten sanctions against the Russian Federation.
Commenting on the new sanctions package, the head of the RF Government announced that Washington declared Moscow a full-fledged trade war, putting an end to the hope of improving bilateral relations.
Medvedev also stated that the U.S. sanctions will act for decades.
In addition, the Prime Minister believes that the American establishment "wclean beat" Trump.
The missing in the Moscow bodybuilder found a lost memory on a stranger
Bodibilder Shamil hanmetov was missing on the road to Noginsk on July 25 in very pictorial circumstances: he went out of the car to go to the toilet.
Seven days he was unsuccessful in searching for familiar and local residents.
And he went on a Shamel on a stranger in Ramensky.
He was completely naked in his toilet.
The Dagestan athlete was unable to explain how it was here and what happened to him.
He wasn't even able to remember his name, and the passport was missing.
The identification of the person helped the announcement of his missing.
Arriving at the call of Medici, hanmetov recorded a partial loss of memory and a brain injury, reports pablik mash.
Probably, the athlete is waiting for other surprises.
The intruders, who had kidnapped Shamil, probably had already visited his apartment, the keys of which he had also stolen.
The oil and gas revenues of July exceeded the forecast of 7.4 billion rubles
In fact, the oil and gas revenues received from July 2017 exceeded the estimate by 7.4 billion roubles, the Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation reports.
The excess, as explained by the Agency, was primarily due to the higher exchange rate of the United States dollar to the rouble, compared to the average monthly value of June used for the assessment, as well as the excess of the actual volume of gas production and the volume of exports of petroleum products to the projected levels.
"The rejection of the oil and gas revenues of the federal budget from the monthly estimate, corresponding to the Federal Law on the federal budget for 2017-2019, is forecast in August 2017 in the amount of + 40.2 billion rubles."
Thus, the total amount of funds sent for the purchase of foreign currency on the domestic currency market during the period from August 7 to September 6, 2017 is 47.6 billion roubles.
Accordingly, the daily volume of the purchase of foreign currency will amount to 2.07 billion roubles.
The Bank of Russia will be attracted to the Commission of the purchase of foreign currency by the Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation.
Every working day during the specified period, the Central Bank will conclude transactions on the purchase of foreign currency at the organized tender of the Moscow Exchange, evenly over the course of the trading day.
The foreign currency acquired will be credited to the Federal Treasury in the Central Bank.
The murder of a journalist emphasizes that Mexico is becoming increasingly dangerous.
Employees of the weekly newspaper riodos usually meet on Wednesdays to discuss plans to cover the latest violent crimes in the State of Sinaloa, linked to organized crime, corrupt officials or the ongoing war of drug traffickers.
But today, given their own tragedy, they met to talk about security.
They said they should change their habits.
Two senior journalists discussed what appears to be safer: take children with themselves in an office, which in 2009 has already thrown a grenade, or leave them at home.
The security experts wrote on the board, hanging in the room, three words: enemies, neutral people, allies.
They asked journalists to name names for each column - proof is not necessary, suspicion and internal sensations will be enough.
These are drug traffickers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected of being content with the Government or cartels, a whole list of undergraduates, which makes the work on reporting chaos in Mexico dangerous.
Violence does not provide respite, and among the bodies that multiply in the country, more and more journalists: according to the Committee for the protection of journalists, no less than 25 since President Enrico Pena Nieto took office in December 2012; 589 people after attacks and threats are under federal protection; and this year, at least seven people have died in seven states.
Among the latter are their publisher and inspirer, the co-founder of the "riodos" Javier Valdés Cardenas.
"The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his many books on violent crimes related to drugs.
His absence is very serious, although his presence is everywhere - a large photograph of Valdez, showing the middle finger, with the inscription "justice" hanging on the facade of the "riodos" building; two reporters for 30, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear T-shirts on which his smile, a face in glasses or his firm Panama.
The Seminar takes place less than two months after his death; journalists discuss their common trauma, their nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.
Although the Office of the special federal prosecutor was organized in 2010 to investigate investigative journalism, only two cases have been investigated, according to the Committee for the protection of journalists.
As in the case of most of the thousands of murders related to drug trafficking and organized crime every year, the killers of journalists are rarely brought to justice.
"riodos" journalists insist that they will write about violence in Sinaloa, though they are killed by GoM, though around now is much more dangerous.
Without information about the killers, without justice from conversations about security at meetings, there is little benefit, says Ibarra.
"It's very stupid to spend time at this seminar," he says.
"As long as we don't know the cause, we suspect everyone."
On the morning of 15 May, Valdés left the "riodos" office in the capital of the state of kuliakane.
He managed to travel only a couple of neighbourhoods before his red Toyota was stopped by two men; he was dragged out of the car and shot at him 12 times, probably because of the name of the newspaper, which means "Twelfth river."
The shooter left his car and crashed nearby.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He had a wife and two adult children.
Rumours usually flow quickly on the couliacanu.
But Valdez is almost all silent.
Since Guzman was arrested and extradited to the USA last January, Sinaloa became one of the most bloody battlefields in the country, as rival factions struggle to fill the vacuum created.
Let us not say that every day in the streets of Sinaloa is killing one or more people, or that the Cemetery has been filled with the stolen two-storey mausoleum of drug lords, which are more than the houses of many living people.
Let us forget that the State of "calm" is just when one of the cartels takes control of the Primorskiy state with important ports and routes of drug trafficking, leading in the USA.
Despite this, Valdes knew perfectly well about the dangers of his work, Ismail bohorkes, the 60-year-old co-founder and the Director of the "riodos," a sense of guilt for the fact that he was not able to protect the friend.
He thinks that the murder has helped two mistakes.
First, in February an interview with Damas Lopez, the leader of one of the rival factions of the cartel, which is fighting with the sons of Gusman, was published.
The publication could distribute sons; the people who were allegedly members of the gang, the Assembly of all copies of the publication, once they were delivered to the kiosks.
The second mistake was that he did not force Valdez for his own security to leave the country after the other newspaper was seized, which wrote about the same story.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his murder was seen as a regular milestone in the development of violence against journalists in Mexico.
He was so long away from the danger, his friends and colleagues thought he would always be.
He was an experienced reporter in the "Noroeste" and in 2003, together with five colleagues, founded "riodos," selling his 50-dollar shares.
In Sinaloa," it was impossible to engage in journalism without affecting the subject of drugs," bohorkes said.
Over time, the newspaper has earned the reputation of bold and honest publication, sales and advertising revenues.
Journalists liked that they could publish courageous reports, without fear of censorship, and readers were attracted to the publication that they could read about what no one had dared to write.
Eight years after its founding, riodos received the prestigious Maria mourse Cabo award for the reporter's work in Latin America.
In the same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Prize for the courage to investigate the Drug Trade of Mexico, wherever it did.
He frankly admitted that he was scared.
"I want to live further," he said at the CJ Award.
Drug trafficking in Sinaloa is "a lifestyle," he said last October in an interview with rompevievo TV.
"You have to accept the tasks that lie on you as a journalist - either, or you just like the fool."
I don't want me to ask: "What did you do when there were so many deaths... Why did you not say what is happening?"
"riodos" staff are bored by waldesau, a joke, who has collapsed like a porter in the port, a friend, a generous embrace and advice, a teacher who knew how to make a living.
They relied on their own order.
He had to wear his hat always.
He was to walk to El guaiyambo, a bar opposite the office, and always sit there behind the same table.
Now they ask: he has destroyed his love for a single set order?
His death forced and questioned them in their calculations of how best to do their job and stay alive.
"They don't like when you're dealing with their wives, children, in their legal business and in clandestine airfields for the transport of drugs.
"These things were behind the line," bohorkes said.
The result, even in the best times, was a high level of self-censorship and a desire for self-preservation.
You have to believe your instincts.
Keep away from what is bad.
The problem, says the editor of "riodos," Andrés Villareal, is that "the smell can be deceived... and then what happened to Javier."
The old rules, he says, are no longer operating in Sinaloa - as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other States, where there is a poisonous mixture of lucrative smuggling routes, weak State institutions and corrupt officials.
The landscape is constantly changing.
In a room where "riodos" gathered for security training, suddenly it was banned to make cell phones: A few days before it became known that spy programs that are sold exclusively to governments are used in Mexico to monitor journalists and public activists.
The outside two policemen are hiding in the shade of wood from 104-degree heat (40 degrees Celsius).
They have given the state government to protect the Office of the "riodos," which is located in a four-story building in the bourgeois quarter of the kuliakana.
Some journalists were asked whether they were not included in the 50 per cent of the servants of the Order, which the governor himself said he could not be trusted.
A few months ago, journalists went to the mountainous terrain, which is de facto controlled by drug traffickers.
In the immediate issue of "riodos," there were three main themes.
This is the murder in Sinaloa brother of former boxing champion Julio sezara Chavez.
They were still exposed to government spending concentrated in the home city of the Governor.
And there was a group kidnapping of people in one of the most expensive restaurants in the restaurant, in the district of the Prosecutor's Office.
It was not officially announced who was kidnapped or as it happened, so it was necessary to observe caution when it was time to write that all in the city knew that it was a favorite restaurant at the same time drug dealers and authorities.
One of their journalists learned from open databases that the restaurant was registered in the name of a politician belonging to the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), which dominated all levels of government over the past century.
Recently, a few governors from PRI have launched high-profile allegations of corruption.
Villareal asked journalists to write about previous incidents in this restaurant, including when the son of "El chapo" Guzmán fell asleep from the military.
A few months ago, readers would seek a column of Valdez with the most reliable information about the abduction.
"Earlier we would already know what happened," says the 46-year-old Villareal, for his bad telltale, called "El Flaco."
"Today, all channels of communication with our sources are broken."
The Valdez cabinet is now used as a warehouse for posters and stylists against the murder of journalists, because the staff have become those who never thought to become: activists acting on behalf of the press.
Journalist Miriam Ramirez took several posters and went to the next morning to demonstrate the local prosecutor's office dedicated to another journalist.
El Salvador Adame disappeared in the State of Michoacán in the west of the country three days after Valdés was killed.
They found a burnt body, and the authorities said it was based on DNA tests.
Throughout the country, journalists began to speak louder, organize protests and write "SOS press" on sidewalks and walls of houses.
On that day, the Director of bohorkes was in Washington trying to secure international support for the Justice requirement in the Valdez case.
At a meeting with the Governor of Sinaloa The following day, after the murder of Valdez Ramírez, the authorities accused the authorities of spying for journalists and ordering their murder for what they say the truth.
She then asked not to give her more tasks to publicize the Government's activities, fearing that anger would damage her objectivity.
Valdés said many times that journalists in Mexico are "surrounded" by organized crime, its accomplices in the Government and the indifferent society.
In his last book," Drug journalism," he wrote that reporters are killing not just gangs of drug traffickers; they do so according to the orders of politicians and security services in collusion with organized crime.
The press protection committee "artikulo 19" believes that half of the attacks against journalists last year were done by police and government officials.
"In Mexico you die because they want you to shut down," Ramirez says.
Of course, the killings are frightening.
Everyone remembers the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias six years ago in the northern border state of Tamaulipas.
Her body found a note supposedly written from the face of the cartel of ZEAS: "I am here because of my articles."
The computer keyboard and headphones were lying close to her head.
Some of the publications have chosen to close as the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state of Chihuahua after having killed her correspondent Miroslav brić in March.
Others continue to hold as "El magnac" from Nuevo Laredo after the murder of her leader in 2004.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juárez publicly contacted drug cartels through a drafting article on the first page, entitled "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists have left their home States or in general.
This is a painful decision.
In exile, it is difficult to find work, and they still see danger on the streets.
And sometimes they are killed, as apparently happened to the photographer, Reuben Espinosa, who was killed in 2015, together with four women in the apartment, three months after the flight from Veracruz.
Those who remain and continue to work on a daily balance between risky decisions.
Ibarra - who once dreamed of being a poet - acknowledges that he is scared to write about drug trafficking.
"Mexico is going to hell, and that is why I became a journalist," he says.
Last Friday, at midnight, when the last issue was ready for the press, the editors of "riodos" sat on the pavement next to the Office and drank beer when their phones were at the same time.
A series of exchanges between rival gangs and security forces near the resort town of Mazatlán left behind, according to confirmed data, 19 bodies.
The war continued to rage, as was promised in a series of messages from cartels found in the area.
Sitting on the pavement, they, through the mobile phone, put news on the "riodos" website.
The next day it was necessary to turn the first page.
The Sirens took off the sirens - another shooting in the vicinity.
Bohorkes looked ready to defend their police officers.
If they were scared, they didn't show anything.
Sitting under a huge portrait of the deceased founder of their newspaper, whose average finger was displayed on the whole of Sinaloa, the "riodos" staff continued his business.
"How can you think about closing," said bohorkes, "If on the very day when Javier was killed, the practitioner asked me to send her to the street to make a report?"
Dinosaurs used camouflage to avoid enemies
At first glance, he seems to be a statue, though terrifying.
The researchers said that the first discovered remains of an incredible creature with rhinoceros, discovered by the Canadian chess player, remained so well that the experts called him "a wet Liza among dinosaurs."
It was so well preserved that they could even determine that the colour of his Czech skin was reddish brown - and to say that he had a "dark past."
In a report published in the journal "Modern biology," it was described as "the most well preserved of tireofor in the history of the discovery and one of the best copies of the dinosaurs in the world."
This is the fossil - a recently found copy of the nodoosaurus, which lived in the middle of the period, between 110 million and 112 million years ago.
His incredible good condition has stunned the researchers who call him "really remarkable."
This travorous tireofor is the most well preserved fossil of this kind in the history of Nakhodka, according to the articles in the National Geographic Journal.
He was found to be a shock fan when he was working at the Millenium mine company Sankor near Forta McMurray in north Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011.
He stumbled on something that seemed different from the environment, and decided to look more closely.
The minerals discovered were sent to the Royal tirrellovsky Paleontological Museum.
The next six years have been carried out to detect the animal inside a mass of 2,500 footballers (1100 kilograms).
Now, when all this hard work is done, the finished result can be demonstrated.
"It's just a little bit to come, and you can almost believe that he sleeps," said the leading author of Caleb Brown, a Fellow of the Royal tyrrellovsky Paleontological Museum, where the creation was demonstrated.
"He will enter the history of science as one of the most beautiful and most well-preserved copies of dinosaurs - Mona Lisa among dinosaurs."
By studying his skin, researchers discovered that it was a traitor, despite the fact that it was covered by pancym and resembled a walking tank, apparently exposed to a significant danger from the carnivorous dinosaurs.
This covered powerful Panzer dinosaurus used the red-white camouflage to hide from predators, and used protective equipment, known as a protective colour, which also uses many of the animals of our days.
This would allow him to merge with the environment and avoid meeting with enemies, experts say, suggesting that the larger dinosaurs were hunting.
This is the essence of the age of 110 million years, which belongs to the family of the nodozavarov family, was widely covered in the press in May, and is now at an exhibit in the Royal tirrellovsky Paleontological Museum.
Scientists have already studied the animal and gave him the name of borealopelta markmitchelli in honor of the museum laboratory laboratory, Mark Mitchell, one of the participants of the group who spent more than 7,000 hours for his painstaking excavations.
The surprising preservation of the copy allowed Dr. Mitchell and the international group of scientists to document the drawing and shape of the Czech and the pancinous plates on his body.
They found a protective colour, a common method of protection in the kingdom of animals, which means that the top of the substance was darker than its lower side.
Although the protective colour is well spread, the discovery became unexpected, because the size of the dinosaurs borealopelta is significantly higher than the size of the currently living animals with a protective margin.
It can be assumed that this dinosaur has been so actively hunting the carnivorous dinosaurs, that evolution has chosen to mask confrontation as a way of survival.
But most modern animals with a protective margin - for example, deer, zebras or Brooks - are significantly smaller and are more readily available, which shows that nodoosaurus has had to fight seriously for survival.
"a serious threat from predators for a massive, covered by a powerful Panzer of dinosaurs shows how dangerous were the predatory dinosaurs," Brown said.
The chemical analysis of organic compounds in the Czech dinosaurs also shows that his skin was to be reddish brown.
Scientists continue to study the animal, to know about his life, including the preserved content of his digestive tract, to find out what he was eating during his last meal.
They believe that when dinosaurs died, he fell into the river and was caught in the sea, where he sank and bent down to the bottom of the ocean.
At those times, Alberta was so warm as now in the south of Florida, and rivers and oceans are likely to spread much farther into the land than now.
"This nodoosaurus is truly remarkable because it is fully covered by the preserved Czech skin, and at the same time it has been completely preserved in three dimensions, while preserving the original form of the animal," Brown said.
"As a result, the animal now looks almost as much as it looked at the early melodic period.
It is not necessary to use the imagination in order to recreate it, it costs only slightly to come to terms, and you can almost believe that he sleeps."
The time period is an epoch when giant teropoons, carnivorous dinosaurs, standing on two legs, Brooks on the ground.
Although the most remarkable of them, Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived for millions of years later than borealopelta, on tirefora could hunt someone from his groceries.
They include the acrocantons, a monster of 38 feet (11.5 metres) weighing six tons.
Scientists, whose latest discoveries are published in the journal "Modern biology," believe borealopelta was after death at sea and mummified in Ille.
The creature was found by a fan fan when he was working at the Millenium mine near Fort McMurray in north Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011.
According to the staff of the Museum, this is the most well preserved tireophor in the world, together with the skin and pancym, and he has served, from the seas to the poor bones.
On average, these creatures reached approximately 18 feet (five metres) in length and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kilograms).
Their characteristic feature was two 20-inch chips from the shoulder.
Researchers believe that this travovorous tireofor has been hard to go to what is now Canada, while the river didn't get it into the open sea.
But the underwater burial of dinosaurs has preserved its Panzer with precision to the smallest details.
The fossils of this particular instance are so well preserved that the remnants of the skin are still covered by brown pancirclement plates along the skull of dinosaurs.
As Michael sinner wrote in an article for the National Geographic magazine, such a degree of security is "rare, as a win in the lottery."
The longer I look at him, the more striking he seems.
The fossils of the skin are still covered by brown pancirclement plates, which are filled with the skull of the animal.
His right front leg is stretched along the side, five fingers on it roll up.
I can read the Czechs on his soles."
Mikhail Saakashvili managed to get to Poland without documents
Mikhail Saakashvili, who had previously led Georgia, and then the Odessa region in Ukraine, flew to Poland.
However, he did so without having documents confirming his identity and citizenship.
On the arrival of Saakashvili, the Polish publication Telewizja Republika, who posted on his channel in YouTube video with his speech.
Saakashvili spoke at an event in honor of the anniversary of the Warsaw uprising against Hitler troops in 1944.
As the politician does not know Polish, although he tried to start speech in this language, he had to speak English through the Polish translator.
During his speech, the politician touched on the topic of cooperation between Georgia and Poland, as well as spoke about Ukraine.
That the Migration Service of Ukraine has deprived him of his citizenship, the oppositional politician learned from the U.S..
As he managed to carry out the transatlantic flight without documents, it is not known.
Previously, former Governor of Odessa region Mikhail Saakashvili stated that his signature on the questionnaire for the acquisition of citizenship of Ukraine was forged.
The politician stressed that he did not complete any questionnaire.
Duration of the investigation in the case of weinziger and olkhovka is extended until January
The period of preliminary investigation in the case of the co-owner of the Group of Companies "Renova" Yevgeny olkhovka and the head of the energy holding "t plus" Boris vainzikera is extended until January 2, 2018.
On Thursday, 3 August, in the Basmanov court, the issue of the extension of the accused house arrest is being considered.
The representative of the UK at the Meeting reported on the decision last time to extend the duration of the preliminary investigation.
"The special difficulty and duration of the investigation is due to the need to seize and carry out the examination of a large number of documents, as well as to conduct investigative actions on the territory of several subjects of the Russian Federation," The investigator said.
He added that the suspects regularly gave bribes to the management of the Komi Republic.
Their total size is estimated at not less than a billion roubles.
According to the investigation, vainziher, Olkhovich, as well as the former head of CJSC Complex Energy Systems, Mikhail sloboone, who was headed by Vimpelcom until September 5, handed over to the top officials of the Republic of Komi a bribe for the establishment of the most profitable tariffs for heat and electricity, as well as for the creation of favourable conditions for business.
Weinzicher and Olkhovich were detained, stormed in Syktyvkar and arrested for two months, the Sloboda fled from the investigation and was announced in the Federal search.
How one activist learned the answer to the question "whose streets?"
On August 9, 2014 Brittany Ferrel was shocked to the depth of the soul.
Just a day after arriving in New York as part of a tourist trip from St. Louis sidela on the bed in an apartment rented via Airbnb, watching the Facebook Facebook page on the phone.
She was pushed to the post of someone from the secondary school.
There said: "The police have just killed an 18-year-old child, and he is still lying in the middle of the street."
Drawing attention to the fact that no one of her tape did this information, puzzled, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
In her lente there were many relocations of the user with the nickname @ theepharoah.
Rapper from greater St. Louis, in real time, covered the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old subcontinent, killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri.
He published a photograph of Brown's lifeless body, spreading among the street, where it will be four hours.
"It's a ditch," the Ferrel thought.
But death was not something new to her and her circle.
She postponed the phone, and later in the evening he returned to tweets that people were gathering on the Kenfield drive.
There were photos of a signal tape and screaming people and a person who claimed he was Brown, who held a poster with the words: "A police officer from Ferguson has just killed my unarmed son!"
She looked at a live broadcast, as a police officer stood before a group of protesters with a dog dog.
On another video of another police officer, she said, "she got up with a rifle and ran away:" I'll kill you all... animals! "
"It's a non-standard situation," said Ferrel, according to his own memories.
"It is not a murder like those to which we are accustomed and which can be described as typical.
At that time, I felt oznob.
I was angry and crying."
She took a ticket for a return flight and took home the next day.
Landing at 11 pm, she married her six-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided that they both would go to Ferguson on the next morning.
What happened with Ferrel and Ferguson in the next three years was the theme of the new documentary "whose streets?," which will be released on August 11.
This is a story about survival and protest, love and loss, strength and resilience from the point of view of people living in the community and responding to the streets, demanding answers.
As long as the Ferrel went to Ferguson with a daughter dressed in a dress in the flower and venk, they recalled the conversation that had led up to this morning countless times," on the experiences of black people and their position."
She recalls how she said: "remember how I told you how black people had to fight for what they believed?
We are currently eating in Ferguson, because a police officer killed an 18-year-old boy, and it was wrong."
"I couldn't do it," said Ferrel later.
"What is happening today is the culmination of what happened earlier.
She must know about it, see it and raise it up.
It must not only be well versed in activism and the Organization, but also understand the different levels of experience of black and black and what we must do to become free to free.
Even if I can provide it with an environment in which she personally does not face obvious racism, she is no different from any other black girl.
I feel that she would have a bad service if she was upset by it."
When they arrived in Ferguson, the first stop they did on South florissant-road, on the road from the police station, which became something like a tent camp, while activists were waiting for reports of the final failure of officer Darren Wilson
There, Ferrel with a daughter joined the local entrepreneur who prepared lunch packages.
They collected packages and helped to distribute their protesters.
A new type of activism took shape in the minds of the Ferrel.
"My activism has changed completely after August 9," she said, noting that as a student of the University of missouri-st. Louis, she was President of the Association of nursing students, representatives of national minorities, and food justice and health inequalities among black communities.
"I didn't have the experience of the organizer.
It's right."
A few weeks later, the Ferrel met with Saba folayan, one of his companions.
Folian said she and her chief operator Lucas Alvaro fairer "just wanted to document" events.
Ferrel came to the head: "You want to document, or try to find a story on which you can play?"
This skepticism was visited by numerous people, often white, who came to the community to benefit from his pain and steadfastness.
As explained in a recent interview with folayan," We've heard that the voices of people who were born and grew up in Ferguson don't get into the center of attention, and wanted to do it differently."
Folian has already joined with his wife, David Davis, a local artist known for his activism on the death penalty.
His participation aroused the sympathy of the project at Ferrel and the six local residents with whom the project team "whose streets?" supported the link over the years following the murder of brown.
"In this documentary, no one speaks for us or with us, it's we say," Davis said.
"It was the most important thing for me, as these people will be represented, because it is how I will be presented myself."
Although the aim of the project was not to focus on the experience of Ferrel - in an effort to show that the movement "is not about the Saviour, but about how the community is uniting," as folian said, it was the most open of the film.
As a result," whose streets? "are shown unexpectedly personal aspects of life Ferrel, for example, how she fell in love and married his wife.
"I felt naked," said Ferrel, with laughter telling me how to see the finished product for the first time.
"But I've understood that when you do this, you must have a certain level of vulnerability."
Moreover, the story of Ferrel is again discussing and emphasizes the role of Black gay women in the broader context of the "Black Life" movement.
Two of the three founding members of the Movement - those who created tag # blacklivesmatter on social media after the murder of a black teenager Traona Martin in 2012 - counts themselves to homosexuals.
"Black gay women in leadership positions support all this movement," says Ferrel. - And all because we are constantly fighting on several fronts.
Black homosexual women have to bear this burden."
Folian agreed with this statement, noting that "the movement is actually supported by black women and many homosexual black women."
However, she insists that "this is not a case of positive discrimination," and that Ferrel was not elected at the central character of the film because of its distinctive features.
"She was the person who tried this energy," she said.
"On the other hand, it's not a coincidence that it was on the first plane because when"
You can feel her energy through the screen."
Meanwhile, in Ferguson, there have been no cameras for a long time, but there are still complex racial links between the community and the police.
The Ferrel for two and a half years will be on the test period for the reopening of the highway during the demonstration.
She describes the social and political atmosphere of the place, which calls home, simply: "bardak."
She is still behind the rectum, which she learned when he went to Ferguson streets three years ago.
We must fight for our freedom.
We must win.
We must love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose except our chains."

The emergence of similarities: The artist creates portraits with the help of the DNA of Chelsea Manning
In the center of the hall in the Friedman Gallery in New York with the ceiling on the wire, people are white, black and brown, all of which are similar to each other.
These 30 portraits were created by the artist, Heather gyi-harborg, from the brushes and hair cuts sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent cuts from fort-levworth prison, where the former intelligence analyst is serving a 35-year period for the famous transfer of confidential diplomatic telegrams on WikiLeaks.
The new exhibition, which was launched on August 2, is called "the emergence of similarities."
This is the result of two years of correspondence between Gyi harborg, whose art brings together technology, information and art, and manning, a transgender woman and a famous dissident, whom Barack Obama softened the sentence just three days before the end of his presidency.
Having analysed with the help of the DNA computer program received from manning, and using it to create three-dimensional portraits of people who could be with such a genome, Gyi harborg created a deep, though not easy to understand Manifesto, dedicated not only to the plasticity of the DNA data - different ways of their interpretation and the invincible Determinism of these interpretations - but also the notion of identity.
Manning, who was born with the name Bradley Edward, but from adolescence, openly said he was a woman, in 2013 was sentenced to 20 episodes, including six violations of the espionage act, computer fraud and theft.
Her photographs in the prison were not available, so only one photograph was known: the Black Black white Selfie, where manning in a platinum shade of Paris, clearly feeling uncomfortable, sits behind the car; with this photo and became associated with it.
In 2015, gyi-harborg successfully completed its 2012 project "vision of strangers."
In it, the artist created portraits of unknown people with the help of a judicial evidence of the type of okurkov and a gesture, giving out of this DNA debris and creating images of how these people could look like.
And then she received an e-mail from Paper Magazine.
"They took an interview with Chelsea Manning in prison and wanted a portrait to illustrate the article," explains gyi-hagborg on a preliminary show of a new press exhibition.
At that time Chelsea could not be visited and photographed, so they contacted her and asked if she wanted to get a portrait created from her DNA.
In this unusual way, the artist and her sitting in Muza prison became friends on correspondence and exchanged several letters for two years.
They even wrote the book comic book "suppressed images," illustrated by Shoor kanongo, who portrayed, as in the future, the President would soften the punishment of Chelsea and that would be able to visit the exhibition in person.
The fact that Obama really decided to release manning just a few days after the release of the book was a pleasant surprise after seven difficult years in a military jail in Kansas.
There is something deep and strong, and that the exhibition opens precisely now, when Donald Trump declares war to people disclosing classified information in the Government, and invents new ways to foment the twists that he is called to soften.
When dui-harborg asked about the coincidence of this all over time, she said "It's no accident."
In a statement by an artist written on the wall of Galeria, the huge signature of manning at the bottom (with a heart instead of "i" in her name) calls for an end to "automatic separation on the basis of gender, race, sexual orientation and culture."
On the opposite side, its mitochondrial DNA, a long tracked from the pencil C, G and A.
With the addition of 200 letters (or nucleotide, as scientific research is expressed by the artist), degli harborg was hoping to show how we are all amazingly similar, in any case, according to his biological structure.
"I hope to explain to people that our gene does not define what we are, how open the genetic data to interpret and how it is subjective," said gyuy-harborg; her video work of 2007 "false memories" is also exhibited here.
"DNA data can tell us very many different stories, and 30 of these stories here."
The last part of the exhibit, which was packed in one room, is the novel mentioned above in comics.
On her, manning in the style of King Kong appears above the US correctional barracks with a loudspeaker in his hand.
"If they kill your speech, they will win," says there.
"That's why never silence."
"This is a direct quote from the letter she wrote to me," says the artist, who welcomes us from Philadelphia.
"I'm still murky on the skin when I'm talking about it."
Manning has not yet seen the exhibition personally - how it was portrayed in comics, but when it comes, it will welcome the masks at the centre of the room, its own genomic simulation, gathered as a crowd of protesters.
This is also done intentionally, like all at the exhibition up to the height (5 "2, growth of manning), on which the pencil was painted by the genetic Haplogroup.
"I'd like to hang them on the walls, but now I wanted them to look like a crowd of people," says gyi-harborg about portraits.
"I wanted them to be like a mass movement that was formed around Chelsea, like a movement that was standing and for her release."
Professor Northwestern University and Oxford University staff are looking for the police on murder charges
According to the police, there is a nationwide cloud at Professor Northwestern University and a staff member of Oxford University, who are wanted as suspects because of the fact that a person's death in Chicago was found in a luxury room in Chicago.
According to the reports of the Court of the district of Kuk, on Monday, arrest warrants were issued for premeditated murder without the right to release on bail for the fortieth year, Windham latema, and the Pentecostal Andrew Warren, in connection with their alleged involvement in the death of the Trenton G. James cornell-duro.
According to documents, the twenty-six year-old cornel-durrant died after he had inflicted multiple injuries.
In the warning issued by the Chicago Police Department, the body was found on July 27.
The police received a call, they came to the Grand Plaza Apartments and found a victim with several wounds on the body.
According to officials, Cornell durant was declared dead at the crime scene, and now detectives are investigating death from knife wounds, considering her murder, while the police are searching for two suspects.
Latam was the associate professor of Microbiology and Immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Kabbaj, Vice President of the University of Communications, said in a statement made by e-mail that Latham is on administrative leave and that he is prohibited from entering the campus of the Northwestern University.
"Now it is a criminal case that investigates the authorized faces, and the Northwestern University is cooperating with the investigation," Kabbaj said.
Warren is a Senior Finance Officer at Oxford University.
A representative of the University and Somerville College said in a statement made by e-mail: "We have communicated with the UK police and are ready to provide any necessary assistance to us investigative bodies."
The statement also stated that colleagues Warren in shock and want him to surrender.
The head of the police department of the Chicago Police, Anthony gulelmi, said he was very advised to surrender to the authorities.
"The police have suggestions about their whereabouts, but our attempts to find them are intensified," gulelmi said.
According to gulelmi, local, regional and federal authorities help in searching for suspects.
According to gulelmi, the police called the Administrator of the Grand Plaza building, who had just received a mysterious message that something had happened in room 1008.
The Police called the scene of the crime terrible.
Gulelmi reported that it was unclear whether the incident was on July 27.
According to him, data from video cameras confirm that Latam and Warren were in the building.
"We believe that Professor latema and the victim have linked relations," gulelmi said.
The Grand Plaza Management issued a message to the parking areas, which reported: "At the moment, the police are working on a chronology of the incident, collecting information about the victim and considering a number of motives, including a possible domestic accident."
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mutko: "We will implement the requirements of the WADA road map in the near future"
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaliy Mutko said that the conditions of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), set to resume the work of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (rusada), will be implemented in the near future.
"a certain stage in the implementation of the requirements was passed, the garden has been given the right to plan and conduct tests together with ukad (the UK Anti-Doping Agency).
The Wada road map was updated accordingly," Mutko said on Thursday.
The Prime Minister commented on the second part of the WADA road map to restore the status of compliance with the Code, which lists the conditions for the reopening of the operation and was recently published on the website of the Organization.
According to Mutko, it does not contain anything that could present difficulties for Russia.
"Everything was announced, everything will be done.
And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA in the near future," he added.
However, one of the requirements included in the list implies that Russian andidoping structures should publicly acknowledge the results of the inquiry commissioned by the Canadian lawyer Richard maclarena, which claimed that doping in Russian sports is controlled by the State.
Turning to this issue, Mutko said: "We are investigating, as our anti-doping system allowed a failure.
All measures have been taken.
But there were no state programs, and we will not accept what wasn't."
Mutko repeated the words of Vitaly Smirnov, the head of the Russian independent public Anti-Doping Commission.
In the morning of the same day, in an interview with the Russian edition of "rsport," Smirnov acknowledged the problems that had previously been encountered in Russian Anti-Doping structures, but added: "We have repeatedly said that the report contains certain controversial positions and provisions.
No one is going to accept this report unconditionally," Smirnov added.
Wada removed the rudder from doping control in November 2015 after a doping scandal.
However, in June this year, he was allowed to plan and coordinate testing under the supervision of international experts and the British Anti-Doping Agency (ukad).
Following a visit to the Moscow office of the Organization in July, the Director-General of Wada Olivier nigli stated that the Garden "is moving in the right direction" to restore its work.

Stoltenberg acknowledged the deterioration of relations between NATO and Russia
This was announced on Friday, August 4, the Radio 4 news service, citing foreign media.
According to him, the Russian authorities are responsible for the deterioration of relations between the West and Russia.
In an interview with CNN, NATO Secretary General also criticized Russia for the situation with Crimea and "destabilization in eastern Ukraine."
At the same time, Stoltenberg assured that the dialogue with Russia, however, is possible, and further escalation of the situation will not benefit anyone from its participants.

The Yekaterinburg Metro is developing a new method of payment
In October, travel to Yekaterinburg will be able to pay a bank card, the General Director of JSC "I-net" Pavel Vedernikov said in an interview with the "regional newspaper."
Our goal is to introduce to the 2018 World Cup the same system of payment for the metro, as in other major cities: Moscow, St. Petersburg, Nizhny Novgorod and Novosibirsk.
"We want fans from other countries, the guests of Mundial, could take advantage of the metro through their bank cards, not buying gestures and not standing in line," he said.
Startups that will help your company not become the next "Uber"
Amy errett wanted to assess the level of satisfaction among its senior staff in the area of electronic commerce, but the polls did not work.
The answers were often vague, useless or, worse, unsincere.
Even though she promised anonymity, some staff did not trust the process.
"He has never been consistent and objective," said errett, the manager of the San Francisco company, of 75 people, "Madison Reed," which engaged in electronic commerce in the field of hair care.
It therefore turned to third parties for help.
Now there is a new type of startups in the field of work with staff, who help companies to find out how their employees feel.
By developing and licensing the software, whose purpose is to measure the involvement of employees, they allow companies to make express surveys, to turn to certain teams and demographic groups, to offer staff anonymity and hot lines for complaints, and in some cases to allow informants to mine top management and to apply directly to the Directorate.
"Now we have tools such as strava and Fitbit to monitor health, and where Fitbit for your company?" says Jim Barnett, co-founder and President of the "glint" from Redwood City, whose analytical programs are used by companies to measure the involvement of employees.
Errett said he had reached a greater understanding of what she thought and felt her employees in three years of use "glint."
In addition to express surveys and questionnaires, the product offers a heat card of the company and shows in a visual form, which units have more complaints and which managers have a low approval rating, which allows it to understand why.
Companies are aware that they need to control the situation in the workplace, otherwise they will be the next "uberom," which was seen in a scandal when the former employee published a post in a blog that described the aggressive environment in which those who expressed discontent were punished.
For Startups such as glint, this is a desire to control the situation - an opportunity for profitable business.
According to the Internet portal," Let's Talk about payment "on financial technologies, the global management industry, regulation and compliance by 2020 could cost more than $118.7 billion.
The start of "convercent" from Denver, Colorado, to help companies prevent and detect bad behavior, noted a small increase in interest and activity earlier this year against the backdrop of the decline in the reputation of Uber.
"convercent" almost 600 customers, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Recently, the "Uber" appeared among clients.
Like "glint," "convercent" allows companies to send their individual opinion polls, collect confidential answers in real time and view the thermal maps of problem areas.
It also provides a hotline for anonymous text messages that allows employees to report bad behaviour.
And if the top manager is affected, complaints go directly to the Directorate.
"The court of public opinion intercepted the power of the inspectors," said Patrick Quinlan, founder and president of "convercent."
If it is found that the company does not treat employees or behave unethical, even if the Inspectors do not intervene, the company may face costly consequences in the form of boycotts by clients, the departure of employees and legal claims, said Quinlan.
"Ruby tuesday," a network of restaurants, where more than 25,000 employees work in 500 establishments, used "convercent" more than a year to ensure that staff members are aware of rules and procedures, and offer a simple way to contact the company's head office.
Earlier, if the staff member wanted to report the problem, he or she had to look for a phone number or a head office, to file a formal complaint, and to hope that she would be taken seriously.
This was often a frightening and awkward experience, said James Vitrano, the head of the legal department of Ruby tuesday, saying that there was no normal way to monitor the complaints of employees.
Now, when the company uses the "convercent" service, the problems that have previously been hidden from managers sitting in offices in other cities or states - such as discrimination, hazing and unfair pay - can be detected and dealt with quickly.
"I can move closer to a comprehensive, comprehensive understanding of the situation of employees," said Vitrano, who runs the risk management group of Ruby Tuesday.
"And we protect our shareholders from legal proceedings with employees."
According to Queensland, companies have begun to be more serious about the ethics, values and involvement of employees in 2002, after Arthur Andersen's accounting firm collapsed due to ethical violations as a result of the "Enron case."
But only when "Social Networks got massive distribution," companies realised that they would not be able to keep their dirty bellows from viral distribution on the network.
"Before Starting using technology to control ethics, people used hope as a strategy," he said.
And "glint" and "convercent" offer their software as a service, charging companies regularly for the use of their products.
This is a business model and an opportunity that has been approved by venture investors, who supported both startups.
In February, convercent received funding of $10 million from firms such as Sapphire ventures and Tola capital, bringing the company's total capital to 47 million dollars.
"glint" received 10 million dollars in November from "Bessemer Venture Partners," bringing the total capital of the company to $60 million.
These investments are unlikely to be surprising given the interconnected nature of companies, culture and venture capital.
The growing volume of research shows that today's employees expect more jobs than it was before.
In markets with tough competition, such as Silicon Valley, high wages and interesting projects are just a minimum.
Employees want to feel that they are accepted and valued, and that they devote their time to the company with a positive mission.
"When people are happy to work in the company, they feel they are heard, and that the work they perform brings the result, they are more trying to make such a company a success," says Nina makquin, vice president for global benefits and employee satisfaction at LinkedIn, where both "convercent" and "glint" are used.
Investors get revenue when companies from their portfolio go well; companies are doing well when employees are committed and involved.
If the analytical tools of the third party promise to increase their commitment and involvement, it is not surprising that they find support.
According to cultural specialists in the workplace, it is important to have data on the involvement of employees.
But the data are useless until the Trustees of the company take action.
In fact, if the company requests feedback officers, it can create the impression that changes are coming.
And if the change does not come quickly, or will not come at all, frustration can be developed, and staff will lose interest.
"If you are going to ask about 4,000 offers, you should be ready to conduct 4,000 conversations," says Russell Rat, President of the consulting firm, Kotter International, who has had to see how companies make a mistake, too relying on data collection.
"Because, if you don't go to the end, the staff will guess:" You have heard me?
Do you not like it?
And if you don't like it, why should I not be still? "
According to errett, the company "Madison Reed," which is now conducting monthly surveys of employees, is able to take measures on the same day when someone reports the problem with the help of "glint."
And, after collecting feedback from employees, dissatisfied with decision-making speed and quality of communication, she was able to rearrange several teams within the company and introduce a communication training to solve the problems.
Ruby Tuesday receives new knowledge of its employees and hopes that in the long term, this knowledge will help it to keep employees in the industry, known as a high turnover of staff.
"If you don't try to create a culture of transparency, you will lose people," said Vitrano.
If you lose people, you lose customers.
And if you lose customers, you lose companies.
Barnaul opens new asphalt on Krasnoarmeyskaya Avenue
In Barnaul, cardinal measures have been taken to address the cause of the failure of asphalt on Krasnoarmeyskaya Avenue.
The place where there was twice a hole in the recently asphalted carriageway (crossing with the Youth Street) was decided to "open."
Let us recall that the collapse of a small section of the road near tram tracks was due to the fact that the land was seeded in the area of an unexploited network.
According to the Deputy Chairman of the city committee on roads, landscaping, transport and communications, Ivan garmata, for a detailed survey and liquidation of the preconditions for the collapse, will carry out a detailed survey.
Depending on its results, the necessary measures will be taken.
It is assumed that it will be necessary to restore the formwork of waste communications and their concreting.
This is reported on the official website of the provincial capital.
Bruins team has to spend longer due to the fact that the National Student Sports Association cancelled training twice a day
The time is approaching 11 PM; the footballers from the University of California in Los Angeles are delayed to chat on one side of the new training fields located on campus.
Some of them were knocking their t-shirts, pushing back their backs, shining from the sweat after a busy first day of the sports camp.
For many team players, these minutes are a break in the middle of the day.
Players recorded in summer classes, after three hours of training, will go back to the dormitories to prepare for the final exams, and the next morning will return to the Vasserman football centre at 6:30.
Shortly before Monday turned on Tuesday, the coach coach Bruce Jim Mora said: "In the next three days, these guys are waiting for the meat."
The fact that the National Student Sports Association cancelled training twice a day, which was invented to reduce the burden on the players, actually extended their working day - at least until the end of the exam on Friday.
Therefore, the start of the first three training of the California University team in Los Angeles was set at 7:15 pm, so that they will be placed in and without the already tight schedule of players.
The side effect of the absence of two training days was a higher number of days with one training, and Bruins moved to the start of the camp almost a week compared to last year and conducted training during the summer school for the first time in six seasons of the morons in Westwood.
According to the schedule, they will have 18 training sessions until August 20 inclusive, before starting official preparations for the first game against Texas University A&M team in September.
Mora said he supported the change of rules by the National Student Sports Association, despite the fact that, due to him, there was another item in the player's tight schedule.
"Within three or four days, we give them this huge burden, it's a serious test," said Mora.
"And they just overcame him, they work, they are wonderful guys.
I think that when we live up to Saturday and we will have more time, it will really be great."
When the camp ends, the University of California in Los Angeles will make training closed; it is a difficult task, since its fields are in direct visibility with the adjacent parking and from the neighbouring "lassi-center," the expensive hotel, which has already been bombarded by football balls that have crossed the protective net for the gate.
"Bruce" players have to occupy the Hotel starting from this weekend, but Mora admits that when the rooms are FREE during the season, there may be a problem.
"We will have security," said Mora.
"It's a serious problem, and I don't exaggerate the danger, suggesting that someone can remove the room, sit there and record a video training.
If you have a video recording of training, it's very serious.
But we will be guarded there and will be guarded parking number 8.
We will do everything that we have.
I won't go too far because of this.
We have a plan."
All victims of the terrorist attack in St. Petersburg are discharged from hospitals
All those injured during the terrorist attack in St. Petersburg in April were discharged from hospitals.
This was reported in the press service of the Deputy Governor of Anna mytyonina.
According to data at the end of July, there were three people in the hospitals, the TV Center reports.
Let us recall that the explosion in St. Petersburg was warm on April 3 this year.
The bomb exploded the suicide bomber of akbarjon Jalilov.
As a result of the terrorist attack, 15 people were killed, as well as the perpetrator himself.
In the criminal case, 11 people, including the alleged organizer of abroir Azimov, were arrested.
Let us recall that on the eve of the Rospotrebnadzor, the Metropolitan of Saint Petersburg recommended to revise the plan of measures to ensure transport safety, in particular by increasing the number of metal detectors.
Facebook is strengthening the factor in the fight against Facebook News
Facebook will be more likely to send texts suspected of mystification, independent experts, and show their conclusions under original posts, said Thursday the largest social network of the world, which is trying to fight the so-called Facebook news.
In a statement on its website, the company stated that it is beginning to use the improved machine training algorithms to recognise possible mystification, send them to the test and possibly show the results of the face-check under the starting point.
Facebook has been criticised as one of the main ways to spread the so-called Facebook News, which, according to many, has influenced the 2016 presidential election in the US.
This issue is also actively debated in Europe after French voters have been misled by false messages before the presidential election in May, and in Germany before the September elections, they announced support for the plan to penalize social media if they do not quickly remove hate posts.
On Thursday, in a separate statement in German, Facebook reported on the testing of the new fact-check algorithm, which was launched in the USA, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
"Moreover, to see what reports are being challenged by independent verifiers, people want to have a wider context to make informed judgements about what they are reading and what they are divided," wrote in his Sarah sue, a Facebook news manager.
She added that Facebook will continue to test the function of "Related articles" and work on other changes in the news ribbon to solve the problem of Facebook news.
Create romance comics: one castle in English history
In the recent past, the tiny Castle of Scotland was filmed in the "squeeze" music video, and in the 1970s and 1980s he served Margaret Thatcher.
But 700 years from their cosy place in The Valley Of The Baul River in Kent, he observed a turbulent history around, and now inspired Jamie Rhodes, Yorkshire with smoked hair and a tendency to historical documents, on roman-comics.
"I think it is so beautiful - look at a person who died 300 years ago," he says.
"You feel it so personally when you keep this letter in your hand."
"The Castle in England" covers the period from the Middle Ages to the evardiane era, and tells about the families who lived in Scotland; each story illustrated one of the Young British Artists - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Bryoni may Smith, William axley, Becky Palmer and Isabelle Greenberg.
This is not the first book of Rhodes, which is based on archive data: in 2014, he wrote "the teeth of the dead man and other stories" - a collection of documents from the British Library Documents; this project suddenly touched him to the depth of the soul.
"I could build just a fingerprint on the edge of a letter written in the 1700-years by a double agent working on jacobitov," he says.
"It's a fingerprint of his fingers"
And the letters will always smell smoke, because in those times the lights have burned fire.
And after 300 years, in the future, you think you are also there.
Ah, how I love the archives! "
For a person covered by this passion to the old securities, to receive support from the National Fund and the English art council and to live in the castle four months ("Honestly, I've got a little bit there") seems too good to be true.
Rodina days studied the "new" Victorian Castle, walked through the archives and considered numerous treasures of impurity and ancient things - for example, the heads of the Gien on the walls or the bottle, the centuries that were lying in the RDF.
He walked on the park and on the ruins of the old castle, talked with lesniers, gardeners and sometimes with artists working on the illustrations to his book.
Then, he "drunk whiskey and sat down at night."
The history of Scotland's Castle is not very well understood, because the National Foundation has received full access to it only in 2006, when the last heir, Elizabeth Hassi, died.
When Rhodes arrived in ten years, the staff only began to deal with the archive, which he describes as "that aristocrats have swapped in the attic for centuries."
Diaries, letters from the British Empire, maps showing who are the ones who are in possession: "You think the land disputes are boredom," says Rhodes, "but that's why there were two families.
It's so, guys! "
In some stories of the collection, the castle is becoming a starting point for a wider search in English history: for example, in the "employee," The Hero takes away from the newly built Castle to join the Peasant Revolution of 1381.
"There are information about the rebellion that took place in the castle in 1380, in a book called" The Knights of Kent and Sussex, "says Rhodes.
"The Peasant Uprising began in these places, and I thought it was a good start.
Maybe they were connected? "
Other stories are tightly connected to the history of the castle - for example, the "priest," which tells about the priesthood, which the family of darrelov, seven years old, hid himself during the English Reformation.
Or "smuggling," About the smugglers of the 18th century Arthur Darrel, who is believed to have staged his own funeral, with stones thrown at the coffin (it was discovered a few years when the coffin of the coffin).
Darrelles - a beloved family of Rhodes from all that was inhabited by scotney: "Gentlemen, it seems to have been perfect, has been a perfect place for debt and spending money on what they could not afford.
In different generations, male darreals have solved their problems with debts, married to wealthy elderly women - I represent them as a company of nice guys who are able to care for the heirs of large fortunes."
After finishing work in the castle, Rhodes is looking for other possibilities to get a unique written experience.
He lived two weeks in the Finnish glamour, where he wrote a graphic nowelle about elyanmäki - a place where at the beginning of the 20th century there was a sanatorium and then it rose again.
But Scott remains a special place for him.
"I was sad to leave," he says.
"I felt something like that: Damn, I need to return to real life again."
Fifteen major banks choose Russia
The conflict in the Association of Russian Banks (ARB) is developing: Following the Sberbank, VTB, VTB-24, Alfa-Bank, Gazprombank, rosagricultural bank, binbank and FC "opening," seven other credit organizations are going to leave this public organization.
Thus, there will be no less than 80 per cent of the market for retired organizations.
But this is not just a way out - All banks that have declared the gap with the ARB are negotiating with another public organization that unites credit institutions - the Association of Regional Banks "Russia," which is headed by the well-known politician Anatoliy Aksakov, the Chairman of the State Duma Committee on the financial market, acknowledged by the way, at the end of the last session and the most effective head of the Duma committee and the deputy on the number of draft laws prepared.
The start of the conflict inside the ARB was initiated during the discussion in the Federation Council, when the Interregional Banking Council considered new bills, in particular the new classification of banks, depending on the size of the authorized capital.
Then, Garegin tosuyan, president of ARB, said that, according to the Association, the bill was adopted for the benefit of the largest banks, which thus try to limit the possibilities of small and medium-sized banks in the regions, intercepting their clients.
Among other claims, there was criticism of the Central Bank, which, according to tosanana, was not always justified by the revocation of licenses from some banks, which, however, was followed by an objection from a central bank representative: many of the leaders of the past banks, in particular the vneshtbank, were part of the governing bodies of the Arb.
Apparently, this exchange of mutually exclusive opinions in a highly sensitive relationship with the main regulator of the banking environment and became a visible reason for the 15 largest banks, arguing against the policy of the ARB, began preparing for joining the "Russia" Association, noting that "the effectiveness of the work of the ARB will be low, and the constructive dialogue within the banking community is actually not conducted."
Depositors will be better
What will the matter end?
We will respond immediately to the main issue that arises at the slightest side or conflict in the banking sphere or next to it: the depositors are not at risk, rather, rather, the reliability of the banking system will increase.
The head of the "Russia" Anatoliy Aksakov, who is famous for his keen interest in the interests of banks and their clients, is a high-level professional who is highly valued in the Central Bank: almost all the central bank's management is present at the annual events of the Association, and all significant legislative initiatives of the regulator are conducted through expert estimates of "regions."
In the staffing plan, it is clear that there are no special shocks.
Undoubtedly, ARB falls into a difficult financial and management situation after losing such powerful and influential participants with their contributions and lobbying opportunities.
However, in this oldest - established in 1991 - an organization defending the interests of the banking community, there are small potential to continue to improve banking legislation and the scope of monetary treatment as a whole.
It cannot be said that the Association "Russia" with open arms is ready to accept new members, judging by the reaction of its head, Anatoliy aksakova ("may, too much want"), which, on July 21, at a briefing in the Press Centre of the Parliamentary newspaper, said that "the representatives of the retired banks of the Republic of Armenia asked me to consider the possibility of increasing the potential of our Association" Russia. "
Their proposals are to strengthen the voice of bankers in the Council of the association, as well as to pay more attention to new banking technologies.
The negotiations are underway, the proposals of both sides are being studied, the agenda of the extraordinary congress of the Association, which will be held in Sochi in mid-September, is being prepared in the framework of the International Banking Forum.
Там и decide.
Also, Anatoliy Aksakov, stressing that "the Chair does not hold," called the new head of the renewed Association "Russia" Georgy luntovsky, who leaves in September the post of Deputy Chairman of the Central Bank, highly describing his business and human qualities.
On August 18, Anatoliy Aksakov, who is currently resting in Crimea, plans to suspend leave and come to Moscow for one day, for an extraordinary meeting of the Council of the Association of Russia, which is scheduled to consider the issue of the agenda of the extraordinary congress "Russia."
The entry of cars with petrol engine into large cities of Russia will not be restricted
The deputy head of the Ministry of Transport, Nikolai Asaul, said that, contrary to the reports of the media, the entry of cars with gasoline engines into the major cities of Russia will not be restricted.
This is a more radical form of our concept.
Our vision is to gradually improve the ecological class.
And there's the concept immediately to zero emissions.
I believe that technically we are not ready to do so.
The question is: From what year?
This is the phrase at the level of slogans - let's ban.
Where and when?
Tomorrow?
The whole city will close?
"After 20 years, I don't know, maybe it will happen," says the Prime Minister.
Earlier, Izvestia reported that by August 17, the Deputy Prime Minister Arkady Dvorkovich was instructed to study proposals on possible options for State support for electric transport, submitted to the Government by the General Director of the company, KAMAZ, Sergei Kogogin.
Among the proposals, according to the newspaper, the use of machines with ice in large cities and resorts.
Washington changes the rules for getting greencard.
As reported by the media, President Donald Trump said that a new US immigration plan will be adopted, according to which the rules for the receipt of the greencard will change.
The plan will reduce the number of legal immigrants to 50,000 per year, stricter rules for obtaining temporary work visas and restrictions on family visas.
The new rules are proposed by the Republican Party and are supported by the President.
The Bill will be discussed in two chambers of Congress.
"This law will reduce poverty, raise wages and save billions of dollars to taxpayers, and will do so by changing the way the US delivers greencards to citizens of other countries.
The law will reduce chain migration and replace the existing scheme.
The new application process will provide benefits to candidates who own English, have the money that allows them to maintain themselves, and have the skills that will benefit our economy," said Trump, according to the American media.
The appearance of Sex robots is real, and this should be of concern to us
We did not have time to think that 2017 could no longer be worse, a new report on technological advances in the production of sex robots.
MDA.
Sex robots are now at the centre of attention.
The responsible robotics Foundation (FRR) released a recent report on the development of sex robots in the next 5-10 years.
According to Noël Sharki, a distinguished professor of robotics and artificial intelligence of the University of scheffield and the co-founder of FRR, we must take them seriously.
The users will be able to choose the Color Of The Eyes Of The Robot, the shape of the nipples and the type of nail.
"People hijack on this issue, but firms are already sending them to consumers, and soon we will see them much more," said Sharki at the presentation of the new report.
Modern Sex Dolls have evolved from their inflatable collections in robots with silicone skin, warm to feel, and with almost human reptiles, which are managed by artificial intelligence.
Users can also "configure" their robots according to their taste, choosing everything from the color of the eye and the shape of the robot to the shape and colour of the nail.
But the fact that many robots have a "personality," compared to which Stepford's wife would be very progressive, is even more worrying.
Modern Sex Dolls have become robots with silicone skin.
For example, realbotix robot allows users to adjust to quality robots that they find attractive - for example, shyness.
There are still sex robots roxxxy gold developed by "true companion," which are supplied with already programmed individuality - for example, the cold Farra gives the impression of being shy, and "Wild Wendy" has "bold" character.
"roxxxy gold has a character that fits perfectly well," the Website "true companion."
So she loves what you love, does not love what you do not love, and so on.
She changes the mood during the day, like this person!
She may want to sleep or live, or she can "be in mood"! "
There is a lot of concern in the appearance of Sex robots - not least because they are replacing real human relationships - but the most worrying is the subordinate image of a woman, an association with rape, which causes the cold (Reading: resisting) Fara.
On the website "true companion" roxxxy compared to the vibrator, only for men.
"If a woman (sic!) can be a vibrator, why men cannot be roxxxy?" says the site.
But these sex robots are not just fetishes or just new sex toys.
Their appearance and growing complexity points to something more dark and deep in our culture, by derogation from the ideal of gender equality towards the desire of sex to be an optional supplement.
Most men, of course, will not buy sex robots, and although FRR notes their growing popularity, they are still on the periphery of consumer culture.
But what comes to us from the periphery can be very instructive about the meaning of the era in which we live.
And many people are not bad and are not aggressive until the free market gives them the opportunity to do so.
This is not a coincidence - that these complex sex Robots have emerged precisely when the rights of women around the world are threatened when the White House is a president, who is praised by the fact that women are taking care of women.
The most frightening of the "story of the service" is not graphic images, twisted bodies, and outstanding eyes, namely, the extent to which this vision seems realistic.
The Republic of galades is a exaggeration, but now it does not seem to be so big.
The aim of the sex robot industry is to achieve such a physical image of real women (only with the proportion of the pornographic Stars), which technology allows.
Their creators want them to appear to people on the feeling to copy the movement of the human body.
But it is their "characters" that don't look like real women.
They cannot break with their partners or leave them.
They have no life, nor biographies - anything that could point to independence or something else, which could destroy the illusion of full dependence.
In other words, it is beautiful slave.
Or, as they say in 2017, the Service.
A native of Los Angeles, Eugene (Puch), Jeter, since 2013, he has not been able to help our national team at the European Basketball Championships, the final part of which starts on August 31.
The General Manager of "blue yellow" Andrei Lebedev said this in an interview with bebasket portal.
We tried to agree with Peter, but unfortunately he does not come for family reasons.
We will go on EuroBasket without a naturalized player, as we don't want to take someone who we don't know.
"This situation will provide opportunities for the development of our young players," he said.
Let me remind you: with the direct participation of Jeter, the Ukrainian team took a record sixth place on EuroBasket 2013, and for the first time came to the World Championship for basketball, where "yellow blue" was not able to overcome the group stage, and the native of the USA recruited 15.4 points, made 3 selection and gave 5 transfers.
Geter ceased to speak for the team of Ukraine since the departure from the post of chief coach of our national team, Mike Fratello, who left the post in 2015.
Male EuroBasket will take place simultaneously in four countries: Turkey, Romania, Israel and Finland.
The Ukrainian team of their matches of the group tournament will hold on the promised land.
There will be five matches in the group B wards: with Germany (31 August), Italy (2 September), Georgia (3rd), Lithuania (5th) and Israel (6th).
As part of the preparation for the tournament, our men's team conducted two control fights, which gave way to the Dutch and Belarusians.
Trump's great feat?
It seems to be a very reasonable picture of the myth of Romney
In the era of Trump, a common place was the fact that political disputes, polarized by the American electorate, have smashed some families at the micro level.
Between Thanksgiving and Christmas, American newspapers sang columns on how to deal with the terrible relatives who vote for Trump.
It seems that we are all strained so that they will soon be piled.
Less talk about Trump's ability to unite families.
I write about it because my cousin, the Left view of the Chicago, who has long been on knives with Republicans in his family, came to me in New York this week.
She reminded me that the unification in the fight against the common enemy could have a strong effect.
With Trump in the White House, everything she knows, including the Republican Republican Party, with whom she has been arguing about politics for decades, suddenly and strange, turned out to be on the same side.
For dinner, this is certainly good; but I can't think that in a wider context it may be quite dangerous.
Trump has breathed forces into the left flank, but the deformable effect of his Government can all move to the right.
When we talk about the tram and "normalization," we mean the unlikely possibility that one day we will stop it.
There is, however, an even more dubious scenario in which Trump "normalize" the most right-wing Republicans, who, against the backdrop of his standards, suddenly show a model of common sense.
I caught myself on the fact that it is very boring today at Mitt Romney's old-fashioned madness - with a dog on the roof of the car and 14 percent income tax (but at least we knew how his tax declaration looks) - compared to Trump and the other seems a very small evil.
When Trump will go, the next Republican candidate will simply be in his mind to see a huge step forward.
When my cousin went to the center, we went with children on carousel in the Central Park - the biggest Carrousel in the Department of Parks of New York City and the best way in the city to spend three dollars if you don't need coffee.
The horses are huge and huge, the pictures from glass wool on the central drum - gripping clowns and animals, which, in horror, look at the back, is extremely ominous, and the links music, ironically, leads to delight.
So many famous things in this city are disappointed: the types of skyscrapers are outdated, the silhouettes of buildings have been too much to call, and the reality of the city does not lead to a dream.
Thirty-five years have passed, and I still experience the day when I learned that the suiss-cottage area is actually not a Swiss chalet (the "Ye Olde Swiss cottage cottage" is not in the account), but a large roundabout in north London.
And carousel in the Central Park is still an unusual, magical place in which the child of two years, the child of eleven years, and two women for forty years of age.
If I could put an estimate, I would put five, but, fortunately, I didn't ask me about it.
And in univermag this week, I was asked for a card on the terminal, to assess his "experience" of shopping on a scale from one to five stars.
In a coffin on the corner of my street, the same plus option is the option to estimate the tea by 15 percent - it is for the Order at the stand.
As a result, not only is the neutrality neutral, but it is also necessary to make a personal attitude to the situation that does not require it.
The poor salesman in the unvermague smiled, while I was tired of evaluating her experience with her credit card in five stars.
Oscar Pistorius transferred from prison to hospital due to pain in the chest
Pistorius leaves the prison because of a visit to a doctor for the second time.
Last year, he was transferred to a hospital for the treatment of cuts, which, according to the prison administration, he received as a result of the fall in the cell.
Pistorius was convicted of premeditated murder following an appeal from the prosecutor's office for an initial sentence for manslaughter.
He killed Steenkamp early morning Valentine's Day in 2013, shot several times through the door of the toilet room in his home in Pretoria.
Pistorius stated that he had taken his girlfriend behind a night thief who had hidden him in the toilet.
The prosecutor's office announced its intention to file another protest, this time against the six-year term of the Pretorius, which, according to her, is too tender.
The Attorney General's Office stated that the appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa and the appeal will be considered this year.
The term of the Pretorius may increase by 15 years if the Prosecutor's Office succeeds.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.

According to the most Razvozzhaev, The troopers, on the other hand, tried to detain Muscovites.
Two Bulgarian citizens were detained in Greece for the illegal tent parking
According to the BBC, according to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, two Bulgarian citizens were detained in Greece for an illegal tent parking.
On the morning of August 1, a group of people who had made tents in a non-local place, including two Bulgarian citizens, were detained on sitonia.

The inspections will be conducted throughout the season.
According to the Ministry, the court may impose a fine.
The Russian Foreign Ministry accused the U.S. Vice President in the cold war rhetoric
The statements made during the European tour of the U.S. Vice President Michael Pena were criticized by the Russian myth.
"It is sad to note that Washington is becoming increasingly confused with the primitive ideological strains of the cold war, which are completely detached from reality," the statement of the Russian Foreign Ministry says.
For example, the myth reacted to the words of Pensa about the "Russian threat" and the attempts of the violent movement of the borders that he said in Podgorica.
The Russian MFA pointed out the destruction of choice "or with the West, or with Russia," and the invisibility of the thesis on the supposedly alternative entry into NATO of the whole of southeast Europe.
Also Russian diplomats recalled that it was the US that violated international law, using force to isolate Kosovo from Serbia and thus created another hotbed of tension.
"We call on us colleagues to stop the shelf of Russia and its foreign policy line, which is always based on respect for partners and readiness for joint constructive work, on mutual recognition of interests," the statement of the Russian MFA says.
Feldsher was injured in an accident with "Ambulance" in Moscow
The accident occurred in the Moscow Stupino, as a result of the collision of a foreign vehicle with the carriage of "Ambulance" was injured by a feldcher.
Today, about 08:30 ICN happened a collision of Mitsubishi car with an ambulance in the city of Stupino Moscow region.
"As a result of the collision, the ambulance stopped," TASS said in the press service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs on the Moscow region.
Law enforcement officials are working on the scene of the accident, and the circumstances of the incident are clarified.
In the Odessa region, a woman threw her newborn son on the construction of his newborn son, wrapped in a whole package.
On the evening of August 3, the Police Division received a message from a local resident that he found a package with a baby in an unfinished private house.
"The law enforcement agencies and doctors who quickly took the child into a medical facility," said the head of the National Police in Odessa.
Medics determined that the boy was born a few hours before his discovery, as shown by the presence of pups.
In the course of Priority investigative activities, the identity of the women is a 36-year-old local resident.
It is also found that a woman has three more young children.
As noted in the glavke, the family of the law enforcement agencies had not previously been caught and there was no special treatment.
Currently, the police are setting the circumstances and the reasons behind the woman's behaviour, after which a procedural decision will be taken.
Now the baby is under the supervision of doctors.
As previously reported, in Nikolaev, a 21-year-old woman threw her underchild into the garbage.
Grigory Leps: "I'm going to fight, though 55 - not 30"
One of the most successful artists of the Russian Estrada Grigory Leps will celebrate his 55th anniversary in the near future.
Before the triumph of the singer, he talked with the reporter "Izvestia."
I remember your "poltinnik."
A special tent in "Luzhniki," Gloria geinor Pella for imeninnik, a powerful salute over Moscow river.
You're certain that you'd like to spend your next five years.
Are the plans come true?
Speaking about the profession, it was a successful period.
I've been working hard three times with the tour of the whole country, gave 120-130 concerts a year.
He released two bad albums.
Of course, I am no longer the one that, say, 20 years ago.
The biological clock is not deceived.
To sing as I sang in my 30, it is all heavier.
However, I'm going to fight, I don't want to stop.
And I am with new people, I think I go to a different level.
With them you and the new album record, the first three years.
Yes, work on it is underway.
Actually, we've already recorded everything in my studio and now we will send it to Los Angeles.
He is called "You are so serious?" according to the same name, which is written together with Timati.
It is not yet fully prepared, so we have not yet put it out.
We will do it later, when and the clip on it.
And the album will be presented in November - to a series of my Jubilee concerts in the Moscow "Crocus City Hall."
To your new album, The class American drummer Chris Coleman put his hand.
Do you think he wanted him to be involved in his tour?
In my opinion, Coleman today is one of the most outstanding drummers of the world.
He came to me in a studio, recording his parties.
I offered him to join my group, and Jeremy Colson (a well-known drummer involved in various projects." Izvestia ") offered.
But for long work in Russia, they put forward, mildly, excessive conditions.
This involved fees from €35,000 to €45,000 per month.
Then I thought that in the post-Soviet space, I would find worthy musicians.
And found an excellent drummer Max Malysheva.
In general, it's better to feed your own (smiles).
At times I want someone to fight, not for what.
For example, guitarist Fedor leisure is highly quoted at the international level.
It is written by Western music magazines, he is invited to various guitar festivals.
Steve Wai, listening to his game, said that "the new generation of guitarists, with other performing equipment, came."
Your Album is limited to Los Angeles, American musicians are working with you, but you're still going to come in the USA?
Do you try to remove this ban?
Now, frankly, I don't do anything.
There are a number of lawyers who deal with this issue.
As a musician, I really sincerely regret that I can't get to America.
I did not say that there would be one thing there.
The more you communicate with real professionals, the more useful it is.
We are not stupid, but we don't have such experience, schools.
Before our performers of popular music for 70 years, the tasks that the American musicians have always decided have not been set up.
They sought to make the best sound.
And I try to follow the same principles.
Now, for some reason, the Great Britain refused me entry for ten years.
But I will still be able to apply for a visa to the British Embassy every year, so that I will be allowed to travel again and most importantly - there is work there.
The rest of Europe is sympathetic to me.
And already in August, you are planning a concert in Monaco, not registered, but Athens, is it true?
Yes, in Monte Carlo there is a good Hall "sporting," I have already spoken there.
Now I was invited again and, as far as I know, all tickets for the concert have already been sold.
On "randevo Laima waikule," which will start on July 20 in Jurmala, eat?
She was invited, and I certainly responded.
It is a wonderful singer and a great woman who can make himself and a great vocal, and even a whisper.
After touring and anniversary concerts, as far as I know, you want to turn to Vladimir Vysotsky's creative work.
Two albums with his songs have already been in the discography.
When will the third come out?
Probably next year.
But it will be completely different.
I want to write about 80-90 songs of Vysotsky about the same way as he did.
Only the voice and guitar.
There is no other arrangement.
It will be our well-known musician Timur Vedernikov.
I will try to involve in the album and Aleksandr Yakovlevich Rosenbaum.
I have this subject with him, and we have good relations, but he is busy, so let's see how to get out.
You and the songs of Boris Grebenschikov gradually introduced into his repertoire.
Maybe, then, and the album of his belongings?
Boris Borisovich is a wonderful man and a great musician.
I've crossed with him several times and asked: you can sing a song or a different song?
He answered: "Grigory, I write songs to be executed."
Please wake up, sing.
Probably, it's interesting and such an album to record.
So far, I don't have such a task, but in the future, two years ago, if Boris Borisovich did not object, I might make such a project.
If you don't focus entirely on the affairs of your production centre.
I think so far you have not yet implemented his potential, did not sign contracts with all the artists you are interested in?
There are a number of artists that I would like to have under their wing, but they are independent, held by people.
Do you mean Sergei Lazarev?
Seryozha is a brilliant singer, I invited him.
I cannot agree to something with his repertoire, but he is a professional and has his own development strategy.
And in my center there is now Aleksandr Panayotov, whom I was in "voice."
We have concluded a contract and work with him.
In our pop music, such singers are rare.
It will be a pity if he does not reach the heights worthy of it.
Try to pick him a repertoire, shoot clips.
I hope for a good result.
I also try to promote other artists of my center: buying them songs, paying the poets, sometimes their tracks are in the rotation of television and radio channels.
If they do not reach great heights, I will still bring our cooperation to a logical conclusion.
At the exit they will receive a recorded album, several clips.
And then, if they want, they can go through their way, and I will not insist that they return the money invested in them.
Although I will be pleased if someone of them will make a commercial success and pay me the interest that we have negotiated in the contract.
But if this does not happen, it is not going to stop the oxygen.
Let everyone work, break, prove, as I once proved.
If tomorrow you will be asked to make a tour Tour in Ukraine and guarantee entry to the country, eat?
I have so far been invited.
Most of these are closed events.
And as far as the big tour is concerned...
I am a man of my country, a Russian, who, according to his own conviction, flew to Syria on the plane itself, which then crashed.
If tomorrow will say that it is necessary to fly to a different point in the interests of the State, it will be a flight.
And I am playing that I think of bloggers and other critics.
I sincerely regret that this situation has come with Ukraine.
As I think: we are one people and must be together.
I regret that this is unlikely to happen, at least in the near future.
And earlier I gave a year in Ukraine for 40-50 concerts.
They met as nowhere.
A very grateful public.
And with several Ukrainian artists, they cooperated: Ani Lorak, fresh lobster, Artemis loik...
In Ukraine, the mass of gifted people, and it is a pity that they are now unable to fully throw their talent into a wide Russian audience.
Music must unite and entertain people.
I would be pleased to invite some class Ukrainian singer to Russia, such as the glory of vacarchuk, and made a joint concert with him.
But, I think, this is unlikely to happen...
Andrei Okhlopkov transferred from the launch site
As it became known, the Technical Director of the Cosmodrome, East Andrei Okhlopkov, started work in the State Space Science and Production Centre (gkntc) named after Khrushchev.
Previously, he was de facto engaged in the construction of the Eastern centre, but due to disagreement with the management of the Earth and space infrastructure operation centre (ECDIS), he was transferred to the company in Moscow fillets, which will coordinate production.

Mr Okhlopkov moved to the work of the Inland ECDIS in 2013, with his service in space troops, in particular at Baikonur, and in Plesetsk, at the "northern" cosmodrome, held the position of the first deputy commander in the rank of colonel.
In 2009, Andrei Okhlopkov became a figure of a criminal case.
The investigation accused him of Bribery: allegedly, with his submission, Regional traders were receiving state orders, but did not comply with the commitments made to cleaning the separated parts of the launch vehicles in the Arkhangelsk region and the Republic of Komi.
In 2012, the jury found him innocent.
The responsibilities assigned to him in the Central African Republic for technological development were extended to various projects, but the main of them was the construction of a space launch site in the Far East.
The head of the Federal Space Agency, Oleg Ostapenko, in an interview with "Kommersant," explicitly said that the situation on the East "was critical already in October 2013."
The fact is that planning was made with a strategic error: the completion of the construction and the first launch of the Soyuz 2.1 launch vehicle were planned for the same time - the end of 2015.
To complete the start before the end of the year, the construction decided to complete the construction six months earlier and the time frame was mixed from December to July 2015.
In order to speed up the process, it was necessary to go to the ditch: the specialists of the ECDIS began to conduct parallel installation of technological equipment at unfinished facilities.
The main supporter of this idea was Andrei Okhlopkov.
In spite of the risks that have occurred and yet the move (instead of December 2015," Union "was only held on April 28, 2016), this idea was justified, says the source" Kommersant "at the cosmodrome:" Otherwise we would still have not carried out any launch from the east, but would work on construction. "
Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin, who is responsible for the creation of the Cosmodrome, called Andrei Okhlopkov as his "space susanian," but it was almost always requesting information about the progress of the construction.
Remember Mr. oklopkov and a straight: for example, in an interview with "Kommersant," he proposed depriving the Federal Agency for special construction (Special Order) of the status of the only perpetrator on the eastern and directly working with subcontractors: "Why should all the eggs be folded into one basket?"
This idea has found support in the Government.
Since 2017, the ECDIS has assumed the responsibility of the general contractor to complete the construction and installation work at the start and the technical complex in the fourth quarter.
According to the "Kommersant," the reason for the transition of Mr. Okhlopkov to the new place of work became disagreements with the guidance of the Inland ECDIS on how to complete the construction of the facilities and complexes of the Cosmodrome, as well as working methods with subcontracting organizations.
"It was decided that it will be better for everyone," says one of the top managers involved in the construction of the East.
A member of the Government's apparatus, in turn, calls a strange decision: "He was one of the best specialists, to find him the equivalent of a replacement will not be easy."
According to the "Kommersant," this will not be necessary: the post of Technical Director of the cosmodrome will be abolished and its functions will be broken down by the units of the ECDIS.
In music schools there will be a program of training for two specialties
In the future, students of children's music schools will be able to receive two specialties at the same time.
According to the Deputy Director of the Department of Science and Education of the Ministry of Culture of the Ministry of Culture, Svyatoslav Golubenko, this can be recounted to students of repetitive disciplines, and the issue with the payment of other classes in the second specialty will be solved by means of special grants," RIA Novosti reports.
"The Ministry of Culture has taken this issue to control, and we, together with the expert community, will develop a mechanism that will allow the development of two specialties, but at the same time will not contradict existing legislation in the field of education," Golubenko said.
Last Friday, Vladimir Putin, with the children of the syrius Children's Center, Maria Andreyeva, said he was forced to pay for repeated subjects in the second specialty at the Moscow Conservatoire.
The girl said that she studied in the violin and piano class and has awards in both directions.
The Head of State acknowledged her question very relevant and promised to help.
In Mexico, a 17-year-old Russian man was arrested on the wall on the wall
In Mexico, a 17-year-old Russian, Kirill N., who, on the wall, on the roof of the high-rise building, reports the El Universal portal.
The incident took place in the capital city of Mexico City.
A young man with two unknown men moved through a three-metre fence into the premises of the complex of the office buildings of the company Nestle, and on his own got into one of his towers.
However, he did not use any special equipment, insurance and rope.
The young man was detained on the roof.
The employees of the Ministry of Public Security have lowered him to the ground on the helicopter.
He was then sent to the National Migration Institute.
There, it is clear whether the youth is lawfully present in the country.
Meanwhile, video with a young man taking off at the height has become popular in the network.
The users called the young man "man."
As the media writes, such experiments are for him a hobby.
Red meat, dairy products and chocolate can help ease the OVC.
Red meat and chocolate are considered a nightmare for your digestive tract.
But recent research suggests the opposite: diet, rich in meat proteins and dairy products, can help alleviate the symptoms of those who suffer from inflammatory diseases of the intestines.
This is an incurable disease, which affects about 1.3 million people in the USA and 300,000 in Great Britain, leads to the Coles and the abdominal fat, chronic or bloody nose, loss of weight and extreme fatigue.
Usually, to mitigate the symptoms of patients, it is advised to avoid meat and dairy products, but researchers from the University of Washington have determined that the main amino acid protein triptophan contributes to the production of immune cells that increase the tolerance of the intestines.
Dr. Marco Colonna, a leading researcher, explained that the immune cells in the intestines ensure that the harmful microbes coming from food do not penetrate into the body.
Cells capable of launching an inflammatory process are balanced by cells that increase tolerance, protecting the body and without damaging sensitive tissues.
If the balance is too strongly disturbed in the direction of inflammation, it may lead to inflammatory diseases of the intestines.
Experiments have shown that mice with some bacteria in the intestines appear to increase the tolerance of the cell.
And this bacteria need tryptophan - one of the building elements of protein - to start the appearance of these cells.
Professor Colonna said: "We have established a link between one type of bacteria - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is part of the normal microbioma of the intestines, and the development of cells that increase tolerance.
The more triptophan was contained in the diet of mice, the more these immune cells were."
He suggested that the same would work for people: the combination of L. reuteri and the rich triptophon diet could contribute to a more tolerant and less prone to inflammatory environment in the intestines.
Dr. Luisa Cervantes barraganas, who studied the variety of increasing the tolerance of the immune cells, found that one group of experimental mice had these cells, and the other group, which belonged to the same line but was held separately, did not.
She suggested that the difference could be caused by the Microbiologists of the intestines - the bacteria, viruses and fungi, which usually live in the gastrointestinal tract.
The DNA cells of the intestines were sequenced, and there were six types of bacteria present in mice with immune cells, but absent from mice that do not have them.
Mice grown in a sterile environment that did not have a good microphobia and did not develop this type of immune cells have received L. reuteri, and the immune cells have appeared.
To understand how bacteria affect the immune system, researchers have grown L. reuteri in the liquid environment and then moved small portions of the liquid - without bacteria - to the underdeveloped immune cells allocated from mice.
The immune cells have become cells that increase tolerance.
When the active ingredient was separated from the liquid, it turned out to be a by-product of the processing of triptophan, known as indol-3-lactic acid.
When researchers doubled the number of triptophan in mice, the number of these cells increased by about 50 percent, but when the level of tryptophan was reduced by half, the number of cells has also fallen twice.
Dr. Servantes Barragan explains that people have the same increasing tolerance of the cell as mice, and most of us have L. reuteri in their gastrointestinal tract.
It is not known whether the by-products of triptophan from L. reuteri develop cell development in humans as in mice, but people suffering from inflammatory diseases of the intestines have found defects in the genes associated with triptophan.
She says: "Perhaps the development of these cells we need to be strengthened, since these cells depend on the inflammatory processes on the inner surface of the cyshock.
High levels of triptophan, with L. reuteri, can potentially lead to the expansion of their population."
According to José Mourinho, Manchester United hired "genius" in the face of nemangy Matić
"Manchester United" hired "genius" in the face of nemy Matić, Jose Mourinho, after the midfielder debuted in the match against "samploriy" in the evening on Wednesday.
A player who has gained 40 million pounds from Chelsea, started with a 2-1 victory in Dublin in the last pre-season match "united" before the UEFA Super Cup against Real Madrid on Thursday and gave an impression of the role of a midfielder, while the players like Paul and Andreas Pereira broke forward when they were blunted.
However, since matich did not take part in the pre-season tour "Chelsea" for Asia, he seriously lacked the preparation for the game, and he held only 45 minutes, which, according to Mourinho, needed to be further developed before the start of the Premier League season.
"He needs time, but his experience, mind, genius as he thinks he thinks football," said Mourinho.
"We will help him prepare sooner rather than later."
Just like machić, his fellow New Players Victor lindelef and romelo Lukaku started the game at avva stadium when Mourinho began to shape his main composition by the start of the next season.
The newspaper "independentent" announced this week that Mourinho wanted to hire three more players, but it was pointed out that the club had already achieved fantastic results, hired by three of the four players he would like to hire first.
"I am grateful to the club for having produced three out of four," he added.
"I am looking even more if they will get me four out of four, but they have tried very much for me."
Former social-democratic leaders of Lithuania persuade them to stay in the ruling coalition
Former Presidents of the Social Democratic Party of Lithuania, former Prime Minister Algirdas Butkevičius and Gediminas Kirkilas, as well as the former Speaker of the Sejm from the Social-Democrats, česklovas jurshenas, appealed to the one-party to remain in the ruling coalition.
As the parliamentary newspaper reported, due to tensions with partners - the Union of Peasants and green - in the Social Democratic Party of the Party, a discussion was initiated, whether to stay in the ruling coalition.
And here, three senior experienced comrades approached one-party one-party, in which, in particular, it says: "The disappointment of the Party's comrades in the election results, but the coalition with" peasants "created for us not very easy, but the conditions for the Further Implementation of the goals of social justice, which, on our initiative, are included in the programme of the Government, and in order to maintain the political dominance of the Left centre over the right parties."
According to former leaders of the party, in the discussion, so far," an opinion based on emotions is expressed without concrete arguments."
The authors of the letter fear that their party may lead Lithuania to political, economic and social instability.
Anton Mamaev, a person with disabilities, appointed a fine
Mosgorcourt reduced the punishment of a wheelchair with a wheelchair to Anton Mamaev from four and a half years of imprisonment to a fine of 200 thousand rubles.
Previously, the decision of the timiyazev court was released from the SIZO.
At the same time, the mosgorcourt confirmed that the accused is a criminal, because he organized the robbery and kidnapping of a former soldier of the Special Forces.
The Moscow court decided to soften the punishment of Anton Mamaev to 200 thousand rubles.
"Mamaev is the organizer of the robbery, which also forms the basis of the crime, and, accordingly, such a person must be prosecuted," explained "the spokesman for the mosgorcourt Ulyana solomova.
In this case, the court took into account the state of health of Mamaev, the factual circumstances of the case, the absence of aggravating circumstances.
In addition, the court applied article 64 of the Criminal Code, according to which the penalty is lower than the lower limit.
As for the assistant Mamayeva, Vasily seroshanov, the Court did not establish the circumstances that would give rise to a change in the category of seriousness and change of the sentence.
Anton Mamayev himself stated that he remained dissatisfied with the decision of the Moscow Court.
I am disappointed by the Court's decision.
The only legitimate solution would be justification, he intends to continue to fight for justice.
His lawyer, Andrei Orlov, did not rule out the appeal of the court of cassation in the Court of Cassation and the Supreme Court.
"We will use all the levers up to the European Court of Human Rights," he said "RIA Novosti."
Let us recall that the 28-year-old Muscovite Anton Mamaev, who suffers from the spiteful muscular atrophy, became the figure of the criminal case in the fall of last year.
A person with a disability claims that he bought a motor car from acquaintances for 160 thousand rubles to sell.
However, the owners of motorlers, including the former Special Forces fighter, said that a person with disabilities and his assistant Vasily seroshanov had taken possession of their property, threatening to use violence.
On June 30, timiyazevsky District Court of Moscow sentenced Vasily seroshonov to three years of colony, and Anton Mamayeva, to four and a half years imprisonment with a sentence of punishment in the general regime colony (under article 162 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation).
After the disabled person was placed in the SIZO, the Public Chamber, the Prosecutor General's Office, the Commissioner for Human Rights under the President, Tatiana MOSKALKOVA, were connected to the case.
As a result, in mid-July, Anton Mamaev was released from SIZO by a decision of the same timiyazev court.
The defence, in turn, appealed the decision of the first instance to the Moscow Court.
Onf will prepare the President's report on the environment
The final "forum of action" of the All-Russian People's Front (onf) in 2017 will be devoted to environmental issues, "Izvestia source reported, and confirmed the head of the Executive Committee of the Movement Aleksei Anisimov.
According to him, following the results of the Forum "frontovici," it is planned to prepare a report to the President on problems of domestic ecology, as well as to propose a strategy for their solution.
Izvestia's interlocutors in the onf note that the report of the Head of State will contain a "deep analyst" on the situation in all federal districts of the country.
According to Izvestia, the final forum of the onf will take place in the autumn.
The exact date of its implementation has not yet been determined - as a rule, it is set up under the President's schedule, which is the leader of the movement and is traditionally present at the key activities of the onf.
The Front has conducted several interregional environmental conferences, one in two federal districts, in Rostov-on-Don, Kaliningrad and Kirov.
The final will be the Conference in the capital of the Republic of Buryatia Ulan-Ude.
On the basis of the proposals that have been made and will be made at these events, we will form systemic proposals to solve environmental problems," Izvestia said at the onf.
The co-chairman of the central staff of the Movement Olga Timofeev, Head of the State Duma Committee on Ecology and Environmental Protection, said that "fronts" will inform the head of State about the work carried out within the framework of the year of ecology in Russia.
The final Environmental Forum and the "Forum of action" are likely to be combined.
Over the year, we developed a powerful team of experts in the field of environmental problems, saw gaps in legislation, stopped dozens of violations of the law.
All this will go into the report that we are preparing for the President as the leader of our movement.
In addition to this document," frontovici "will report on the work on the priority projects of the onf," said Olga Timofeeva, "Izvestia."
According to her, the Forum will be invited and invited by the Special Representative of the Head of State on environmental issues, ecology and transport, Sergei Ivanov.
Earlier he had already taken part in the work of the media forum of the onf, which was held in Saint Petersburg in April.
A few months later, the environment will come into history, and most importantly what we need to do today - to launch environmental mechanisms to work for years.
In order to avoid these issues, Olga Timofeeva added.
The head of the Laboratory of the Regional Policy of the Expert Institute for Social Research (EISI) Andrei koladin noted: Raising the environmental issues, the onf operates in line with the Presidential agenda.
Many things, as experts, have been offered in various forums, and these initiatives have been supported by the President," Izvestia said.
He stressed that to date, the economic potential of the environmental agenda could not be excluded, which could give regions an additional impetus for development.
In the future, the regions will be able to lobby not only the solution of their environmental problems, but also the development of ecotourism, the expert added.
The relevance of environmental issues has shown a "direct line" with Vladimir Putin in June.
In particular, the President asked questions about the garbage dump in balashihe (already closed) and about coal dust in the port of Nakhodka (already drafted a bill to ban open transfer of coal in human settlements, one of the authors - Olga Timofeeva).
Experts in the field of ecology believe that the legal basis for solving environmental problems in Russia as a whole has been created, the issue is the further enforcement of law, as well as in the position of civil society.
There is a need for a clear implementation of the decisions taken by the State, the head of the Charitable Foundation "ecology for all" Leonid Bochin believes.
A member of the HRC, the head of the non-governmental organization Greenpeace Russia, Sergei tsyfilov, in conversation with Izvestia, stressed that in order to successfully solve environmental problems, a responsible approach of society and business is needed, some legislative efforts are few.
As soon as society and business are aware that solving environmental problems is a much more profitable step in the strategic perspective, the situation will change," Sergei tsyplkov noted.
The expert stressed that it is necessary to reverse the trend that the violation of environmental legislation is an economically profitable solution for business.
The British inventor has a microchip to get into the house and the car's car
The British inventor became the first person in the country to which the microchip was installed to open the door of his home, to go to the Office and even to plant a car with a simple arm.
Thirty three-year-old Stephen Northem has a tiny chip between big and informative fingers, and now, through his company "Biotec," offers this service to firms and individuals who want to simplify their life through technology.
He was united with Dr. Jeff Watson, an anaesthetist consultant from Royal in Winchester, to ensure that the process of reproduction was conducted in accordance with medical standards.
The technology is similar to a microchip that covers cats and dogs, and the procedure takes only 30 seconds.
Nortema also replaces locks in houses and machines with a chip at a price of 300 pounds per lock.
The married father of one child has already installed the technology in his home and in his car "BMW Z4," which is being built when his hand is on the handlebars.
The President of the White House was robbed by taxpayers in thousands of dollars
According to the records of the armed forces provided by the magazine "Time," the decision of the White House last month to drive the marines to the South Lawn for an event devoted to American industrial production cost the taxpayers as much as 24,000 dollars.
The white green Sikorsky vh-3d, known as "Marine one," when the president is on board, has become a central element of the event on July 17 at the White House, where American construction programs were shown.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike pens and senior White House officials examined technological products from all 50 states.
The shipyard was built in Connecticut, with a yacht from the state of Maine, a fire car from Wisconsin and a truck from Mississippi.
According to the records of the first Squadron of the Marines (hmx-1), the department responsible for the administration of the vertolyot, the White House Military Administration ordered the presence of a helicopter in a private order, or "FRAGO," just 36 hours before the landing on the South Lawn on the occasion of the "unusual" event.
"I just wanted you to convince you that you are in the course because it's an unusual high-profile event," the commander of hmx-1 wrote in an electronic letter to his chief, the First Deputy Chief of Aviation of the Marine Corps, on the eve of the event.
The letter stated that he would arrive at the South Lawn at about 7 a.m. on July 17, to participate in an event scheduled for 3 hours, and will remain there until the lawn will be released between 6 and 9 pm on the same day.
The letter adds that if the departure from the White House will be held, the second crew will be required for the reverse flight, in accordance with the restrictions on working hours.
The first crew was escorting during the event, while security officers remained close to the aircraft while it was on the ground.
From the records received by the Time magazine, it was unclear whether the second crew was required.
The hatch law prohibits federal employees from using state property for political purposes.
According to the records, hmx-1 specified whether the event was not in conflict with this Regulation.
"among other things, we asked if this was not a violation of the hatch law, and we replied that no," the commander wrote.
"It seems that you are nowhere to go," the Deputy Chief replied.
The event "Made in America" was announced by the White House as an official event, and the hatch law did not spread.
But even official events have political notes.
During the event, the President made efforts to advance the reform of the health sector, former at that time in the Senate, and praised attempts to regulate Government orders.
The use of aircraft known as "Marine one" and "Air Force One" for political purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.
The Presidents are required to use them for travel.
But it is unusual for them to ask them for the sake of photography.
Trump has already been the subject of discussions in February, when the presidential plane drove back to the back of his first election rally in Melbourne, Florida, and his Twitter account was sealed with complaints about the use of the presidential plane by his predecessor.
"The White House is delighted by the show" Made in America, "which featured products from 50 States made by American workers from American materials," said the Deputy Spokesperson of the White House, Lindsay Walters.
The hmx-1 crews often perform training shelves around the Washington agglomeration and on the South Lawn to train the transportation of the President of the United States into a White House with an accuracy of up to inches.
When Trump in early July was at the G-20 summit in Germany, hmx-1 conducted 58 training camps at the White House.
According to one of the officials, the flight carried out for the event "Made in America," was counted to the crew by the necessary training shelves per month.
The units of the Unit were also flying 11 additional hours on the same day as part of the "non-presidential support tasks."
According to the White House, the taxpayers did not charge the costs of any of the other exhibits presented at the event.
The representative of Sikorsky said that the company did not take part in organizing a demonstration on the South Lawn.
Hmx-1 does not take into account the budget for the presidential regiments, and it is difficult to determine the exact amount spent on the event.
But, according to the hourly rates of the Ministry of Defense for the 2017 fiscal year, the reimbursement rate of the Ministry of Defense for vh-3d amounts to 24,380 dollars per hour.
In the records of the Unit, it was reported that the flight time in the air was 30 minutes each side from his home airbase on the aviation base of the kuantiko Marine Corps in Virginia.
The White House claims that the real value of the use of the vertex is much lower than that rate.
"calculate the cost for taxpayers based on the approximate rate of reimbursement," says Walters.
"These Approximate rates include personnel, services and many other irreversible costs that are included in the annual appropriation."
According to a study conducted in 2015 by RAND Corporation, the rates of reimbursement do not include the cost of the personnel, but, indeed, take into account the cost of fuel, services and expenses specified in the contract.
At that time, the former White House spokesman, Shawn Spicer, spoke in defence of the use of the helicopter for the event.
"The idea is to show this week things made in America," Spier said.
"And I know that Sikorsky and the State of Connecticut are very proud of the fact that they contribute to national security, and that there are, I guess, hundreds, if not thousands of people who depend on it.
And I think, like most Americans, that we are all proud of this belief and other military equipment, which has worked tirelessly for so many Americans.
Therefore, of course, it is absolutely appropriate to draw attention to this."
It was unclear whether Trump worked with a verthom, exploring the South Lawn during the event, but he was just sitting on the driver's car in a fire vehicle.
Within the White House, Trump turned to the representatives of Sikorsky, with the press on the subject of its own fleet of companies.
"I really know Sikorsky," the president said. "I have three."
Moscow will allocate grants for the resuscitation departments of city hospitals
Every year," Save Lives "grants will be allocated to resuscitation and intensive care units of Metropolitan medical clinics.
Funds will be sent to encourage doctors and nurses.
The Mayor of Moscow, Sergei Sobyanin, visited the city clinical hospital named after Yudina.
During the examination of the clinic, he presented a letter of thanks to the traumatologist Of The traumatologist Victor proko, who was led by a complex operation for the reconstruction of the teenager's feet.
Sergei Sobyanin also spoke about the decision to allocate annual reanimation and intensive care units to city clinics.
Funds will be sent to encourage doctors and nurses.
According to the Capital City Mayor, the Udina Clinical Hospital is currently one of the largest in Moscow.
Over the past few years, the clinic has received new modern equipment, allowing its doctors to carry out unique operations.
The Clinic was opened in 1961 on the basis of the Kolomenskaya rural hospital.
Currently, medical facilities are designed to receive more than a thousand patients.
In addition to resuscitation and inpatient care, there are day offices.
The staff of the hospital has 2,800 people.
The total area occupied by the Medical Clinic is 23.7 hectares.
In February of this year, the medical institution became a participant of a pilot project on the organization of short-term stays (UPC).
They are designed for relatively small operations.
In the process of surgery, advanced medical equipment is used to significantly reduce the duration of the rehabilitation of patients.
After surgery, they spend only a few hours.
In the first half of this year alone, 36 thousand patients were provided with inpatient medical care at the Udina Clinical Hospital.
Medical staff of the clinic performed 15800 operations of varying degrees of difficulty.

In Venice, toughening fines for tourists for improper behavior
The Venice authorities have toughened fines for bathing in canals from 50 euros to 500 euros.
For walking around the city in a swimsuit or with a naked cake, there will now be a penalty of 200 euros.
For 100 euros, it will require those who organize a picnic in a public place or ride a bike on pedestrian areas, TASS reports to the Association of Tour Operators of Russia.
Moreover, it is mentioned that the authorities provide for a fine for the inscriptions on monuments 400 euros and for rubbish 25 euros.

He remains a Senator from the Khabarovsk Krai.
A statement asking him to release him from the post of Ozer was written last week.
He explained his decision to rotate and his desire to "change the rhythm of life."
The Senator also noted that the decision on care was not short-term.

Electricity is cheap for residents and for producers of Buryatia
The efforts of the Soviet and post-Soviet authorities of the Republic of Buryatia (Eastern Siberia) to establish fair tariffs for consumers of electric energy are beginning to bear fruit.
As of September 1, 25% of the electricity costs are low for industrial consignees.
The Federal Antimonopoly Service of the country, in accordance with the decision of the Government of the Russian Federation "On Amendments to the rules of the wholesale electricity and power market and in the consolidated forecast balance of the production and supply of electrical energy (power) within the framework of the Unified Energy System of Russia on subjects of the Russian Federation" (dated 17.07.2017 No. 842), established indicative prices for electricity and power for industrial consumers of the Republic of Buryatia.
As a result, the cost of electric power for Buryat producers is reduced by a quarter, which will significantly facilitate the lives of small and medium-sized enterprises and individual entrepreneurs.
For many decades, the leaders of the Republic have offended the vices of Moscow offices in their futile efforts to equate the region in tariffs with the neighboring Irkutsk region with a cascade of hydroelectric power plants in the hangar, flowing from Baikal, the main watershed of which is Buryatia.
And only this year the movement began.
In March, electricity tariffs for the population of the Republic were reduced from 4.24 roubles/kWh to 3.93 roubles/kWh, or 7.3%.
With the inclusion of Buryatia by a decision of the Federal Government on the list of Territories of the wholesale market, for which the peculiarities of the operation of wholesale and retail markets have been established, the industrial consumers' skull has been established.
According to analysts, this is only the beginning, as the population of the Irkutsk region pays for kilowatt/hour 1.01 roubles.
But no one is going to call at least the approximate date of new tariff shifts towards Buryatia.

The National Union of unskilled, municipal and cooperative workers (GMB) is concerned about the investment at mcvitie's factory in Glasgow
The Union requires guarantees by managers of the mcvitie manufacturer, in relation to his long-term obligation to produce at Glasgow factory.
The Scottish branch of GMB reports that the company has been silent on the issue of future investments in the tolkcross facility.
In the factory producing, among other products, hobnobs and rich tea, more than 500 people work.
Pladis, owner of mcvitie's, reports that over the past few years has invested more than 5 million pounds.
The company adds that, in the event of any changes in the work of the facility, employees and representatives of the Trade Union "know the first."
In a letter to the head of the company owned by the company, the Scottish branch of GMB demanded mcvitie's reaction to concern that funding would not be used to modernize production lines.
The Senior organizer of the drew daffee said: "The members of our Union are deeply concerned that we cannot achieve clarity from the general manager of the business needs and investment plan for the future of tolkcross."
Families have worked for generations, and the concentration of workers is high in the local society and in greater Glasgow; it is a crucial pillar of decent work in the territory of high unemployment and social deprivation.
Thus, from the point of view of jobs, wages and prosperity, and against the backdrop of brevity, the growth of the subsistence minimum and the chronic decline of production, the East and Glasgow desperately needs the prosperity of production at mcvitie's factory.
According to the representative of pladis," the head of the tolkcross facility only yesterday received a letter from the Scottish branch of the GMB, and the company will respond immediately, as we value our ongoing cooperation with employees and representatives of the Union."
Two months ago, we held a regular meeting with the staff and representatives of GMB, which openly discussed a number of issues.
We spoke with employees that as all companies working in the most competitive and unstable economic environment, we are constantly reviewing our actions - and this applies to all of our facilities and activities - to remain competitive.
"Over the past few years, we have invested more than £5 million into our tolock facility, especially in production lines and improving functional performance."
We are fully aware of the value of tolcross as a production facility, and, in the case of any changes in the work at this site, employees and representatives of the Union will learn about this first."
Putin said the authorities will not give directions to Rosneft and Gazprom
Vladimir Putin said that the issue of gas supply to the Eastern Petrochemical Company (vnac) should be connected to the Kremlin and the Cabinet of Ministers, but Gazprom's instructions, like Rosneft, will not be given.
Thus, Russian President Vladimir Putin responded to the request by Igor Sechin to assist in resolving the conflicts that have emerged.
The Head of State drew attention to the fact that relations between Rosneft and Gazprom should be decided exclusively on the basis of market principles.
Earlier, the head of Rosneft, Igor Sechin, at a meeting on the implementation of major investment projects in the Far Eastern Federal District, said that the absence of an agreement with Gazprom on Gaza for the WNC is threatening the duration of the project.
Sechin noted that the dialogue with Gazprom on this issue is ongoing.
Gazprom proposes to find gas resources from the perimeter of Rosneft, but we have no such resources," Sechin added.
Let us recall that Rosneft has asked for permission to use for the "Eastern Petrochemical Company" gas from the kirinsky field "Gazprom," located on the shelf of Sakhalin.
In June, Gazprom stated that negotiations on this issue are continuing and there is no "sharp corners there."
Did you warn the "PSG" "Barcelona" about the transition of nemar three years ago?
A member of La League may regret his interest in Marco Verratti
"PARI Saint-Germain" will not stop persecuting nemar after the club has offered 189 million pounds for his ransom, but did they warn them "Barcelona" about the world record of flying three years ago?
The sensational proposal revived the summer transfer window, when the League club 1 was ready to beat the world record at the cost of the transition, more than double the previous mark related to the return of the field to Manchester United in the past season for 89 million pounds.
When the transition ends, neida will become the most expensive player in the world, as well as the highest pay for a professional athlete in the world, as "PSG" offers him a salary of more than 500,000 pounds a week clean.
It is known that "Barcelona" and the fury of the proposal, and how neimar broke the contract, despite the fact that, as the source is close to the leadership of the Catalan club, the club has always done everything possible for the player since its transition from Santos in 2013.
But hasn't the football world been warned about this possibility three years ago by the President of "PSG"?
When Manchester City expressed interest in the hiring of Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser al-helaifi issued a tough warning to any club who would like to turn one of the best players in the "PSG."
"I'm not worried because they know that if they are touched by one of our players, then we will be against them, we will make suggestions to their players," al-helaifi said.
"We respect all clubs.
But if they try to recruit one of our players, they are waiting for the consequences."
It appears that Barcelona has crossed this line when the Spanish club earlier this summer expressed interest in a midfielder from "PSG" Marco Verratti.
"PSG" has made it clear that the Italian player will not let the Italian team go on under any conditions, and now probably "Barcelona" feels the consequences of his offer in the form of losing one of its most valuable players, nemar.
Putin has instructed to deal with the payments to the victims of forest fires.
Russian President Vladimir Putin has instructed to understand the material assistance that is allocated to the victims of forest fires and to the construction of new housing.
Today, I would like to hear how work is going on.
In particular, I ask you to report on the situation with payment, compensation to injured citizens.
I have a somewhat different reading.
"In this regard, I would also like to ask the relevant colleagues about how much money is allocated," Putin said at a meeting with the leaders of the regions located on Baikal.
On August 4, Vladimir Putin visited the Baikal state natural biosphere reserve.
Putin accompanied the Plenipotentiary of the President of the Russian Federation in the Siberian Federal District, Sergei changed, and Chief of the Baykalsk branch of the fagbu branch," glavfish," Leonid Mikhailov.
They spoke about the work on the treatment of the lake.
Then they showed Malkov in the open capacity next to the container, which was prepared for breeding.
First, Putin released a few boys from the Saya.
Then he pulled behind a special lever on the lid of the container and released the rest.
Also during the trip, the leader instructed to look into the environmental situation in Baikal and to build a road on Olkhon Island.
According to the Ministry of Justice, there is a need for one volume, and there is a supposedly other volume.
"I want to understand that, in fact, there is a financing for us," said the Russian leader.
Let us recall that in the course of the forest fires in 2017, the fires were covered by the settlements of Buryatia, the Irkutsk Region, the destruction of residential buildings and economic structures.
