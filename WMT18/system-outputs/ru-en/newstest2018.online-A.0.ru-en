Russian President Vladimir Putin has signed a law on the introduction of administrative liability for violation of the term and order of payment for goods (works, services) in the procurement for State and municipal needs.
This law is intended to solve the very acute problem of non-fulfillment of its obligations by customers in the implementation of State and municipal procurement.
Two years ago, the situation, when businessmen could not get payment on already executed state and municipal contracts, was widespread.
At the same time, the Russian President instructed the Prosecutor General's Office to take the problem to special control.
Because the businessmen themselves could not cope with unscrupulous customers who concluded unfunded contracts, tried in every way to evade the commitments made on payment and included in the contracts illegal conditions.
The problem was systemic in general in the country.
Since 2015, the prosecutor's office has made 9.7 thousand in order to protect the rights of entrepreneurs to receive payment on public orders. The results of their consideration to disciplinary responsibility attracted 4.5 thousand. Officials, to administrative-533, the investigative bodies for the organization of procedural checks submitted 75 materials, on 46 of them criminal cases were opened.
As a result, the debt owed to entrepreneurs in the amount of more than 66 billion rubles was liquidated.
And these huge sums were not accumulated as a result of non-payment of multi-billion contracts.
Numerous, systematic delays in payment of services to businessmen on much more modest sums have led to fabulous debts.
This is a typical case.
The head of the small company won the competition for the provision of services on social transportation for several million rubles.
The man has put all his circulating assets, has completely fulfilled obligations, but the put money in time has not received.
The result is a growing financial com from debts on wages, taxes, credits, which would lead to bankruptcy, if the businessman did not appeal to the prosecutor's office for help.
Now in some regions the problem has been maximally neutralize.
Nevertheless, as of the first half of 2017, the total volume of debt under state and municipal contracts, identified by the prosecutors of the constituent entities of the Russian Federation, amounted to about 27.4 billion rubles.
In regions where debt indicators continue to reach critical values, the prosecutor's office operates in a manual crisis management regime.
The Attorney-General personally conducts on-site meetings with representatives of the local authorities, where all prosecutors ' disclosed violations and measures for their immediate elimination are subject to a substantive hearing.
Such operational meetings have already been held in Yaroslavl and Yekaterinburg this year.
The implementation of federal law № 189-FZ "On amendments to the Code of the Russian Federation on Administrative Offences in the part of establishing administrative responsibility will be able to improve qualitatively the payment discipline of public customers" Officials of the customer for violation of the term and order of payment of goods (works, services) in the procurement for the provision of state and municipal needs ", which was signed last week by the president of Russia.
The draft law was developed by the Ministry of Development of Russia on the initiative of Prosecutor General.
The new law will supplement the Code of the Russian Federation on Administrative Offences with the article, which provides for a fine of 30 thousand. Up to 50 thou. Rubles for violation by the official of the customer of the term and order of payment for goods, works and services under state and municipal procurement.
And if an official has already been subjected to administrative punishment for a similar offence, he will be disqualified for a period of one to two years.
All prosecutors of the subjects of the Russian Federation have already received the order to ensure the application of these legislative novels in practice.
Civil Rights protection group announces warning on movement in Missouri
The National Association for the Advancement of the color population has issued a warning for colored people traveling to Missouri because of the discriminatory policies of the state and racist attacks.
The statement of the group sounds like this: "The warning for the Traveling National Association for the Advancement of the color population, valid until August 28, 2017, encourages American travelers, guests and citizens of Missouri to be Especially attentive and cautious when travelling in the state due to a number of dubious racist incidents that have recently occurred throughout the state and are listed here. "
According to the National Association for the Advancement of the color population, to announce a warning on the movement of the group prompted a recent law in Missouri, which made it more difficult for people to win lawsuits related to discrimination, as well as what State law enforcement agencies disproportionately choose their minority sites.
"You have people subjected to human rights violations.
They stop on the roads because of the color of the skin, they are beaten and killed ",-said the newspaper" Kansas City Star "Rod Chapel, president of the National Association for the Advancement of color population of Missouri.
"We hear complaints often like never before."
This is the first warning of its kind announced by the organization to the U.S. state.
The Panel referred to incidents such as humiliation of black students on racial grounds at the University of Missouri and the death of Dvadcativosmiletnego Tori Sanders, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders was killed in suspicious circumstances earlier this year after he ran out of gasoline during his trip to the state, and the Missouri police arrested him without accusing him of a crime.
The warning also mentions the recent report of the Missouri General Prosecutor's Office, according to which the probability of being stopped on the road for black drivers is 75 percent higher than for whites.
"The goal of the warning is for people to be aware of the situation and to warn their relatives and friends and colleagues about what might happen in Missouri," Chapel said.
"People should be prepared in some way, whether they will take money for collateral or tell relatives that they are traveling through the state."
According to the latest data from the FBI Hate crime report, 100 hate crimes were reported in Missouri in 2015, making the State sixteen in the state by the number of such violations.
Also, the movement warning is a response to the new Missouri state law, which will make it harder to bring a case against a legal person in connection with housing or labour discrimination.
Earlier, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) announced warnings for travellers to Texas and Arizona after these states passed new immigration control laws, according to which local law enforcement authorities It was ordered to arrest people for violating immigration laws, which, according to ACLU, should have increased the number of checks on racial grounds.
Movement warnings are usually issued by the State Department in relation to other countries, but recently public organizations have resorted to this measure in response to certain laws and trends within the United States.
Two people killed in a police patrol in Egypt
The unknown fired a police patrol in the Egyptian city of isnâ, Reuters reports citing the Ministry of the Interior of Egypt.
Two people, including one policeman, were killed and three people were injured during the shooting.
All the wounded were taken to the hospital.
According to the agency, the police stopped the car, after which two armed men in the car opened fire on police officers.
One of the intruders was detained, the second managed to escape.
Rosturizm supports the law on cancellation of free baggage for non-return tickets
Head of the federal Oleg Safonov said in an interview to the RBC TV channel that "positively" refers to the adoption of the Law on the abolition of free baggage in non-return tickets.
"It is necessary to create conditions under which a person who has no luggage can buy a ticket cheaper than the one with the luggage,"-he said (quote on TASS).
At the same time, Mr. Safonov noted that despite the fears of citizens, it is not necessary to pay for the carriage of outerwear and mobile phone in hand luggage.
"It would be correct to calm all our citizens and tourists and declare it, to say that it is to the top clothes, to the umbrella, to the mobile phone, to ajpjedu or even to some computer the relationship will not have,"-said the head of Federal.
Earlier, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a law providing for the right of airlines to rule out the free baggage allowance for non-refundable tickets.
We are talking about the fact that airlines can determine the number of seats and the weight of the baggage included in the non-refundable rate.
Vladimir Putin instructed to eliminate Baikal pollution
Russian President Vladimir Putin at a meeting on the protection of Baikal said that in recent years significant areas of the lake were subjected to extreme pollution.
He instructed to identify sources of financing, plans and executors for the elimination of pollution.
Mr. Putin also instructed to carry out a full remediation of contaminated areas.
"It is necessary to understand the objects that continue to work here, treatment facilities of most of them are worn out," the president quotes "RIA Novosti".
He added that the Prosecutor General's Office of Russia should conduct a check on the detection of environmentally harmful activities.
According to him, in the area of the lake there are problems associated with the emergence of natural landfills and a number of disturbances in the field of ecology on the part of the organizers of recreation.
"I want to emphasize this: not all to check, here too measure to know, but it is-illegal and environmentally harmful activities and take appropriate measures,"-he said.
Earlier, the PGO reported on the reduction of fish stocks in Lake Baikal and proposed to increase the number of objects covered by environmental surveillance.
Recall, on June 15, Vladimir Putin in a straight line announced the need to change the legislation to ensure the rights of citizens living in the natural areas of the special protection regime.
The inhabitants of the island of Olkhon, who enters the Baikal natural territory, informed him about the problems with conducting economic activity.
The head of the Ministry of Environment Sergei Donskoy immediately proposed to solve the problem by refining the boundaries of the water protection zone of Baikal, but the government of Buryatia reminded that such a change is not enough, as the restrictions are connected with a number of normative acts.
Earlier the Ministry of Economy proposed to solve the problem by changing the land Code and the Law on Environmental protection.
A new temple will appear in Yugra
In the village of Sosva members of the community of representatives of the small indigenous peoples of the North "Rahtynja", together with the residents of Berezovsky district take part in the construction of the Orthodox Church in honor of St. Nicholas the miracle Worker.
Its location-River coast, the temple will be well visible from afar, so it serves as a beacon for the fishermen.

Igrimskaja EW fleet provided transport support.
The temple is named in honor of St. Nicholas, as it is revered by the Orthodox Church as a patron of travelers, including fishermen.
In Sosve, the same fishery gives the settlers a job, feeds them.
Locals wait for the temple to open its doors, and children even write about it as a local attraction in school compositions.
Disneyland with the death penalty.
Why does Singapore comply with laws?
I'm talking to a local businessman Chang, sitting in an open-air diner.
Commenting on the situation in Singapore, Chang smokes one cigarette after another, butts are carefully mothballing in Prihvachennuju with him from the Office iron box.
After the end of the conversation the businessman goes to the nearest urn-to it meters hundred-and throws there steers.
A fine for garbage in a public place-500 local dollars,-reports Chang.
You know, I've had a reflex since my childhood: you can't throw wrapper from candy to the pavement, instantly fined.
And now there are cameras everywhere.
And really-the sidewalks of Singapore in the center of the city are clean, as if in a museum.
Chang tells: three months ago the 18-year-old son of his neighbor painted graffiti wall of the old colonial building.
The court found the guy guilty of vandalism and sentenced him to flogging.
What?!
Imagine.
He got ten strokes of a wooden stick on his buttocks and spent a week in prison.
We are not uncommon in corporal punishment.
As Singapore combines the highest standard of living and incredibly harsh laws, the columnist "AIF" was on the spot.
Here, no one is thinking of abolishing the death penalty, "says lawyer Viktor Lee Hong.
And the government has long spit on the opinion of both the EU and the US on this occasion.
If a person carries a large batch of drugs or trades them, he is put in a gallows.
In 2002, a 22-year-old Australian citizen was detained at Changi Airport: He was carrying 400 g of cocaine with him.
He was defended by the Australian Prime Minister, threatening sanctions, international human rights defenders and even the pope.
But the guy ended up hanging anyway.
After that mule our country diligently circle the party.
The point is this: in Singapore, it is assumed that laws are required to comply with everything, not just modest and unrich people.
No matter who you are-a millionaire, a deputy prime minister, a famous artist or a resident of the European Union.
option in this case one: if you find pound cocaine, you'll be hung.
When you walk around Singapore and everywhere you meet the tablets with a lot of warnings, simply Diva is a matter-how much in this city-state bans!
For example, chewing gum is sold only in pharmacies, and you can buy it strictly by prescription (!) doctor.
The tourist on arrival chewing gum is not wrest, but it is necessary to stick "gum" in the subway, punched a fine of 1 thousand. Local dollars
For four days I met two people with white plates on the neck: "I mess".
For thrown past the urns butt in addition to the penalty is often sentenced to "link to the janitors": a week to clean up parks and beaches.
6 thous. Rub. Pays "offender", who has retired to rinse the water in the public toilet, and when trying to celebrate a small need in the elevator of the apartment house triggered a special detector-blocked doors and sent a signal to the police.
Among the most exotic laws-bans on feeding pigeons on the street, public performance of songs and even excessive watering of houseplants (!): It is believed that the abundance of water attracts mosquitoes.
To avoid fires smokers can not carry lighters in the subway, otherwise fined for 5 thousand. Singapore Bucks.
In general, there is a thought: no matter how hard you try, necessarily something break.
This is not the case,-tries to dissuade me Mohammed Kabir-Kadzharija, owner of a local travel agency.
Especially fantastic laws exist only on paper, and for the last twenty years I have not seen that for their violation someone attracted.
Why are they saved?
So that citizens don't relax.
Adherence to the basic rules is strictly followed.
For example, if a minor is sold in a kiosk of cigarettes, then all the chain will be punished: The owner of the store pays a huge sum, the intruder will get blows with sticks on the "back", and the seller also flogging and put in jail.
It is because of such harsh laws that the offences in Singapore are very rare.
Is it justified?
Back in the Seventies we were in chaos on the roads-motorists ignored the traffic lights, drove as they wanted, sat drunk behind the wheel.
After the introduction of fines for the year everything calmed down.
Now the driver, after drinking a portion of whiskey, knows: If you stop, the police will not let go for a bribe, impose a fine in the amount of the cost of the apartment and for years to send to jail.
To many foreigners the city-state in south-East Asia seems to be a kind of concentration camp.
In 1993, American writer William Gibson named Singapore "Disneyland with the death penalty"-a guest from the U.S. has horrified the universal wealth of residents, "frightening clean airport" and "cultivated nature".
Say, such things are unnatural, look artificial, and so in principle should not be.
The first days in Singapore and rightly fear to throw a piece of paper on the sidewalk, SPOHVATYVAESHSJA, if you went to the subway with ice cream.
But then come to the area "Little India", and suddenly-"break pattern": The bus stop is lying plastic cups.
"And how is it?"-You wonder.
Chuckle Singaporeans.
Things do happen.
Not for every such "crime" will be captured on the spot, but you must know: If you calculates, do not OTMAZHESHSJA-because you broke the law.
More often than not, it is enough for a person to behave normally.
Of course, the power in Singapore is quite authoritarian.
But you know what?
In Vietnamese Ho Chi Minh City I moved very cautiously-motorcyclists often grab from the hands of tourists smartphones and cameras.
In the center of Paris is full of dirty bums and beggars.
In our streets, too, not all try to throw trash in the urns.
Singapore, however, through a set of draconian fines and ruthless (down to death penalty) laws has become the most peaceful, clean and safe city on Earth.
Prizadumaeshsja.
This is human nature: remember, and in Russia, no one bracing at the wheel, until they began to fine.
Although the main thing in Singapore is not fines, but voluntary enforcement of laws.
And we should think that in Russia people would also be glad to clean streets, lack of debris in the subway and would welcome the arrest of those who confuse the elevator with the public toilet.
That's corporal punishment--thanks, No.
The rest of Singapore's laws are at least worth looking at.
Nothing sacred?
Now the White House of Trump targeting on the Statue of Liberty.
The most reliable sign of regime change is when it starts to fight the statues.
Americans realize this is no worse than everyone else-hence the deliberate theatrical demolition of the statue of Saddam Hussein at Firdos Square in Baghdad in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of Trump's key ideologists, undoubtedly knew what he was doing when he blacklisted a symbolic axe over the Statue of Liberty during a fierce controversy with CNN reporter Jim Acosta about the president's proposals to drastically reduce Legal migration.
Let's be honest, Miller won't attempted on the statue itself.
Hordes of boat owners and artists depicting the Statue of Liberty would lynched him if he tried to do it.
But he attempted to its meaning, and especially to the meaning which was ascribed to her in 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, when the poems of Emma Lazarus were added to the pedestal.
As Miller grumbled at Akostu: "I do not want to enter deep into history, but the Statue of Liberty is... A symbol of American freedom that illuminates the world.
The poem you are talking about has been added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty. "
Miller set out the facts correctly, but as he said, it's not really about history.
It is about the present sounding of the startling words of Lazarus, the only ones in which the State invites not any immigrants, but the poorest: "Your tired, your poor,/your crowds, dreaming to breathe freely,/miserable scum of your abundant shores ".
Never have "miserable scum" been so visible on our screens.
Miller was not engaged in literary-he made it clear that in America Trump these people are not waiting.
This dispute about the meaning of the statue is part of a broader political and cultural war: it is indeed a dispute about the meaning of America.
Lazarus-and her friends, fought for putting her words on the plinth of the statue after her death-very well understood that they are committing a completely political act.
The sculpture was intended to mark the connection between the French and the American republics with the help of a banal classical figure-a feminine image of freedom.
Lazarus changed its meaning: in her poem female figure is no longer abstract, she has a voice.
And she got a completely different name: The mother of the exiled.
The compound of the poem and the image was a brilliant feminist move and a devastating attack against the American Nativizma.
And as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, the right one though to change it back.
Loud Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist, announceding the advent of Trump, in 2010 reasoned that freedom does not invite anyone, rather it is an early neocon, carrying the flames of America underlying in the darkness of the World: "Freedom goes forward.
It carries the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
The torch is not needed to illuminate the way to the United States. "
Against the habit of limbo here really hit the point.
The meaning of the statue depends solely on the angle of view.
The great creative achievement of Lazarus was to see it as it would be seen by Haggard, unhappy, but hopeful people on decks of ships after a long and often heavy voyage.
It means literally looking at the world through the eyes of people who seek refuge and a chance for a better life.
Her statue responds to them with the words of hope and hospitality that they dream to hear.
And of course, this is not the perspective that Miller and Trump will ever want to admit.
Their torch is not needed to illuminate the path, but to incite hatred, which is the only source of their power.
World Championship 2017: Neil Blake highly appreciates the Scottish members of the UK team.
Eilidh Doyle remembers the time when the UK team had only two Scots
Neil Blake, director of the UK Athletics federation, said that the 16-man Scottish part of the World Cup team will make "a significant contribution to the team's game."
A record number of Scottish athletes were selected for the London 2017 Championship, which begins on Friday.
Blake believes that in Scotland "something special is Born" and the UK Athletics federation should take this into account.
"We know that and we try to understand and support them as long as they have the potential," Blake said.
"I have spoken to people at the Scottish Sports Institute and they think it is due to what they have done.
The Scottish Athletics Federation thinks that with what they have done, it is necessary to work.
British Athletics Federation: with what they've done, you have to work.
And people on the street think the same way.
I don't know why the circumstances are so, but it's perfectly brilliant. "
Some of the Scottish athletess claim medals, including Laura Muir and Andrew Bachert-who will compete with Sir Mo Farah at a distance of 5000 m; And Eilidh Doyle's team chose his captain.
"Eilidh Modest.
Her captain's speech was great, "Blake says.
"Many athletes, whether they are Scots or not, and from where they live or train, come out of this room, feeling pride and mood to win.
The passion and sincere feelings that Eilidh put into her were remarkable. "
The winner of the silver Medal of the Commonwealth Championship, which at its fifth world championship would run a distance of 400 m with obstacles, said that 16 Scots in the British national team-it's "incredible".
The previous record for the number of Scots at the World Cup was equal to seven, in 1983 and 2005.
Ahead is Laura Muir, specializing in the middle distance and breaking last year five British and two European records.
It runs at 1500 and at 5000 meters.
Chris O'hjer, who will participate in the race at 1500 m, is another Scotsman, which is worth paying attention to: behind his back he had a good season, in which there were victories in the qualifying competitions of the British national team and at the annual competitions.
Doyle recalls his first World Cup when besides her only Scottish team was McConnell.
The captain of the team says that she is "incredibly proud" because so many of her compatriots have not only entered the national team, but in some cases will claim medals and fight for the final.
"The captain of the team is chosen by other members, so it was a huge honor in any case, but to know that your comrades voted for you and chose you,-for me it is a very special thing,"-she added.
"Of course, I am very proud of all the Scots who have entered the national team.
It shows how much we have achieved.
And they are all-held athletes who will strive to get on the podium.
And what about my captain's speech?
Yes, I think she was good.
I just paid attention to the fact that we were very fortunate to host the World championship.
So it's just about how important it is to get support from the fans and take advantage of the fact that we will be back at the Olympic Stadium.
I got another chance to go to his arena and take part in competitions, and the atmosphere there will be just wonderful. "
Blocking critics on Facebook: no need to move to public office if you are not ready to listen to criticism from voters
The founder of our country understood what the critical press is.
Americans loved George Washington, but that did not prevent them from criticizing him for everything from domestic politics to his political principles.
His criticism, of course, annoyed.
But he didn't plugged his critics.
Because back in 1783 Washington said: "You can take away the freedom of speech and us, deaf and dumb, will lead as sheep to the slaughter."
Now I'm going to go to the governor of Maryland, Larry Hogan, who should try to be more like Washington.
Hogan's subordinates blocked and erased the posts of at least 450 people who expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page.
And this week, the American Union for the protection of civil liberties sued him for it.
The subordinates of the governor called this lawsuit null and the comment on the Internet was written in the spirit of "well and what."
"It's just Facebook," many will say.
But this is also important.
And that's especially important when it comes to a guy like Hogan.
He is a surprisingly popular Republican governor in a democratic state.
He is in second place in the rating of approval among 50 governors of the country.
Hogan's not a stubborn reshareholder.
He demonstrated a firm hand in the management of the State and commitment to its principles.
He also deftly uses Facebook as the primary way of communication with his constituents and with jokes demonstrates on his page his bald after chemotherapy head.
Therefore block people who come to the governor's page-which is declared as an official public forum and is conducted by the administration staff on taxpayers ' money-it is unnecessary and ultimately harmful.
In an interview with The Washington Post, the spokesman for Amelia Chas defended the governor's actions, arguing that the blocking of comments is simply their moderation.
But it is too easy-to use the image of trolls, spammers and hate, zlobstvujushhih on the Internet.
The post talked to some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.
And these are real people, not trolls,-a teacher, a businessman, a pastor who turn to their chosen leaders.
All of them say that their comments were respectful, informative and not rude.
The pastor quoted the Bible, appealing to Hogan as a Catholic.
Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Raman of Bowie, Maryland, did not express hatred, but asked about hate crimes.
"I wrote a polite comment that I was disappointed by the lack of his reaction to hate crimes and other recent news," she wrote in the comments section of the article in the post.
"I also do not like the idea that when a lot of people leave comments on the same topic, some immediately say that it is a so-called cheat, instead of admitting that they are dealing with a large group of disgruntled citizens."
The fact that subordinates of the governor are called "concentrated spam-attack", others, probably, would call "active life position".
In the Facebook era, it's easy to edit your image by simply blocking critics or erasing negative comments.
This is much less dusty work than before when it was required to send people, collect and burn newspapers with critical editorialss or arrest and stop the mouth of protesters.
But this is exactly what is happening now, only in the figure.
Haugen is not the first official to be criticized for not wanting to listen to Facebook or any other networking.
President Trump was sued by Twitter users who were banned from his Twitter account.
One of the first, pivotal decisions on this topic was made this week in Virginia.
According to the U.S. District Judge of Alexandria, James K. Kjesherisa, the chairman of the Laudon County Supervisory board violated the First Amendment Zabaniv the voter in his Facecbook account.
And in Kentucky, Republican governor Matt Bjevinu sued the American Union for the Protection of civil liberties for his behavior on Facebook and Twitter.
It shouldn't be that hard.
At the time of Washington, the era of affordable postal costs made about the same coup as the internet today.
From 1776 to 1800 years the number of newspapers grew four times, and the authors of anonymous letters strongly impressed his authority.
And even then, Washington was dealing with anonymous trolls.
People under pseudonyms "Jurikola", "Valerius", "Belizarius" and "Porcius" wrote letters in newspapers, deriding the decision of Washington.
According to historical documents collected by the online project "Documents of George Washington", his office was inundated with petitions, critical his position on the Treaty of Friendship, commerce and navigation.
But he didn't try to silence them.
Freedom of speech, dissent and speech lies at the very foundation of our state.
And true leadership means consenting to it.
Ronan Rafferty hopes for comfort at the Renaissance Club
Former European champion Ronan Rafferty hopes for home comfort for the next three days, when the Renaissance club in East Lothian will host the twenty-fifth open Scottish golf tournament for senior athletes.

It is magical to return to this corner of the world.
This is a great place to play golf.
Memories of the past year are coming back, and for me and my wife Sharon was a very special experience to win last year.
It was a really special time, and we will always remember it. "
He returns to the fight in his native land, Gary Orr, joined to the European tournament for senior athletes after he was 50 earlier this year.
This event will be his first appearance in the public in Scotland since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open Tournament in 2013.
"When you play at home, it is always a little more important," said a resident of Helensboro Orr.
"You want to perform well, but you feel this extra burden."
I played with great pleasure again, and I showed good golf.
I'm happy with the way things are so far. "
On the field to this trio will join the former winner of the tournament "Masters" Ian Vusnem and champions majors for senior athletes Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Marc James and Marc McNulty.

All proceeds go to the British Prostate Cancer Fund.
British roads will learn to absorb harmful emissions
Peculiar tunnels over the highways, capable of absorbing emitted cars carbon monoxide, are already tested on the roads of Great Britain.
According to the Autocar edition, the country's transport agency reported on the positive results of the tests of the 100-metre tunnel installed on one of the highways in the north of the country.
The tunnel height of 6 meters is constructed of some newest polymeric materials which are capable to absorb harmful substances contained in automobile exhausts.
However, the creation of an entire network of such tunnels is only part of the large-scale measures that the UK authorities are going to take to improve the atmosphere.
In addition to the network of tunnels, the British are going to expand the network of charging stations for electric vehicles, to implement a number of measures to reduce road traffic, to expand the use of commercial transport on electric traction and Upgrade the heavy truck fleet.
According to official statistics, a quarter of all atmospheric pollution falls on transport, and unsatisfactory air quality becomes the cause of 40 000 premature deaths per year.

28-year-old Anton Mamas was sentenced to four and a half years of imprisonment with serving punishment in the general regime colony for robbery, the victim of which was a former special forces fighter.
On July 19, the court in the remand prison released a man from custody.
Poverty and death in the Indonesian "Golden Land"
Preparing lunch, Bardina Degei does not use the stove.
She even uses the pot rarely.
In his wooden house in Jenarotali, the capital of Paniaj County in the rebellious Indonesian province of Papua, a housewife usually simply places the sweet potato, which is called "note", directly into the hearth.
In half an hour charred tuber and eat impatient, unwashed hands.
Degei sits on the ground floor – there is no furniture – and it is here that she performs her work around the house, such as washing clothes with muddy water from a nearby swamp.
The restroom serves as a bucket in a room without a roof.
She is the youngest of the four wives of her husband, and so she was not assigned to work in the field.
Polygamy here is common.
Of course, working late can be dangerous: Many men from this village are unemployed, many people drink, and yet there are soldiers.
"No one decides to walk in the village after five o'clock," she said.
This is a rare opportunity to look at the daily life in the highlands of Papua, the former Dutch colony, which was annexed to Indonesia in 1969 after a dubious referendum, when only 1026 elders were forced to vote, publicly raising Hands before the occupying troops.
The current movement for independence from the Netherlands has quickly turned its anger against the Jakarta government, which maintains tight control over the region, not allowing foreign journalists and human rights defenders.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua, while the independent State of Papua New Guinea occupies the eastern part of the island.
Jenarotali – The city is as remote as the abandoned; The road here includes a hour flight from Jayapura, the administrative center of the province, to Nabire, and then poker shaking on the employees machine.
There is no public transport here.
The city with a population of about 19 000 people consists of wooden houses obnesjonnyh bamboo fences; The roofs of corrugated steel are painted with rust in a variety of reddish shades.
Few of the Indonesians, let alone journalists, and almost none of the foreigners got here.
Prior to the arrival of Christian missionaries, Papuans Sun Pago was worshipped by a god named CAA Tamee.
There were other changes.
"It was unusual for us to wear this outfit," says Degei, showing his bright, hand-woven turban, dark skirt and bright shirt.
"We used to wear only leaves on the body."
Papua is the poorest province of Indonesia, 28% of its population lives below the poverty line, and the levels of child mortality and literacy among the worst in Asia.
But this is also the Indonesian gold land.
The world's largest and most lucrative gold mine, Grasberg, owned by the Phoenix Company "Freeport McMoran", is only sixty miles from Paniaj, a Highland province about the size of New Jersey, where 153 000 people live.
Only in 2015 the company "Freeport" has got here gold and copper approximately on 3.1, 1 billion dollars.
In addition, Papua can boast of reserves of forest, valued at 78 billion dollars.
This wealth, however, entails one misfortune for Papuans, ensuring that the powerful Indonesian armed forces maintain their suffocating presence here.
According to an investigation by the New York Times in 2005, between 1998 and 2004, Freeport paid the local troops and units nearly $20 million, including up to 150 000 dollars to one officer.
The demands of greater autonomy on the part of the Papuans threaten the existence of this golden vein and are ruthlessly suppressed.
According to human rights defenders, since 1969, Indonesia's military forces have killed more than 500 000 papuans, and thousands more have been raped, tortured and deprived of their liberty.
According to the Asian Human Rights Commission, the massacres of indigenous peoples in the highlands of Papua in the Seventies can be considered genocide.
Last year alone, Indonesian police arrested more than 3900 peaceful protesters in the region.
"We will lose everything," a report published in 2016 by the Brisbane Diocese contains testimonies of the atrocities committed in the previous year, such as the executions without trial, torture – especially as alleged in another report, rape and defeat And the brutal suppression of peaceful demonstrations.
"It's hard to count the number of casualties because the incidents take place every week," said Andreas Harsono, who studies in Indonesia for Human Rights Watch.
The nuts have dragged on because Papua resources have attracted the influx of settlers from other parts of Indonesia.
3.5-The Milionnoe population of the province is 83 per cent Christian, but demographic indicators change as Muslim economic migrants arrive from the populated of the Indonesian islands – Java, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Javanese benches, "Varungi", sell fried chicken and a mixture of vegetables "gado-gado", supplied with peanut sauce.
Locals are trying to withstand competition.
"Migrants started selling chicken and vegetables in the traditional market cheaper than indigenous people in Papua," explains Abet Yo, Dvadcatichetyrjohletnjaja native Paniaj, moved in Dzhajapuru, the provincial administrative center, because of the work.
"Because of this, the indigenous people of Papua-Mama-Mama (women) of Papua-lost their market."
Indonesian President Jock Widodo, known as the Jokowi, has vowed to address inequality and rights violations in Papua during his presidential campaign in 2014.
On his way to the presidential palace in Jakarta, the former carpenter enlisted support from 27 of the 29 districts of Papua, including Paniaj.
But almost nothing has changed in Papua, and the locals feel betrayed.
"Our hearts are broken because in 2014 we voted for Jokowi, expecting him to fulfill our hopes for justice," says Yo.
In fact, just two months after the October inauguration, Jokowi Paniaj survived the tragedy.
On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children was on the street singing Christmas carols at the campfire in Jenarotali, when two Indonesian soldiers broke out of the darkness on a motorcycle.
Frightened children told them that they should turn on the headlights.
According to the local pastor Dzhavedt Tebaj, one of the soldiers was offended by their tone and after a while returned with four soldiers.
According to the victims and eyewitnesses, the soldiers, who were drunk, chasing the children and beat them with rifle butts.
Then one of the soldiers shot at a group of children.
One child, sixteen Julianus Ejmo, was so badly beaten that he fell into a coma.
A couple of hours later someone fire a nearby government building of the Electoral Commission, and the next day the situation worsened.
About a thousand Papuan men, women and children gathered on a football field in front of a local police station and a military command center to demand justice.
They brought with them ritual hunting bows and performed white, the dance of the Papuan tribe Sun Pago: Ran around and portrayed the bird's singing.
Some protesters began to throw stones at the police station and military base.
When the situation tense, the soldiers were given an order: "If the crowd will resist more than three times, shoot them," he sounded, as stated in the official document, which was seen by the correspondents of the magazine "TIME", but which was not published in the local media.
Pjatidesjatishestiletnij Eremias Kajame, head of the meter Koto district in Jenarotali, felt the danger approaching and called for calm, asking the crowd to go home.
Nobody wanted to listen to him.
"When I turned, I suddenly got a bullet in my left wrist," he told the magazine "TIME", standing on the porch of his brightly painted wooden house.
Kajame still does not know who shot, but says that the bullet flew from the lines of the assembled soldiers.
"There was a crowd, there were many shots," he adds.
In the local resident Alfiusa Jouva got three times, as his cousin, who witnessed the shooting, tells.
"I ran up to him and examined his body to make sure it was him," Johannes, who, as many indonesianss, uses only one name, told the magazine "TIME" grimly.
"I saw that he was dead... I kissed him. "
General Jotdzhe Mende, a senior police officer in Papua, told reporters that his officers were only "defending" their base because she was being attacked.
"We must defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us," said police spokesman Pudzho Sulistijo in 2015.
"It's a matter of life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and much more injured.
The news of the murders reached Jakarta only the next day.
Three weeks later, Jokowi uttered a passionate speech in dzhajapure, expressing condolences to the families of the victims and pledging to address the historical abuse of power in Papua.
"I want this situation to be settled immediately so that it will never happen again in the future," he said.
In October 2016, Wiranto Minister of Security said he would establish a nonjudicial organization to put an end to historical human rights violations.
But almost immediately went the excuses.
"Most of the violations occurred long ago.
Some of them took place in the Nineties or at the beginning of the zero.
The fact is that we certainly want to deal with these violations, but there are procedures that need to be passed, "he said.
Wiranto then retracted his words, speaking with TIME magazine on June 5 in Jakarta, and said he had no plans to establish an organization to deal with complaints in Papua.
Instead, he said, "everything will be resolved through the court."
Wiranto, whom the United Nations accused of "crimes against humanity" in connection with the death of more than 1000 people during the bloody vote for independence of East Timor in 1999, said that 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua have were settled, including the incident in Paniaj.
The families of the victims from PANIAJ met such statements with gloomy distrust.
"I have been asked four times over the past three years, but there have been absolutely no changes," Johannes said.
"I'm tired."
He says that years later, he still lives in fear.
"I'm scared," he says.
"I am afraid that the military will arrest me, I am afraid I will be shot."
His brother Jacobus also expressed the opinion that the residents of Paniaj are afraid to discuss the incident.
He said he was beaten by the military after he helped bury four victims.
"After we buried the bodies, the military came after me," he says.
The shooting didn't stop.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police shot at villagers in the neighboring Paniaj district of Deijaj.
In a clash between villagers and the manager of a construction company who refused to help drive a man unconscious to the hospital, one person was killed and 17 others were injured, including children.
The man, Dvadcatichetyrjohletnij Ravianus Dove, drowned while catching fish in Susquehanna near the river, died on the way to the hospital.
Angry villagers protested in front of the office of the construction site owned by the company.
According to the police, the villagers hurling stones at the officers, who responded with warning shots.
But locals claim that the Mobile Brigade (Indonesian special Forces) began to shoot at the crowd and killed one person.
"We were in such a panic, we fear retaliation," told TIME magazine Dvadcatidevjatiletnij Dominggu Badia, who lives near the hospital and saw how hastily the wounded were delivered.
"I've been hiding at home for two days."
The Deijaj Parliament demanded that the officers implicated in the incident be called to account and the Mobile Police Brigade withdrawn from the region.
Panijaj has always been a sore spot for the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development is the dissatisfaction of the tribes of Sun, Moni, Dani and damal, scattered throughout the green areas of the Central highlands of Papua.
Many have joined the "Free Papua Movement" (OPM), an insurgent army that claims to be defending the rights of the Papuans by throwing sporadic attacks and raidsing the abduction of people on Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the top executives of OPM originate from Paniaj, including Thadius Yogi and Daniel Judas Cogoya.
As a retaliatory measure in recent years in Paniaj, thousands of people have been arrested and arbitrarily detained by the military on the pretext of "defending national independence".
Some never came back.
Among the population of Papua Paniaj is considered a "sad, forgotten place."
Poverty exacerbates discontent.
A small portion of the rice in the jenarotali is too expensive for the locals.
The bread in the same exact degree is not accessible.
People here grow everything they eat: mostly a note, as well as some fruits and leafy vegetables.
Agriculture is the work of women, each of whom can care for four or five fields of sweet potatoes.
Usually they keep most of the crop for the family, and the rest is sold in the local market.
The ten tubers of the note cost only 10 000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Over time, economic disparities between indigenous jimjams and new migrants have increased, and have come in large numbers since the introduction of new flights to Nabire airport.
Few existing vacancies usually reach more educated and wealthy migrants.
Papuans rarely have enough money or the necessary skills to run their own competitive business.
"Young people do not want to stay in the village... Because there's no work or money here, "says John Gobai, chairman of the Paniaj Tribal Council.
Isolation keeps Papua away from the views of the rest of the world.
In addition, restrictions on the work of international media remain rigid.
Earlier this year, French journalists Frank Jeskjudi and Basil Longchamp were deported from Papua for "lack of coherence with relevant organizations" despite the fact that they were given rare video-recording permits.
According to Felima Keene, the Deputy director for Asia of Human Rights Watch, the promises made during the Jokowi campaign to lift the restrictions on the work of the media in order to promote transparency and development have not been fulfilled.
"Now foreign journalists trying to report from the rebellious eastern Indonesian provinces, Papua and West Papua, face new dangers: denial of visa and blacklisting," he said in a statement.
The lack of attention from the press means that the international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely limited to the immediate neighbours of Papua.
In March, six Pacific States — Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands — requested the UN Human Rights Council to investigate "diverse and widespread violations" in Papua, including shooting Paniaj.
The same countries in the past supported OPM.
A spokesman for the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Arramanata Nasir, dismissed the group's statement, telling reporters in Jakarta that "there is still a democratic system in Indonesia and a free press, so hide the evidence Episodes of human rights violations would be difficult. "
The locals want more foreign governments to pay attention to the situation.
When an official delegation from the Netherlands, led by the Dutch ambassador for Human Rights Kijsom van Baarom, visited Dzhajapuru on 4 May, the locals violated the silence, praying, "We want freedom," says the source, who also attended Meeting, but wished to remain anonymous.
New presidential elections will be held in Indonesia in 2019, but Papuans say they are unlikely to vote for Jokowi again.
"Jokowi is a man who has good intentions, but is surrounded by people involved in shooting at Paniaj," says Gobai, chairman of the Tribal Council.
He wants Jokowi to know that the inhabitants of Paniaj, except that they live in the shadow of the threat from the greedy army, are mired in poverty, and education and health in them are in a miserable state.
Gobaj says that residents of Paniaj, like other Papuans, consider their voice given for Jokowi, the duty that he must pay.
"They don't need money, they just want justice," he says.
Despite threats and intimidation, the families of the victims of the shooting in paniaj the last symbolic act of disobedience: buried the body of one of the victims on a plot of land right in front of the police and military station.
Knowing that justice will probably never triumph, they at least will not allow the guilty to forget their crimes.
"A member of our family was killed," Jacobus says, not raising his head.
"What else would we do?"
The fire for the second time covers the Dubai skyscraper "Torch"
The fire engulfed one of the world's highest residential skyscraperss in Dubai on Friday, forcing hundreds of residents to hastily leave the semidesjatidevjatijetazhnuju construction at 337 metres.
This is the second fire, Pronjosshijsja on a high-rise building-which by coincidence is called "torch"-in two years.
The building was evacuated, no casualties were reported, and there were no operational news about the cause of the fire.
"We slept and woke up from fire alarms and shouts of people.
We ran down the stairs, and it took us about ten minutes to get down from the 50th floor, "said Reuters resident skyscraper, himself George.
According to the Dubai Civil Defense office, the fire brigade extinguished the fire at about 4:00 local time (00:00 GMT) and cooled the building.
The Government reported that it was working to provide asylum to victims.
The incident can bring back to the agenda the security of materials used in the exteriors of high-rise buildings around the world.
In the course of the investigation by the "torch" administration after the fire there in 2015 it became clear that the plating-external panels used for decoration and isolation were the most affected.
In the UK kingdom, the police stated that it believed that the insulation system and the Plakirovochnye panel of the Grenfell Tower in London could accelerate the spread of the fire in June, which killed about 80 people.

At least five soldiers were killed in an explosion in the Afghan province of Helmand, RIA Novosti reports.
According to the police, a mined car exploded near the military roadblock in Girishk County the night before.
It is known about 20 victims.

Diver shot on video Pokusavshuju his camera shark
The Diver and explorer Greg Skomal (Greg Skomal) captured a video of a shark that bittened his GoPro action camera.
The video was posted on Facebook by a unit of the American Marine Fisheries Agency in Massachusetts, whose staff is skomal.
The incident occurred on August 2 off the coast of Cape Cod in the northeast of the USA, clarifies the portal NECN.
A man during a scuba diving attempted to take the shark to the camera, which was held on a special stick.
Noticing a man, an animal over three meters long swam to it.
The shark began to bite the camera, and did not try to attack the scientist.
Skomal explained that the predator had acted in a similar way to determine if the gadget was edible.
The researcher added that the shark could easily destroy the device.
He also noticed that such behavior of a marine animal appeared to be a novelty for scientists.
The reason of mass fighting in the Ural Military center became known
A working group of senior officers of the Central Military District arrived to investigate the circumstances of the incident at the Elanskij Training Centre, where a mass brawl took place.
Some details of this carnage have already been known.
According to Inhouse Mash, appearing on the page "VKontakte", contractors the Ural military unit number 31612 brutally fought because of the untucked bed.
It all started with the fact that private by the name of Sayan defiantly ignored the order of the officer to fill the sticking sheet.
Soldiers from the sixth company stood on the side of the officer.
Sayan supported the first company.
For half an hour 140 young guys trashed the barracks beds and shells, knocked out the glass.
More than ten people were injured in the mass brawl.
CVO denied information about knife.
The study showed that at least one fifth of passengers in the United States carry prohibited items on the plane.
The study found that more than 20 per cent of the passengers had deliberately or accidentally carried in their luggage on board the aircraft through the security checkpoints of the United States Traffic Safety Administration, which included at least 6 per cent of the Aircraft, by overlooking the prohibited knives or other sharp objects.
Almost 1 per cent reported that they later found that they had accidentally had firearms, ammunition or explosives.
The study, conducted charter company Stratos Jet Charters, Inc. and l990s more than 1000 people, also showed that young passengers are more inclined to break the rules.
Of the respondents who admitted that consciously tried to fly with something that is prohibited ATB, 19.7 percent were millenialami compared to less than 15 percent of the members of Generation X.
Deliberately past employees ATB often carry food and water.
More than 3 per cent admitted that the sharp objects had been specially carried through the examination, and 2.2 per cent of the female respondents and 3.7 per cent of the male respondents had admitted that they had deliberately carried illegal drugs into the aircraft.
The company stated that it had studied passengers all over the country to find out how many of them had accidentally smuggled through airport searches, and how many had done so deliberately.
It is quite expected that most often-deliberately or unconsciously-jam smuggling through the inspection of those who fly the most.
As the company points out, the rules of ATB are quite complex and confusing.
People often do not know exactly what liquids they can carry and in what quantity.
It is not surprising, therefore, that most of what ATB takes is a prohibited liquid.
Some time ago people thought that ATB could be considered forbidden to carry a book.
Liquids are allowed on domestic flights, but not international.
EPA head Pruitt refuses to postpone compliance with Obama's emission reduction rules
The day after the 15-state action, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency canceled his decision to postpone the implementation of the rules adopted under Obama to reduce emissions of air pollutants and lead to the formation of smog.
Pruitt explained his decision by the fact that now his agency more than in previous administrations, listens to the needs of environmental regulators of individual states.
He did not mention the lawsuit against his previous position filed with the Federal Court of Appeal.
The dispute turned around the deadline of October 1, to which the States should ensure compliance with the 2015 ozone standards at ground level.
In June, Pruitt announced that they would postpone their observance for one year to give their office more time to study the plan and avoid "inconsistency with local decisions or obstacles to economic growth."
Pruitt, who before being appointed President Trump for his current position, was the attorney General of Oklahoma, was long known as a consistent opponent of the tightening of environmental standards.
After moving to Washington, Pruitt repeatedly blocked or postponed the introduction of norms that opposed the chemical or gas-oil industry.
Unexpected change of course on Wednesday is another legal defeat of the taken Pjuittom course to return to the previous norms.
Last month, the Federal Court of Appeals in Washington ruled that the EPA chief had exceeded his authority by attempting to delay the Obama administration's rule requiring oil and gas companies to track and reduce methane leakage .
In a statement released on Wednesday night, Pruitt suggested that by drastically changing the course on ozone standards, he was simply fulfilling the EPA's obligation to cooperate with the States in a comprehensive process of timely implementation of the new standards.
"In previous administrations, the EPA was often unable to meet the deadlines, then waited for action from groups of activists and others and discussed the timing of the case," said Pruitt, who filed more than a dozen lawsuits against the EPA at his previous Post.
"We do not believe in regulation through litigation, and we treat the deadlines seriously.
We are also serious about our charter and the power it gives us. "
However, the EPA statement states that Pruitt may at some point again use its "powers to defer and other legal credentials" to make sure that the Norms "Jcyjdfys on a clear course and on all available information".
Republicans in Congress are insisting on a broader revision of the rules on ozone.
The bill approved by the House of Representatives last month seeks to defer compliance with the 2015 regulations for at least eight years.
The Senate has not yet voted on this issue.
New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who led the state coalition that sued the EPA this week, said the group intended to continue the legal pressure.
"The evolution of the EPA-after our lawsuits-is an important victory in the fight for health and safety 6.7 million New Yorkers and more than 115 million Americans, who directly influenced the smog, covering their cities,"-said Schneiderman.
New York was joined by California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington, as well as the District of Columbia.
Ozone at ground level occurs when conventional contaminants from machines, power plants, refineries and chemical plants and other sources enter the atmosphere in response to sunlight.
The resulting smog can cause serious breathing problems for sensitive people, leading to thousands of premature deaths per year.
Health advocates and environmental advocates welcomed the unexpected change in the Prjuitta course.
"It's sad to think about how much pressure it took to get this perfectly logical step away from the man who is charged with protecting the air we breathe," said Lori Ann Bird of the Biodiversity center.
"We need to continue to resist Trump's ideological campaign and protect those who pollute the air and their special interests."
IAAF Congress extends suspension of all-Russian athletics federation

Study of Russian influence on American elections will be held by a large jury
Specprokuror in Russia, Robert Mueller convened a grand jury in Washington to study Russia's influence on the U.S. president's election in 2016, the Wall Street Journal and Reuters reported.
The grand jury is a group of ordinary citizens who collect evidence of potential criminal offences and have the right to interrogate witnesses under oath.
The collected materials will examine the specprokuror and decide whether they are sufficient for indictment.
The convening of the grand jury gives Mueller additional powers to collect evidence.
One of the topics of the jury's investigation, began the work a few weeks ago, will be the details of the son's meeting with the Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnickoj.
Mueller himself promised to check the details of this meeting held in June 2016.
They've already been studied by the FBI.

Trump Jr. earlier told that he had been waiting for compromising at the headquarters of Democratic Hillary Clinton from the meeting with Veselnickoj, but no exposing documents had been presented, and the speech was about adoption.
In early August, a number of media reported that Trump Jr. 's statement about meeting with Veselnickoj was literally Nadiktovano Trump-Senior.
The White House clarified that the president had not dictated anything, but simply used his authority, which any father would have done.

Murder at Morse Ford: Activists will lose Lynch's courts on stage to call for justice
The 1948 Ford Mercury drove past spectators in the village of Monroe in the state of Georgia and raced to the small bridge of Morse Ford.
When the car, which had four black passengers and a white driver unloaded to the bridge, a group of white men with guns blocked her way.
The chief-a middle-aged man in a suit in a thin strip-dragged a cigar and looked through the windshield.
The sitting inside trembled with fear.
"We need that nigger, Roger!"-barked man.
"Get him out of the car!"
Piercing shrieks tore the silence when a young black man pulleded from the front seat.
Fortunately, this terrible scene, which played on July 22nd, is just a dramatization.
But when Roger's neck thrown the loop, almost all the spectators really grudge breath.
Since 2005, activists have returned to the Morse Ford Bridge to replay that night, when in 1946 Kukluksklanovcy lynched two black couples-Roger and Dorothy Malcolm and George and Mae Murray Dorsey.
No one was convicted of these murders.
"It is astonishing that in all these years no man has been arrested--although we see them beside us; Although we know who they are, "said Tyrone Brooks, who helped organize the staging.
"It's a stain on our history and it's a stone on our souls."
71-year-old Brooks is a former member of the Georgia Congress who has been fighting for human rights all his life.
For him, the spectacle is a dramatic call to action and an annual reminder to the people of Monroe that the injustice has not been corrected.
"We want an investigation, we want to complete, we want healing, we want reconciliation, but first we have to get justice," he says.
"We cannot go to healing and reconciliation until we have justice."
The coroner covers the body of one of the victims of lynching at Morse Ford on July 27, 1946.
According to an FBI report received by the BBC News, more than 50 people in Monroe and neighboring counties were suspected of participating in lynching.
But nobody was charged.
Although suspects have remained at large for decades, human rights defenders say Thatin the city has always been well aware of the two related motifs of lynch: politics and sex.
In April 1946, the Supreme Court ruling first allowed black citizens to vote in the primaries, which were to be held that summer.
Roughly during the same election, according to the FBI, Black Sharecropper Roger Malcolm was stabbed in a fight by Barnett Hestera, a white landowner-apparently, because of a woman.
Brooks says that, according to rumors, Raznosivshimsja in the city, Hester slept with Malcolm Dorothy's wife, and that the child she was supposed to give birth to was not from her husband.
According to the FBI, on July 25, 1946, Loy Harrison, a major white landowner, paid 600 dollars of bail to get Malcolm out of jail.
He went to prison together with Dorothy and their cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey.
But when they drove from prison and driving to the bridge Morse Ford, the crowd Lynch surrounded the car.
"It turns out that he orchestrated and commanded Harrison's murders," an FBI report concludes.
"It is also clear that there has been collusion between state and city law enforcement agencies, which not only took part in the killings, but destroyed the evidence and concealed the identities of the witnesses."
Brooks calls it shorter.
"It was an attack on the electoral rights," he says.
"They were all killed to send a signal to blacks in the city: if you sign up and vote, you will be the same."
For almost ten years, Cassandra Greene has been running an annual performance that reproduces the lynching at the Morse Ford Bridge.
Its performance is vivid, it captures the viewer and tells the story of the deep racism, which, as many would like to consider, there is no more in America.
It's hard to look at and even harder to turn away, but Greene thinks this is the main thing.
"We don't want to talk about Lynch's ships because they show us our own ugliness," she says.
"But I can't build a relationship with you unless you hear me or hear what I've experienced."
Rehearsals of this year's performance began in June, and on the first day almost 30 actors-a dozen whites, the rest of the black-gathered in the room and listened to a polished over the years review of the play.
Wade Marbo was the director along with Greene.
He played the role of the main member of the clan for several years, but said that the role did not become easier.
"I think I dirty because it's not the person I am," Marbo says.
"But I think it's very important to remember this story because we don't want to go back at that time."
Indoors, actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Cohn, who play Roger Malcolm and Barnett Hestera, repeat their roles.
Puppet begins with the fact that Malcolm, enraged by the fact that Hester sleeps with his wife Dorothy, shouts and pushes him.
I said,, get out of my house!
Yells out the answer.
There is a blow.
And at the same time, all (at least all black actors) are bursting with laughter.
Green laughs louder than anyone.
"What is"-asks Ascona.
He is concerned and confused.
Am I thememory?
"No," Green says through laughter.
I just don't think White then said ' '.
"Yes-yes," one of the black singers laughs.
"You must proznesti a solid ' p '."
And as the energy in the room changes: discomfort is replaced by a sense of camaraderie.
Everyone should do everything right, not only for the sake of the play, but also for the memory of the four people killed.
The scene begins first.
This time, when the word "n" is spoken, it is clear and sharp.
No man laughs.
The performance ends violently and quickly.
Screams, shots, and then silence.
A woman in mourning black clothes stands above the actors ' bodies and performs the sad song of Billy Holiday "Strange Fruit".
Her voice is interrupted by the word.
In a hundred yards from it fifty spectators wipe off eyes tears and sweat.
Among the viewers almost equal number of black and white.
One couple came from Ithaca, NY, to watch the show; Many live very close by.
They spent almost eight hours enduring the heavy stifling of Georgia while Brooks drove them on a pilgrimage to the graves of Malcolm and Dorsey.
Until then, the murders were only history, but now that they are at the same place where people lynched, it seems that their ghosts are hovering in the air.
When the last note of the song fades, Green invites people to come closer and examine the bodies.
Children bend to their heads, touch to the paint depicting blood, and motionless bodies and whisper something to each other.
"They're not really dead," one little boy mutters, as if to remind himself of it.
A few minutes later, Greene thanks the audience, and all of a sudden it ends.
The actors dump the ropes from the neck and wipe the tears.
Bradshaw hugs Marbo, a man in a suit that played the main KUKLUKSKLANOVCA.
Nick Cohn hugs two other actors and suddenly, crying, falls into their arms: the emotional load of the performance finally fell on him.
"It's all right," one of the women whispers.
"We know that you have a good heart.
You had a reason for that. "
Later spectators sit down to supper together with actors.
At one table, a white couple from Atlanta is busy discussing a performance with a black couple that they have just met.
Denise Daplinski A hard time searching for words to describe what she feels after the performance.
"It is hard to listen to these horrible, creepy words, and actions... People who look like you, and who do it because they look like you, "she says.
"After that, I think the lynching are still happening," she adds, "Only now is it called that the police shoots."
In the other corner of the room, the general attention was taken by Tyrone Brooks, who remembers his work as a defender.
He said he had already begun to plan the next year's presentation.
"Staging inspires us because it not only describes the horror of what we have experienced, but also teaches us," he says.
"Because if you don't extract from this lesson, it can happen again.
Those who do not study their history, who do not know their history, are doomed to repeat it. "

New results of tests to assess the age of asylum-seekers in Sweden published
Recent results of tests of asylum-seekers in Sweden, subjected to a new method of medical assessment of age, show that more than 80 per cent of those tested were evaluated as persons over 18 years old, but not all trust the accuracy of these results.
The Swedish National Forensics Agency (Rättsmedicinalverket) began conducting tests earlier this year.
They were designed to make the assessment of age in the asylum process more accurate, after the Swedish Migration Agency (Migrationsverket) criticized for failing to determine the true age of some refugees, Claimed they nesovershennoletnye.
At the moment Migrationsverket sent 6 880 cases for testing, and forensic medicine Agency has now published the results of 2 481 tests for the period between mid-March and July 31, 2017.
Eighty percent (2002) of those tested were estimated to be 18 years of age or older, and for 25 more cases, the forensic medicine agency evaluated that "probably a person 18 years of age or older" is being tested.
In the case of 432 cases, the conclusion was that the person was "probably less than 18".
Tests are conducted only in cases where the age of the person is doubtful.
According to Johan Gjoranssona of the forensic Medicine Agency, the results are consistent with the results of the previous months.
"We do not see much difference with the statistics for the past months, the numbers are quite appropriate," he said to the portal "the Local".
The high proportion of cases in which people have been assessed as having reached the age of 18 does not necessarily indicate that asylum-seekers have lied about their age.
In May, the agency published the results of the 581 test and reported that in 442 cases "The age of the test is probably 18 years or more".
However, having considered 581 published results, the newspaper "Svenska Dagbladet" has found out that in 243 cases the person openly declared that 18 it is executed this year.
The method of conducting medical assessment of age, consisting of making X-ray of wisdom teeth and tomography of knee joints and giving them to the dentists and radiologists for analysis, also caused criticism in some instances.
One of the skeptics is an endocrinologist from the Caroline Institute, Claude Marcus, whose work is to assess the biological maturity of people in order to determine whether they have gone through puberty earlier or later than usual.
"I had reasons to think about it, and I don't think we should use the measurement methods that are used now.
The biological age in this way is determined very inaccurately.
If we cannot define it with certainty, we should not pretend that we can, "he said to the newspaper" Metro ".
However, the Gjoranssen of the Forensic medicine agency spoke in favor of the accuracy of the tests: "In general, it can be said that the risk of mistaken adoption of a child for an adult is small.
With the greatest risk we face when a man is soon 18, in which case he is about 10 percent. "

On July 28, Russian president's spokesman Dmitry Peskov commented on some media reports that Vladimir Putin's pre-election headquarters would be headed by the head of the Russian presidential administration Anton Vaino.
Sands called these assumptions "on anything not based, hypothetical arguments".
"So far, no headquarters, until the establishment of the headquarters away, before the election campaign far,"-said the sands.

"I think it was a very constructive day and that we are moving forward, but Congress supports the recommendations of the Special Commission, according to which it is not the time to restore Russia's rights," Coe said.

Our guiding principle was our desire to separate clean athletes from the tainted system, "he added.

Two years after the peak of the migration crisis in Europe, Italy decided to have a limited military operation in the Mediterranean Sea.
The Comandante Borsini patrol ship entered Libya's territorial waters to stop the influx of illegal migrants together with the country's navy.
The decision to start the operation was made by the Italian Parliament on Wednesday.
Rome has coordinated it with the internationally recognized government of Libya, which, however, does not control much of the territory of the country.
The opposing cabinet and the Tobruk-based Libyan parliament accused Italy of violating Libya's sovereignty.
And the commander of the Libyan National Army Marshal Haftar gave his subordinates an order to counteract the Italian ships.
In Rome, however, they said they do not believe these threats and intend to send another military vessel to Libyan territorial waters.
The situation was discussed last week at the talks between Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni and the head of the European-recognized Libyan cabinet Faizah Saradzha.
The Italian authorities have gone to the establishment of a maritime mission to combat illegal migration after the publication in July of statistics on the number of illegal immigrants recruits to the country from Libya: 95 thousand people since the beginning of the year.
The Government stated that the resources for receiving migrants had been exhausted.

How the financial rules of football will affect the move of Neymar to Paris
The rules aimed at preventing unlimited spending by European football clubs will not prevent the outlawing world record from the transfer of Neymar from Spanish Barcelona to the French "Paris Saint-Germain".
Any consequences may come further along the chain, for "Paris Saint-Germain" by UEFA, the governing body controlling the European football, in whose power to forbid the teams to participate in the prestigious tournament "Champions League".
From the rules of the financial "fair-play", introduced by Uefa in 2011, it follows that "PSG" in the end will have to show that the transfer Neymar was financed without major losses.
Barcelona paid 222 million euros (262 million) only to free the Brazilian from the contract, and Neymar will receive a salary that reaches tens of millions of dollars a year.
Here are some financial aspects of moving Neymar to France.
PSG can certainly fork out to hire Neymar and add it to the galaxy of other stars, considering the funding of the team from the rich energy of the ruling family of Qatar.
Clubs have the right to spend large sums to buy players, but they have to balance them at the expense of legitimate sources of income to reach the threshold of profitability in their football business.
"PPPs" was introduced by Michel Platini after his election as Uefa president in 2007.
A former French football player believed that clubs zalezajushhie huge debts in their quest for success, in essence, cheateded and risked ruin in the event that banks or owners stopped funding.
In 2011, "PPPs" stopped focusing on the debts of clubs and instead switched to tracking their losses.
As a result of this change, the business model originally used by Roman Abramovich in Chelsea in 2003-to buy a club with good potential and then seriously invested in order to improve the team and create a world brand-has become a administratively plan.
During this trjohgodovogoing period of the year 2018, clubs can incur losses of 30 million euros.
And, despite the fact that platinum disgraced from the presidential post in 2015, his successor to Uefa Alexander Cheferin is still determined to restrain excessive spending.
"Of course," PPPs "is alive, and we, moving forward, will tighten the rules," said the Associated Press Andrea Traverse, who controls "PPPs" in Uefa last week.
Although PSG will pay for the redemption of the Neymar contract at a time, he can distribute this amount over the entire term of his contract for reporting.
Neymar signed a five-year contract, so the transfer value can be shown in annual reporting as a cost of 44.4 million euros over the next five years.
During the first wave of sanctions "PPPs" in 2014 to "PSG", as well as to Abu-Dhabi "Manchester City" were applied severe sanctions.
PSG had a fine of 60 million euros (at that rate of 82 million dollars), which was later reduced to 20 million euros, and was ordered to limit the composition of its team in the "Champions League" during the season 2014-1015 years 21 player instead of the usual 25.
Uefa keeps track of clubs that can try to outsmart its financial inspections, inflating its income at the expense of companies associated with club owners.
Although the Qatari company could have sponsored PSG, but if the amount of funding was considered to exceed the standard market prices, UEFA would not allow it to be considered a legitimate income.
This is what happened in 2014, when Uefa decided that the amount of funding for PSG by the Tourism Authority of Qatar was bloated.
It was reported that part of the earnings of Neymar in PSG could be in the form of payments from the organizing committee of the world Championship 2022 in Qatar.
But PSG and Qatar-2022 deny that Neymar will become the Ambassador of the world Championship, and such maneuver could easily be discovered by the UEFA inspectors.
The past sanctions imposed on PSG mean that UEFA will even more closely monitor any attempts to circumvent the rules.
As the people familiar with the situation reported on Thursday, Uefa did not have preliminary discussions with PSG about the transfer of Neymar.
They communicated with the Associated Press Agency on condition of anonymity, as they are not authorized to discuss the position of PSG.
According to the latest published report, in 2015-1016, PSG received more than 10 million euros of profit at a turnover of 542.4 million euros.
Reporting for the last fiscal year has not yet been published.
PSG expects that the arrival of Neymar will be a fertile ground for sponsorship deals, sales of paraphernalia and T-shirts with the team's logo.
The club suggests that the turnover will increase by at least 30 percent as a result of hiring a new player.
Undoubtedly angry that one of the best players is leaving, the Spanish league tried to prevent the transfer of Neymar, saying that "PSG" will break the financial "fair-play".
"This is an obvious case of" financial doping ", with the club and the state," said the Spanish newspaper "AS" President of La Liga Javier Tebas, bearing in mind that the ultimate owner of PSG is Qatar.
Arsenal coach Arsene Wenger, whose club belongs to the American sports tycoon, shares the doubts of La Liga about the state's funding of the club.
"It's all the consequences of equity participation, and it has completely changed the landscape of football over the last fifteen years," Wenger said Thursday.
"When the club belongs to the country, everything is possible.
It becomes very difficult to comply with the financial fair-play, because the country can have many ways and many reasons to be represented by such a serious player.
The president will determine the order and place of the oath
Where and how the new Russian citizens will be swearing allegiance to the Russian Federation, will determine the President-such amendments to the second reading in the relevant law was developed by the State Duma Committee on Legislation and state.
A week ago the deputies planned to define the order of swearing in the law directly.
From the solemn oath will be released children under 18 years of age, as well as incapacitated, follows from the amended text of amendments to the Bill "on citizenship of the Russian Federation" (available "Izvestia"), which the Committee on July 11 will consider before the second reading on its meeting.
The idea of imposing an oath of allegiance to the Russian Federation instead of the formal signing of the documents was supported by President Vladimir Putin on June 6 during a meeting with the speaker of the State Duma Vyacheslav Volodin.
The deputies have made this idea in the form of an amendment to the second reading of the bill, which provides for the abolition of the decision on the extradition of nationality to those who were subsequently convicted of a number of crimes of a terrorist or extremist nature: for example, for public Calls for terrorism or its public justification in the media or on the Internet (H. 2 art. 205.2 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation), as well as for hijacking a plane, train or water transport, but only if the act is connected with terrorism (Part 4 art. 211 of the Russian Criminal Code).
According to the bill, his logic was as follows: When issuing documents for citizenship, a person subscribes under the promise to abide by Russian legislation-embarking on the path of extremism, he violates this promise.
The bill in April brought to the Duma leaders of Duma fractions Vladimir Vasilyev ("United Russia"), Gennady Zyuganov (Communist), Vladimir Zhirinovsky (LDPR), Sergey Mironov ("Fair Russia") and the Speaker of the DG Vyacheslav Volodin.
On May 19 deputies adopted it in the first reading.
Last week, the Committee on State and legislation approved the text of the bill for second reading, but now it has been reworked again.
Now it says that the order of swearing will be set by the President of the Russian Federation.
Previously, parliamentarians were going to describe the procedure directly in the law "on citizenship of the Russian Federation", stating that the ceremony should take place in a solemn atmosphere before the state emblem and the flag of Russia in the presence of a representative of the Interior Ministry.
However, it was not clear from the text of the bill where such an event should take place-the list of places where the emblem of the Russian Federation may be placed is regulated by the relevant federal constitutional law.
These include courts, cabinets of heads of bodies of sings entities, municipalities, judges, prosecutors, heads of federal executive authorities, etc.
Most likely, it could be registry.
To pronounce solemn oath wishing to receive citizenship of the Russian Federation will be after officials have checked their documents.
But the person will receive the Russian passport only after the oath, follows from the modified text.
A week ago, the draft stated that the oath should precede the signing of the decree.
The updated text says that the swearing of Russia will be 18 years old, not 14.
There is a rule that the oath will be exempted from incapacitated or incapacitated, as well as those who cannot pronounce, read or personally sign the text of the oath.
In addition, the President of the Russian Federation has the right to exempt from this procedure and "other persons",
Also, the updated Bill prescribes a special procedure for admission to Russian citizens of Ukrainian residents, who are considered native Russian speakers.
They will have to officially renounce Ukrainian citizenship by providing a corresponding application to the authorized body of Ukraine.
A notarized copy of the application will need to be handed over to Russian officials.
The waiver of "alien" nationality, as it is now, will not be required if it is provided for by an international treaty or if it is not possible "for reasons beyond the person's power".
The corresponding amendment to the law was proposed by a group of deputies, including the first vice-speaker of the DG Ivan Melnikov (Communist), Natalia Bowing, Pavel Krasheninnikov and Ira Farrahov (All-"United Russia").
I think many of you know that getting a certificate from Ukraine is unrealistic, just impossible.
Accordingly, a lot of people are waiting for a solution to their fate about the citizenship of the Russian Federation,-explained the day before the head of the Duma Committee on state and Legislation Pavel Krasheninnikov (EP).
In addition, the text clarified that restrictions on the employment of certain positions for foreigners would not be extended to those who refused "other" citizenship in writing and passed the previous passport to the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia, but "on the independent of it Reasons, "he was not ceased to be considered a citizen of another country.
Now foreigners are forbidden to hold positions in the municipal service, to be accepted for work on objects and in the organizations which activity is connected with maintenance of security of Russia.
Also a person with dual citizenship or a residence permit of another country can not become a deputy of the State Duma or a member of the Federation Council.
It is planned that the law should enter into force on September 1, 2017, by that time the necessary bylaws should be ready.
Nostalgia becomes niche in "Hot American Summer" and "Comrade Detective"
The current iteration of nostalgically history reminds of the glorious days of the characters in the 80s; About the grunge era in the 90s (around the time when outstanding Masters David Wayne and Michael Shovalter made comedy sketches "state" for MTV); And about myself-that is about 2001, before her stars like Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd moved to more serious things.
As a fact of culture, it is simultaneously the exaltation and embodiment of our epoch with its constant reminders from Facebook.
But as a franchise it seems anachronistic.
"The first day of the camp" was surprisingly good, and not only because of Absurdistskogo humor (including the original story of a talking Bank of vegetables, which was voiced by H. John Benjamin).
The result doubles the main joke: Middle-aged actors play sexually preoccupied children who have only just reached adulthood; Thanks to this inability to return to becomes a part of the joke.
"Ten years later," where adults have already played adults, has less profound emotional roots, and his parody is more unsystematic and includes riffs from stalker movies of the 90s like "Hands Kachajushhejing the Cradle."
In one episode, the character gets Apple Powerbook, wheeled roller skates and "a bunch of other things from 1991."
Many story moves are the same.
Good-natured Coop (Showalter), now a writer, still has not achieved reciprocity from Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) still has not broke up with virginity.
And there's still a crazy and sneaky conspiracy that involves Ronald Reagan (also Showalter), who is now being instigated by George W. Bush (a proven parody by Michael Ian Blake).
As always, the best part of the franchise is to retreat from it.
It is especially amusing to see an eternally young Radda who humming a song of Matt Dillon from "Loners", whose character, the former big man Andy looks now geezer.
To bring this franchise success could have occasional madness in the spirit of the type of recursive series "Seven Up" until it comes to what, in my opinion, would be its logical conclusion: "Hot American Summer: Twenty years later", where in the last scene the whole The company would go to the cinema for the premiere of the film "Hot American Summer".
"Comrade Detective" at Amazon turns to another type of nostalgia: Memories of the Cold War of the "Americans", "explosive blondes" or even "glitter" with its images of the struggle of the East and the west.
This comedy, created by Brian Gejtvudom and Alessandro Tanaka with the director Reese Thomas portrays a television film: the Romanian police drama of the 1980s about two policemen in Bucharest fighting for the truth, atheism and the Marxist-Lenin way.
The main roles-broker the life of Gregor and idealist Josef-perform Florin Persik Jr. and Corneliu Street, and voiced their dialogues in English Channing Tatum (he is the executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Leviticus.
It's a brilliant idea.
But just an idea.
There are some visual jokes (the police spend time watching the chess match, as the Americans could watch football).
The team of famous voices behind the scenes-among them Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloe Sevigny-makes it interesting to play "Guess The Voice".
But "Comrade Detective" is so clinging to the credibility of clumsy propaganda drama-there is even a killer in the mask of Ronald Reagan-which often looks like it.
Six long episodes are tightened, and funny happens not very often.
If it were to be made shorter, "Comrade Detective" could better cope with his satire in the Spirit of agitprop; For example, every time Gregor and Josef come to the American Embassy, two fat people are sitting in the lobby, absorbing a bunch of hamburgers.
To an imaginary Communist spectator this image says that Western culture is able to make obzhiralovku from anything.
The fictional Romanian authors of the film are not so wrong: we do so even with our own recent history, and with them too.
The prize fund of the match for the Super Cup of Russia between Spartak and Lokomotiv will be about 30 million rubles.

State Department commented on Medvedev's remarks on Russia-USA relations
The US and Russia must be able to work with each other.
This statement was made by the official representative of the department Heather in response to the words of Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev on the relations between the two States.

According to him, the peninsula remained without electricity because of a traffic accident in the territory of Krasnodar region.
The truck hit the transmission line, as a result there was a shutdown of Kuban and related Crimean networks.

Bank of England will retain interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to later announce that interest rates will not change after weak economic growth and oslabevajushhaja inflation have forced subside rumors of a possible increase.
The Bank of England warned that economic growth would remain unhurried, and left interest rates unchanged amid growing pressure on family incomes.
Specialists of the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted with the result of 6 versus 2 for saving rates at the level of 0.25%, and this month fewer members of the Committee expressed their interest to increase the rate because the weak economic growth weakened support for promotion.
In its quarterly inflation Report, the bank limited its forecasts for an increase of 1.7% in 2017 and 1.6% in 2018, and warned that the pressure on family income would continue, while inflation was still expected to rise to about 3% in the fall.
However, the bank warned that the increase in rates over the next few years would be necessary to control the Brekzitom inflation, and stated that the borrowing costs would probably have to rise more than expected in the financial markets.
Members of the Committee also voted to abandon part of a huge set of measures to develop the economy launched a year ago as a result of Brekzita.
Starting next February, the bank will close the urgent financing plan, by which it provides low-cost loans to banks, although he reported that he will now have to provide another 15 billion pounds in this plan, up to 115 billion pounds.
The bank said in the protocol of decision on rates: "According to the main forecasts of MPC, the growth of gross domestic product (GDP) in the near future remains slow, while the pressure on real income of families continues to influence consumption".
On the issue of bets, he reiterated that in order to stop inflation, it would require "some tightening of financial policy", "somewhat more" than the markets expect.
At the moment, the markets predict the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020.
But the bank stressed that all the increases will be "gradual" and "limited".
The bank's forecasts for the increase in this and next year are lower than the forecasts made in May, which were equal to 1.9% and 1.7%.
The bank left its forecast for 1.8% in 2018.
After these news, Sterling fell against the dollar and the euro.
The pound fell by 0.5% to 1.31 US dollar and by 0.4% to 1.11 euros.
The decision not to change the bid was taken after the recent disappointing growth rates weakened the increased expectations of the increase; GDP then grew by 0.3% in the second quarter versus 0.2% in the previous three months.
According to the bank's representative, the growth seems to remain at the level of 0.3% in the third quarter, although it will start to increase slightly at the end of the year.
The bank's latest report on inflation gave little reason for the joy of households, which hit high inflation and a slight increase in wages: According to the bank, the pressure is skyrocketing before the decline.
The bank added that the financial policy "can not prevent" Udao on earnings in the next few years, but expects that the salaries "significantly" will recover to the end of his three forecast.
The economy is also set to grow as a result of the growing demand for British products due to the low rate of the pound, which compensates for a portion of the lower consumption costs.
The decision was made one year after the last August the rates were reduced to 0.25% after the shocking results of the referendum on the issue of withdrawal from the European Union, which led to the fall of the pound.
The bank estimates that it will likely take four years to fully influence prices and the economy.
Before the bank delivered its last decision on rates, loudered the noise around the alleged rise in rates, as inflation was increasingly pushing for and so pressured households: the three experts in the Committee asked to increase Rates up to 0.5% in July.
Last month, inflation fell to 2.6% from 2.9% in July, although the bank reports that this decline was expected and is again offset in the coming months.
According to the bank, the higher rate compared to the planned 2% is completely a consequence of the low rate of the pound.
Andrew Montlejk, director of mortgage brokers Koreko, said: "Given the recent fall in swap rates, the mortgage market is likely to become even more competitive again, as lenders demand business opportunities and rely on good End of the year.
The market looks particularly favourable for those who are approaching the end of their existing contracts, as refinancing of loans, often with the possibility of a lack of commission, as well as a low rate, becomes more popular than ever. "
The state health service will prescribe a controversial drug from HIV 10000 people
Beginning in September, patients will have access to the "revolutionary" drug for HIV prevention after the High Court battle on the issue of financing the drug from the Public Health service.
The National Health Service of England has announced that the pre-exposure prevention of HIV (Prep), a pill before sex, which has been proven to reduce the risk of infection in people at risk by an average of 86 percent, now will be provided by the health service during the initial three trial period of approximately 10000 persons.
She agreed to fund the test after the Court of Appeal upheld last year a ruling by the High Court, which stated that the National Health Service had the opportunity to pay for Prep despite her statements, That it should be financed by local authorities.
This move, announced on Thursday, was called the "major innovation" by the president of the National Health Service of England, Simon Stevens, and the National AIDS Control Office (NAT) called it a "turning point" .
Before the full launch of the program throughout England by April 2018, venereal dispensaries in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to start registering people, and more dispensaries are joining the program in October.
Pre-exposure Prevention (prep) is a course of HIV drugs that are taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
Studies have shown that prep significantly reduces the risk of HIV infection among people at risk.
When taking prep before sex in the human body, a sufficient number of certain drugs to prevent HIV infection.
Such drugs can be taken daily or not later than two hours before sex.
The patients eligible for the drug include homosexual and bisexual men, transgender people and those whose partners are HIV-positive and do not receive successful treatment.
Dispensaries will select suitable participants agreed to participate in the study, including men, women, transgender people and individuals whose partners do not know whether their HIV status is constrained by antiretroviral therapy.
People living and assigned to a general practitioner in England will also be able to apply for potential participation in the nearest Venereological dispensary attending the program.
The program will cost 10 million pounds, and the National Health Service of England this week after the international tender for procurement has signed a drug supply agreement.
The study is constructed in such a way as to evaluate all the possibilities of prep by collecting clinical data on who is the target audience of the drug, its digestibility and application on a large scale.
"This crucial innovation should complement and strengthen the broader and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV.
This is another milestone in more than three decades of success in the fight against one of the biggest health threats facing humanity.
Deborah Gold, President of NAT (National AIDS Control Office), said: "This is a turning point in the fight against HIV.
Prep, if it is wise to target people in need of help and at risk, gives an opportunity to change the situation with the HIV epidemic in England.
Since September, people at risk from HIV, through this study conducted in England through the National Health Service, will have access to new opportunities, a tool that can be used by people Control yourself without discussing it with a partner, which will lead to the improvement of many-many lives.
We warmly welcome this news. "
Ian Greene, president of the Terrence Higgins Foundation, said: "The first thing to do is to ensure that the test is quickly deployed across the country and that none of the HIV risk groups are forgotten.
Now that we are provided with an experimental drug prep, we are going to protect more than 10000 people in the HIV risk zone. "
The shadow Minister of public Health, Sharon Hodgson, said, "We very much welcome the beginning of the prep test, which is very belated because of months of delay and procrastination on the part of the government."
The evidence shows how revolutionary this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and the cessation of transmission of this fatal infection.
This test is a step closer to a full understanding of the benefits of prep.
It is now important that the test be expandeded throughout the country as soon as possible to protect people at risk from HIV and move us further towards ending the spread of HIV in society.

On July 11 deputies of the State Council of Tatarstan appealed to the President of Russia with a request to prolong the agreement and keep the title of the head of the region.
Now Tatarstan is the only subject of the federation, which has a contract with Russia.
The head of the region is the only one whose position is called "President".
Difficulties in obtaining international driving license in Russia
The traffic police units are experiencing a shortage of international driving permits (IDPs).
To get such rights, it is necessary to wait for a few weeks to turn, which became a real problem for holiday, wishing to leave for vacation abroad on his car or rent it there.
It should be noted that the situation with international driving certificates remains controversial.
The IDP was introduced in order to make it easier for the foreign police to understand what is written in the National certificate, as the information in it is explained in five languages.
The requirements for international rights are enshrined in the 1968 Vienna Convention on Road Traffic, but in countries that have ratified the Vienna Convention, Russian rights are recognized as well.
However, in fact, it all depends on the specific police or rental office: Some require IDPs, and someone has enough national rights.
To be safe, drivers of international rights still receive, but it is necessary to take into account that in the countries which have not ratified the Convention (for example, the USA, Spain, Mexico, Indonesia) The authorities have the right not to recognize neither national rights, nor IDPs.
Now there is a problem with forms in almost all departments of the traffic police, reports "Kommersant", having conducted research in a number of regions.
So, in Moscow in units UGIBDD tickets simply are not issued, forms are not enough already four months.
You can make an appointment on the site Rajapipala, but there is a queue stretched until mid-August.
In Krasnoyarsk, IDPs can not get "for technical reasons", without going into details, in the Samara region honestly say that there are no forms, a similar situation is in other cities.
Many Muscovites have already faced the problem, in social networks more and more such messages appear:
Irina Burmistrova: "Guess why in Moscow it is impossible to get international rights?"
That's right, because all of the traffic police departments ran out of blanks.
Elena Podkolzina: "The question to the knowledgeable people!"
We need to get international rights very urgently.
In Moscow all the time is clogged far ahead, on the spot coupons do not give out (the button is, but the coupon can not give).
It seems that the portal Rajapipala shows that in St. Petersburg time free to FIG.
Has anyone tried to get in another city?
Work?
As the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation has explained, the requirements to the forms of international driving permits have been changed, so new forms are being delivered to the traffic unit.
With this and may be associated deficit, however, it is not clear what changes are in question, previously it was not reported.
Forms buys the center of special purpose in the field of road traffic safety (CTS traffic) of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation and then supplies them to the traffic police units.
In recent years, all contracts were concluded with JSC "Goznak": In 2014-2015 years, almost 200 thousand were manufactured. The IDP forms, in 2016 it was purchased 15 thous. Forms, in 2017-90 thousand, but the last contract was concluded on July, 18th with LLC "The first printing court" on manufacture of 70 thousand. Forms.
There is a version that CTS just did not have time to hold a tender, because of what the deficit arose.
However, there are other versions of the shortage of forms: Because of the crisis, many people began to travel independently to Europe, and cheaper Asian countries-China, Thailand and so on.
What rights are accepted there, to the end is not clear, therefore people and reinsured, therefore also there was a hype demand for international "crusts".
It has recently become known that professional drivers will have to take an exam to confirm their qualifications.
This proposal was made by Ministry.
The International Driving Licence (IDP) of the new model is valid from May 31, 2011.
The Minister of Justice of Ukraine refused to believe in the construction of the Crimean bridge
Minister of Justice of Ukraine Pavel Petrenko said that he does not believe in the ability of Russia to build a bridge to the Crimea.
He said this on Friday, August 4, in an interview with the browser portal.
No self-respecting international company will even screw or gaechku there, because it risks losing its business on the territory of the EU, USA, Japan-in the countries that have joined the sanctions against Russia on the Crimea.
"That is, in my deep conviction, there are no prospects for this project," Petrenko said.
He added that he considers Russia incapable of implementing a large infrastructure project on its own.
Russia can not build normal and less scale objects.
I know that after the Olympic Games in Sochi the whole stadiums have already begun to collapse.
"Therefore, I think the best tool in this situation is sanctions against companies that were so short-sighted to join this project,"-said the official.
On July 31 The builders completed the construction of the arch of the Crimean bridge car arch.
On Kerch Bank completed enlarger Assembly of the road Arch of the Crimean Bridge: its arch is closed at an altitude of 45 meters from the base of construction.
"At the same time bridge prepared for installation on the fairway supports railway arch,"-said in the information center of the project.
In April, the head of the ministry Maxim Sokolov informed Russian President Vladimir Putin that the construction of the object is ahead of schedule.
The Crimean Bridge will connect the Crimean Peninsula and Krasnodar territory.
In Spain, the official was fired, who did not go to work for 10 years
What kind of angelic patience (or absolute indifference to public service) should have had the head of the Spanish official Carles Recio?
Permanent truancy lasted for 10 long years.
However, Mr. Recio was fired.
But not your immediate boss.
That only in the world of bureaucrats does not happen.
Inhabitants seems to have been accustomed to all the pranks of the "servants of the People".
And, nevertheless, officials all the time manages to surprise those whose taxes they live well.
This time "sensation" came from Spain.
There the employee of the archive Valencia Carles Recio managed for ten years not to go to work.
At the same time he received regular salaries.
And all solid-50 thousand euros per year.
And the "wonderful times" of Mr. Recio are over.
He was fired by a decision of the Legislative Assembly of Valencia.
The investigation revealed that a malicious slacker every working morning came to the office at 07:00 to mark the electronic system.
And then he went home.
Once again he appeared in the workplace at 16:00 to again note in the system that he had gone.
Ten years.
It also became known that all the free time slacker devoted to drawing comics at home.
Now the deputies of the Legislative Assembly of Valencia think how to punish and direct the chief of Mr. Recio, who could not but know how to "actively work" in his work place his subordinate.
Judges are invited to protect from the presidents
The Presidential Council for Human Rights (HRC), on behalf of Vladimir Putin, has developed proposals to strengthen the independence of the judicial branch of government.
The HRC proposes to limit the powers of the court presidents and to impose their election.
For courts of appeal and cassation instance, the HRC wants to introduce special constituencies that will not be tied to the administrative-territorial division in the Russian Federation.
The Supreme Court should also submit its proposals within the framework of the presidential order.
The HRC has finalized proposals that will strengthen the independence of Russian justice.
This work was conducted by the HRC on behalf of Vladimir Putin on January 3, 2017, which the President gave after meeting with council members.
At the meeting with the Council members on December 8, 2016 were discussed including individual cases of judicial arbitrariness, as well as problems of public control in places of detention of citizens (see "Kommersant" on December 9).
The work of the HRC resulted in 25 proposals, which relate to the issues of ensuring the independence of judges and the identification of judicial errors, as well as the financing of courts and legal education.
One of the ideas Kremlin human rights defenders is to limit the powers of the court presidents to increase the independence of the remaining judges.
If the candidate for the position of the judge successfully passed the competition and received the support of the judicial community, the President of the Court, in the opinion of the HRC, should submit it to the appointment without the right to refuse, as the law now allows.
It is also proposed that the President be deprived of the right to distribute cases between judges.
To do it, allow experts, can specially written computer program.
Also, the HRC believes that the Chairman is not entitled to "predetermine the results of the qualification evaluation of the judge, to initiate his involvement in disciplinary responsibility, to make decisions on the establishment of additional material payments."
At the same time, the Presidential Council considers it necessary to move to the "election of the Presidents of the courts by the judges themselves" and "to confer powers on them for a relatively short period with mandatory rotation".
Now all the presidents of the courts (from the Republican to the district) are appointed for six years by the President on the proposal of the Chairman of the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation.
In order to shield judges from the pressures of regional administrations, the HRC proposes a new appeal and appeal in the courts of general jurisdiction.
Now their structure is tied to the administrative-territorial division in the Russian Federation.
The HRC says that "it is necessary to ensure the organization of separate courts of appeal and cassation instance not at the level of regional judicial bodies in the subjects of the Russian Federation, but in the judicial districts".
Experts take the practice of arbitration courts as a basis.
They have "judicial districts", which do not coincide with the administrative division in the Russian Federation, but guarantee at the expense of this greater independence from regional officials, who are hampered by the use of "telephone law".
Magistrates of the HRC proposes to strengthen the people's jury to consider some "categories of civil and administrative cases" with their participation.
For example, deprivation of parental rights, reinstatement at work, protection of honor and dignity, denial of driving licences, etc.
"These are only our proposals," said the member of the HRC, the judge of the Constitutional Court in resignation Tamara Morshhakova.
She also recalled that the President's assignment concerned not only the HRC but also the Supreme Court (SC), which had not yet disclosed its proposals.
The time to carry out the task of the Sun (among the co-prosecutors and the Commissioner for Human Rights in the Russian Federation) is still there.
To report to Vladimir Putin on how effectively the independence of justice is ensured in Russia, the chairman of the Sun Vyacheslav Lebedev should be by September 1.
To live a high life: mezzanine and cunning design techniques have turned this small apartment in Earl Court in a spacious dwelling
Joan Li, a former banker enthusiast real estate repairs, moved from a spacious house in Knightsbridge to an apartment in Earl Court in 2014.
The apartment is on the first floor of a cute model house in the style of Queen Anne, and in favor of the new design says that Joan did not pack her clothes and moved again.
"I used to live with my ex in Knightsbridge on a much larger area," Joan says.
"I was looking for something comparable for my money.
I was shown this apartment in Earl Court, and there were the same high ceilings.
I fell in love with her and offered a price the same day. "
From the moment of the first viewing the apartment in the area of 1000 square feet has transferred the full reconstruction.
It was originally a one bedroom apartment with a complex layout-to get into the bedroom, you had to go through the kitchen-and Joanna wanted to add space to store things and mezzanine to make the most of the generous height of the ceilings.
"I wanted high ceilings, big windows, lots of light.
These were my demands, "she says.
To this end, she hired Jerfana Azada from the Shed-style studio, the "Duck &" in Notting Hill, to use the ceilings of 12.5 feet tall and create a dwelling that would not only be a successful project, but would suited Joan for life.
The ceiling was not high enough to arrange two rooms one above the other, so the architectural task was to create a mezzanine where one could stand in full stature.
Jerfanu had to think creatively to cope with the brief.
"Working with steel structures is very complicated," he explains.
"We had to arrange the rooms so that they were one above the other, and did not have to bend.
It was necessary not simply to build a simple platform, and so to bend designs that they were at the correct height and allowed to use premises from above and from below».
This solution allowed Jerfanu to arrange two full-size rooms one above the other in the allotted space-and many more interesting.
With mezzanine through a vintage copper light window from "Retrouvius" opens a view of the chic living room downstairs.
Mirrored furniture with golden finish, silver accents and vintage lighting fixtures from Serge Muja set the style of the project.
The use of mirrors plays a role in the addition of entertainment, space and light.
A short corridor juniper mirrors to make it seem longer.
In the kitchen, the Mirror protection panel seems to be a window into another room.
At the entrance the mirror cabinets serve to store all the utensils Joan.
To create a feeling of more luxurious space, the beauty of the living room can fence the kitchen when not in use.
There is nothing new in the folding kitchens.
The uniqueness of this kitchen is that it sliding up the door like in a garage.
"Engineering Art was involved here",-rasskazyvet jerfan about reinforced steel wood-fibre panel door.
"It's equipped with a counterweight, so when you push the door upwards, it glides very easily."
Thanks to the reasonable use of space and storage, Joan gained an additional 16 square meters, an extra bedroom and improved layout.
"After all, the floor area is exactly what you're going to sell, that is, what your property is valued at," says Jerfan.
"Roughly speaking, the real estate agent will enter and calculate based on the floor area."
Here they were able to increase the floor area using quality materials that give the space a shade of luxury.
"Materials are what we touch, so they help create an emotional connection with the home," Jerfan said.
"No one falls in love with the wiring in the walls.
It is important, but it does not hurt the strings of our hearts. "
This serves as a testament to the fact that due to the good design and the enlarged footage the apartment can become something amazing from something usual.
In fact, like Joan, you can decide to stay.

MFA angered blocking of UN Security Council's statements on attacks on Russian embassy
The Russian Foreign Office is indignant at the actions of certain Western diplomatic representatives, who block the statements of the UN Security Council in the press, condemning the terrorist attacks of the Russian embassy in Syria.
This is reported by the Russian MFA.
The Office reminded that the territory of the Russian Embassy in Damascus on August 2 was the third time in a month of mortar shelling by the terrorist groups "Hejat Tahrir al-Sham" (formerly "Jabhat An-Nusra", banned in the Russian Federation) and "Fajlak ar-Rahman".
Taking into account that the international community is unanimous in the qualification of "Nusra" as a terrorist organization, and the UN Security Council resolutions call for counteracting this structure, the Russian MFA noted that "it would seem, it goes without saying that The terrorist attacks of "Nusra" must face universal unequivocal and decisive condemnation, and there should be no ambiguity in the assessments of raids against diplomatic missions. "
However, as stressed in the dipvedomstve, "for the third time in a month the diplomatic representatives of the United States, Great Britain, France and Ukraine in the UN Security Council, alternately, varying the tonality of objections, hiding behind arguments about the alleged absence Necessary information, blocked the proposal of the Russian Federation to adopt a standard brief draft of the Security Council statement to the press condemning terrorist attacks on the Russian diplomatic mission in the Syrian capital. "
The reluctance to show diplomatic solidarity with us may be left to the conscience of these delegations.
"The most outrageous thing is that the inability of the Security Council to condemn the acts of terrorists encourages them to new provocations and terrorist attacks, gives them a sense of impunity,"-said the MFA and added that "do not want these barbarians to create The conviction that someone in the Security Council is with them at the same. "

Brothers fight for Real estate empire worth over 500 million dollars
Two brothers are fighting for one of the largest in the state of Victoria Empires in the real estate trade worth more than 500 million dollars-forty years after their Italian ancestors founded the dynasty.
Former director of the Carlton Football Club and builder Colin de Ljutis lives in the palace of Turak through three doors from his younger brother Paul, who filed against him in the Supreme Court claim for the division of possessions and assets.
Paul wants to get out of the family business since 2014, but the Supreme Court still has a fierce dispute about divorce.
Together with his mother, Anna's brothers own 87 objects worth more than billion dollars bought since their family bought a shop on Smith Street in Collingwood in 1973.
There, the family founded the firm "Westco Jeans", which grew into a network of 160 outlets.
It was sold in 1999 for 85 million dollars.
The money was invested in real estate, and the list of the property of the family de Ljutis includes today office buildings, building plots in Brunswick and Sorrento, apartments on the Gold Coast and in Mount Buller and shopping malls in the suburbs.
In agreement with the late father Colin-whom Paul describes as "the main driving force and dominant personality" of the Family de Ljutis-owns approximately two thirds of the company's assets, and the floor-about one third.
According to the court, this means that Colin's property is 316 million and Paul is 176 million.
Division of property and money has become a stumbling block for the floor.
"The section proposed by Colin gives him, in my opinion, the best part of the property," he wrote in his first statement in 2015.
Last Friday, after several failed reconciliation attempts, the first Supreme Court hearing was held.
The brothers now argue about who will control the existing business-from which, according to Paul, Colin expelled him.
Colin argues that this is not the case, but accuses Paul of incompetently managing certain objects.
In the testimony given by Colin at the beginning of the process, he says he hopes to resolve the dispute.
"My Italian Roots make me consider the family to be the highest priority," he wrote.
Litigation costs grow as a snowball: Hundreds of pages of testimony, e-mails and reports of companies such as Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer are attached to the case; Both sides attracted the most famous lawyers, including the Royal attorney Allan Myers, and the best strjapchih.
Mrs. De Ljutis and her late husband Luigi were immigrants from Italy; Since the late 1950s, they have managed dairy bars and delis, and in the early 1970s bought a store in Brunswick.
Under financial guarantees they bought a store in Collingwood, in which Colin opened the first Family jeans store.
Colin says he launched Westco when he was "in the last grades of school, and Paul was then a boy (about 10 years old)."
Anna de Ljutis says that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to transfer their possession to their sons without conflict.
"Luigi often told me that he didn't want the brothers to be in court," she wrote.
The other two brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Ljutis group of companies; Colin says Mark got 10 million when he left the business, and Luke's 26 million.
According to Paul, both Luke and Mark were "unhappy with the financial conditions of their office."
Colin was not a public figure, though he was a former member of the board of Directors of the AFL Club and, according to a biography published in 2015 by Eddie McGuire, the best friend of the Telestar.
"Fairfax Media" on Friday contacted Colin and Paul and with their lawyers.
The only answer was Colin, a text message saying that since the case had not yet been dealt with in court, "I really have nothing to say."
"I am very, very sorry that my brother Paul decided to sue me and wag the name of our family in court," he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote in evidence that he was trying to satisfy his brother's demands.
"Our father would not like to see Paul arguing in court," he said, adding that "he still hopes for a resolution of the conflict."
On Friday, this hope seems to have dissipated.
"The decision on our case will soon be rendered by the court,"-Colin wrote.
The new head of Trump's staff plans to limit the flow of information to the President.
Others tried to do it and were defeated.
Maybe John F. Kelly will really succeed.
In that case it will be the first.
"Politician" informs that the new head of the White House Office plans to limit the flow of information to President Trump, including news reports from the media, hoping to keep the boss in a more relaxed state.
That's what reporter Josh Dozy reports.
"At the meeting, which was held by the new head of the White House John F. Kelly with the management of the apparatus on his first day, he identified the main problem in the White House under President Donald Trump, which he hopes to solve: bad channels of admission Information to the president. "
Kelly told the staff that the information should go through it – in paper form or through briefings – because the President would be better able to make decisions if he would get the right information.
Kelly's diagnosis is perfectly correct, but others have already failed in trying to subdue Trump by tracking the information he received.
President Trump's relationship with television has developed several decades ago-and now that he is in the White House, his habit of watching TV is still strong.
"When Trump, as a candidate, was indignant at the unfair coverage of the campaign, it was useful to show him that he had received fair coverage in publications that could be persuaded," said in February, "politician" Sam Nanberg, a former Adviser to the electoral staff.
Tara Palmeri wrote then in "the politician" that "according to six former members of the electoral staff, in order to keep the Trump's habit of tweeting, it was necessary to ensure that the information received in person was a constant stream of praise."
Ok.
But the idea that Trump's habit of tweeting has ever been "under control" is just ridiculous.
Maybe these members of the electoral staff know something that we don't know--for example, if it weren't for them, Trump's tweets would be even more provocative.
We may never know about the tweets that Trump hasn't published.
If his staff saved him from troubles at least a few times, their efforts were not in vain.
But nobody ever managed to keep Trump from pouring oil into the fire.
Part of the problem is that in the White House, divided into rival factions, people are constantly trying to promote their agenda by giving Trump material-reliable or not-which confirms their views.
"Politician"-just to this story-wrote in May about the tendency of advisers to constantly slip the president doubtful information.
Here is one example, described by reporter Shane Goldmaherom:
"Current and former Trump officers say that Trump can react very abruptly to negative reports in the press, especially those containing dangerous information leaks, and will not calm down until he finds who stood behind them.
So happened at the end of February, when someone gave the president a printout of the article from GotNews.com, the site of the Internet provocateur Charles C. Johnson, in which the deputy head of the apparatus Kathy Welsh was accused of being "behind a number of leaks" in the White House.
It doesn't matter that Johnson is forever banned from Twitter for aggressive behavior, that he has not presented specific facts or that in the past he has run false accusations and then refused them.
Trump read the article and began to question the staff about Welsh. "
Goldmaher adds that the then head of the reins Pribus and secretary of the apparatus Rob Porter "tried to build a system to control the flow of papers that Trump receives and document them."
How did it work?
Three months later, Kelly is trying to do the same thing.
Maybe he will be a more efficient manager than Pribus, but Trump still has impulsive nature, and his assistants are still fighting each other for influence.
These constant factors make Kelly's task very difficult.
Tyumen Prosecutor's office fights HIV-dissident
The prosecutor's Office challenged the decision of Kalinin District of Tyumen, ceased a criminal case against a local resident, who died of teenage daughter from HIV.
According to the investigation, the child died because the mother was an HIV-dissident and refused treatment.
However, the court relieved her of her responsibility in connection with the reconciliation with the injured father.
The prosecutor's Office believes that the crime cannot be left unpunished in order not to create a precedent for other HIV-dissidents.
The case against the Tyumen resident was initiated under Part 1 of art. 109 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation (causing death by negligence) in April-after her three-year-daughter died of HIV-infection 4b stage.
According to the prosecutor's office, the mother itself is HIV-positive.
"The woman was not treated herself and refused to treat her daughter, believing that HIV-infection does not exist,"-explained in the prosecutor's office of the Tyumen region.
The criminal case was received by the Kalinin Pecherskyi of Tyumen, who decided to terminate it on July 25.
The father of the deceased girl applied for this, explaining that "he forgave the wife, has no claims to her, she has ironed the harm and apologized."
The prosecutor's office did not agree with the court's decision and filed an appeal, demanding to cancel the decision on termination of the case and send it for a new consideration.
The girl died, and it is impossible to make amends of the crime caused.
HIV-infected mother, contrary to the recommendations of doctors, refused to survey the baby and treat her from a dangerous infection, "-the press service of the prosecutor's office said.
In the opinion of the supervisory body, it should be punished, otherwise its example will be followed by other HIV-dissidents.
As told in the Tyumen Center of AIDS, now in the Tyumen region about 12 children, who are HIV-positive, do not receive medical care because of parents ' refusal.
"And this situation has already improved-during the year of work of the special group half of parents, categorically refused to treat children from HIV, changed their opinion-allowed to carry out diagnostics, began to take drugs,"-said the press-Secretary of the AIDS center Elena Loseva.
According to her, the legislative way to influence parents is impossible, and as a result not all HIV-infected children can detect-mothers do not allow them to examine, hide, run away with children from hospitals.
What are the dangers of HIV-dissidents
At the end of last year, St. Petersburg sociologists presented the results of the first in Russia study of the so-called movement of HIV-dissidents.
HIV-dissidents are called people who deny the existence of HIV and refuse to take medicines.
Medics and activists of AIDS-service NGOs call such views antimedical, and in their distribution see a serious threat.

Scientists have allowed the existence of oceans on the ancient Venus
On ancient Venus could exist oceans.
French scientists have made this assumption.
Experts have created a computer model, which demonstrated the process of water formation on the surface of planets, writes Science News.
It turned out that on Venus in the beginning of its history oceans were formed, in which there was 10% more water, than now on the earth.
Earlier "Arguments of the Week" wrote that, according to the hypothesis of scientists, the ocean 4 billion years ago could exist on Mars.

The Gypsies overcame the moat and returned to the "street of millionaires"
Some of the wealthiest Western Midland homeowners are again in conflict with the resolute gypsies who overcame the dug municipal authorities to re-occupy the field next to their homes.
Gypsies Valet 20 houses on wheels in the field, borderinged with a rich street Solihull, humorous the name "Street of Millionaires".
Having brought with them horses, babies and many houses on wheels, they returned after they were expelled no further than in May, and they did not interfere with the moat dug the municipal authorities to prevent their invasion.
This tactful company found a gap in the defensive structures and protisnulaed its vehicles through a plot that was left not ograzhdjonnym to leave room for the footpath.
Enraged residents attacked the municipality of Solihull, saying that it was "unable to solve the problem."
An anonymous local resident said: "They came here on Monday evening, after they were driven out of the Bentley Heath, where they hurling stones at passers-by."
The municipality should be ashamed and forced to act because they are totally incapable of solving the problem.
The Gypsies were here in May, they were expelled, and they returned again.
Last night there were more gypsies, and today perhaps even more.
"The municipality of Birmingham knows how to solve this problem, they get long-term court orders to protect their parks," she added.
I live on Stritsbruk Road, and I don't like that I keep paying the municipal tax, and the municipality can't even put an end to it. "
One local resident, who wished to remain anonymous, said: "It is ridiculous, we have just seen these gypsies leave the previous time, and here, please, this attack continues."
This time there was more of them, and we even saw a horse cow in the meadow. "
The representative of the Municipality of Solihull said: "We know about the illegal camp on the ground near Stritsbruk Road and cooperate with the Solihull Police; We are taking the necessary legal action to get them out of the way as soon as possible. "
To assist us in collecting evidence, it is important that as many local residents report any anti-social or criminal behaviour to the police by calling 101.
This gives an idea of the situation that the Court will consider when we present our case to them.
Crimea Akcioniruet factory of sparkling wines "New World"
Sue of the Republic of Crimea "the plant of sparkling wines" new Light "" decided reincorporate, converting in OAO "The factory of sparkling wines" New World ", follows from the order of the Minister of Property and land relations of the Crimea Anna Anjuhinoj.

The authorized capital of the joint stock company will be 595.5 million rubles. And will consist of 5.955 million ordinary shares par value of 100 rubles. Each.
The Ministry of Agriculture of Crimea stated that if there are no funds for modernization of the enterprise within the next three years, there will be a threat of plant shutdown.
The depreciation of fixed assets at the Enterprise is about 60-70%.
The modernization of the company requires 1.2 billion rubles. Due to the peculiarities of the organizational-legal form it is obliged to give 50% of profit in the budget income.
What remains is not sufficient to implement the modernization plan.
"To get money from the owner is problematic, it is difficult to talk about attracting borrowed funds of large credit organizations,"-said the deputy head of the Ministry of Crimea Sergei Petelin in April this year.
The Crimean parliament included the enterprise in the forecast plan of privatization for 2017.
It was suggested to hold his corporatization and put it on auction.
The source of "Interfax" in the Crimean authorities assessed the possible value of the company's sale of $40 million, investment of the investor in modernization-another $30 million.
"New World" in 2016 increased the production of sparkling wines by 2.8% compared to the level of 2015-up to 1.52 million bottles.
In 2017, the new world intended to release 1.6 million bottles.

Nizhny comments crushed more than 40 tombstones
Employees of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Nizhny Novgorod region identified citizens devastated 46 tombstones in the cemetery of Lyskovo.
The third-class disciples were the intruders.
The first statement that grave plates were damaged by unknown, was received in OMVD of Russia on Lyskovskomu District on June, 27th.
In all, 24 people were contacted by the police.
As a result, a criminal case was instituted under article 244 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation "destruction, damage or desecration of burial places".
According to the results of the investigation policemen identified the suspects, they were two schoolchildren aged 8 and 9 years.
The juvenile offenders told the police that they were interested in seeing how the monuments were falling, and that prompted them to act in hooliganism.
Preventive measures have been taken with children and their parents.
Italy is tightening its tone towards the ships of NGOs rescuing migrants.
Italy warned NGOs that owned rescue ships in the Mediterranean that they would not be able to continue their work unless obey new rules governing their activities.
"If NGOs do not obey the new code of conduct, it is difficult to say whether they will be able to continue their activities," said Interior Minister Mario Minniti in an interview with the Turin daily newspaper "Stampa".
The Minniti warning sounded the following day after the Italian authorities confiscated a vessel belonging to the German humanitarian organization "Jugend Rettet", on suspicion that its crew actually cooperated with traffickers and Facilitates illegal immigration.
The humanitarian organization, which has worked for the whole year, has refused to comment on the merits of the detailed accusations made against it by the Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Kartozio.
"For us the salvation of human life is and will remain the highest priority, so we are very sorry that we can not continue activities in the area of search and rescue,"-says the organization's statement in social networks.
"We will be able to assess all the accusations made now, only after we gather all the information and evaluate the situation."
Italian authorities are watching the ship "Yuventa" belonging to "Jugend Rettet", since October.
His crew is suspected of having taken on board migrants whom traffickers sent directly to them and allowed the smugglers to leave together with boats that they could use anew.
At least one such meeting is expected to take place only 1.3 miles from the Libyan coast, as alleged in the charges, the contents of which were published in the Italian media.
The crew is suspected of violating the regulations of the Italian coast authorities, which control the rescue operations in this zone, rather of humanitarian zeal, than for any other motive.
The code of conduct presupposes, mainly, that vessels of the type "Juventy" will have on board an Italian police officer who will monitor their activities.
So far, only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have agreed to obey the code: "Save the Children", Maltese MOAS and "Pro-Activa outstretched hugs" from Spain.
The latter stated on Thursday that it considered the new rules unnecessary but acceptable provided that they did not entail any "significant changes or hindrances" to its rescue operations.
Among those who refused to sign, there is also a Nobel Prize organization Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF).
Meanwhile, Minniti said that the sharp decline in recent weeks in the number of migrants arriving in Italy as a result of rescue operations indicates that efforts to support the Libyan Coast Guard and cooperation with local mayors are bearing fruit.
"In the last days we began to see the light at the end of the tunnel," the minister said.
He reported on plans for further negotiations with the Libyan Mayors on economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving these countries in the hope of reaching Europe.
"In Libya we do not want to be associated with any of the parties to the conflict"
The Russian authorities have recently significantly intensified their policy on the Libyan track, and the delegations of the warring Libyan parties frequent to Moscow.
The head of the Russian contact Group on Vnutrilivijskomu Settlement under the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation and Duma, the assistant to the head of the Chechen Republic Lev of money told "Kommersant" what goals Moscow pursues in this region and on whom it bets.
The Contact group for Libya you are heading is almost unknown.
Here, let's say, the contact group on Ukraine-everyone knows about it.
And here is the veil of mystery.
What exactly do you do, what are your goals?
The contact group was created on the initiative of the Russian MFA and the State Duma.
Her activities supervise deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Bogdanov and Adam Delimkhanov (deputy of the Duma from Chechnya.-"Kommersant").
The latter is authorized to work on the Libyan direction by the speaker of the State Duma Vyacheslav Volodin.
The impetus for the formation of the group was the detention in Libya of the Russian tanker "mechanic Chebotarev" (in September 2015, on board there were 11 people.-"Kommersant").
We were thinking about how to help the crew.
Then the contact group of military specialists, representatives of the State Duma was created, our work was supported by the head of Chechnya Ramzan Kadyrov.
And how did it happen that you were the one who led it?
Since I have been working in Libya since 2008, I have been asked to lead the group's work.
Our activities were not limited to the release of seafarers from the "Mechanics of Chebotareva".
We have been able to establish contacts with representatives of all the major factions opposed to each other in the Libyan conflict-and from Tripoli (where the UN-recognized government led by Faizom Saradzhem is based.-"Kommersant"), and with Tobruk (residence Parliament, which opposes the government and supports Marshal Khalifa Haftara, controlling the eastern areas of Libya. -"Kommersant").
Thanks to the active participation of Ahmed Metiga (Deputy Prime Minister of Libya-"Kommersant"), we managed to quickly agree on the release of Russian seamen.
Then it was decided to make more efficient use of these contacts, to create a contact group.
Its task is to analyze the situation, identify key factors and players, and dialogue with all parties to the conflict.
I want to emphasize: in Libya we do not want to be associated with any of the parties to the conflict, we are engaged in dialogue with all.
How many people are in the contact group and how many of them are permanently in Libya?
Now the contact group consists of five people.
Among them there are people who have experience in law enforcement agencies, including the Ministry of Defense.
We also want to be part of the Group of specialists for the region, representatives of the Middle East Institute of RAS.
Constantly in Libya from our employees nobody is, in this is not necessary yet.
Are there any Russian military advisers and instructors in Libya now?
And if so, on whose side?
There are no Russian military specialists in Libya.
All conversations and publications about it do not correspond to reality.
But in your contact group the ex-military enters...
Yes, and their presence is necessary.
For example, when we visit hotspots.
Or such closed up to a certain point for US cities, as Misurata (where militias are based, played a role in overthrow of the Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi in 2011 and appreciably intensified in the following years.-"Kommersant").
We came to Misurata in January this year.
We were frightened, saying that there are all the Islamists, terrorists.
But it was important for us to assess the situation there, to analyze the real military potential, who is responsible for what, why there are rumours, what the role of Islamists are in reality.
In Misrata, we met with all the representatives of the squads who were involved in the destruction of the IG in Sirte (in December 2016, this city on the Mediterranean coast was recaptured from militants banned in Russia "Islamic State"-"Kommersant").
We wanted to see them, get to know these people, check the information that they played a decisive role in destroying the ISIS in Libya, not Khalifa Haftar, who attributed these merits to themselves.
And what conclusion did you come to?
"Islamic State" in Libya won not Haftar?
That's not what he did.
Haftar conducted operations on another front, in Benghazi.
And with the IG in Sirte fought structures that obeyed the government in Tripoli.
And by the way, we have invited people who conducted this anti-terrorist operation to Russia.
And they arrived-the visit lasted from 19 to 23 April this year, the Libyan delegation was accepted in the Council of the Federation, in the Duma, ministry and Rosgvardii.
You have, as we have understood, been in all the Libyan regions and are likely to imagine the sentiments of local elites and warlords.
Do you think it will be possible to implement the cease-fire arrangements, the elections that Khalifa Haftar and Faiz Sarraj reached at the end of July in Paris?
Or again, as has happened repeatedly in the past, the agreements will be thwarted, the fighting will resume, the parties would try to seize power alone?
For us a good signal was already the fact that Sarraj and Haftar agreed to the next meeting, not so long ago it was impossible.
In the recent past, both leaders have been extremely negative about each other.
And as for the position of Russia...
Often write and say that Moscow actively supports Haftara, many believe it.
We faced this situation when we were in Misrata, and Haftar was on board the Russian aircraft carrier "Admiral Kuznetsov" on that day.
It was a coincidence.
But in Misrata did not believe in coincidence.
We were told: "You are probably very brave people that came to us today."
But our task is precisely to show: we do not support only Haftara, we are engaged in dialogue with all key participants of the conflict in Libya.
You and Haftarom communicated.
Does understanding with Russian partners facilitate the fact that he studied twice in the USSR on a human, emotional level?
And, by the way, does Haftar know the Russian language?
Russian it if and knows, it is very relative.
But the fact that he has studied, of course, facilitates dialogue with him.
And by the way, not just with him.
When we communicate with the military in Tripoli and Misrata, we meet generals who have studied either in Russia or in the Soviet Union.
And here they speak fluent Russian.
And stretch to Russia, to some extent experiencing nostalgia for it.
Do you believe that the arms embargo imposed on Libya is likely to be lifted soon?
Are your Libyan interlocutors interested in the supply of Russian weapons?
are interested, of course, but, as I said, we do not take sides in this conflict, and do not want to arm some to the detriment of others.
We would like to see everyone in equal positions.
As far as the arms embargo is concerned, there is a constant call on the part of Libyans for Russia to contribute to its withdrawal.
The process of drafting the Constitution is now actively advancing in Libya.
We hope that the parties will reach compromise solutions and achieve an internal consensus.
Then we have to pass the elections, which was discussed at the meeting of Saradzha and Haftara.
If the elections are held and the legitimate authority is finally elected (and now none of the parties has such status), it is possible to put in the UN un the issue of lifting the arms embargo.
Raising this issue now is pointless and dangerous, it will only lead to an escalation of the conflict.
Recently, the media reported that Italy, recessionary with the problem of African refugees floating from Libya, feels abandoned by the allies of the EU.
Can Moscow help Italian partners in this situation by using their links with Libyans?
For example, how realistic is the option that Haftara units will establish control over the coast and put an end to the business of smugglers, direct immigrants to Europe?
Very timely question.
We are actively working on it.
The Italians need the support of Russia, because Moscow is engaged in a dialogue simultaneously with Haftarom, Saradzhem, Misurata and the south of the country.
And in this matter the tribes in the south of Libya play a big role, and they are ready to cooperate with Russia.
Is it a question of southerners nipped flows of migrants on distant approaches?
That is to say, unfolded back the buses in which the Nigerian migrants go?
We're doing this.
But it's not easy.
Some clans and groups are interested in keeping these flows going.
We hope to contribute to the consolidation of Southerners in the negotiation process between Saradzhem, Haftarom and tribes in the south.
But first we would like to see the unity of opinion on this issue between Haftarom and Saradzhem.
The head of the government in Tripoli Faiz Sarraj is considered an Islamist who supports the introduction of Sharia law in the country.
How radical do you think he sticks?
Will this not be an obstacle in building relations with Russia or the West?
I'll give my personal opinion of him.
In my opinion, he is, on the contrary, an opponent of radical Islam.
But the Islamists are in his coalition.
Yes, but he himself holds the position that Libya should be an absolutely normal country, a moderately Islamic, open world.
And he is also actively struggling with terrorists.
Where did he get that reputation?
It is created by those countries that have no interest in having Russia talk to Tripoli.
Tripoli is the capital, the legislative, executive and judicial authorities.
There is the National Oil Corporation, the National Bank and other State structures.
Of course, some countries were interested in not Leslie.
And we have all the maps mixed and began to communicate actively with both Tripoli and Tobruk.
And already reaping the fruits of this work: Rosneft has concluded a cooperation agreement with the state oil Company of Libya-NOC.
Director NOC Mustafa Sanalla, with whom the head of Rosneft Igor Sechin made the deal, himself directly from Tripoli.
And two weeks ago, the first shipment of Libyan oil to the company "Rosneft" took place.
What will Russia do with it?
I believe that resell.
What about Russia's economic interests in Libya?
Plans to resign the contracts concluded with Muammare Gaddafi.
In particular, the previous agreements in the transport sphere (construction of railways), energy (electrification) and a number of others are involved.
Do Libyans have anything to pay?
Well, they have oil.
That is, as in the case of Iran, is the scheme "oil in exchange for services"?
I do not know what will be the scheme, directly these questions I do not do.
In fact, the economy for Russia in Libya is not the main thing.
We are in fact engaged in peacemaking work.
The main thing for us is to stop the bloodshed, to help the Libyans to agree among themselves so that they can establish themselves in order and Libya ceased to be a favourable environment for the development of terrorism.
For Russia, this is the main task-to help the Libyan people and to squeeze out the terrorists.
Do you have data on the presence in Libya (now or earlier) of radical militants from Russia or other countries of the former Soviet Union?
One of the tasks of our contact group was to clarify this.
I met with a representative of the Libyan State Security Committee, who said that today there are no immigrants from Russia and other countries of the former USSR.
He said he had about 50, 000. Records of telephone conversations of representatives of Islamist and radical groups (in Libya.-"Kommersant") and Russian speech does not sound there.
And from what states then these militants?
I would not like to go into these details.
Then formulate the question differently.
How many Islamist militants in Libya Libyans themselves?
Libyans among them practically no, them no more than 5%.
The others are the outsiders.
Can Moscow hold Vnutrilivijskie talks on the example of Paris?
There are such plans.
We are actively negotiating with Libyans, several delegations from Libya have already visited Moscow, and have declared their readiness to come to Moscow or Grozny.
And when can such negotiations take place?
It's hard to say now.
There should be several visits, and I hope that there will be clarity about the time and place of the negotiations.

A 30-year-old resident of the Olevska Zhytomyr region near the local football stadium fired several times towards the teenagers who were there.
According to the suspect, he was annoyed by the noise, reported "facts" in the Department of Communications of the police of Zhytomyr region.
After that, the man went to a café, located nearby.

34-year-old victim was provided with the necessary medical assistance, the threat of his life is not present.
Police and ambulance arrived at the scene, but the shooter had fled by that time.

Sentence of Michelle Carter for allegations prompted to the suicide of Conrad Roy
Resident Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years of imprisonment for using text messages and phone calls encouraged to kill her boyfriend Conrad Roy.
Michelle Carter, who is now 20 years old, will have to be 15 months behind bars and five more years of probation.
Carter was convicted in June of the manslaughter murder of Conrad Roy, who committed suicide on 13 July 2014.
Roy's father said at the Thursday's hearing, "My family is heartbroken.
My son was my best friend. "
Carter was allowed to stay free before the appeal.
She threatened a maximum of 20 years, but her lawyers said that both she and Roy suffered mental disorders.
Carter, dressed in red trousers and cream blouse, listened to the verdict standing, compressing hands and drooping eyes.
"She killed Conrad Roy by her actions," the prosecutor said to the court.
"She interrupted his life to improve her.
She did not recognize responsibility, "she said.
"She has not demonstrated remorse."
But Carter's lawyer said it was a "tragic case she deeply regrets."
Judge Lawrence Monis said, however, that in his opinion, her "age, maturity, or even mental illness did not have a noticeable impact on her actions".
The prosecutor read out a statement from Roy Lynn Roy's mother, saying: "There has not been a single day when I would not mourn the loss of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and how I manage-I try to support his sisters, despite all the pain that will remain with us forever, "-said in him.
Roy Kamdin Roy's sister said that she was haunted by the idea that she would never be able to attend his wedding or become an aunt of his children.
"To lose a man who has been with me ever since I was born is a pain that will stay with me for the rest of my life," she said.
This case is likely to become a legal precedent, as there is no law in Massachusetts that would provide for the responsibility of a person to commit suicide.
In 2014, when Roy was found dead in the car with symptoms of monoxide gas poisoning, Carter was 17 years old.
The case caught the attention of the whole country when it became known that he was pushed to suicide of the Carter's message.
"You can hang yourself, jump from the roof, stab yourself with a knife do not know there are many ways,"-she wrote in several messages sent two weeks before his death, when he was resting with his family.
A few minutes before the suicide she wrote: "You have to do it, Conrad" and "You just need to turn on the ignition, and you'll be free and happy."
Judge Monit said Carter wanted to catch up with Roy's death and forbade her from communicating with the press to prevent her from getting the desired.
The opinions of the lawyers were divided.
One of the few who defended Carter was Amanda Knox, who was convicted in 2007 for murdering her British roommate in Italy and acquitted two years later.
30-year-old Knox published in the Los Angeles Times his special opinion, which stated: "Michelle Carter deserves sympathy and help, not prison."

Audi to be modified to 850 000 diesel cars
The day before the announcement by "Audi" "BMW" announced that they will offer to update the software in more than 350 000 cars.
The chairman of "BMW" said that the company believes that "there are more intelligent ways than restrictions on driving", referring to the European cities-including Munich, where the "BMW"-which considered the possibility to prohibit or restrict Use of diesel cars.
Daimler said on Thursday that it is modifying three million Mercedes cars in Europe to reduce their diesel emissions.
None of the companies called their step review.
European automakers have actively promoted the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to help comply with the carbon emission regulations.
But oxides nitrogen, which emit diesel engines, are considered carcinogens and can cause asthma.
Cost for automakers installation equipment, antacid exhaust fumes of diesel cars also rises, and maintain a competitive price for cars becomes difficult.
While German car manufacturers are under close scrutiny, Chancellor Angela Merkel's government is also accused of indulgesing influential car manufacturers and ignoring the signs of the problem.
Companies try not to repeat the mistakes of "Volkswagen", which concealed the use of so-called "damage Devices", which during the testing could correct the amount of emitted harmful gases to conform to the rules, and in Conditions of normal driving were disconnected.
Several Volkswagen leaders were convicted in the United States, and others are under investigation on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month in Germany the former head of thermodynamics department was arrested in the structure of "Audi" engine development group.
The former manager, Zakkeo Giovanni Pamio, is an Italian, and therefore is not protected from extradition and can be tried in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi was under a German criminal investigation with Volkswagen after the authorities accused Audi of installing the system to circumvent European emission regulations and expanded the investigation, which was previously focused on The United States.
The inclusion of Audi in the investigation can create serious problems for Volkswagen: the manufacturer of luxury cars is the source of a disproportionately large share of the Volkswagen's income.

Astronomers have found a "hell" planet on which even iron can melt
For the first time studying the properties of the stratosphere giant exoplanets called WASP-121b, astrophysicists were quite surprised by its temperature, which is able to evaporate iron and other metals.
Experts noticed that the water molecules are so warmed up by the light of the star that emit infrared radiation.
The Hubble telescope has captured the radiance of water molecules on this gas giant: This high temperature causes water in the atmosphere of the planet to glow in the infrared range.
WASP-121b refers to the so-called "hot Jupiters"-gas giants, in size and weight comparable to the largest planet of the solar system, but located ten times closer to the parent star.
Because of this year on Jekzoplanete lasts only 1.3 "earthly" days ", and its gas shell is inflamed almost to 2 500 degrees Celsius.
Climate change threatens lavender in Provence.
It has become a symbol of Provence and southern France, but there are fears that it is threatened by climate change.
Lavender has grown worse because of the arid weather and the transmorbidity of insects; This has caused a constant headache for scientists and farmers who are trying to find a solution.
Eric Shehs, an expert from the Crieppam Agricultural Research Institute in Provence, says: "Lavender in Provence is really in jeopardy because in recent years this plant has felt the consequences of changing Climate: In spring and especially in autumn the rains became much less.
This affects the life of lavender.
And there are small cicadas, jumping on leaves insects, carrying micro-bacteria; In very dry weather they become very much. "
There is a lot at stake.
Lavender not only attracts holiday; Lavender oil is very popular in perfumery and cosmetology.
Eric Shehs says: "Instead of very long ears with a large number of large flowers, we have small, underdeveloped, weakened or absent.
So we have fewer parts containing essential oil. "
The solutions currently under consideration include improved water distribution and slowing down of evaporation from the soil, as well as spraying plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and the cultivation of varieties more resistant to drought.
Ambassador of Winter Universiade-2019 met with Krasnoyarsk schoolchildren
Two-time world champion in hockey, the Ambassador of the Winter Universiade-2019 Alexander Semin met the day before with novice hockey players and gave autographs to the fans.
The meeting was held in the tent of the Winter Universiade-2019 as part of a theme week dedicated to ice hockey.
Any visitor to the tent could skate on a platform with artificial ice.
In addition, there were relays, quizzes and games with the drawing of souvenir products of student games, warm-up from the Federation of Aerobics.
The event was attended by 50 schoolchildren.
Alexander Semin advised the guys to do as much as possible on the sports grounds and stressed that the most important thing at the initial stage of training-hard work and a huge desire to engage in hockey.
"It is great that there is a playground in Krasnoyarsk, such as the tent of the Winter Universiade-2019, where novice sportsmen can ask questions directly to the coaches of the teams," the champion said.
It should be noted that the ambassadors of the Winter Universiade-2019 Help to promote student sport and healthy lifestyle among Krasnoyarsk.
The Universiade tent will work throughout the summer season until September 25, according to the press service of the Winter Universiade-2019 Directorate.
Foggy commented on Medvedev's words
The official representative of the U.S. Department of State Heather I, commenting on the briefing the words of Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, said about the need to find "areas for interaction" with Russia.
According to her, such areas should be found to "improve bilateral interaction".
An example of such successful cooperation was the Armistice Agreement on Syria.
We are two nuclear super powers.
"And people around the world agree that the US and Russia should be able to work with each other," the diplomat said.
At the same time, the Commission refused to comment on Medvedev's statement about a full-fledged trade war between Russia and the United States.
"If Russia said that, it certainly has the right to speak, but I can not say anything more on this subject,"-said the representative of Department.
Earlier, U.S. President Donald Trump signed a bill to tighten sanctions against the Russian Federation.
Commenting on the new package of sanctions, the Russian Prime Minister Medvedev said that Washington declared Moscow a full-fledged trade war, putting an end to the hope of improving bilateral relations.
Medvedev also said that the US sanctions will be in effect for decades.
In addition, the prime Minister said, the American establishment "retire beat" Trump.
Missing in the suburbs bodybuilder found on someone else's dacha lost memory
Bodybuilder Shamil Hanmetov disappeared on the road to Noginsk on July 25 under very piquant circumstances: He left the car to go to the toilet.
For seven days he was unsuccessfully searched by acquaintances and locals.
And Shamil was found on someone else's dacha in Ramenskoye.
He was completely naked found in his toilet owner.
Dagestan athlete could not explain how he was here and what happened to him.
He couldn't even remember his name, and his passport was gone.
Identify the person helped by the announcement of his missing.
The medics who arrived on the call recorded a partial loss of memory and traumatic brain injury in Hanmetova, reports public Mash.
Probably, other surprises are waiting for the athlete.
Intruders, Ankhara Shamil, probably already visited his apartment, the keys of which he also stole.
Oil and gas revenues of July exceeded forecast for 7.4 billion rubles
Actually received oil and gas revenues on the results of July 2017 exceeded the estimate by 7.4 billion rubles, the Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation informs.
The excess, as explained by the Office, was mainly due to the higher exchange rate of the United States dollar to the ruble compared to the average monthly value of June used for the valuation, as well as the excess of the actual volume of gas production and Export volume of the projected levels.
"The deviation of the oil and gas revenues of the federal budget from the monthly assessment, corresponding to the federal law on the federal budget for 2017-2019 years, in August 2017 is forecasted at the rate of + 40.2 billion rubles,"-the Ministry of Finance informed.
Thus, the total amount of funds allocated for the purchase of foreign currency in the domestic currency market in the period from August 7 to September 6, 2017 is 47.6 billion rubles.
Accordingly, the daily volume of purchases of foreign currency will be equivalent to 2.07 billion rubles.
The Bank of Russia will be involved in the transaction of purchase of foreign currency ministry Russia.
Every working day during the specified period the CB will conclude transactions of purchase of foreign currency at the organized auctions of the Moscow exchange evenly during the trading day.
The acquired foreign currency will be credited to the accounts of the federal treasury in leaner.
The murder of a journalist underlines that in Mexico it is becoming more dangerous.
Employees of the weekly newspaper "Riodose" usually meet on Wednesdays to discuss plans to cover the latest violent crimes in the state of Sinaloa related to organized crime, corrupt officials or Incessant war drug.
But today, depressed by their own tragedy, they met to talk about security.
They were told they had to change their habits.
Two senior journalists discussed what seems safer: taking children with them to an office where they had already thrown a grenade in 2009, or leaving them at home.
Security experts wrote three words on the board hanging in the room: enemies, neutral people, allies.
They asked the journalists to name the names for each column-no proof needed, suspicions and internal sensations would suffice.
They are drug traffickers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected of being on the government's or cartel's expense, a whole list of scoundrels, which makes the work of covering the chaos in Mexico dangerous.
Violence does not give respite, and among the corpses that are multiplying in the country, more and more journalists: according to the Committee for the Protection of journalists, not less than 25 since President Enrico Pena Nieto took office in December 2012; 589 persons after attacks and threats are under federal protection; And this year, at least seven people have died in seven states.
Among the latter-their publisher and Mastermind, co-founder of "Riodose" Javier Valdez Cardenas.
"The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," he wrote in one of his many books on violent drug-related crimes.
His absence is felt very sharply, although his presence everywhere-a large picture of Valdez, showing the middle finger, with the inscription "Justice" hanging on the façade of the building "riodose"; Two reporters of the year for 30, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear T-shirts, which depicts his smile, face with glasses or his branded Panama.
The seminar takes place less than two months after his death; Journalists discuss their common trauma, their nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.
Although a special federal prosecutor's office was organized in 2010 to investigate journalistic cases, only two cases were investigated, according to the Committee for the Protection of journalists.
As in the case of most of the thousands of murders associated with drug and organized crime every year, killer journalists are rarely brought to justice.
Journalists of "Riodose" insist that they will write about violence in Sinaloa, although they are heartbroken, although the area is now much more dangerous.
Without the information about the killers, without justice from talking about security at meetings is not good,-says Ibarra.
"It's very foolish to spend time at this seminar," he says.
"Until we know the reason, we suspect everyone."
In the morning of May 15 Valdez left the office of "Riodose" in the capital of Culiacan state.
He managed to drive only a couple of blocks before his red Toyota roll was stopped by two men; He was dragged out of the car and shot at him 12 times, probably because of the name of the newspaper-which means "the Twelfth river".
Shooter left his car and smashed it nearby.
Valdés was 50 years old.
He has a wife and two adult children.
Rumors tend to disperse quickly on Kuliakanu.
But almost everyone is silent about Valdez.
Since Guzman was arrested and extradited to the United States last January, Sinaloa has become one of the bloodiest battlegrounds in the country, as rival factions are struggling to fill the vacuum.
Let's not say that every day in the streets of Sinaloa kill one or more people, or that the cemetery is filled with decorated storey mausoleums barons, which are more than the homes of many living people.
Let's forget for a moment that the state of "tranquility" is simply when one of the cartels takes control of the seaside state with important ports and ways of trafficking, leading in the USA.
Despite this and the fact that Valdez was well aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bohorkes, 60-year-old co-founder and director of "Riodose", crushed by guilt for not being able to protect a friend.
He thinks the murder has been helped by two mistakes.
First, in February, an interview was published with Damaso Lopez, the leader of one of the rival cartel factions, which fights with the sons of Guzman.
The publication could anger the sons; The people who were presumed to be members of the gang bought all copies of the publication as soon as they were delivered to the kiosks.
The second mistake was that he did not force Valdez to leave the country for his own safety after another newspaper, which wrote about the same story, was seized.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his murder was regarded as another milestone in the development of violence against journalists in Mexico.
He had been away from danger for so long, his friends and colleagues thought that he would always be.
He was an experienced reporter at "norojeste" and in 2003, together with five colleagues, founded "Riodose", selling his 50-dollar shares.
In Sinaloa "It was impossible to do journalism without touching the topic of drugs,"-said Bohorkes.
Over time, the newspaper earned the reputation of a bold and honest publication, sales and advertising revenues grew.
Journalists liked that they could publish bold reports without fear of censorship, and readers were attracted by the fact that in this edition they could read about what no one else dared to write about.
Eight years after its founding, "Riodose" received the prestigious award of Maria Moors Cabo for her report work in Latin America.
In the same year Valdez won the International Press Freedom Prize for daring to investigate the drug trafficking in Mexico wherever it led.
He frankly admitted that he was scared.
"I want to live on," he said at the CPJ prize.
Drug in Sinaloa-"It's a way of life," he said last October in an interview with Rompevento TV.
"You have to accept tasks that fall on you as a journalist-either so, or you just valjaete fool."
I don't want to be asked: "What did you do when there were so many deaths around... Why didn't you tell me what was going on? "
Employees of "Riodose" Miss Valdés, a joker who swore as a porter in the port, a friend, generous in hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to Sotatsja alive.
They relied on routine order.
He must have always worn his hat.
He had to go to El Guajjabo, the bar opposite the office, and always sit there at the same table.
Now they ask: it has ruined love to once routine?
His death made them doubt their calculations of how best to do their job and stay alive.
"They don't like it when you know their wives, children, in their legal business and in clandestine airfields for drug trafficking.
"These things were beyond the line," Bohorkes said.
The result, even in the best of times, was a high level of self-censorship and a desire for self-preservation.
You have to trust your instincts.
Stay away from what smells bad.
The problem, says the editor of "Riodose" Andres Villareal, is that "the sense of smell can be deceived... And then what happened to Javier is happening. "
Old rules, he says and others, no longer act in Sinaloa-like in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states, where there is a poisonous mixture of lucrative smuggling routes, weak state institutions and corrupt officials.
The landscape is constantly changing.
In the room where the staff of "Riodose" gathered for the training on safety, suddenly it was forbidden to make cell phones: a few days before it became known that spyware, which is sold exclusively to governments, used In Mexico to spy on journalists and public activists.
Outside, two policemen refuge in the shade of a tree from the 104-degree heat (40 degrees Celsius).
They gave the state Government to guard the office of "Riodose", which is located in a four building in the bourgeois quarter of Culiacan.
Some half journalists asked whether the police officers were in the 50 per cent of the order that the governor himself had said they could not be trusted.
A few months ago, journalists went to the mountainous terrain, which is de facto controlled by gangs of drug traffickers.
In the nearest room "Riodose" counted on three main themes.
This is the murder of the Sinaloa brother of former boxing champ Julio Cesar Chavez.
They also had an exposure to government spending concentrated in the governor's hometown.
And there was a group kidnapping in one of the most expensive restaurants of Culiacan, a block from the Office of the Prosecutor.
It was not officially announced who was kidnapped or how it happened, so it was necessary to be cautious when it was time to write about the fact that everyone in the city knew: that it was a favorite restaurant at the same time drug dealers and authorities.
One of their journalists learned from the open database that the restaurant was registered in the name of a politician belonging to the ruling Institutional-Revolutionary Party (PRI), which has dominated all levels of power for almost the entire past century.
Recently, a high level of corruption charges against several governors from PRI were put forward.
Villareal asked the journalists to write about previous incidents in this restaurant, including when the son of "El Chapo" Guzman escaped the raid of the military.
A few months ago, readers would be looking for a Valdez column with the most reliable information about the abduction.
"Earlier we would already know what happened," says 46-year-old Villareal, for his thin physique nicknamed "El Flaco".
"Today all channels of communication with our sources are broken."
The Valdez cabinet is now used as a warehouse for posters and stickers with protests against the murders of journalists, because employees have become the people they never thought to become: activists acting on behalf of the press.
Journalist Miriam Ramirez took a few posters and went to a demonstration at the local prosecutor's office next morning, dedicated to another journalist.
El Salvador Adam disappeared in the state of Michoacán in the west of the country three days after he was killed by Valdez.
They found the burnt body, and the authorities said it was him, based on DNA tests.
Throughout the country, journalists began to speak louder, to organize protests and to write "SOS Press" on the sidewalks and walls of houses.
On that day, the director of Bohorkes was in Washington, trying to enlist international support in the demand for justice in the case of Valdez.
At a meeting with Governor Sinaloa the day after the murder, Valdez Ramirez accused the authorities of spyinging for journalists and ordering their murders for telling the truth.
She then asked her not to give her any more tasks to publicize the Government's activities, fearing that anger would harm her objectivity.
Valdez has said many times that journalists in Mexico are "surrounded" by organized crime, its complicity in government and an indifferent society.
In his latest book, "Drug journalism," he wrote that reporters were not killed just by gangs of drug traffickers; They do so on the orders of politicians and security forces in collusion with organized crime.
The article 19 Press Protection Committee believes that half of the attacks on journalists last year were ordered by police and government officials.
"In Mexico, you die because they want to shut you up," Ramirez says.
Of course, killing frighten people.
Everyone remembers about the death of a blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias six years ago in the northern frontier state of Tamaulipas.
On her body found a note allegedly written on behalf of the cartel Zetas: "I'm here because of my articles."
The computer keyboard and headphones lay beside her head cut.
Some editions chose to close as the newspaper "El Norte" in the northern border state of Chihuahua after the murder of her correspondent Miroslav Breech in March.
Others continue to hold on as "El Mañana" from Nuevo Laredo after the assassination of its leader in 2004.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed the drug cartels using an editorial on the first page, entitled "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists have left their native states or in general the country.
It's a painful decision.
In exile, it is difficult to find a job, and they still look at the danger in the streets.
And sometimes they are killed, as apparently happened to photographer Ruben Espinoza, who was murdered in 2015 together with four women in an apartment in Mexico three months after fleeing from Veracruz.
Those who remain and continue to work are balanced daily between risky decisions.
Ibarra-who once dreamed of being a poet-admits that he is afraid to write about drug.
"Mexico is heading to hell, and that's why I became a journalist," he says.
Last Friday, at midnight, when the latest issue was already ready for printing, the publishers of "Riodose" sat on the sidewalk near the office and drank beer when suddenly their phones simultaneously rang.
A series of skirmishes between rival gangs and security forces near the resort town of Mazatlan left behind, according to confirmed figures, 19 corpses.
The war continued to flare up, as promised in a series of messages from cartels found in the area.
Sitting on the sidewalk, they posted the news on the website "Riodose" via mobile phone.
The next day I had to remake the first page.
Nearby howled sirens-another firefight in the neighborhood.
Bohorkes looked ready for defense guarding their cops.
If they were frightened, they didn't show it.
Sitting under a huge portrait of the deceased founder of their newspaper, whose middle finger was exposed to the whole Sinaloa, the employees of "Riodose" continued his business.
"How can you think about closing," said Bohorkes, "If on the very day that Javier was murdered, intern asked me to send her to the street to do a report?"
Dinosaur used camouflage to avoid enemies
At first glance, it seems to be a statue, albeit a terrifying one.
The researchers told that the first found remains of an incredible creature the size of a rhino, discovered by Canadian miners, survived so well that the experts called it "Mona Lisa among the dinosaurs."
It was so well preserved that they could even determine that the color of his scaly skin was reddish-brown – and to say that he had, in a way, a "dark past".
In a report published in the journal "Modern Biology", it was described as "the best preserved of the tireofor in the history of the finds and one of the finest copies of the Dinosaur in the world."
This fossil is a recently found copy of Nodozavra, who lived in the middle of the Cretaceous period, between 110 million and 112 million years ago.
His incredible good fortune stunned researchers who call him "really wonderful."
This herbivore tireofor is the most well-preserved fossil of its kind in the history of finds, according to the articles in National Geographic magazine.
He was found by Sean Funk when he was working at Sankor Millennium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011.
He stumbled upon something that seemed to differ from the surrounding rock, and decided to look more closely.
The discovered fossil was sent to the Royal Tirrellovskij Paleontological Museum.
For the next six years, work was carried out on the detection of the animal inside the earthen block with a mass of 2500 Futnov (1100 kilograms).
Now that all this hard work is done, the finished result can be demonstrated.
"It only costs a little squint, and you can almost believe that he sleeps," said the lead author Caleb Brown, a researcher at the Royal Tyrell Paleontological Museum, where the creation is demonstrated.
"He will enter the history of science as one of the most beautiful and well-preserved specimens of dinosaurs – Mona Lisa among dinosaurs."
Studying his skin, the researchers found that this herbivore, despite the fact that it was covered with a shell and resembled a walking tank, appeared to have been exposed to a significant danger from the carnivorous dinosaurs.
This powerful shell dinosaur used a red-white camouflage to hide from predators, and used a protective technique, known as protective color, which is also used by many animals of our day.
This would allow him to quickly merge with the surrounding environment and avoid encountering enemies, analysts say, suggesting that he was hunted by larger dinosaurs.
This creature of 110 million years of age, belonging to the Nodozavrov family, was widely covered in the press in May, and is now at the exposition at the Royal Tirrellovskom Paleontology Museum.
Scientists have already studied the animal and gave it the name Borealopelta Markmitchelli in honor of the Museum laboratory assistant Mark Mitchell, one of the group's participants, Tabynsk more than 7000 hours for his painstaking excavation.
The amazing preservation of the specimen allowed Dr. Mitchell and the international Group of scientists to document the pattern and shape of flakes and shells on his body.
They found a protective color, a common method of protection in the animal kingdom, which means that the top of the creature was darker than its lower side.
Although the protective colouring is well spread, the opening was a surprise, because the size of the dinosaur Borealopelta significantly exceeds the size of now living animals with protective color.
It can be assumed that this dinosaur was so actively hunted carnivorous dinosaurs that evolution chose to disguise confrontation as a way of survival.
But most modern animals with protective colouring-for example, deer, zebras or armadillos-are much smaller and are more accessible prey, that indicates that NODOZAVRU had to seriously fight for survival.
"A serious threat from predators for a massive, powerful shell dinosaur shows how dangerous the predatory dinosaurs of the Cretaceous period were," Brown said.
The chemical analysis of organic compounds in the scales of the dinosaur also indicates that his skin had to be reddish-brown.
Scientists continue to study the animal, searching for information about his life, including the surviving contents of his digestive tract, to find out what he ate during his last meal.
They believe that when the dinosaur died, it fell into the river and was conveyeded into the sea, where sank and back down went to the bottom of the ocean.
In those days, Alberta was as warm as it is in the south of Florida, and the rivers and oceans are likely to go much farther into the land than they are now.
"This NODOZAVR is truly remarkable in that it is completely covered with preserved scaly skin, and at the same time completely preserved in three dimensions, retaining the original shape of the animal," Brown said.
"As a result, now the animal looks almost the same as it looked in the Early Cretaceous period.
It is not necessary to use especially imagination to recreate it, it is necessary only slightly squint, and it is possible practically to believe, that it sleeps».
Cretaceous Period is an epoch when giant theropods, carnivorous dinosaurs, standing on two legs, wandered on the earth.
Although the most remarkable of them, Tyrannosaurus rex, lived millions of years later than Borealopelta, on Tireofora could hunt one of his formidable ancestors.
These include Akrokantozavr, a monster of 38 feet (11.5 meters) weighing six tonnes.
Scientists, whose recent discoveries are published in the journal "Modern Biology", believe that Borealopelta was after the death of conveyed in the sea and MUMIFICIROVALSJA in the mud.
The creature was found by Sean Funk when he was working at the Millennium mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011.
According to the staff of the museum, it is the most well-preserved tireofor in the world, along with the skin and shell, and it is intact, from muzzle to thigh bones.
On average, these creatures reached approximately 18 feet (five meters) long and weighed to 3000 lbs (1300 kilograms).
Their characteristic feature were two dvadcatidjujmovyh thorns, protruding from the shoulders.
The researchers believe that this herbivore tireofor was what is now Canada, until the invasion river took him to the open sea.
But the underwater burial of the dinosaur kept his shell with precision to the smallest detail.
The fossilized remains of this particular specimen are so well preserved that the remnants of the skin still cover bumpyed shell plates along the dinosaur skull.
As Michael Greshko wrote in an article for National Geographic magazine, this degree of preservation is "rare as winning the lottery."
The longer I look at it, the more startling it seems.
Fossilized remnants of the skin still cover bumpyed armoured plates, useivajushhieing the skull of an animal.
His right front leg is stretched along the sides, five fingers on it rotated up.
I can count the flakes on its sole. "
Mikhail Saakashvili managed to get to Poland without documents
Mikhail Saakashvili, who had previously headed Georgia, and then Odessa region in Ukraine, flew to Poland.
He did so without having documents proving his identity and citizenship.
On the arrival of Saakashvili is reported by the Polish edition Telewizja Republika, which posted on his channel in YouTube video with his speech.
Saakashvili spoke at an event commemorating the anniversary of the Warsaw Uprising against the Nazi troops in 1944.
As the politician does not know Polish, although he tried to start speech in this language, he had to speak English through a Polish translator.
During his speech, the politician touched upon the topic of cooperation between Georgia and Poland, and spoke about Ukraine.
That the migration service of Ukraine has deprived of its citizenship, the disgraced politician has learned, being in the USA.
It is unknown how he managed to make a transatlantic flight without documents.
Previously, former governor of the Odessa region Mikheil Saakashvili stated that his signature on the questionnaire for obtaining the citizenship of Ukraine was tampered with.
The politician stressed that he had not filled in any questionnaires.
The term of investigation in the case of Vajnzihera and Olhovika extended until January
The term of the preliminary investigation in the case of the co-owner of the Renova group of companies Evgeny Olhovika and the head of the "T Plus" Boris Vajnzihera was extended until January 2, 2018.
On Thursday, 3 August, the Basmannom court is considering the extension of house arrest by the accused.
The representative of the SC at the meeting informed about the decision last time to prolong the period of preliminary investigation.
"The special complexity and duration of the investigation is caused by the necessity to seize and carry out the examination of a large number of documents, as well as conduct investigative actions in several subjects of the Russian Federation,"-said the investigator.
He added that the suspects regularly gave bribes to the leadership of the Komi Republic.
Their total size is estimated at least one billion rubles.
According to the investigation, Vajnziher, Olhovik, as well as the former head of CJSC "complex energy Systems" Mikhail Slobodin, who headed the company "VimpelCom" until September 5, handed over to the highest officials of the Republic of Komi bribes for Establishment of the most advantageous tariffs for heat and electricity, as well as for the creation of favorable conditions for business.
Vajnziher and Olhovik were detained, at in Syktyvkar and arrested for two months, Slobodin escaped from the investigation and was declared in the federal search.
As one activist learned the answer to the question "Whose streets?"
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrel was shocked to the bottom of her heart.
Just a day after arriving in New York as part of a tourist trip, native St. Louis sat on a bed in an apartment rented via Airbnb, looking through the Facebook tape on the phone.
She ran into a high school post.
It said, "the police just killed a eighteen child, and he's still lying in the middle of the street."
Drawing attention to the fact that no one else from her tape did not posted this information, puzzled, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
There were a lot of user reposts with Nick @TheePharoah in her tape.
Real-time rapper from Great St. Louis tweeted the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black eighteen, killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri.
He published a photograph of Brown's lifeless body, rasprostjortogoing in the street where it would be four hours.
"It's savagery," Ferrel thought.
But death was not something new to her and her circle.
She put off the phone, and later in the evening she went back to tweets that people were going to Canfield Drive.
There were pictures of a signal tape and screaming people and a man claimeding that he was Brown's father, holding a poster saying, "A policeman from Ferguson just killed my unarmed son!"
She watched a live broadcast of a police officer standing in front of a group of protesters with a barking dog.
On another video another policeman,-she told,-racked the trigger of the rifle and yelled: "I will kill you all... Animals! "
"This is a non-standard situation",-according to his own memoirs, said then Ferrel.
"It is not such a murder as those to which we are accustomed and which we can call typical.
At that moment I felt chills.
I was angry and cried. "
She took the return flight ticket and flew home the next day.
Landing at 11pm, she took her six daughter from her father's house and decided they'd both go to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened with Ferrel and Ferguson in the next three years was the theme of the new documentary "Whose Streets?", which will be released on August 11.
It is a story about survival and protest, about love and loss, strength and resilience from the viewpoint of people living in the community and the streets that have filled the street, demanding answers.
While Ferrel was traveling to Ferguson with her daughter dressed in a floral dress and a wreath of color, they recalled a conversation that had been held up to this morning countless times, "the experience of Chjornokozhih and their situation."
She recalls saying, "Remember how I told you how black people had to fight for what they believed in?
We're going to Ferguson right now because the policeman killed eighteen boy and it was wrong. "
"I couldn't help but take it," Ferrel said later.
"What is happening today is the culmination of that... what happened earlier.
She should know about it, see it and be brought up on it.
It must not only be well understood in activism and organization, but also understand the different levels of experience of CHJORNOKOZHIH and their positions and what we must do to become free to be freed.
Even if I manage to provide her with an environment in which she does not personally faced with the obvious racism, she is no different from any other black girl.
I feel I would do her a bad favor if I ogorodila her out of it. "
When they arrived in Ferguson, they made the first stop on South Florissant Road, on a site across the street from a police station that became something like a tent camp, while activists were waiting for reports of a total uncharged officer Darren Wilson
There Ferrel with her daughter joined a local businessman who was preparing lunch packages.
They collected packages and helped distribute them to the protesters.
Gradually, in the minds of Ferrel, a new type of activism was acquired.
"My activism has changed completely since August 9th," she said, noting that as a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, she was president of the Association of Medical students, representatives of national minorities, and was engaged in Food equity and health inequities among black communities.
"I had no experience of the organizer.
It came by itself. "
A few weeks later at the evening demonstration Ferrel met with Saba Folajan, one of his co-directors.
Folajan said that she and her chief operator Lucas Alvarado-Fjerrjer "just wanted to document" the events.
Ferrel the question: "Do you want to document, or are you trying to find a story to play?"
This skepticism was inspireded by numerous people, often white, who came to the community to benefit from his pain and fortitude.
As explained in a recent interview to Folajan, "we have heard that the voices of people who were born and raised in Ferguson do not fall into the spotlight and wanted to do it differently."
Folajan has already teamed up with his co-director Damon Davis, a local artist known for his activism on sentenced to the death penalty.
His participation aroused sympathy for the project from Ferrel and six other locals, with whom the team of the project "Whose streets?" has been in contact for years since Brown's murder.
"In this documentary, not someone speaks for us or with us, it is we who speak," Davis said.
"This was the most important thing for me, as these people will be represented, because this is how I will be represented by myself."
And although the aim of the project was not to focus on the experience of Ferrel – in an effort to show that the movement "it is not about the leader-the savior, but about how the community is united", as Folajan said-it was the most open of the participants in the film.
As a result, "Whose streets?" shows unexpectedly personal aspects of Ferrel life, such as how she fell in love and married her wife.
"I felt naked," said Ferrel, laughing about the first time she saw the finished product.
"But I understood that when doing such a job and ochelovechivaeshing blacks, there must be some level of vulnerability."
In addition, the history of Ferrel again discusses and emphasizes the role of black homosexual women in the broader context of the movement "the Life of Blacks matters".
Two of the three founders of the movement-those who created the tag #BlackLivesMatter in social networks after the murder of a black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012-are homosexuals.
"Black homosexual women in leadership positions support this movement," Ferrel said. -All because we constantly fight on several fronts.
Black homosexual women have to bear all this burden. "
Folajan concurred with this statement, noting that "the movement is actually supported by black women and a multitude of homosexual black women."
However, she insists that "this is not a case of positive discrimination" and that Ferrel was not chosen as the central character of the film because of its distinctive features.
"She was the person who awakened this energy," she said.
"On the other hand, it is not a coincidence that it was in the foreground, because when"
You can feel its energy through the screen. "
In the meantime, Ferguson has long had no cameras, but there are still complex racial ties between the community and the police.
Ferrel Two and a half years will be on probation for covering the highway during the demonstration.
It describes the socio-political atmosphere of the place that the house calls, simply: "A mess."
She's still holding on to the rechjovku she learned when she went to Ferguson's streets three years ago.
We must fight for our freedom.
We have to win.
We must love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose except our chains. "

The appearance of similarities: The artist creates portraits using the DNA of Chelsea Manning
In the center of the Hall in the gallery of Friedman in New York from the ceiling on the wire hangs faces of people-white, black and brown, all something subtle similar to each other.
These 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-harborg of smears from cheeks and hair trimmings sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent the clippings from Fort Levenvort, where a former intelligence analyst is serving a 35-year term for the famous transfer of confidential diplomatic telegrams on the WikiLeaks website.
The new exhibition, Okryvshajasja August 2, is called "the appearance of similarity."
This is the result of two-year correspondence between Dewey-Harborg, whose art combines technology, informatics and Art, and Manning, a transsexual woman and a famous dissident, to whom Barack Obama softened his sentence just three days before the end of his Presidency.
After analyzing the DNA obtained from Manning with a computer program and using it to create three-dimensional portraits of people who might be in humans with such a genome, Dewey-Harborg created a deep, albeit hard-to-understand manifesto, Dedicated not only to the plasticity of data DNA-different ways of their interpretation and ingerentnomu determinism these interpretations-but also the concept of identity.
Manning, who was born with the name Bradley Edward, but from adolescence openly said that she considers herself a woman, in 2013 was sentenced to 20 episodes, including six violations of the act of espionage, computer fraud and theft.
Her photos in prison were inaccessible, so only one of her photos was known: A grainy black-white selfie, on which Manning in a platinum-tinted wig, clearly feeling uncomfortable, sits behind the wheel of a machine; With this photo she became associated.
In 2015, Dewey-harborg with great success completed its 2012 project "Visions of Strangers".
In it the artist created portraits of unknown people with the help of forensic clues like cigarette butts and chewing gum, separating from this garbage DNA and creating images of how these people could look.
And then she got an email from Paper Magazine.
"They interviewed Chelsea Manning in prison and wanted some portrait to illustrate the article," explained Dewey-Hagborg at the preliminary display of the new Press exhibition.
Chelsea was not allowed to attend and take pictures at the time, so they contacted her and asked her if she wanted to get a portrait created from her DNA.
In such an unusual way, the artist and her imprisoned muse became friends in correspondence and exchanged several letters for two years.
They even wrote a comic book "suppressed Images" illustrated by the Shoili of Eve, who portrayed how in the future the president will soften the punishment of Chelsea and TA can visit the exhibition in person.
The fact that Obama really decided to release Manning just a few days after the book's outbreaks, turned out to be a pleasant surprise after seven hard years in a military prison in Kansas.
There is something deep and strong and that the exhibition opens just now, when Donald Trump declares war on people revealing secret information in the government, and invents new ways to Kindle on Twitter the enmity that he is called to soften.
When Dewey-Harborg asked about the coincidence of this in time, she said that "nothing happens accidentally".
In the artist's statement, written on the wall of the gallery, the huge signature of Manning at the bottom (with a heart instead of a point above "I" in her surname) calls for an end to "automatic separation based on gender, race, sexual orientation and culture".
On the opposite side-its mitochondrial DNA, a long caterpillar of drawn with pencil C, G and A.
By incorporating 200 letters (or nucleotides as a scientifically exquisitely expressed artist), Dewey-Harborg hoped to show how we are all surprisingly similar, at least in its biological structure.
"I hope to explain to people that our genome does not define what we are, how open the genetic data is to be interpreted and how subjective it is," said Dewey-harborg; Her 2007 work "False Memories" is also exhibited here.
"DNA data can tell us a lot of different stories, and 30 of these stories are here."
The last part of the exposition, gone in one room, is the novel mentioned above in comics.
On it, Manning in the style of King Kong appears over the building of U.S. correctional barracks with a loudspeaker in his hand.
"If they kill your speech, they win," it says.
"So never zamolkajte."
"This is a direct quote from the letter she wrote to me," says the artist who welcomes us from Philadelphia.
"I still have goose bumps when I talk about it."
Manning has not yet seen the exhibition personally-as it was visionary depicted in the comics-but when she comes, she will be greeted by masks in the center of the room, her own genomic faking, gathered like crowds of protesters.
This is also done intentionally, as everyone at the exhibition up to the height (5 "2, The Rise of Manning), on which the pencil was drawn genetic haplogroup.
"I used to hang them on the walls, but now I wanted them to look like a crowd of people," says Dewey-harborg about the portraits.
"I wanted them to be like the mass movement that was formed around Chelsea, as the movement that stood for her release."

Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mutko: "We will meet the requirements of Wada road map in the near future"
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said that the conditions of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), set for the resumption of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA), will be implemented in the near future.
"A certain stage in the fulfillment of the requirements has been passed, Rusada got the right to plan and conduct tests together with UKAD (Doping Agency of Great Britain).
The WADA road map has been updated accordingly, "Mutko said Thursday.
The Prime Minister commented on the second part of the Wada road map to restore the compliance status code, which lists the conditions for the resumption of RUSADA and was recently published on the organization's website.
According to Mutko, it does not contain anything that could present difficulties for Russia.
"Everything has been announced, everything will be fulfilled.
And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA in the near future, "he added.
However, one of the requirements included in the list implies that Russian Andidopingovye structures should publicly acknowledge the results of a WADA-ordered investigation by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren, which alleged that doping in Russian sport is controlled by the state.
Referring to this issue, Mutko said: "We are investigating because our anti-doping system has failed.
All measures have been taken.
But there was no countries'experiences, and we will not recognize what was not. "
Mutko repeated the words of Vitaly Smirnov, the head of the Russian independent public anti-Doping Commission.
In the morning of the same day in an interview to the Russian edition of "Rsport" Smirnov acknowledged the previous problem in Russian anti-doping structures, but added: "We have repeatedly said that the report contains certain controversial positions and provisions.
Unconditionally nobody is going to take this report, "-Smirnov added.
WADA suspended RUSADA from doping control in November 2015 after a doping scandal.
However, in June this year, he was allowed to plan and coordinate testing under the supervision of international experts and the British Anti-Doping Agency (UKAD).
After visiting the organization's Moscow office in July, the Director general of Wada Olivier Niggli stated that Rusada "is moving in the right direction" to re-establish his work.

Metro Yekaterinburg Masters A new method of payment

Startups that will help your company not to become another "Uber"
Amy Jerrett wanted to assess the level of satisfaction among the employees of her startup in the field of electronic commerce, but the polls did not work.
The answers were often vague, useless or, worse, insincere.
And even though she promised anonymity, some employees did not trust the process.
"It has never been consistent and objective," said Jerrett, who manages a San Francisco-based company of 75 people, Madison Reed, who is engaged in e-commerce in the field of hair care.
So she turned to third parties for help.
Now there is a new kind of startups in the field of work with personnel, which help companies to find out how their employees feel.
By developing and licensinging software that is designed to measure involvement employees, they enable companies to do express surveys, access specific teams and demographic groups, and offer Employees anonymity and hotline for complaints, and in some cases allow informants to bypass top management and address directly to the directorate.
"Now we have tools like Strava and Fitbit for health monitoring, and where is the Fitbit for your company?" says Jim Barnett, co-founder and CEO of Glinka's startup, Redwood City, whose analytical programs are used by companies to Measurement of involvement employees.
Jerrett told that she had reached a greater understanding of what her employees think and feel over the three years of "Glint".
In addition to express surveys and questionnaires of certain teams, the product offers a thermal card of the company and shows in a visual form, which units have more complaints and which managers have low approval rating, which allows her to understand why.
Companies gradually realize that they need to control the situation in the workplace, otherwise they will be the next "Uber", which was implicated in the scandal, when a former employee published a blog post, which described the aggressive environment in which Those who expressed dissatisfaction were punished.
For such startups as "Glint", it is a desire to control the situation-an opportunity for profitable business.
According to the estimates of the Internet portal "Let's talk About payment", devoted to financial technologies, the industry of global management, regulation and compliance by 2020 can cost more than 118.7 billion dollars.
The "Convercent" startup from Denver, Colorado, which helps companies prevent and detect bad behavior, noted a slight increase in interest and activity earlier this year amid the fall of the Uber reputation.
Convercent has nearly 600 customers, including Airbnb, Microsoft, and Tesla.
Recently "Uber" has appeared among clients.
Like "Glint", "convercent" allows companies to send custom-made opinion polls, collect confidential answers in real time and view thermal maps of problem areas.
It also provides a hotline for anonymous text messages that allows employees to report bad behavior.
And if the top manager is affected, the complaints go directly to the directorate.
"The court of public opinion intercepted the power of the inspectors," said Patrick Quinlan, founder and president of the company "Convercent".
If it turns out that the company Mistreats employees or behaves unethically, even if the inspector is not intervene, the company may face costly consequences in the form of boycotts by clients, outflow of employees and lawsuits, Said Quinlan.
"Ruby Tuesday", a network of restaurants, where in 500 institutions employs more than 25000 employees, has used "convercent" for more than a year to make sure that employees are aware of the rules and procedures, and offer an easy way to contact the head office of the company.
Earlier, if an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to search for a phone number or an e-mail of the head office, to file a formal complaint and hope that it would be seriously disregarded.
Often it was a frightening and awkward experience, said James Vitrano, head of the legal department of the Company "Ruby Tuesday", saying that there was no normal way to track complaints of employees.
Now, when the company uses the "convercent" service, problems that were previously hidden from managers sitting in offices in other cities or states – such as discrimination, harassment and unfair wages – can be quickly detected and Deal with them.
"I can get closer to a holistic, comprehensive understanding of the situation of employees," said Vitrano, who runs the risk management group for the Ruby Tuesday network.
"And we protect our shareholders from legal proceedings with employees."
According to Kvinlanda, the companies began to take more seriously the ethics, values and involvement of employees in 2002, after the accounting firm "Arthur Andersen" collapsed due to ethical violations as a result of the "Enron case".
But only when "social networks got mass spread", companies realized that they would not be able to keep their dirty underwear from viral spread in the network.
"Before we started using technology to control ethics, people used hope as a strategy," he said.
Both "Glint" and "Convercent" offer their software as a service, Vzymaja from the companies a regular fee for the use of their products.
This is a business model and an opportunity that has received the approval of venture investors who have supported both startups.
In February, "Convercent" received funding of $10 million from firms such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, bringing the company's total capital to 47 million dollars.
"Glint" received 10 million dollars in November from "Bessemer Venture Partners", which resulted in the total capital of the company was 60 million dollars.
These investments are hardly surprising if we take into account the interrelated nature of companies, culture and venture capital.
The growing volume of research shows that today's employees expect more from their jobs than they did before.
In markets with fierce competition, such as Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are just the minimum required.
Employees want to feel that they are accepted and valued, and that they devote their time to the company with a positive mission.
"When people are happy to work in a company, they feel they are heard, and the work they do brings results, they are more trying to make such a company a success," says Nina McQueen, vice president of global benefits and satisfaction Employees in the company "LinkedIn", where both "convercent" and "Glint" are used.
Investors receive income when companies in their portfolio are doing well; Companies are doing well when employees are loyal and involved.
If third-party analytical tools promise to increase loyalty and involvement of employees, it is not surprising that they find support.
According to culture specialists in the workplace, it is important to have data on involvement staff.
But the data is useless until the company's trustees take action.
In fact, if a company asks employees about feedback, it can give the impression that changes are coming.
And if the change does not come quickly enough, or does not come at all, frustration can develop, and employees will lose interest.
"If you're going to ask for 4000 offers, you should be prepared to hold 4000 talks," said Russell Rath, president of Kotter International's management consulting firm, who had to see how companies make a mistake Too relying on data collection.
"Because if you don't go to the end, the staff will guess," Did you really hear me?
Do you care?
And if you don't care why I shouldn't care? "
According to Jerrett, Madison Reed, which now conducts monthly employee surveys, is able to take action on the same day that someone reports a problem with "Glint".
And, after collecting feedback from employees who were unhappy with the speed of decision-making and the quality of communication, she was able to reorganize several teams within the company and introduce a communication training to solve the problems.
Ruby Tuesday gets new knowledge about its employees and hopes that in the long term this knowledge will help it to better retain its employees in the industry, known for high turnover of personnel.
"If you do not try to create a culture of transparency, you will lose people," Vitrano said.
If you lose people, you lose customers.
And if you lose customers, you lose the company.

In Barnaul took drastic measures to eliminate the cause of the failures of asphalt on the avenue Krasnoarmeysky.
The place where twice there were pits on the recently asphalted carriageway (crossing with street youth), it is decided to "open".

This is reported on the official website of the regional capital.
The Bruins team has to deal longer because the National Student Sports Association has canceled the training twice a day.
The time is approaching eleven in the evening; A crowd of football players from the University of California in Los Angeles is delayed to chat on one side of the team's new training fields located on the campus.
Some of them pulled their T-shirts, exposing backs, shiny from sweat after the intense first day of the sports camp.
For many team players, these minutes of idleness make a break in the middle of the day.
The players recorded for the summer classes will go back to the dormitories after the newest training to prepare for the final exams, and the next morning return to the Wasserman Football centre for meetings in 6:30.
Shortly before Monday turned on Tuesday, Bruins team coach Jim Mora said: "In the next three days these guys are waiting for a meat grinder."
The fact that the National Student Sports Association canceled the training twice a day, which was invented to reduce the load for the players, actually extended their working day – at least until the end of the exams on Friday.
So the beginning of the first three trainings at the University of California in Los Angeles was scheduled for 7:15 pm to fit into the already tight schedule of players.
The side effect of the absence of two workouts per day has been a greater number of days with one training, and Bruins moves the camp start for almost a week compared to last year and conducts training during the summer school for the first time in six seasons Mora in Westwood.
According to the schedule, they will hold 18 training sessions until August 20, inclusive, before starting the official preparation for the first game of the season against the team at the University of Texas A&M in September.
Mora said he supported the change of rules by the National Student Sports Association, despite the fact that he had another point in the tight schedule of the players.
"For three or four days we give them this huge load, it is a serious test," Mora said.
"And they just overcame it, they work, they are wonderful guys.
I think that when we get to the Sabbath and we will have more time, it will be really cool. "
When the camp is over, the University of California in Los Angeles will make the training closed; This is not an easy task, as its fields are in direct visibility from the adjacent parking and from the nearby "Laskin-center", an expensive hotel, which has already been bombarded by football balls, power a protective net behind the gate.
Players from "Bruins" must take the hotel from this weekend, but Maura admits that when rooms are free during the season, a problem may arise.
"We will have security," Mora said.
"This is a serious problem, and I'm not exaggerating the danger, suggesting that someone can rent a room, sit there and record training on video.
If you have a videotape workout, it's very serious.
But we will have security there and there will be security in parking number 8.
We'll do whatever we can with what we have.
I'm not going to worry too much about it.
We have a plan. "

Facebook amplifies fact-cheking in the fight against fake news
Facebook will more often send texts suspicious to hoaxes, independent experts, and show their findings under original posts, said Thursday the world's largest social network, which is trying to fight the so-called fake News.
In a statement on its website, the company stated that it was starting to use improved machine learning algorithms to recognize possible hoaxes, to send them for review, and possibly to show the results of the fact-Chekinga under the original post.
Facebook has been criticized as one of the main ways to spread the so-called fake news, which, according to many, influenced the U.S. presidential election in 2016.
This issue was also actively debated in Europe after the French voters were misled by false reports before the presidential elections in May, and in Germany before the tragic elections expressed support for the plan to penalize social Networks if they do not quickly remove posts that hate hatred.
On Thursday in a separate statement in German, Facebook reported testing a new fact-Chekinga algorithm that was launched in the USA, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
"In addition, to see which messages are challenged by independent reviewers, people want to have a broader context to make informed judgments about what they read and what they share,"-wrote in her block Sarah Sue, news Feed manager Facebook.
She added that Facebook will continue to test the "related articles" feature and work on other changes in the news feed to solve the problem of fake news.
Create a novel-comic: One castle in English history
In the recent past, the tiny castle of Scotney was filmed in the music video "Squeeze", and in the 1970s and 1980s served as a haven for Margaret Thatcher.
But 700 years from his cozy place in the valley of the River Bjul in Kent, he watched the turbulent history around, and now inspired Jamie Rhodes, Jorkshirca with shock hair and with a penchant for historical documents, on the novel comic.
"I think it's so beautiful to look at the handwriting of a man who died 300 years ago," he says enthusiastically.
"You feel it so personally when you hold this letter in your hand."
"Castle in England" covers the period from the Middle Ages to the Jevardianskoj era and tells about the families who lived in Scotney; Each story illustrated one of the young British artists-Isaac Liankevich, Briony Mae Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabelle Greenberg.
This is not the first book of Rhodes, which is based on archival data: In 2014 he wrote "The Teeth of a dead man and Other Stories"-a collection of materials of documents of the British Library; This project suddenly touched him to the bottom of his heart.
"I could just touch a fingerprint on the edge of a letter written in the 1700-1980s by a double agent working for Jacobite," he says.
"It's his fingerprint."
And the letters always smell like smoke, because in those days the lights were lit.
And in 300 years, in the future, you think you're there too.
Oh, how I love archives! "
For a person covered by such a passion for old papers, get support from the National Foundation and the English Texbook Council and live in the castle for four months ("Frankly, I'm a little zagostilsja there") seems too good to be True.
Rhodes spent days studying the "new" Victorian castle, walked through the archives and considered numerous treasures of the estate and ancient things-for example, the heads of hyenas on the walls or bottles, centuries lain in moat.
He walked through the park and the ruins of the old castle, talked to wardens, gardeners and sometimes with artists who worked on illustrations to his book.
Then at night he "drank whiskey and sat down to write."
The history of Scotney Castle is not very much studied, because the National fund got full access to it only in 2006 when the last heiress, Elizabeth Hussey, died.
When Rhodes arrived in ten years, the staff were only beginning to deal with the archive, which he described as "what the aristocrats piled to the attic for centuries."
Diaries, letters from the British Empire, maps showing who owned what: "You think land disputes are boring," Rhodes says, "but here's the birch that two families fought for.
It happens so, guys! "
In some of the stories of the collection, the castle becomes the starting point for broader research in English history: for example, in the "worker", the hero leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant revolution of 1381 years.
"There is evidence of a riot that took place in the castle in the year 1380, in a book called" The Knights of Kent and Sussex, "says Rhodes.
"The peasant uprising began in these places, and I thought the riot was a good start.
Maybe they were connected? "
Other subjects are strongly related to the history of the castle-for example, "Priest", which tells about a Jesuit priest, whom the family Darrelov seven years hid at home during the English Reformation.
or "smuggler", about the 18th-century smuggler Arthur Darrell, who is believed to faked his own funeral, with stones in the coffin (this was discovered a few years later when the coffin was dug).
Darrely-The favorite family Rhodes of all that inhabited Scotney: "Gentlemen, it seems, were perfect zhulem, always therefor into debt and spend money on something that could not afford.
In different generations men-darrely solved their problems with debts, marrying wealthy elderly women-I imagine them as a company of cute guys who are able to care for the heirs of large states. "
After finishing work at the castle, Rhodes is looking for other opportunities to get a unique writing experience.
He lived two weeks in the Finnish wilderness, where he wrote a graphic novel about Jeljamjanmjaki-a place where in the early XX century was a sanatorium, and then it grew again forest.
But Scotney remains a special place for him.
"I was sad to leave," he says.
"I felt like this: damn it, I have to go back to real life again."
Fifteen largest banks choose "Russia"
The conflict in the Association of Russian Banks (ARB) is developing: Following Sberbank, VTB, VTB-24, Alfa-Bank, Gazprombank, Rosselkhozbank, Binbankom and FC "Discovery", seven more credit organizations are going to leave this public organization.
Thus, at least 80 percent of the market will be on the share of the ARB organizations.
But this is not just a way out-all the banks, declared about the break with ARB, are negotiating with another public organization, uniting credit Institutions-the Association of regional Banks "Russia", which is headed by a well-known politician Anatoly Aksakov, Chairman of the State Duma Committee on the financial market, recognized, by the way, on the results of the last session and the most effective leader of the Duma committee and deputy on the number of drafted bills.
The beginning of the conflict within the ARB was the subject of discussion in the Council of the Federation, when the Interregional Banking Council considered new bills, in particular, implying a new classification of banks depending on the size of the authorized capital .
Garegin Tosunyan, the president of the ARB, said that the association believes that this bill is adopted in the interests of the largest banks, which thus try to limit the opportunities of small and medium-sized banks in the regions, intercepting their clientele.
Among other claims was the criticism of the central bank, which, according to Tosunjana, does not always justify the withdrawal of licenses from some banks, which, however, was followed by an objection from the representative of the CB: many managers police Banks, in particular, Vneshprombanka, were included in the governing bodies of Arb.
Apparently, this exchange of mutually exclusive opinions in a very sensitive to relations with the main regulator of the banking environment and became a visible reason for the fifteen largest banks, declaring disagreement with the policy of ARB, began to prepare for the entry into Association "Russia", noting that "the efficiency of ARB Nahoidtsja is low, and constructive dialogue within the banking community is not actually carried out".
Investors will be better
What's the deal going to end?
We will answer at once to the main question which arises at the slightest failure or conflict in the banking sphere or near to it: Investors are not threatened, rather, on the contrary, reliability of the banking system would increase.
The head of "Russia" Anatoly Aksakov, known for his scrupulosity in all that concerns the interests of banks and their clients, a high-level professional, which is highly valued in leaner: almost all the management of the central Bank is present at the annual Activities of the Association, and all significant legislative initiatives of the regulator pass through expert evaluations of "regionals".
In the personnel and organizational plan, obviously, there are also no special shocks.
Undoubtedly, ARB gets into a complicated financial and management situation after losing such powerful and influential participants with their contributions and lobbying opportunities.
However, in this oldest-established in 1991-organizations that defending the interests of the banking community, there is considerable potential to continue to improve the banking legislation and the sphere of monetary circulation in general.
It is impossible to say that in the association "Russia" with open arms are ready to accept on any conditions new members, judging by the reaction of its leader, Anatoly Aksakov ("Maybe too much will want"), which is still on July 21 at a briefing in the press center Parliamentary newspaper said that "just the next day representatives of the ARB banks asked me to consider the possibility to build up the potential of our association" Russia ".
Their proposals are to strengthen the voice of bankers in the Association Council, as well as to pay more attention to new banking technologies.
Now there is a negotiation process, the proposals of both sides are being studied, the agenda of the Extraordinary Congress of the Association is being prepared, which will be held in Sochi in mid-September within the framework of the International Banking Forum.
We'll define it there.
Also Anatoly Aksakov, emphasizing that "for the chair does not hold," called the possible new head of the updated association "Russia" Georgy Luntovskogo, who leaves in September the post of deputy chairman of the central bank, highly describing his Business and human qualities.
On August 18, Anatoly Aksakov, who is currently resting in the Crimea, plans to suspend his vacation for one day and to come to Moscow for an extraordinary meeting of the Council of the Association "Russia", where it is planned to consider the agenda of the Extraordinary Congress of "Russia".
Arrival of petrol engines in major cities of Russia will not be limited
Deputy head of the ministry Nikolai Asaul said that, contrary to media reports, the entry of petrol engines into major cities in Russia will not be limited.
This is a more radical form of our concept.
Our concept is that it is necessary to gradually raise the ecological class.
And there's a concept to go straight to zero emissions.
I think that technically we are not ready for this.
The question is still: from what year?
It's such a phrase at the level of slogans-let's ban.
Where and when?
Tomorrow?
Will we close the whole city?
"In 20 years-I don't know, maybe it will happen," Prime Minister said.
Earlier the newspaper "Izvestia" reported that by August 17 Deputy Prime Minister Arkady Dvorkovich was charged to study the proposals on possible variants of insufficiency electric transport, presented to the Government of CEO of PJSC Kamaz Sergei Kogogin.
Among the proposals, according to the newspaper, is the use of engines in large cities and resorts.
Washington changes the rules of getting green.
According to the media, President Donald Trump said that a new U.S. immigration plan will be adopted to change the rules for obtaining green.
The plan envisages a reduction in the number of legal immigrants to 50 000 a year, stricter rules for obtaining temporary work visas and restrictions on obtaining family visas.
The new rules are proposed by the Republican Party and supported by the President.
The bill will be discussed in two chambers of Congress.
"This law will reduce poverty, raise wages and save billions of dollars to taxpayers, and do so by changing the way the US gives out to green citizens of other countries.
The law will reduce chain migration and replace the existing scheme.
The new application process will provide benefits to candidates who speak English, have the money to support themselves, and have the skills that will benefit our economy, "Trump said, according American media.
The appearance of sex robots is real and it should bother us
No sooner had we thought that 2017 could no longer be worse, a new report on technological advances in the production of sex robots.
Yes.
The sex robots are now in the spotlight.
The Responsible Robotics Foundation (FRR) has recently released a report on the development of sex robots in the next 5-10 years.
According to Noel Charcot, the honored professor of Robotics and artificial intelligence of the University of Sheffield and the co-founder of FRR, we must take their appearance seriously.
Users will be able to choose the eye color of robots, nipple shape and type of nails.
"People giggle about this, but firms are already sending them to consumers, and soon we will see them much more," said Charcot at the presentation of the new report.
Modern sex dolls have evolved from their inflatable fellows in robots with silicone skin, warm to the touch, and with almost human replicas controlled by artificial intelligence.
Users can also "customize" their robots to their liking by choosing everything from the eye color and the shape of the robot's nipples to the shape and color of the nails.
But the fact that many robots have "personality", compared to which Stepford wife would seem very progressive, worried even more.
Modern sex dolls have turned into robots with silicone skin.
For example, the firm "Realbotix Robot" allows users to configure in robots the qualities that they find attractive-for example, shyness.
There are still sex robots Roxxxy Gold, developed by "True Companion", which come with already programmed individuality-for example, "cold Farr" makes an impression shy, and "Wild Wendy" has a "bold" character.
"Roxxxy Gold has a character that perfectly suits your",-enthusiastically reports the site "True Companion".
So she loves what you love, doesn't like what you don't like, and so on.
She's changing her mood during the day, like a real man!
She may want to sleep or chat, or she may "be in the mood"! "
In the appearance of sex robots is a lot of concern-not least because they replace real human relationships-but the most disturbing is the subordinate image of women, associations with rape, which causes mastering Cold (read: resistant) faro.
On the site "True Companion" Roxxxy compared to a vibrator, only for men.
"If a woman (sic!) Maybe a vibrator, why men can not be roxxxy? "-said on the site.
But these sex robots are not just fetishes or just new sex toys.
Their appearance and increasing complexity points to something darker and deeper in our culture, a retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards the desire for sex with submission as an optional additive.
Most men, of course, will not buy sex robots, and although FRR notes their growing popularity, they remain at the periphery of consumer culture.
But what is being conveyed to us from the periphery can be very instructive about the meaning of the epoch in which we live.
And many people are not bad or aggressive until the free market gives them the opportunity to do so.
It's not a coincidence that these complex sex robots emerged just when women's rights around the world were threatened when the White House had a president who was praised for being a woman.
The worst thing about the maids ' story is not the symbols, the twisted bodies and the extruded eyes, but the extent to which the vision seems realistic.
The Republic of Gilead is an exaggeration, but now it does not seem so big.
The purpose of the sex robots industry is to achieve such physical likeness to real women (only with proportions of pornstars), which allows the technology.
Their creators want them to appear to people by touch to copy the movements of the human body.
But it is their "characters" that robots do not look like real women.
They can not break up with their partners or leave them.
They have no life, no biography-nothing that could point to independence or something else that could destroy the illusion of full dependence.
In other words, they are beautiful slaves.
Or, as they say in 2017,-maids.
A native of Los Angeles, Eugene (Pooh) Jeter, who has been playing for Ukraine since 2013, will not help our national team at the European Basketball Championship, the final part of which starts on August 31.
The general manager of "blue-yellow" Andrei Lebedev told about it in an interview to the portal Bebasket.
We tried to negotiate with Jeter, but unfortunately he won't come for family reasons.
We will go to EuroBasket without naturalized player, because we do not want to take someone we do not know.
"This situation will provide opportunities for the development of our young players," he said.
Recall: With the direct participation of the Jeter team of Ukraine took a record for itself sixth place in EuroBasket-2013 and first hit the World basketball championship, which "yellow-blue" failed to overcome the group stage, and a native of the United States was recruited in Average for the game 15.4 points, did 3 rebounds and gave 5 gear.
Jeter stopped playing for Ukraine since the resignation of the head coach of our national team, American Mike Fratello, fled this position in 2015.
Men's EuroBasket-2017 will be held simultaneously in four countries: Turkey, Romania, Israel and Finland.
Ukrainian team will hold their matches of the group tournament on the promised land.
In group B, Evgeny Murzina's wards will have five fights: Germany (August 31), Italy (September 2), Georgia (3rd), Lithuania (5th) and Israel (6th).
As part of the preparation for the tournament, our men's team held two control fights, in which they lost to the Dutch and Belarusians.
Trump's Great feat?
Portraying yourself Mita Romney seems very sensible
In the era of Trump, the common place was the fact that political disputes poljarizovavshieing the American electorate at the micro level broke some families.
Between Thanksgiving and Christmas, American newspapers Pestrili columns on how to deal with the terrible relatives voting for Trump.
I think we're all tense so soon pop.
Less talk about Trump's ability to connect families.
I'm writing about this because my cousin, left-winged poet from Chicago, who had long been on the knives with the Republicans in her family, came to visit me in New York this week.
It reminded me that unification in the fight against a common enemy can have a strong effect.
With Trump at the White House, everyone she knows, including the Republican brother with whom she has been arguing about politics for decades, is suddenly and strangely on the same side.
At supper it is undoubtedly good; But I can't help thinking that in a broader context it can be quite dangerous.
Trump breathed forces into the left flank, but the deforming effect of his reign could move us all to the right.
When we talk about Trump and "normalization", we mean unlikely the possibility that one day we will stop hitting his antics.
There is, however, an even more questionable scenario in which Trump "normalizes" the most right-wing Republicans who, against the backdrop of his standards, will suddenly appear to be a model of common sense.
I caught myself on that very much miss today on the old-fashioned madness of Mitt Romney-with the dog on the roof of the car and the 14 percent income tax (but we at least knew what his tax return looks like)-compared to Trump and both seem very A little evil.
When Trump leaves, the next Republican candidate will be enough to just be in his mind to see a huge step forward.
When my cousin went to the center, we went with the kids to the carousel in Central Park-the biggest carousel in the Department of Parks of New York and the best way to spend three dollars in the city, if you do not need caffeine.
Horses are formidable and huge, pictures of fiberglass on the central drum-grimasnichajushhie clowns and animals, which, affably, in horror look at their back-extremely sinister, and ringing music, oddly enough, delights.
So many famous things in this city disappoint: the views from the skyscrapers become obsolete, the silhouettes of buildings are too boring to cause awe, and the reality of the city does not have time for a dream.
Thirty-five years have passed, and I'm still going through the day when I found out that the Suisse-cottage area is not really a Swiss chalet ("Ye Olde Swiss Cottage" themed pub), but a large roundabout in north London.
A carousel in Central Park is still an unusual, magical place in which a child of two years, a child of eleven years and two women over forty can have a great time.
If I could put the carousel on the score, I'd bet the top five, but luckily no one asked me to.
And in a department store this week I was asked before to spend a card on the terminal, to estimate the "experience" of purchases on a scale from one to five stars.
In the coffee shop on the corner of my street all the same plus the option to accompany the evaluation tip of 15 percent-it's for the order at the counter.
As a result, not only is the neutral interaction slow, but it is also necessary to make a personal attitude to a situation that does not imply it.
The poor saleswoman at the confused department store smiled while I was tired of judging my experience of giving her a five-star credit card.
Oscar Pistorius transferred from prison to hospital because of chest pain
Pistorius leaves prison because of a visit to the doctor for the second time.
Last year he was transferred to a hospital for the treatment of cuts on his wrists, which the prison administration claimed he had received as a result of a fall in the cell.
Pistorius was convicted of manslaughter after an appeal by the prosecutor's Office for an initial sentence for manslaughter murder.
He killed Steenkamp early in the morning of Valentine's Day in 2013, shooting it several times through the door of a toilet room at his home in Pretoria.
Pistorius stated that he had taken his girlfriend for a night thief hiding in his closet.
The prosecutor's Office has announced the intention to submit another protest, this time against a six-year term Pretoriusa, which, she said, is too lenient.
The Office of the Prosecutor General stated that it would appeal to the South African Supreme Court and the appeal would be considered this year.
The term of Pretoriusa may increase by 15 years if the prosecutor's office succeeds.
There is no capital punishment in South Africa.

Russian MFA accuses U.S. vice president of Cold War rhetoric
Statements made during the European Tour of U.S. Vice president Michael Pence were criticized by the Russian MFA.
"We regret to state that Washington is getting deeper into the primitive ideological stamps of the cold War, which are completely disconnected from reality,"-said in a statement of the Russian Foreign Ministry .
So in the Ministry reacted to the words of the pence about the "Russian threat" and attempts to forcibly reshape the borders, he said in Podgorica.

Gregory LEPs: "I charging in the fight, although 55-not 30"
One of the most prosperous artists of Russian variety Grigory LEPs will celebrate its 55 anniversary in the nearest Sunday.
Before the celebration, the singer talked to the "Izvestia" browser.
I remember how your "Poltinnik" was celebrated.
Special tent in "Luzhniki", Gloria Gaynor sang for the birthday boy, a powerful salute over the Moscow River.
You must be figured to spend your next five.
Are the plans fulfilled?
If we talk about the profession, it was a good period.
I worked a lot, went on tour all over the country three times, gave 120-130 concerts a year.
Released two decent albums.
Of course, now I'm not the one that, say, 20 years ago.
The biological clock is not deceived.
Singing the way I sang in my 30s is getting heavier.
Nevertheless, I charging into battle, I do not want to stop.
I think I'm on a different level with new people.
With them you and the new album recording, the first in three years.
Yes, he's going to work on him now.
Actually, we have already recorded everything in my studio and now we will send it to the station in Los Angeles.
It's called "Are you so serious?" by the song of the same name, which is written in conjunction with Timati.
She's not quite ready yet, so we're not going to laid her yet.
We'll do it later, when the clip is filmed.
And we will present the album in November-to a series of my Jubilee concerts in the Moscow "Crocus City Hall".
The cool American drummer Chris Coleman to your new plate.
You seem to want him and your tour squad to draw?
In my opinion, Coleman today is one of the most outstanding drummers of the world.
He came to my studio, recorded his games.
I offered him to join my group, and Jeremy Kolsonu (a famous drummer involved in various projects.-"Izvestia") suggested.
But for long-term work in Russia they put forward, to say the least, excessive conditions.
It was about fees from €35 thousand. Up to €45 ths. Per month.
Then I thought that in the post-Soviet space dig worthy musicians.
And found a great drummer Max Malysheva.
Generally better to feed their (smiling).
At times I want to one of them to fault, and not for what.
For example, guitarist Fyodor Dosumov is highly quoted at the international level.
He is written by Western music magazines and invited to various guitar festivals.
Steve Wai, listening his game, said that "a new generation of guitarists, with other performing techniques, has come."
Your album comes down in Los Angeles, American musicians cooperate with you, but you still can't come to the USA?
Trying to lift that ban?
Now, frankly, I'm not doing anything.
There are a number of lawyers who deal with this issue.
As a musician, I really sincerely wish I could get to America.
I've said more than once that I'm studying there.
The more you communicate with real professionals, the more useful.
We don't dumber them, but we don't have that kind of school experience.
Before our performers of popular music for 70 years did not put the tasks that were always decided by American musicians.
They aspired to the highest quality sound.
And I'm trying to follow the same principles.
Now for some reason, Britain has refused to enter my entry for ten years.
But I'll still be applying for a visa to the British embassy every year, so that I will be allowed to go there again, and the most important thing is to work there.
The rest of Europe treats me favorably.
And in August you are planning a concert in Monaco, not a custom, but a poster, right?
Yes, there's a nice sporting hall in Monte Carlo, I've been there once.
Now we are invited again, and as far as I know all tickets for the concert are already sold out.
On the "Rendezvous Limes Vaikule", which will begin on July 20 in Jurmala, you go?
She invited me, and I certainly responded.
Lyme is a wonderful singer and gorgeous woman, competently to submit herself and wonderful vocals, and even a whisper.
After the tour and Jubilee concerts, as far as I know, you want to turn to the work of Vladimir Vysotsky.
Two albums with his songs in your discography already have.
When will the third be released?
Probably next year.
But it will be completely differently made.
I want to record about 80-90 songs Vysotsky about the same serve as he did.
Only the voice and the guitar.
No other arrangement.
Accompany to me will be our famous musician Timur Vedernikov.
I will try to attract Alexander Yakovlevich Rosenbaum to participate in the album.
I loud with him, we have a good relationship, but he's a busy man, so let's see how it goes.
You and Boris Grebenshchikov's songs gradually entered into your repertoire.
Maybe you can write an album of his things later.
Boris Borisovich is a wonderful man and a great musician.
I crossed with him several times and asked: can I sing one or another of his songs?
He answered, "Gregory, I write songs to be performed."
Please try, sing.
Probably, it is interesting and such album to write down.
As long as I have no such task, but in the future, in a year or two, if Boris Borisovich does not mind, I may make such a project.
If you don't concentrate entirely on the affairs of your producer Center.
I suppose, until you have realized its potential, did not sign contracts with all the artists that you are interested in?
There are a number of performers that I would have dreamed of having under my wing, but they are independent, held people.
You mean Sergei Lazarev?
Seryozha is a brilliant singer, I invited him.
I can disagree with his repertoire, but he is a professional and he has his own development strategy.
And in my center now there is Alexander Panaiotov, whom I led in the "Voice".
We signed a contract with him and we work.
In our pop music, such singers are rare.
It would be a pity if he didn't reach the heights he deserved.
I'm trying to pick up his repertoire, shoot clips.
I hope for a good result.
I also try to promote other artists of my center: buy them songs, pay to poets, sometimes their tracks fall in the rotation of TV and radio channels.
If they do not reach high altitudes, I will still bring our cooperation to a logical conclusion.
At the exit they will get a recorded album, several clips.
And then, if they want, they can go their own way, and I will not insist that they return the money invested in them.
Although I would be pleased if any of them would achieve commercial success and pay me the interest that we agreed on in the contract.
But if it doesn't, no one's going to cover the oxygen.
Let everyone work, make their way, prove how I once proved.
If tomorrow you will be offered to make a tour of Ukraine and guarantee entry into the country, you go?
I'm still invited there.
This is mainly closed events.
And as for the Big tour...
I am a man of my country, a Russian, on my own conviction flew to Syria on the same plane, which then crashed.
If tomorrow they say that it is necessary to fly to some other point in the interests of the State, I will fly.
And I don't care what bloggers and other critics think about me.
I sincerely regret that this situation happened with Ukraine.
Because I believe that we are one people and must be together.
I regret that this is unlikely to happen, at least in the near future.
And earlier I gave for a year in Ukraine on 40-50 concerts.
Met like nowhere.
Very grateful to the public.
And with several Ukrainian artists collaborated: Ani Lorak, light Loboda, Artem Loikom...
Ukraine has a lot of gifted people, and it is sincerely pity that now they can not fully splash their talent to a wide Russian audience.
Music should unite and entertain people.
I would gladly invite some cool Ukrainian artist to Russia, for example, the glory of Vakarchuk, and made a joint concert with him.
But, I think, at the moment it is unlikely...
Andrei Okhlopkova was thrown from the cosmodrome
As it became known "Kommersant", technical director of the Cosmodrome East Andrey Okhlopkov started to work in the state space research and Production Center (Khrunichev) named Khrunichev.
Previously, he was de facto engaged in the construction of the Vostochny Cosmodrome, but due to disagreement with the management of the center of operation of the ground and space infrastructure (Tsenki) was transferred to the enterprise in Moscow Fili, where he will coordinate production .
Mr. Okhlopkova will not have a changer: The post of technical director is likely to scrapped, and the functionality is displaced by subdivisions of Tsenki.
That the technical director of the Eastern and deputy general Director of Tsenki for technological development Andrei Okhlopkov went to work in the Khrunichev named Khrunichev, "Kommersant" told the top managers of several enterprises of the space industry, as well as Employee of the government office.
"He has been working in a new post for several weeks," Kommersant's interlocutors said in the industry.
It was not possible to get an operative comment of Tsenki on Thursday, and Mr. Okhlopkov was not available for comments.
However, the information "Kommersant" officially confirmed in Khrunichev.
He decided to move to the position of Director of production coordination,-said at the enterprise. -Andrey Okhlopkov the task set before him to provide a start-up minimum for the first launch on Baikonur East fully complied.
Mr. Okhlopkov went to work in Tsenki in 2013, having served in the space forces, in particular at Baikonur, and in Plesetsk-at the "North" Baikonur held the post of the first deputy commander in the rank of colonel.
In 2009 Andrei Okhlopkov became the defendant of the criminal case.
The investigation accused him of bribery: ostensibly from his submission regional businessmen were received for kickbacks of orders, but did not fulfill the taken obligations on cleaning of separated parts of rocket carriers in Arkhangelsk region and the Republic of Komi.
In 2012, the jury pleaded not guilty.
The responsibilities assigned to him in the tsenki for technological development were extended to different projects, but the main one was the construction of the cosmodrome in the Far East.
The head of the federal Space agency Oleg Ostapenko in an interview to "Kommersant" directly said that the state of affairs on the eastern "was critical already in October 2013".
The fact that the planning was a strategic mistake: the completion of the construction and the first launch of the Soyuz-2.1 launch vehicle were planned for the same time-the end of 2015.
To implement the start up to the end of the year, to finish the construction decided six months earlier and the terms shifted from December to July 2015.
To speed up the process had to go to the trick: Experts Tsenki began to conduct parallel installation of technological equipment on unfinished objects.
The main proponent of this idea was Andrei Okhlopkov.
Despite the existing risks and still happened transfer (instead of December 2015 "Soyuz" flew only on April 28, 2016), this idea has justified itself, says the source of "Kommersant" on Baikonur: "Otherwise we would not have implemented a single launch from the East, and would be engaged in construction. "
Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin, charge the creation of the Cosmodrome, jokingly called Andrei Okhlopkova his "Cosmic susaninym", but he almost always requested information about the construction.
It was remembered by Mr. Okhlopkov and directness: for example, in an interview with "Kommersant" he proposed to deprive the federal agency for Special Construction (Spetsstroy) of the status of the sole executor of the eastern and to work directly with subcontractors: "Why should we All eggs fold into one basket Specstroja? "
This idea has found support in the government.
Since 2017, Tsenki has assumed the duties of general contractor to complete construction and installation works at the starting and technical complex in the fourth quarter.

"It was decided that it would be better for everyone," says one of the top managers involved in the erection of the east.
A staff member of the government, in turn, calls the decision strange: "He was one of the best experts to find him equivalent replacement will be difficult."
According to "Kommersant", this is not required: the position of technical director of the Cosmodrome will be abolished, and its functions will be scattered by subdivisions of Tsenki.
In music schools there will be a program of training of two specialties
In the future, students of children's music schools will be able to receive two specialties at the same time.
According to the deputy Director of the Department of Science and Education Ministry Svyatoslav Golubenko, for this it is possible to reread to students repetitive disciplines, and the question with payment of other classes on the second speciality to solve with the help of special grants, RIA Novosti reports.
"The Ministry of Culture has taken this issue to the control, and we together with the expert community will develop a mechanism that will allow to master two specialties, but at the same time would not contradict the current legislation in the field of education,"-said Golubenko.

The head of state admitted her question very urgent and promised to help.
17-year-old Russian got detained on wall on a skyscraper in Mexico
In Mexico detained 17-year-old Russian Kirill N., who climbed the wall on the roof of a high-rise building, reports the portal El Universal.
The incident occurred in the capital city of Mexico.
The young man with the help of two unknown men climbeded through the ditch fence on the territory of the complex of office buildings of Nestle and independently climbed one of his towers.
At the same time he did not use any special equipment, insurance and ropes.
Detained the young man already on the roof.
Employees of the Ministry of Public Security have lowered him to the ground by helicopter.
He was then sent to the National Institute of Migration.
There they find out if the young man is lawfully in the territory of the country.
Meanwhile, the video with the young man, climbing on the skyscraper, became popular in the network.
Users named the young man "Spiderman".
As the media writes, such experiments are a hobby for him.
Red meat, dairy products and chocolate can help ease the GCS.
Red meat and chocolate are considered a nightmare for your digestive tract.
But recent research suggests the opposite: a diet rich in meat proteins and dairy products can help relieve the symptoms of those suffering from inflammatory bowel disease.
This incurable disease, which affects approximately 1.3 million people in the United States and 300000 in the UK, leads to colic and bloating, chronic or bloody diarrhea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
Usually to mitigate symptoms patients are advised to avoid meat and dairy products, but researchers from the University of Washington found that the main amino acid protein tryptophan promotes the production of immune cells that increase Bowel tolerance.
The lead researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that the immune cells in the intestines ensure that the harmful microbes coming with food do not penetrate the body.
Cells that can trigger an inflammatory process are balanced by cells that increase tolerance, protecting the body while not damaging sensitive tissues.
If the equilibrium is too severely disturbed in the direction of inflammation, it can lead to inflammatory bowel diseases.
Experiments have shown that mice having a certain bacterium in the intestines, appear increasing tolerance cells.
And this bacterium needs tryptophan--one of the building elements of protein--to trigger the appearance of these cells.
Professor Colonna said: "We have established a link between one type of bacteria-Lactobacillus reuteri-which is part of the normal microbiome of the intestine, and the development of a population of cells that increase tolerance.
The more tryptophan contained in the nutrition of mice, the more these immune cells they had. "
He suggested that the same would work for people: the combination of L. reuteri and a rich tryptophan diet can contribute to a more tolerant and less prone to inflammation in the intestines.
Postdoc Dr. Louise Cervantes-Barraganvas, studying the variety of immune cells that increase tolerance, found that one group of experimental mice had these cells, while another group that belonged to the same line, but contained separately, did not Was.
She suggested that the difference could be caused by the mikrobiomami of the gut mice-communities of bacteria, viruses and fungi that usually live in the gastrointestinal tract.
The DNA cells of the mice were sequenced, and six species of bacteria were found in mice that had immune cells but were absent from mice without them.
Mice grown in a sterile environment, had no good microbiome and did not developed this type of immune cells, received L. reuteri, and the immune cells they have appeared.
To understand how bacteria affect the immune system, researchers raised L. reuteri in a liquid environment and then transferred small portions of liquid-without bacteria-to nedorazvivshimsja immune cells, separated from the mice.
The immune cells have turned into cells that increase tolerance.
When the active component was separated from the liquid, it turned out to be a byproduct of the processing of tryptophan, known as indole-3-lactic acid.
When researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in food mice, the number of these cells increased by about 50 percent, but when the level of tryptophan was halved, the number of cells also dropped twice.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explains that people have the same tolerance-enhancing cells as mice, and most of us have L. reuteri in their gastrointestinal tract.
It is not known whether by-products of tryptophan from L. reuteri the development of cells in humans as in mice, but in people suffering from inflammatory bowel diseases, defects in the genes associated with tryptophan were found.
She says: "Perhaps the development of these cells should be strengthened, because the inflammatory processes on the inner surface of the intestines depend on these cells.
High levels of tryptophan in the presence of L. Reuteri can potentially lead to the expansion of their population. "
According to José Mourinho, Manchester United has hired a "genius" in the face of Nemanja Maticha
Manchester United has hired "genius" in the face of Nemanja Maticha, said José Mourinho after the midfielder made his debut in the match against "Sampdoria" on Wednesday evening.
The player, purchased for a 40 million pound from Chelsea, began with a 2-1 victory in Dublin in the last pre-season match of United before the UEFA Super Cup match against Real Madrid on Thursday and played the role of midfielder, while the players Like Paul Pogby and Andreas Pereira broke forward whenever they please.
However, as Matić did not take part in Chelsea's preseason tour of Asia, he seriously lacked preparation for the game, and he survived only 45 minutes, which, according to Mourinho, needs to be finalized before the start of the Premier League season.
"He needs time, but his experience, his mind, his genius in the way he thinks, he thinks of football," Mourinho said.
"We will help him prepare sooner rather than later."
As well as Matić, his new players Victor Lindeljof and Romelu Luka started playing at the stadium of Aviva, when Mourinho began to form his main lineup by the beginning of the next season.
The newspaper "Independent" reported this week that Mourinho wanted to hire three more players, but emphasized that the club had already achieved fantastic results, hiring three of the four players whom he would like to hire in the first place.
"I am grateful to the club for having extracted three of the four," he added.
"I will be happy even more if they get me four out of four, but they have already tried very hard for me."
Former leaders of the Social Democrats of Lithuania persuade them to stay in the ruling coalition
Former presidents of the Social Democratic Party of Lithuania, former prime ministers Algirdas Butkevičius and Gediminas Kirkilas, as well as the former speaker of the Sejm from the Social Democrats Cheslovas Jurshenas appealed to the teammates to stay in the ruling coalition.
As the "parliamentary newspaper" reported, due to friction with the partners-the Union of peasants and the "green"-the Social Demokraticheckoj party initiated a discussion, whether to remain in the ruling coalition.
And here are three senior experienced comrades addressed to teammates with an open letter in which, in particular, it is stated: "It is clear disappointment of friends on a party results of elections, however the coalition with" peasants "has created for us not very easy, but all The same conditions for the further implementation of social justice goals, which are under our initiative envisaged in the government program, and to maintain the political dominance of the left centre over the right parties. "
According to the former leaders of the party, the debate has "prevailed an emotion-based expression of opinion without specific arguments."

The defense, in turn, appealed the decision of the first instance in city.
Bip to prepare a report on ecology for the President
The final "Forum of Actions" of the all-Russian Popular Front (BIP) in 2017 will be devoted to environmental issues, the source in Bip told "Izvestia" and confirmed the head of the Executive Committee of the Movement Alexey Anisimov.
According to him, according to the results of the Forum "veterans" plan to prepare a report to the President on the problems of domestic ecology, as well as propose a strategy for their solution.
The interlocutors of "Izvestia" in Bip note that the report of the head of state will contain "deep analytics" on the situation in all federal districts of the country.
According to "Izvestia", the final BIP Forum will be held in autumn.
The exact date of its holding has not been determined-as a rule, it adapts to the schedule of the President, who is the leader of the movement and traditionally present at the key events of BIP.
The front held several interregional environmental conferences, one for two federal districts in Rostov-on-Don, Kaliningrad and Kirov.
The final will be a conference in the capital of the Republic of Buryatia Ulan-Ude.
On the basis of the proposals that have been made and will be expressed at these events, we form systemic proposals to solve environmental problems,-told "Izvestia" interlocutor in Bip.
Co-Chairman of the central staff of the movement Olga Timofeev, head of the State Duma Committee on Ecology and Environmental Protection, said that "veterans" will inform the head of the country about the work carried out in the framework of the year of ecology in Russia.
The final environmental forum and the "Action forum" Bip are likely to be combined.
During the year we grew up as a powerful team of experts in the field of environmental problems, saw gaps in the legislation, stopped dozens of violations of the law.
All this will be included in the report, which we prepare the President as the leader of our movement.
In addition to this document, "veterans" is also deducted from the work on priority projects Bip, "Olga Timofeev told the News.
According to her, Sergey Ivanov, Special Representative of the Head of State on environmental issues, ecology and transport, will be invited to the forum.
Earlier he took part in the work of Forum Bip, which was held in St. Petersburg in April.
In a few months, the year of ecology will go into history, and the most important thing to do today is to launch environmental protection mechanisms so that they will work for many years.
That these questions should not be dropped from the agenda,-added Olga Timofeev.
The head of the laboratory of Regional Policy of the Expert Institute of Social Studies (Jeisi) Andrei Kolyadin noted: raising ecological problems, BIP acts in the direction of the presidential agenda.
Many things they as experts have offered in various forums, and these initiatives have received the support of the president,-Andrei Kolyadin told "Izvestia".
He stressed that the economic potential of the environmental agenda could not be excluded today, which could give the regions an additional impetus for development.
In the future, with the help of BIP regions will be able to lobby not only the solution of their environmental problems, but also the development of ecotourism,-the expert added.
The relevance of environmental issues was demonstrated by the "Direct line" with Vladimir Putin in June.
In particular, the president was asked questions about the landfill in Balashikha (already closed) and about the coal dust in the port of Nakhodka (already drafted a bill to ban the open transshipment of coal in human settlements, one of the authors-Olga Timofeev).
Experts in the field of ecology believe that the legal basis for the solution of environmental problems in Russia as a whole is created, the question is the further enforcement practice, as well as the position of civil society.
We need a clear implementation of the decisions taken by the state,-said Leonid Bochin, head of the charitable foundation "Ecology for All".
Member of the HRC, head of the NGO "Greenpeace Russia" Sergey Chicks in a conversation with "Izvestia" underlined, that for successful decision of ecological problems the responsible approach of the society and business is necessary, some legislative efforts are not enough.
As soon as the society and business realize that the solution of environmental problems is a much more profitable step in the strategic perspective, the situation will change,-said Sergey Chicks.
The expert stressed that it is necessary to reverse the tendency that violation of environmental legislation is a cost-effective solution for business.
British inventor Vzhivil himself a microchip to get into the house and the car by sweep hands
The British inventor became the first person in the country to have a microchip installed, so that he could open the door of his house, go to the office and even start a car with a simple wave of his hand.
Tridcatitrjohletnij Stephen Northam Vzhivil himself a tiny chip between thumb and forefinger and now through his firm "biotech" offers this service to companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives at the expense of technology.
He teamed up with Dr. Jeff Watson, an anesthesiologist from the Royal in Winchester, taking care to ensure that the implantation procedure was conducted in accordance with medical standards.
The technology is similar to a microchip that implanting cats and dogs, and the procedure takes only 30 seconds.
The company Northam also replaces locks in houses and machines with chip compatible at a price of 300 pounds for one lock.
The married father of one child has already installed the technology in his home and in his car "BMW Z4", which turns up when his hand is on the handlebars.
White House props to taxpayers in thousands of dollars
According to the military records given to the TIME magazine, the decision of the White House last month to drive a marine infantry helicopter to the South Lawn for an event dedicated to American industrial production cost taxpayers Whole 24 000 dollars.
The white-green Sikorsky VH-3d, known as the "Marine One", when the president is on board, has become a central element in the White House's July 17 event, which showcased American construction programs.
President Donald Trump, vice president Mike Pence and top officials of the White House inspected technological products from all fifty states.
The helicopter, produced in Connecticut, was exhibited next to a yacht from Maine, a fire truck from Wisconsin and a forklift truck from Mississippi.
According to the records of the first squadron of Marine helicopters (HMX-1), the department responsible for helicopter management, the White House military authority ordered the presence of a helicopter in a private order, or "Frago", just 36 hours before The helicopter landed on the South Lawn on the occasion of an "unusual" event.
"I just wanted you to be convinced that you are aware of this, because it is an unusual event widely illuminated in the press," wrote Commander HMX-1 in an e-mail to his boss, the first Deputy chief of Aviation of the Marine Corps, the day before Events.
The letter indicated that the helicopter would arrive on the South Lawn at about 7 a.m. on 17 July to attend an event scheduled for 3 p.m. and remain there until the lawn was vacated between 6 and 9 p.m. on the same day.
The letter adds that if the departure from the White House is delayed, a second crew will be required for the return flight in accordance with the restrictions on the working hours.
The first crew accompanied the helicopter during the event and the security officers remained near the aircraft while it was on the ground.
It remains unclear from the records received by TIME magazine whether the second crew was required.
The Hatch law prohibits federal employees from using state property for political purposes.
According to the records, HMX-1 clarified whether the action contradicted the decision.
"Among other things, we asked if it was a violation of the law hatch, and we were told that there is no," the commander wrote.
"It seems that you have nowhere to go," the deputy head said.
The "Made in America" event was declared a White House as an official event, and the hatch law was not distributed to it.
But even official events have political notes.
During the event, the President made efforts to advance the reform of health, which was at that time in the development of the Senate, and praise attempts to regulate government regulations.
The use of aircraft known as "Marine One" and "Air Force One" for political purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.
Presidents are instructed to use them for travel.
But to request them solely in the interest of photoability is unusual.
Trump was already the subject of discussions in February, when a presidential plane drove in the background during his first pre-election rally in Melbourne, Florida, and his Twitter account was inundated with complaints about the use of the presidential Aircraft by its predecessor.
"The White House is delighted with the" Made in America "show, which showcased products from 50 states made by American workers from American materials," said deputy spokesman for White House Lindsay Walters.
The HMX-1 crews often carry out training flights around the Washington metropolitan area and on the South Lawn to train the president of the United States in the White House with an accuracy of up to an inch.
When Trump was at the G-20 summit in Germany in early July, HMX-1 held 58 training landings at the White House.
According to one of the officials, the flight performed for the event "Made in America" was counted to the crew in the account of necessary training flights for a month.
The unit's helicopters that day also flew 11 additional hours as part of the "Nonpresidential support Tasks".
According to the White House, the taxpayers did not cost any of the other exhibits presented at the event.
The representative of the company "Sikorsky" reported that the company did not participate in the organization of the helicopter demonstration on the South Lawn.
HMX-1 does not account for the budget for presidential flights, and it is difficult to determine the exact amount spent on the event.
But, according to the hourly rates of the Ministry of Defense for 2017 fiscal year, the rate of reimbursement of the Ministry of Defense for VH-3d is 24 380 USD per hour of flight.
In the records of the unit, it was recorded that the time of the aircraft in the air amounted to 30 minutes in each direction from its base airfield on the aviation base of the Marine Corps Quantico in Virginia.
The White House claims that the real cost of using a helicopter is much lower than this rate.
"Calculating the value for taxpayers based on the approximate rate of reimbursement is totally wrong," Walters said.
"These approximate rates include personnel, services and many other irreversible costs that are included in the annual Assignirovanija."
According to a study conducted in 2015 by RAND Corporation, the rates of reimbursement do not include the cost of the personnel, but indeed take into account the cost of fuel, services and expenses specified in the contract.
At the time, a former White House spokesman, Sean Spicer, spoke in defense of the helicopter's use for the event.
"The idea is to demonstrate this week the things made in America," Spicer said.
"And I know that Sikorsky and Connecticut are very proud of the fact that they are contributing to national security, and that there are, I guess, hundreds, if not thousands, of people whose workplace depends on it.
And I think, like most Americans, that we are all proud of this helicopter and other military equipment that has been relentlessly workeded by so many Americans.
So, of course, it is quite appropriate to pay attention to this. "
It was unclear whether Trump was interacting with the helicopter while viewing the southern lawn during the event, but he was definitely sitting in a driver place in a fire truck.
Inside the White House, Trump appealed to the representatives of the company "Sikorsky", joking with the press on the theme of his own fleet of products of the company.
"I know Sikorsky well," the president said. "I have three of them."
Moscow to allocate grants for resuscitation departments of city hospitals
Annually the grants "saving lives" will be allocated to resuscitation and intensive care units of the metropolitan Medklinik.
The funds will be directed to encourage doctors and nurses.
The mayor of Moscow Sergey Sobyanin visited the city Clinical Hospital named Yudina.

Sergey Sobyanin also told about the decision to allocate annually to resuscitation and intensive care departments of city clinics grants.
The funds will be directed to encourage doctors and nurses.
According to the capital mayor, the clinical hospital named Yudina is one of the largest in Moscow today.
In recent years, the clinic has received new modern equipment, allowing its doctors to carry out unique operations.

The total area, occupying Medklinikoj, is 23.7 hectares.
In February of this year clinic became a participant of the pilot project on the organization of Short-term hospital (UPC).
They are designed for relatively small operations.
In the process of surgical interventions, advanced medical equipment is used to significantly reduce the time of rehabilitation of patients.
After surgery in the hospital they spend only a few hours.
Only in the first half of the current year in the clinical hospital named Yudina was provided stationary medical 36 thousand patients.
Medical staff of the clinic performed 15800 operations of varying degrees of complexity.

Federal Antimonopoly Service of the country in accordance with the decree of the Government of the Russian Federation "on amendments to the rules of the wholesale market of electric power and power and in the consolidated forecast balance of production and supply of electrical energy (power ) within the framework of the unified energy system of Russia on subjects of the Russian Federation "(from 17.07.2017 G. № 842) has established indicative prices for electricity and power for industrial consumers of the Republic of Buryatia.
As a result, the cost of electrical energy for Buryat producers decreases by a quarter, which will greatly facilitate the life of small and medium enterprises and individual entrepreneurs.
For many decades, the leaders of the Republic obivalied the thresholds of Moscow offices in vain attempts to equalize the region in tariffs with the neighboring Irkutsk region with a cascade of hydro-power plants on the hangar flowing from Baikal, the main catchment area for which is Buryatia.
And only this year began the movement.
In March electricity tariffs for the population of the Republic were reduced from 4.24 rubles/kwh to 3.93 rubles/kwh, or by 7.3%.
With the inclusion of Buryatia by the decision of the federal government in the list of areas of the wholesale market price zones, for which the peculiarities of the functioning of wholesale and retail markets are established, the turn of industrial consumers has come.
According to analysts, this is only the beginning, as the population of the Irkutsk region pays for kilowatt/hour 1.01 rubles.
But nobody dares to name at least an approximate date of new tariff shifts downwards for buryatia.

But wasn't the football world warned about this possibility three years ago by the president of PSG?
When Manchester City expressed interest in hiring Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser al-Khelaifi a strong warning to any club that would like to lure one of PSG's best players.
"I'm not worried because they know that if they're touched by one of our players, then we're going to go against them, we'll make suggestions to their players," al-Khelaifi said.
"We treat all clubs with respect.
But if they try to recruit one of our players, they are waiting for the consequences. "
Apparently, Barcelona crossed this line when the Spanish club earlier this summer expressed interest in the midfielder Marco Verratti.
PSG has made it clear that he will not release the Italian team player under any conditions, and now, probably, Barcelona feels the consequences of his offer in the form of loss of one of his valuable players, Neymar.
