Russian President Vladimir Putin has signed a law introducing administrative liability for violation of the term and order of payment of goods (works, services) in procurement for state and municipal needs.
This law is intended to solve the very acute problem of non-compliance by customers in the implementation of state and municipal procurement.
Two years ago, the situation when entrepreneurs could not get payment on already executed state and municipal contracts was widespread.
At the same time, the President of Russia instructed the Prosecutor General's Office of the Russian Federation to take the problem to special control.
Because the businessmen themselves could not cope with unscrupulous customers who entered into unfunded contracts, tried to evade their payment obligations and included illegal conditions in the contracts.
The problem was systemic in general in the country.
Since 2015, in the interests of protecting the rights of entrepreneurs to receive payment on public orders, the Public Prosecutor's Office has made 9.7 thousand submissions, as a result of their consideration, 4.5 thousand officials have been brought to disciplinary responsibility, to the administrative - 533, 75 materials have been submitted to the investigative bodies for the organization of procedural inspections, 46 of them have been brought criminal cases.
As a result, the debt to entrepreneurs in the amount of more than 66 billion rubles was repaid.
And these huge sums were not accumulated as a result of the non-payment of multibillion-dollar contracts.
There have been numerous, systematic delays in the payment of services to entrepreneurs for much more modest amounts.
Here's a characteristic case.
The head of a small company won a competition to provide social transportation services for several million rubles.
The person invested all his defense funds, fully fulfilled the obligations, but the money was not received in time.
The result is a growing financial coma from debts on wages, taxes, loans that would lead to bankruptcy if the entrepreneur did not seek help from the prosecutor's office.
Now, in a number of regions, the problem has been reduced as much as possible.
Nevertheless, as of the first half of 2017, the total amount of debt under state and municipal contracts, identified by the prosecutors of the subjects of the Russian Federation, amounted to about 27.4 billion rubles.
In regions where debt ratios continue to reach critical levels, the prosecutor's office operates under manual crisis management.
The Prosecutor General personally holds visiting meetings with representatives of the local authorities, where all the violations uncovered by the prosecutors and the measures to eliminate them are dealt with in a substantive manner.
Such operational meetings this year have already been held in Yaroslavl and Yekaterinburg.
The implementation of Federal Law No. 189-FZ "On Amendments to the Code of Administrative Offences of the Russian Federation with regard to the establishment of administrative responsibility of the officials of the customer for violation of the term and order of payment of goods (works, services) in the execution of purchases for the provision of state and municipal needs," which was signed last week by the President of Russia, will be able to improve the payment discipline of public customers.
The draft law was developed by the Ministry of Economic Development of Russia on the initiative of the Prosecutor General's Office.
The new law will supplement the Code of Administrative Offences of the Russian Federation with an article which provides for a fine of 30 thousand to 50 thousand rubles for violation by the customer's official of the term and order of payment of goods, works and services in state and municipal procurement.
And if an official has already been subjected to administrative punishment for a similar offence, he will be disqualified for a period of one to two years.
All prosecutors of the constituent entities of the Russian Federation have already been instructed to ensure the application of these legislative provisions in practice.
Civil rights group announces travel warning in Missouri
The National Association for the Progress of Color People has issued a warning for colored people traveling to Missouri because of the state's discriminatory policies and racist attacks.
The group's statement sounds like: "A warning to the traveling National Association for the Advancement of Color People, valid until August 28, 2017, encourages African-American travellers, guests and citizens of Missouri to be particularly attentive and exercise increased caution when traveling across the state in the wake of a number of dubious racist incidents recently occurring across the state and brought here."
According to the National Association for the Progress of Color People, the announcement of a warning on the movement of the group prompted a recent law in Missouri that made it harder for people to win discrimination-related lawsuits, and that state law enforcement agencies disproportionately chose minority targets.
"You have people being subjected to human rights violations.
They are stopped on the roads because of the color of their skin, they are beaten and killed, "Rhode Chapel, president of the National Association for the Progress of the Color People of Missouri, told the Kansas City Star.
'We hear complaints often like never before. '
This is the first warning of its kind announced by the organization in relation to the state of the United States.
The group cited incidents such as the humiliation of black students on racial grounds at the University of Missouri and the death of twenty-eight-year-old Tory Sanders, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died in suspicious circumstances earlier this year after he ended up with gasoline during a trip across the state, and Missouri State Police arrested him without being charged with a crime.
The warning also mentions a recent report by the Missouri Attorney General's Office that the likelihood of being stopped on the road for black drivers is 75 percent higher than for whites.
"The purpose of the warning is for people to be aware of the situation and warn their relatives and friends and colleagues about what might happen in Missouri," Chapel said.
'People should be prepared in one way or another, whether they will take money with them for bail or inform relatives that they are travelling across the state. '
According to the latest data from the FBI's hate crime reporting program, there were 100 hate crimes in Missouri in 2015, making the state sixteenth in the state by the number of such violations.
The travel warning is also a response to a new Missouri law that would make it more difficult to bring a case against a legal entity for housing or labor discrimination.
Earlier, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) announced warnings for traveling across Texas and Arizona after those states passed new immigration enforcement laws that required local law enforcement to arrest people for violating immigration laws, which the ACLU said was supposed to increase the number of race-based checks.
Travel warnings are usually issued by the State Department for other countries, but public organizations have recently resorted to this measure in response to certain laws and trends within the United States.
Two people killed in shooting on police patrol in Egypt
Unidentified men fired at a police patrol in the Egyptian city of Isna, Reuters reported, citing Egypt's Interior Ministry.
During the shootout, two people, including one police officer, were killed and three people were injured.
All of the wounded were taken to hospital.
According to the agency, police stopped the car, after which two armed men in the car opened fire on law enforcement.
One of the attackers was detained, the second managed to escape.
Rochism backs law to abolish free baggage for non-refundable air tickets
Oleg Safonov, the head of the Russian Academy of Sciences, said in an interview with the RBC TV channel that he was "positive" about the adoption of the law on the abolition of free baggage allowance for non-refundable air tickets.
"It is necessary to create conditions under which a person who does not have baggage can buy a ticket cheaper than the one who has baggage," he said.
At the same time, Mr. Safonov noted that despite the concerns of citizens, it would not be necessary to pay for the transportation of top clothes and a mobile phone in hand luggage.
"It would be right to reassure all our citizens and tourists and to declare it, to say that it is to the top clothes, to the umbrella, to the mobile phone, to the apes or even to some computer the relationship will not have," the head of Rochism said.
Earlier, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a law providing for the right of airlines to exclude the rule on free carriage of baggage on non-refundable air tickets.
It's about airlines being able to determine the number of seats and the weight of baggage included in the non-refundable fare themselves.
Vladimir Putin instructed to eliminate Baikal pollution
Russian President Vladimir Putin said at a meeting on the protection of Baikal that significant areas of the lake have been subjected to extreme pollution in recent years.
He instructed to identify sources of funding, plans and performers to eliminate pollution.
Mr. Putin has also commissioned a full-fledged recultivation of contaminated areas.
"It is necessary to deal with the objects that continue to work here, the treatment facilities of most of them are worn out," RIA Novosti quoted the president as saying.
He also added that the Russian Attorney General's Office should conduct an audit to identify environmentally harmful activities.
He said there were problems in the Lake District due to the emergence of natural dumps and a number of environmental violations by holiday organizers.
"I want to emphasize this: Not all in a row to check, here too the measure needs to be known, but it is - illegal and environmentally harmful activities and take appropriate measures," he stressed.
Earlier, the Prosecutor General's Office reported a reduction in fish stocks in Lake Baikal and proposed an increase in the number of facilities subject to environmental supervision.
On June 15, Vladimir Putin stated in a direct line that it is necessary to change the legislation to ensure the rights of citizens living in the natural territories of the special protection regime.
The residents of Olkhon Island, which is part of the Baikal Natural Territory, were informed about the problems with the economic activity.
The head of the Ministry of Nature, Sergei Donskaya, immediately proposed to solve the problem by clarifying the boundaries of the Baikal water protection zone, but the Buryatia government reminded that such a change is not enough because the restrictions are related to a range of regulations.
Earlier, the Ministry of Economy proposed to solve the problem by changing the Land Code and the Law on Environmental Protection.
A new temple will appear in Maguire
Members of the community from the indigenous peoples of the North "Rakhtynya," together with the residents of Berezovsky district, take part in the construction of an Orthodox church in honor of St. Nicholas the Wonderworker.
Its location is the river shore, the temple will be well visible from afar, so it will serve as a travel beacon for fishermen.
According to the community representatives, construction works will be completed this year, domes are now installed, church bells are available.
The Igrima REB of the fleet provided transport support.
The temple is named after St. Nicholas the Wonderworker, as it is revered by the Orthodox Church as a patron of putters, including fishermen.
At the same time, fishing gives the settlers work and feeds them.
Locals wait for the temple to open its doors, and children even write in school writings about it as local attractions.
Disneyland with the death penalty.
Why does Singapore comply with the laws?
I talk to local businessman Chang, sitting in an outdoor eatery.
Commenting on the situation in Singapore, Chang smokes one cigarette after another.
After the end of the conversation, the businessman goes to the nearest urn - up to it a hundred meters - and throws the bulls there.
The fine for rubbish in a public place is $500 local, Chang reported.
You know, I've just had a reflex since my childhood: You can't throw a fantik from the candy on the bridge, instantly fine.
And now there is a video camera in general.
And indeed - Singapore's sidewalks in the city centre are clean, as if in a museum.
Chang tells: Three months ago, his neighbor's 18-year-old son painted a wall of an old colonial building.
The court found the guy guilty of vandalism and sentenced to flogging.
What?!
Imagine.
He received ten blows with a wooden stick on his buttocks and spent a week in prison.
It is not uncommon for us to have corporal punishment at all.
As Singapore combines the highest standard of living and unbelievably harsh laws, the "AiF" columnist has been dealt with on the spot.
Here, no one is thinking of abolishing the death penalty, "explains lawyer Victor Lee Adams.
And the government has long lashed out at the views of both the European Union and the United States on this.
If a person carries a large batch of drugs or trades them - he is put on a viseface.
In 2002, a 22-year-old Australian citizen was detained at Changi Airport, carrying 400 grams of cocaine.
He was defended by the Australian prime minister, threatening sanctions, international human rights defenders and even the Pope.
However, the guy ended up hanging out anyway.
After that, the drug couriers of our country diligently go by the side.
The point is: In Singapore, laws are required to comply with ALL in a row, not just modest and non-rich people.
It doesn't matter who you are - a millionaire, a deputy prime minister, a well-known artist or a resident of the European Union.
The option in this case is one: If you find half a kilo of cocaine, you will be hanged.
When you walk through Singapore and the Pentagon meet the plates with a bunch of warnings, it's easy to give a diva - how many bans in this city-state!
For example, chewing gum is sold only in pharmacies, and you can buy it strictly according to the doctor's prescription (!).
The tourist on arrival will not take away the harness, but it is worth gluing the "rubber" in the subway, will get a fine of 1 thousand local dollars.
In four days, I met two people with white plates on my neck: "I'm muscular."
In addition to the fine, they are often sentenced to a "link to the palaces": A week to clean the parks and beaches.
6 thousand rubles is paid by the "criminal," who has forgotten to flush the water in the public toilet, and when trying to correct a small need in the apartment building a special detector works - the doors are blocked and a signal is sent to the police.
Among the very exotic laws are bans on feeding pigeons on the street, public performance of songs and even excessive watering of a room plant (!): It is believed that an abundance of water attracts the mosquito.
To avoid fires, smokers cannot wear lighters in the subway, otherwise they will be fined 5,000 Singapore bucks.
In general, there is a thought: No matter how old, it is necessary to break something.
That's not the case at all, "Mohamed Kabir-Kadjaria, the owner of a local travel agency, tries to reassure me.
Particularly fantastic laws exist only on paper, and over the last twenty years I have not seen someone attracted for their violation.
Why do they persist?
For citizens not to relax.
The observance of the basic rules is strictly observed.
Say, if a minor is sold in a cigarette kiosk, everything along the chain will be punished: The store owner will pay a huge amount, the abuser himself will get hit with sticks at the "back," and the seller will also be kicked out and jailed.
It is thanks to such harsh laws that offences are very rare in Singapore.
Is this justified?
Back in the seventies, we had chaos on the roads - motorists ignored traffic lights, traveled as they wanted, sat drunk behind the wheel.
After the introduction of fines for the year, everything calmed down.
Now the driver, drinking a portion of whisky, knows: If stopped, the policeman will not let go for a bribe, impose a fine in the amount of the cost of the apartment and for years will go behind bars.
To many foreigners, the city-state in Southeast Asia seems like a kind of concentration camp.
In 1993, the American writer William Robertson called Singapore "Disneyland with the Death Penalty" - a guest from the United States horrified by the universal wealth of residents, a "frighteningly clean airport" and "cultural nature."
To be sure, such things are unnatural, look artificial, and so in principle should not be.
The first days in Singapore and it is true to be afraid to throw paper on the pavement, you stumble if you went to the subway with ice cream.
But then you come to the area of "Little India," and suddenly - "breaking the template": The bus stop rolls plastic staples.
"And how is that?" You wonder.
And so, "the Singaporeans grinned.
Everything happens.
Not for every such "crime" will fight on the spot, however you have to know: If you are calculated, you will not give up - after all you have broken the law.
More often than not, it is enough for a person to behave normally.
Of course, power in Singapore is quite authoritarian.
But you know what?
In Vietnam's Ho Chi Minh City, I moved very carefully - motorcyclists often grab smartphones and cameras out of the hands of tourists.
The centre of Paris is full of dirty bombs and beggars.
On our streets, too, not everyone is trying to brush the trash in the urns.
Singapore, thanks to a set of draconian fines and ruthless (up to the death penalty) laws, has become the quietest, cleanest and safest city on Earth.
You think.
Such is the human nature: Remember, and in Russia no one stared at the wheel until they began to sanction.
Although the main thing in Singapore is not fines, but voluntary compliance with the laws.
And one should think, we in Russia people would also be happy with the clean streets, the lack of rubbish in the subway and would welcome the arrest of those who confuse the elevator with the public toilet.
Here's corporal punishment - thank you, you don't have to.
Otherwise, Singapore's laws are at least worth watching.
Nothing holy?
Now the Trump White House has targeted the Statue of Liberty.
The most reliable sign of regime change is when it starts to fight the statues.
Americans understand this no worse than everyone else - hence the deliberately theatrical demolition of a statue of Saddam Hussein in Baghdad's Neptune Square in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the Trump government's key ideologues, no doubt knew what he was doing when he curtain a symbolic axe over the Statue of Liberty during a fierce dispute with CNN journalist Jim Acosta about the president's proposals to dramatically reduce legal migration.
Let's be honest, Miller didn't attempt the statue itself.
A crawl of pleasure-boat owners and artists depicting the Statue of Liberty would lynch him if he tried to do so.
But he attempted her meaning, and especially the meaning that was attributed to her in 1903, 17 years after the monument was completed, when Emma Lazarus's poems were added to the pedestal.
As Miller grumbled at Acosta: "I don't want to go deep into history here, but the Statue of Freedom is... a symbol of American freedom that oozes the world.
The poem you're talking about was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty. '
Miller correctly set out the facts, but as he himself said, it's not really about history.
It's about the current sound of the startling words of Lazarus, the only one in which the state invites not any immigrants, but the poorest: "Your tired, your poor, / your crowds dreaming of sighing freely, / Unprivate releases of your abundant shores."
Never before have "unhappy releases" been so visible on our screens.
Miller wasn't doing literature - he made it clear that in Trump's America, these people aren't waiting.
This dispute about the meaning of the statue is part of a broader political and cultural war: It's really a dispute about the sense of America.
Lazarus - and her friends, who were afraid to place her words on the statue's cap after her death - understood very well that they were committing an entirely political act.
The sculpture was intended to mark the connection between the French and American republics with the help of a banal classical figure - the female image of Liberty.
Lazarus changed her meaning: In her poem, the female figure is no longer abstract, she has a voice.
And she got a completely different name: The mother of the Exiled.
The connection of poem and image was a brilliant feminist move and a crushing attack against American nativism.
And how Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, right though to change it back.
The outspoken Rush Limbo, the sort of John the Baptist who heralded Trump's arrival, argued in 2010 that Liberty was not inviting anyone, rather she was an early neo-conservative, bearing the flames of America lying in the darkness of the world: "Freedom goes forward.
It carries the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
The torch is not needed to illuminate the path in the United States. "
Against the usual Limbo here really got to the point.
The meaning of the statue depends solely on the angle of view.
Lazarus's great creative achievement was to see her as she would be seen by the exhausted, unhappy but hopeful people on the decks of ships after a long and often heavy sailing.
It means literally looking at the world through the eyes of people who seek refuge and a chance for a better life.
Her statue answers them with the words of hope and hospitality they dream to hear.
And, of course, that's not the prospect that Miller and Trump will ever want to acknowledge.
Their torch is needed not to illuminate the path, but to incite hatred, which is the only source of their power.
World Cup 2017: Neil Blake appreciates the Scottish members of the UK national team.
Eaton Doyle recalls a time when there were only two Scots in the UK national team
Neil Blake, game director of the UK Athletics Federation, said the 16-man Scottish part of the national team at the World Championships would make a "significant contribution to the team's game."
A record number of Scottish light athletes have been selected for the 2017 London Championship starting on Friday.
Blake believes that something special is born in Scotland and the UK Athletics Federation should take this into account.
"We know this and are trying to understand and will support as long as they have the potential," Blake said.
'i've spoken to people at the Institute of Sport Scotland and they think it's due to what they've done.
The Scottish Athletics Federation thinks that with what they've done, it's got to work.
British Athletics Federation: With what they've done, it's got to work.
And people on the street think the same way.
I don't know why the circumstances so developed, but it's absolutely brilliant. '
Some of the Scottish Athletics are claiming medals, including Laura Mür and Andrew Bahell - who will rival Sir Robin Farage at a distance of 5,000 metres; and Eign Doyle's team have chosen their captain.
"Eign is modest.
Her captain's speech was magnificent, "says Blake.
'Many light athletes, whether Scots they are or not, and from where they live or train, have come out of this room feeling proud and determined to win.
The passion and sincere feelings that Eaton put into her were remarkable. "
The Commonwealth Championship silver medal holder, who will run the 400m distance with hurdles at his fifth World Cup, says the 16 Scots in the British national team are "unbelievable."
The previous record for the number of Scots in the World Cup was seven, in 1983 and 2005.
Ahead is Laura Muir, who specializes in running mid-distance and beating five British and two European records last year.
It will run for 1,500 and 5,000 metres.
Chris O'Her, who will be involved in the 1500m race, is another Scotsman worth paying attention to: Behind his back he has a successful season in which there were victories in the British national team's qualifying competitions and in the Annual competitions.
Doyle recalls his first World Cup when, apart from her, the only Scotsman in the team was Lee McConnell.
The team captain says she is "incredibly proud" that so many of her compatriots have not only entered the national team but in some cases will claim medals and struggle to reach the final.
"The captain of the national team is chosen by other members of the team, so it was a huge honor anyway, but to know that your comrades voted for you and you were chosen is a very special thing for me," she added.
'of course I'm very proud for all the Scots who have entered the national team.
It shows how much we have achieved.
And they are all accomplished athletes who will strive to get on the podium.
And as for my captain's speech?
Yeah, I think she was not bad.
I just drew attention to the fact that we were very lucky to take home the World Cup.
So it's just about how important it is to get support from the fans and take advantage of what we will be at the Olympic Stadium again.
I've got another chance to go out to his arena and take part in competitions, and the atmosphere there is going to be just wonderful. '
Blocking critics on Facebook: Don't have to be nominated for public office unless you're willing to listen to criticism from voters
The founder of our country understood what a critical press is.
Americans loved George Washington, but that didn't prevent them from criticizing him for everything from domestic politics to his political principles.
The criticism of him, of course, was annoying.
But he didn't shut his mouth to his critics.
Because back in 1783, Washington said, "You can take away the freedom of speech and us, deaf and dumb, will lead as sheep to slaughter."
I will now move on to Maryland Governor Larry Hogan, who should try to be more like Washington.
Hogan's subordinates blocked and erased the posts of a minimum of 450 people who expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page.
And this week, the American Civil Liberties Union sued him for it.
The governor's subordinates called the lawsuit negligible, and the comment on the internet was written in the spirit of "well and what."
"It's just Facebook," many will say.
But it's also important.
And that's especially important when it comes to a Hogan-type guy.
He is a surprisingly popular Republican governor in a Democratic-dominated state.
He is second in the approval rating among the country's 50 governors.
Hogan is not an uphill reactionary.
He has shown a firm hand in managing the state and a commitment to his principles.
He also lovingly enjoys Facebook as a primary way of communicating with his constituents and with jokes demonstrates on his page his ski after chemotherapy head.
So blocking people who come to the governor's page - which is claimed as an official public forum and conducted by administration officials on taxpayer money - is unnecessary and ultimately harmful.
In an interview with the Washington Post, spokeswoman Amelia Ches defended the governor's actions, arguing that blocking comments was simply their moderation.
But it's too easy - to use the image of trolls, spammers and heiters vicious on the internet.
"The Post" spoke to some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.
And it is the real people, not the trolls, - the teacher, the businessman, the pastor, who turn to their elected leaders.
They all say their comments were respectful, meaningful and not rude.
The pastor cited the Bible, appealing that Hogan was a Catholic.
Lakshmi's lawyer, Sarma Raman of Bowie, Maryland, did not express hatred but asked about hate crimes.
"I wrote a polite comment that I am disappointed by the lack of his response to hate crimes and other recent news," she wrote in the comments section of the article in The Post.
'i also don't like the idea that when a lot of people leave comments on the same topic, some immediately say it's so-called nagging, instead of admitting to dealing with a large group of disaffected citizens. '
What the governor's subordinates call a "concentrated spam attack," others would probably call an "active life position."
In the Facebook era, it's easy to edit your image by simply blocking critics or styling negative comments.
It's a much less dusty job than it used to be when it required sending people, collecting and burning newspapers with critical front-runners or arresting and shaming protesters.
But that's exactly what's happening now, only in the figure.
Hess is not the first official to be criticized for not wanting to listen to Facebook and other social networks.
President Trump was sued by Twitter users who were banged on his Twitter account.
One of the first, swirling decisions on the topic was made this week in Virginia.
According to U.S. District Judge James C. Cacheris of Alexandria, the chairman of the Laudon County Supervisory Board violated the First Amendment by enlisting a voter in his Facecbook account.
And in Kentucky, Republican Governor Matt Bavin brought claims by the American Civil Liberties Union for his behavior on Facebook and Twitter.
It should not be that hard.
In the days of Washington, the era of affordable postal spending carried out about the same coup as the Internet today.
From 1776 to 1800, the number of newspapers grew four-fold, and the authors of anonymous letters severely damaged his authority.
And even then, Washington was dealing with anonymous trolls.
People under the pseudonyms "Juricola," "Lazarus," "Belizinger" and "Porcius" wrote letters to newspapers ridiculing Washington's decision.
According to historical documents compiled by the online George Washington Documents Project, his cabinet has been swamped by petitions criticizing his position on the Treaty of Friendship, Trade and Navigation.
But he didn't try to silence them.
Freedom of speech, dissent and speech lies at the very foundation of our state.
And true leadership means agreeing to that.
Ronan Rafferty hopes for household amenities at Renaissance club
Former European champion Ronan Rafferty is hoping for household amenities for the next three days when the Renaissance club in East Lotian will host the twenty-fifth open Scottish golf tournament for older athletes.
The Northern Ireland native, who was leading next door at the Archerfield Links club and moved towards the final round last year until he lost to Paul Ilsa, is attached to the new venue and serves as the tournament's representative on behalf of the club's founder and director, Jerry Sarvadi.
"I've seen the Renaissance club being built and we're seeing it come to success with this event," Rafferty said.
'the players will see this pitch at its best moment, it's in a magnificent state.
Jerry did a great job arranging this place.
He is a strong veteran of this game and is proud of his achievements here.
It's a great demonstration for this field. '
Englishman ILS is looking forward to the opportunity to defend the champion title for the first time, despite winning both the European Tournament and the European Challenge Tour in his 32-year career.
"It's a really special feeling," the Southport player said.
"I failed to try to re-win the Extremadura Open because it was removed from the schedule a year after I won it.
Going back to this corner of the world is magical.
It's a great place to play golf.
The memories of last year are back, and for me and my wife, Sheron was a completely special impression to win last year.
It was a really special time and we'll always remember it. '
Returns to fight on home soil Gary Orr joining the European tournament for older athletes after he turned 50 earlier this year.
The event will be his first appearance in public in Scotland since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
"When you play at home, it's always a bit more important," said the Helensboro Orr resident.
'you want to perform well, but you feel that extra burden. '
I was very happy to play again and I showed good golf.
I'm happy with how things get so far. "
On the pitch, this trio will be joined by former Masters tournament winner Ian Wushim and champions of the majors for older athletes Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark Mcnalty.
Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are two of the six Scots on the pitch; the others are Andrew Oldkorn, Steven McAlister, Bill Buckmuir and Kevin Drummond.
Participation in the tournament is free, and parking costs 5 pounds per hour if there is one person in the car, and 10 pounds if the person is two or more.
All proceeds go to the British prostate Cancer Foundation.
British roads will learn to absorb harmful emissions
Peculiar tunnels over highways capable of absorbing carbon monoxide emitted by cars are already being tested on UK roads.
The country's transport agency, according to Autocar, reported positive test results of a 100-metre tunnel installed on a highway in the north of the country.
The 6-meter-high tunnel is built of some state-of-the-art polymeric materials that can absorb harmful substances contained in car exhaust.
However, creating an entire network of such tunnels is only part of the sweeping measures the UK authorities are going to take to improve the atmosphere.
In addition to the network of tunnels, the British are going to expand the network of charging stations for electric vehicles, implement a number of measures to reduce road traffic, expand the use of commercial transport on electric traction and modernize the fleet of heavy trucks.
According to official statistics, a quarter of all air pollution comes from transport, and poor air quality causes up to 40,000 premature deaths per year.
Moscow City Court changed punishment of disabled Medvedev to fine
The Moscow City Court changed the sentence to a fine of 200 thousand rubles for a disabled man, Anthony Medvedev, who was sentenced to four-and-a-half years in prison.
This is reported by TASS.
Earlier, the prosecutor's office asked the court to replace the term with a conditional one, explaining its request that Medvedev's disease "prevents him from being found in prison conditions."
Anton Amiev, 28, was sentenced to four-and-a-half years in prison while serving his sentence in a general-regime colony for a robbery suffered by a former special forces fighter.
On July 19, a court at a retreat in the jail released the man from custody.
Poverty and Death in Indonesia's Golden Land
Preparing lunch, Bardina Degey doesn't use the stove.
She's even a pot enjoyed rarely.
In her wooden house in Enarotali, the capital of Paniai district in the rebellious Indonesian province of Papua, the housewife usually simply places the sweet potato, which is here called a "note," straight into the hearth.
Half an hour later, the curb tuber is delivered and eaten with impatient, unwashed hands.
Degey sits on the earthen floor - she has no furniture - and it is here that she does her housework, such as washing clothes with muddy water from a nearby swamp.
The cleaner serves as a bucket in a room without a roof.
She is the youngest of her husband's four wives, and so she was not instructed to work in the field.
Polygamy is common here.
Of course, working late can be dangerous: Many men from this village are unemployed, many drink, and there are soldiers.
"No one decides to walk around the village after five in the evening," she says.
It is a rare opportunity to look at daily life in the highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony that was joined by Indonesia in 1969 after a dubious referendum when only 1,026 elders were forced to vote, prickly raising their hands in front of occupying troops.
The existing pro-independence movement from the Netherlands quickly turned its anger against the Jakarta government, which retains tight control over the region, barring foreign journalists and human rights defenders.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua, and the independent state of Papua New Guinea occupies the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is a city as remote as it is abandoned; the road here includes a half-hour flight from Jayapura, the provincial administrative center, to Nabira, and then a five-hour shaking on a nasty car.
There is no public transport here.
The city, with a population of about 19,000, consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences; roofs of corrugated steel are painted with rust in a variety of loose shades.
There were few Indonesian people here, let alone journalists, and almost none of the foreigners.
Prior to the arrival of Christian missionaries, papuasa MEE Pago worshipped a god named Uga Tamee.
There were other changes.
"It was unusual for us to wear these clothes," Degey says, showing off his bright, hand-woven turban, dark skirt and bright shirt.
"We used to wear only leaves on the body."
Papua is Indonesia's poorest province, with 28% of its population living below the poverty line, and child mortality and literacy rates among the worst in Asia.
But it is still Indonesian gold land.
The world's largest and most lucrative gold mine, Sandberg, owned by Phoenix-based Freeport McMoRan, is just sixty miles from Paniai, a high-mountain province the size of roughly New Jersey, where 153,000 people live.
Freeport produced about $3.1 billion worth of gold and copper here in 2015 alone.
In addition, Papua boasts forest reserves valued at $78 billion.
These riches, however, entail one misfortune for the papuas, ensuring that Indonesia's powerful armed forces retain their suffocating presence here.
According to an investigation by The New York Times in 2005, between 1998 and 2004, Freeport paid nearly $20 million to local troops and units, including up to $150,000 to one officer.
Demands for greater autonomy on the part of the papuas threaten the existence of this golden gill and are ruthlessly suppressed.
Human rights activists claim that more than 500,000 papuas have been killed by Indonesian military forces since 1969, and thousands more have been raped, tortured and imprisoned.
According to the Asian Human Rights Commission, mass killings in the indigenous highlands of Papua in the seventies could be considered genocide.
Last year alone, Indonesian police arrested more than 3900 peaceful protesters in the region.
"We will lose everything," a report published in 2016 by the Brisbane diocese contains evidence of atrocities committed in the previous year, such as executions without trial, torture - particularly frequent, as alleged in another report, rape and electric shock - and the brutal suppression of peaceful demonstrations.
"It's hard to count the number of casualties because accidents take place every week," says Andreas Harsono, who is doing research in Indonesia for Human Rights Watch.
The nuts were delayed as Papua's resources attracted an influx of migrants from other parts of Indonesia.
The province's 3.5-milion population is 83% Christian, but demographics are changing as Muslim economic migrants arrive from the densely populated Indonesian islands of Java, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Yavan lavows, "varungi," sell fried chicken and a mixture of "Gado-Gado" vegetables served with peanut sauce.
Locals are trying to withstand competition.
"Migrants started in the traditional market to sell chicken and vegetables cheaper than the indigenous people of Papua," explains Abet You, a twenty-four-year-old Paniai native who moved to Jayapuru, the province's administrative center, because of work.
'Because of this, the indigenous people of Papua - the mum-mum (women) of Papua - have lost their sales market. '
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, known in the people as Jokowi, vowed to tackle inequality and rights abuses in Papua during his presidential campaign in 2014.
On his way to the Presidential Palace in Jakarta, the former carpenter enlisted the support of 27 of Papua's 29 districts, including Paniai.
But in Papua, almost nothing has changed and locals feel betrayed.
"Our hearts are broken because in 2014 we voted for Jokovi, expecting him to fulfill our hopes of restoring justice," says Yew.
In fact, just two months after the October inauguration, Jokovi Paniai survived the tragedy.
On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children were on the street and singing Christmas anthems at a bonfire in Enarotali when two Indonesian soldiers on a motorcycle pulled out of the dark.
Frightened children told them they should turn on the headlights.
According to local pastor Javedt Tebay, one of the soldiers offended their tone and returned with four soldiers after a while.
According to victims and eyewitnesses, soldiers who were drunk were chasing children and beating them with rifle butts.
Then one of the soldiers shot at a group of children.
One child, sixteen-year-old Julianus Eymo, was so badly beaten that he fell into a coma.
A couple of hours later, someone picked up the government building of the election commission, which was located in the city, and the next day the situation escalated.
About a thousand papuas men, women and children gathered on a football field in front of a local police station and a military command center to demand justice.
They brought with them ritual hunting bows and performed Wait, a dance of the papuas tribe MEE Pago: Ran circles and depicted bird singing.
Some protesters began shoving stones at the police station and military base.
"If the crowd resisted more than three times, shoot them," he said, according to an official document seen by TIME magazine correspondents, but which was not published in the local media.
Five-and-a-half-year-old Thamias Kayama, the head of the Kego Koto district in Enarotali, felt the danger approaching and called for calm, asking the crowd to disperse at home.
No one wanted to listen to him.
"When I turned, I suddenly got a bullet in my left wrist," he told TIME magazine, standing on the porch of his brightly painted wooden house.
Kayama still doesn't know who was shooting, but says the bullet came from the Shereng side of the assembled soldiers.
"There was a crowd, the shots were a lot," he adds.
Local resident Alfius Jouwa was hit three times, as his cousin, who witnessed the shooting, tells him.
"I ran up to him and examined his body to make sure it was him," Lowes, who, like many Indonesian, enjoys only one name, told TIME magazine.
"I saw he was dead... I kissed him."
Gen. Jotje Mende, PNG's senior police inspector, told the Remainers that his officers were merely "protecting" their base because it was being attacked.
"We must defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us," PNG police spokesman Commissioner Pujo Sulistiyo said in 2015.
'it's a matter of life and death. '
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and many more were wounded.
News of the killings reached Jakarta only the next day.
Three weeks later, Djokovi delivered a dull speech to Jayapi, expressing condolences to the victims' families and vowing to address the issue of historical abuses of power in Papua.
"I want this situation to be settled immediately so that it will never happen again in the future," he said.
In October 2016, Security Minister Viranto said he would establish a non-judicial organisation to end historic human rights abuses.
But almost immediately there were excuses.
"Most of the violations occurred a long time ago.
Some of them took place in the nineties or at the beginning of zero.
The fact is we definitely want to address these violations, but there are procedures that need to go through, "he said.
Viranto then retracted his words, speaking to TIME magazine on June 5 in Jakarta, and said he did not plan to establish an organization to deal with complaints in Papua.
Instead, he said, "everything will be decided through the court."
Viranto, who was accused by the United Nations of "crimes against humanity" over the deaths of more than 1,000 people during the bloody vote for East Timor's independence in 1999, said 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua had already been settled, including the Paniai incident.
The families of the Paniai victims met such statements with grim distrust.
"I have been asked four times in the last three years, but there has been absolutely no change," says Lowes.
"I'm tired."
He says that years later he still lives in fear.
"I'm scared," he says.
"I'm afraid I'm being arrested by the military, I'm afraid I'll be shot."
His brother Jacobus also expressed the opinion that the people of Paniai were afraid to discuss the incident.
He said he was beaten by the military after he helped bury four victims.
"After we buried the bodies, the military came behind me," he says.
The shooting didn't stop.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police shot at villagers in the nearby Paniai district of Deiai.
In a clash between villagers and a construction company manager who refused to help take a man unconscious to hospital, one person was killed and 17 others were injured, including children.
The man, twenty-four-year-old Ravianus Grove, who drowned while fishing in a flowing river, died on his way to the hospital.
Angry villagers protested in front of the convoy of a construction site owned by the company.
According to police, villagers shoved stones at the officers, who responded by firing warning shots.
But locals claim the mobile brigade (Indonesian special forces) began shooting at the crowd and killed one person.
"We were in such a panic, we are afraid of retribution," twenty-nine-year-old Dominggu Badia told TIME magazine, who lives near the hospital and seen hurriedly delivering the wounded.
"I hid at home for two days."
Deiai's parliament demanded that the officers involved in the incident be called to account, and the mobile police brigade withdrew from the region.
Netanyahu has always been a sick place for the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development causes resentment of the MEE, Moni, Dani and Damal tribes scattered throughout the green-covered central highlands of Papua.
Many have joined the Movement for Free Papua (OPM), a rebel army that claims to protect the rights of papuas by hosting sporadic attacks and kidnapping raids on Indonesian soldiers.
Some of OPM's top executives come from Paniai, including Tadius Yoga and Daniel Papadas Kogoya.
As a response in recent years in Paniai, thousands of people have been arrested and baselessly detained by the military under the pretext of "defending national independence."
Some never returned.
Among the population, Papua Paniai is considered a "sad, forgotten place."
Poverty reinforces discontent.
A small portion of rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive for locals.
Bread, to the same extent, is not available.
People here grow everything they eat: Mostly a note, as well as some fruit and leafy vegetables.
Agriculture is the work of women, each of whom can care for four to five fields of sweet potatoes.
They usually retain most of the crop for the family, and the rest is sold on the local market.
The ten tuber note costs just 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Over time, economic inequality has increased between indigenous papuas and new migrants, who have arrived in large numbers since the introduction of new flights to Nabire airport.
Few existing vacancies are usually delivered to more educated and affluent migrants.
Papuas rarely have enough money or the necessary skills to run their own competitive business.
"Young people don't want to stay in the village... because there's no work or money here," says John Purai, chairman of the Paniai tribal council.
Isolation keeps Papua away from the views of the rest of the world.
Moreover, restrictions on the work of international media remain tight.
Earlier this year, French journalists Frank Esküdi and Basil Bergshan were deported from Papua for "insufficient coherence with relevant organisations" despite being given rare permits to conduct video footage.
According to Felim Kine, deputy director for Asia at Human Rights Watch, the promises made during Jokovi's election campaign to lift restrictions on media work to promote transparency and development have not been fulfilled.
"Now, foreign journalists trying to report from the rebellious eastern Indonesian provinces, Papua and West Papua, face new dangers: Visa denials and blacklisting," he said in a statement.
The lack of press attention means that international pressure on Indonesia's government is largely limited to Papua's immediate neighbors.
In March, six Pacific states - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - asked the U.N. Human Rights Council to investigate "diverse and widespread violations" in Papua, including the Paniai shooting.
The same countries have supported OPM in the past.
Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesman Arramanata Nasir dismissed the group's statement, telling reporters in Jakarta that "Indonesia still has a democratic system and a free press, so it would be difficult to hide evidence of episodes of human rights violations."
Locals want more foreign governments to pay attention to the situation.
When an official delegation from the Netherlands, led by Dutch human rights ambassador Kiyce Van Baar, visited Jayapuru on May 4, locals broke the silence, mowing: "We want freedom," according to a source who also attended the meeting but wished to remain anonymous.
In Indonesia, a new presidential election will be held in 2019, but papuses say they are unlikely to vote for Jokovi again.
"Jokovi is a man who has good intentions, but he is surrounded by people involved in the Paniai shooting," says Hisai, chairman of the tribe's council.
He wants Jokovi to know that the people of Paniai, apart from living in the shadow of the threat from the altar army, are mired in poverty, and their education and health care are in a miserable state.
Mumbai says that the people of Paniai, like other papuses, consider their voice, given for Jokovi, a debt that he must pay.
"They don't need money, they just want justice," he says.
Despite the threats and intimidation, the families of the victims of the Paniai shooting carried out the latest symbolic act of disobedience: Buried the body of one of the victims on a plot of land directly opposite the police and military station.
Knowing that justice will probably never prevail, they will at least not allow the guilty to forget their crimes.
"Killed a member of our family," Jacobus says, without raising his heads.
"What else did we do?"
Fire covers Dubai skyscraper Facel for second time
The fire engulfed one of the world's highest residential skyscrapers in Dubai on Friday, forcing hundreds of residents to hastily leave the seventy-nine-storey structure at 337 metres high.
This is the second fire in two years.
An evacuation was carried out in the building, no human casualties were reported and there was no operational news about the cause of the fire.
'We slept and woke up from the fire alarm and people's screams.
We ran down the stairs and it took us about ten minutes to get down from the 50th floor, "a skyscraper resident called George told Reuters.
The Dubai Civil Defense Authority said fire teams extinguished the fire at about 4: 00 local time (00: 00 GMT) and cooled the building.
The government said it was working to provide asylum to the victims.
The incident could put the safety of materials used in high-rise buildings around the world back on the agenda.
An investigation by the Facela administration after a fire there in 2015 revealed that plaque was the most affected - external panels used for decoration and insulation.
In the United Kingdom, police said they believed the insulation system and plaque panels of the Grenfell Tower building in London could speed up the spread of a fire there in June that killed about 80 people.
The growth of tourist flow in Ida-Virumaa in June turned out to be minimal
According to the data, which the correspondent of the portal rus.err.ee received in the Department of Statistics, in June 2017 the services of hotel enterprises of the North-East were used by a total of 20,519 local and foreign tourists, which is 125 people or 0.6% more than in the same period a year earlier.
At the same time, the number of local tourists has fallen and foreign tourists have grown.
Thus, the foreign turnaround increased in June by 7.3% (544 people) to 7994 tourists.
And the number of local tourists fell by 3.2% from 12,944 to 12,525.
The number of Russian tourists increased most markedly in the region - by 8.9% or by 318 compared to June 2016.
A total of 3,885 guests from the Russian Federation stayed overnight in Ida-Virumaa hotels in June 2017.
Andrei Malakhov made it clear to fans who are to blame for his departure
Andrei Malakhov hinted to his fans on Instagram who was to blame for his departure from Channel One.
So far, he has not commented on the rumors, but today he has posted a fragment of an article in the newspaper "The Office" for August 1.
Photo Malakhov signed the tag "seismocosos."
An article on how to prevent the "burning" of an employee and pay attention to his condition.
If you recall the numerous reports that the presenter couldn't find a common language with the newly arrived producer, who has taken to reformulating "Let's Say," it becomes clear what he so transparently hinted at, writes "KP."
TV presenter Andrei Malakhov was reportedly currently on leave and did not sign an application for dismissal from Channel One.
The dismissal situation could be clarified in the coming days.
In Afghanistan, five soldiers killed in car bombing
At least five soldiers were killed in an explosion in Afghanistan's Helmand province, RIA Novosti reported.
According to police, a mined car exploded near the military's roadblock in Girishk County the night before.
20 dead are known.
On Friday morning, a new PE took place in Girishka.
Armed criminals attacked the currency exchange point.
The shootout between the attackers and security forces continues.
Diver filmed on video attempting his camera shark
Diver and researcher Greg Skomal captured on video the shark that popped up his GoPro action camera.
The video was posted on Facebook by a unit of the U.S. Marine Fisheries Agency in Massachusetts, of which Skomal is an employee.
The incident occurred on August 2 off the coast of the Cape Cod Peninsula in the northeastern United States, the Necn portal said.
The man, while diving, attempted to remove the shark on camera, which was held on a special stick.
After noticing the man, the animal, over three metres long, sailed toward him.
The shark began to bite the camera without trying to attack the scientist.
Skomal explained that the predator did likewise to determine whether the gadget was eaten.
The researcher added that the shark could easily destroy the device.
He also noticed that similar behavior of a marine animal turned out to be a novelty for scientists.
The cause of the mass brawl at the Ural military centre has become known
A working group of senior officers from the Central Military District arrived at the Elan Training Centre, where the mass brawl took place, to investigate the circumstances of the incident.
Some details of this beating have already become known.
According to the Mash pablik, which appeared on the page "VContact," the contractors of the Ural military unit number 31612 were brutally imitated because of an uncorrected bed.
It all began with the fact that an ordinary named Sayan vividly ignored the order of the officer to correct the torched sheets.
Soldiers from the sixth company stood on the officer's side.
Sayana supported the first company.
In half an hour, 140 young guys were crushed in the barracks of a bed and sink, knocked out glass.
More than ten people were injured in the mass brawl.
The CHI denied information about the ponytail.
The study found that at least one-fifth of passengers in the United States carry banned items into a plane.
The study found that more than 20 percent of air passengers knowingly or accidentally carried prohibited items in their luggage on board the plane through U.S. Transportation Security Administration inspection points, including a minimum of 6 percent boarded the plane, under-watched with banned knives or other sharp items.
Nearly 1 percent said they later discovered they accidentally had firearms, ammunition or explosives with them.
The study, conducted by charter company Stratos Jet Charters, Inc. and covered more than 1,000 people, also found that young passengers were more likely to break the rules.
Of the respondents who admitted to knowingly trying to fly with something that is banned by the ATB, 19.7 percent were millenials compared to less than 15 percent of Generation X members.
Consciously past ATB employees are most likely to carry food and water.
More than 3 per cent admitted to having specifically carried sharp items through the inspection, while 2.2 per cent of female respondents and 3.7 per cent of male respondents admitted to knowingly carrying illicit drugs on the plane.
The company said it had studied passengers across the country to find out how many of them had accidentally worn smuggling through inspections at airports, and how many had done so knowingly.
It is quite expected that most often - consciously or unconsciously - drag smuggling through the inspection of those who fly the most.
As the company points out, the ATB rules are quite complex and confusing.
People often don't know exactly what liquids they can carry and in what quantity.
So it's not surprising that much of what the ATB selects is banned liquids.
Some time ago, people thought that the ATB might be considered forbidden to carry a book.
Liquids are allowed on domestic flights, but not on international ones.
EPA chief Prüitt abandons intention to delay implementation of Obama-era emissions reduction rules
The day after the 15-state lawsuit, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency reversed his decision to delay implementation of Obama-era regulations designed to reduce emissions of air-polluting substances and lead to resin formation.
Prüitt explained his decision that his agency is now listening more to the needs of state environmental regulators than under previous administrations.
He did not mention the lawsuit against his previous position, filed in a federal appeals court.
The dispute unfolded around the October 1 deadline, to which states must ensure compliance with 2015 ozone standards at ground level.
In June, Prüitt announced that he would delay their compliance by one year to give his department more time to study the plan and avoid "inconsistencies with local solutions or obstacles to economic growth."
Prüitt, who before being appointed by President Trump to his current position was Oklahoma's attorney general, was long known as a consistent opponent of tightening environmental regulations.
After moving to Washington, Prüitt repeatedly blocked or delayed the introduction of norms opposed by the chemical or gas-oil industry.
The unexpected change of course on Wednesday is another legal defeat of the course taken by Pewitt to return to the previous norms.
Last month, a federal appeals court in Washington ruled that the EPA chief had exceeded his authority in an attempt to delay implementation of an Obama administration rule requiring oil and gas companies to track and reduce methane leaks.
In a statement released Wednesday night, Prüitt suggested that by dramatically changing course on ozone standards, he was simply fulfilling the EPA's duty to cooperate with the states in a comprehensive process of timely implementation of the new standards.
"Under previous administrations, the EPA often could not meet the deadline, then waited for lawsuits from activist groups and from others and discussed the timing in the course of settling the case," said Prüitt, who filed more than a dozen lawsuits against the EPA in his previous position.
'We don't believe in regulation through trials, and we take the timing seriously.
We're also serious about his statute and the power he gives us. '
However, the EPA said in a statement that Prüitt may at some point again use his "powers to delay and other statutory powers" to make sure the norms are "jcyjdfys on a clear course and on all available information."
Republicans in Congress are pushing for a broader review of ozone rules.
The bill, approved by the House of Representatives last month, seeks to delay implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years.
The Senate has yet to vote on the issue.
New York Attorney General Eric Schnederman, who led a coalition of states that filed a lawsuit against the EPA this week, said the group intends to continue legal pressure.
"The EPA's course changes - after our lawsuits - are an important victory in the health and safety struggles of the 6.7 million New Yorkers and more than 115 million Americans who are directly affected by the able, covering their cities," Schnederman said.
New York's lawsuit was joined by California, Connecticut, receiver, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington, as well as the District of Columbia.
Ozone at ground level occurs when conventional pollutants from machines, power plants, refineries and chemical plants and other sources enter the atmosphere in reaction with sunlight.
This can cause serious breathing problems in sensitive people, leading to thousands of premature deaths per year.
Health advocates and environmental advocates welcomed Prüitt's unexpected change of course.
"It's sad to think about how much pressure it took to achieve this perfectly logical step from the person tasked with protecting the air we breathe," said Lori Anne Bird of the Center for Biological Diversity.
'We must continue to resist the Trump administration's ideological campaign and protect those who pollute the air and their special interests. '
IAAF Congress extends suspension of All-Russian Athletics Federation
The Congress of the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) voted to extend the suspension of the All-Russian Athletics Federation (WFLA).
So Congress backed the IAAF's WFLA recovery board, which issued a report on Monday recommending that the suspension be upheld.
166 people voted for the extension of the suspension, against 21, TASS reported.
A report by the IAAF board said the WFLA had made significant progress towards meeting the conditions set by the board to restore membership, but those conditions had not yet been fully met.
Because of WFLA's disqualification at the World Championships in London, Russian light athletes were forced to perform under a neutral flag.
The team included 19 people admitted to the IAAF championship.
WFLA was subjected to indefinite disqualification by the IAAF in 2015.
Then a report by the independent expert of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), Dick Paunda, was published, citing numerous violations of WADA regulations made by Russian officials and athletes.
Read more about the IAAF council's latest report in The Post, "the IAAF extended sanctions on the WFLA."
Offensive defeat
Within the framework of the 3rd round of the Fonbet-Championship of Russia among the teams of PFL Novomoskovsky "Himik" held a visiting match against FC "Ural."
A little more than 10 days ago, the rivals played among themselves in the Russian Cup, but this time the picture of the game was completely different.
The "chemist" didn't concede anything to the opponent, but the second-round relaxation at the outcome of the match led to an offensive gown and a fiasco.
After the recent defeat of Kaluzan with a score of 0: 3, many predicted an easy victory for the hosts in advance.
However, since the beginning of the meeting, the newcomers have been forced to reckon with themselves and acted from defense, but from a position of strength.
In the first half, the Caldinans were more built up and had an advantage in possession of the ball.
Another very high-quality match was held by Alexey Sirotin, who reflected the dangerous blows several times and gave the partners confidence by his actions.
Unfortunately, in the attack, the "chemist" lacked the effort and luck to put the Tigers "defence to a standstill and score the first goal on the way out.
After the break, the game began to tread on counter courses.
The Novomoskovs were more active in the attack.
The wake-up calls for our team were defense errors that allowed the callers to create a number of sharp moments.
10 minutes before the end of the meeting, Chemical intercepted a territorial advantage and carried out several dangerous attacks.
But Kaluzan's experience played a part - they had a more competent and cold-blooded ending, waiting for their moment to take the gate.
After a dangerous attack, "Chemical" moved the ball to a corner, the feed of which the owners of the field without resistance moved to the gate.
The author of the goal was Yuri Dubrovin.
In the reporting meeting, Chemical demonstrated a good game but suffered an offensive defeat.
In front of our team there will be another departure - on August 11 at 19 o'clock in Moscow at the stadium "Torpedo" named after Eduard Streltsova the newcomers will fight with the favorite of the group "Center" FC "Ural," which includes Roman Pavlyuchenko, Marat Izmailov, Igor Ledenko, Alexey Rebko.
Come to support "Chemical!"
The place and time of the meeting of the Novomoskovs - 6: 30 p.m. near the store "Magnolia" (East, d.2, corp.
Composition of "Chemical": Sirotin, Manohin (k), Romashchenko, Shayunov, Khomutov, Gogia (Oreshkin), Dudaiti, Ryzhov, Sacred, Belyanin (Tsievtsev), Andreichenko (Lygin)

According to published decliners of phone conversations, Trump pressed Mexico over paying for a wall at the border
The Washington Post published deciphering phone conversations between US President Donald Trump and the leaders of Mexico and Australia.
On January 27, during a telephone conversation with Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto, Trump insisted that he stop publicly declaring that he would not pay for the planned wall at the border.
The US president rumoured him for speaking out publicly against the wall and, according to leaked information, told him, "You can't say it to the press."
Trump began his election campaign with a promise to build a wall along the southern U.S. border and vowed he would force Mexico to pay for the project.
The published decryption of his first phone conversation with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull also revealed a hot stir.
Trump told Turnbull that the agreement that the US should accept refugees heading to Australia was "ridiculous," "disgusting" and "stupid," and insisted that because of the agreement negotiated by the Obama administration, it would look like an idiot as it intended to stop refugee resettlement in the United States.
Trump ended the conversation by telling Turnbull that "it was the most unpleasant conversation all day."
Bodies of dead in Abkhazia tourist sent by plane from Sochi to St. Petersburg
The plane, owned by Russia Airlines, carrying the bodies of those killed in Abkhazia by the Russians, took off at 20: 15 Moscow time from Sochi to St. Petersburg, TASS reported.
Staff of the ritual agency, as well as representatives of the town hall, will meet at the site of the final destination, Deputy Minister for resorts and tourism of Abkhazia Astatha Akhba told reporters.
Earlier, representatives of the Ministry of Emergency Situations of the Republic stated that all expenses related to the delivery of the bodies back to Russia were borne by the government of Abkhazia.
In addition, the official Sukhum intends to pay the families of the victims compensation in the amount of 500 thousand rubles.
According to Ahba, the leadership of Abkhazia expressed readiness to pay the relatives of those killed as a result of the explosions of the tourist flight and residence in the republic, but the relatives sent to the republic only the power of attorney for the right of the local authorities to act in accordance with the established order.
On August 2, at approximately 16: 20 Moscow time, in the village of Primorsky Gudautsky district, two explosions were carried out in a warehouse of rocket and artillery weapons of the Ministry of Defense of the republic, after which they began to detonate large-caliber shells and other ammunition stored there.
As a result, there was a burning of the storage room, which provoked uncontrolled explosions of shells of various modifications.
As a result, two Russian citizens, Elena Polyakov, born in 1970, and Elena Timofeeva, born in 1962, were killed and were on holiday near a hydrogen source.
64 people, including 35 citizens of the Russian Federation and 29 citizens of Abkhazia, were taken to medical institutions of the republic with injuries of varying severity.
Currently, seven people remain in the hospital, the rest discharged.
Study of Russian influence on American elections will be conducted by a grand jury
The veteran prosecutor for Russia, Robert Mueller, has convened a grand jury in Washington that will examine Russia's influence on the 2016 U.S. presidential election, according to The Wall Street Journal and Reuters.
The grand jury is a group of ordinary citizens who collect evidence of potential criminal offenses and have the right to question witnesses under oath.
The materials collected will be examined by the special prosecutor and decide whether they are sufficient to bring charges.
The convening of a grand jury gives Mueller additional powers to collect testimony.
One of the topics of the jury investigation that began work a few weeks ago will be details of a meeting between the son of then-presidential candidate Donald Trump and Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya.
To verify the details of that June 2016 meeting, Mueller himself had previously promised.
They have already been studied by the FBI.
In late July, it was reported that Donald Trump Jr. had expanded the staff of his lawyers.
Trump Jr. has previously said that from a meeting with Veselnitskaya, he was waiting for a compromise on the headquarters of Demparty candidate Hillary Clinton, but no exposing documents were presented, and it was ultimately about adoption.
In early August, a number of media outlets reported that Trump Jr. 'S statement about the meeting with Veselnitskaya was literally dictated by Trump senior.
The White House clarified that the president didn't dictate anything, but simply used his authority that any father would do.
Penza deputy mayor detained at workplace
The deputy head of the Penza administration, Irina Shirshin, was detained for 48 hours on behalf of the Investigative Committee at his workplace, RIA Novosti reported.
There have been no official reports from law enforcement agencies on the matter so far, but the SU SC press service has assured that they will soon follow.
Penza City Hall has not yet commented on the incident.
Irina Shirshin is one of five deputy heads of the Penza administration.
She has overseen urban planning issues and land relations, occupying the position since April 2015.
Prior to that, she worked for a long time as the head of the department of the State Housing and Technical Inspection in Penza region.
Irina Shirshin is raising three minor children, it is remarkable that once again becoming a mother a year ago, she refused maternity leave and returned to work.
Of course, there is no cosmodrome or launch vehicle in Mexico.
But there is a space agency established in 2010 and a desire to develop its own space program.
And the installation of Yuri Gagarin's bust is a tribute to the first person to visit in space.
In contrast to the monuments of the Soviet period, which are demolished in some countries, the monuments of Gagarin, on the contrary, "follow the planet."
In 2012, the Pentagon was installed in American Houston near the former NASA headquarters.
In London, a monument on the grounds of the Royal Observatory was set to mark the 50th anniversary of the first flight into space.
There is a monument to Gagarin in Germany in the city of Erfoot, where our cosmonaut visited in 1963.
The monument in Karlovy Vary (Czech Republic) escaped demolition in 1992 thanks to public protests and was moved from the city centre to the square in front of the local airport.
In the year of the 70th anniversary of Gagarin in Riga there was a monument to Jurius Gagarins.
This is the name and surname of the first cosmonaut in Latvian, and he looks as if he is 70 years old.
Murder at Mendez: Activists lose Lynch courts on stage to call for justice
Diana Mercury, 1948, drove past the audience in the village of Monro in Georgia and with a river to the small bridge of Mendez.
When the car, which had four black passengers and a white driver, drove up to the bridge, a group of white men with guns blocked her way.
The principal - a middle-aged man in a suit in a thin strip - was delayed by a cigarette and looked through the windscreen.
Those sitting inside were trembling with fear.
"We need this nigger, Roger!" The man yelled.
"Get him out of the car!"
Piercing screams ruined the silence when a young black man was dragged from the front seat.
Luckily, this horrific scene, which played out on July 22, is just a mock-up.
But when Rodgers got a noose on his neck, almost all of the audience shaved their breath.
Since 2005, activists have been returning to the Mourinho Bridge to replay that night, when, in 1946, the KuKluxclans were lynched by two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and May Murray Dorsey.
No one has been convicted of the murders.
"It's striking that in all these years, no person has been arrested - although we see them next to ourselves; although we know who they are," says Tyrone Brooks, who helped organize the staging.
'it's a spot on our history and it's a stone on our souls. '
The 71-year-old Brooks is a former Georgia congressman who has been fighting for human rights all his life.
For him, the play is a dramaturgic call to action and an annual reminder to the people of Monro that injustice has never been fixed.
"We want an investigation, we want completion, we want healing, we want reconciliation, but first we have to get justice," he says.
'We can't move on to healing and reconciliation until we get justice. '
A coroner covers the sheets of the body of one of the victims of the lynching at Mendez on July 27, 1946.
According to FBI records obtained by CNN News, more than 50 people in Monro and neighboring counties were suspected of participating in the lynching.
But no one has been charged.
Although the suspects have remained at large for decades, human rights activists say the city's chats have always been well aware of two related vigilante motives: Politics and sex.
In April 1946, a Supreme Court ruling for the first time allowed black citizens to vote on the primaries, which were due to take place that summer.
Around the time of the same election, according to FBI reports, black user Roger Malcolm was stabbed in a fight by Barnett Hester, a white landlord - apparently because of a woman.
Brooks says that, according to rumours spread in the city, Hester slept with Malcolm's wife Dorothy, and that the child she was supposed to give birth to was not from her husband.
According to FBI reports, on July 25, 1946, Loy Harrison, a major white landlord, paid $600 bail to summon Malcolm from prison.
He went to prison with Dorothy and their cousins May Murray and George Dorsey.
But as they drove out of the prison and drove up to the Mendez Bridge, a crowd of vigilantes surrounded the car.
"It turns out that he organized and commanded the Harrison murders," one FBI report concludes.
'it's also obvious that there was collusion between state and city law enforcement that not only took part in the killings but also destroyed evidence and concealed the identities of witnesses. '
Brooks calls it shorter.
"It was an attempt on electoral rights," he says.
"They were all killed to send a signal to blacks in the city: If you register and vote, you will be the same."
For nearly a decade, Cassandra Green has been directing an annual performance reproducing that lynching at the Mendez Bridge.
Her play is glimpsed, it captures the viewer and tells of the deep racism that many would like to consider there is no more in America.
It's hard to watch and even harder to turn away, but Green believes that's the main thing.
"We don't want to talk about Lynch's courts because they show us our own ugliness," she says.
'but I can't build a relationship with you if you don't hear me or hear that I've survived. '
Rehearsals for this year's performance began in June, and on the first day, nearly 30 actors - a dozen whites, the rest black - gathered indoors and listened to a years-long review of the play.
Wade Marbo was a director along with Green.
He has played the role of chief member of the clan for several years, but says the role never got easier.
"It seems to me that I was baffled because it's not the person that I am," Marbo says.
'but I believe it's very important to remember this story because we don't want to come back at the time. '
Indoors, actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascon, who play Roger Malcolm and Barnett Hester, repeat their roles.
Spectal begins with Malcolm, angry that Hester sings with his wife Dorothy, screaming and pushing him.
"I said, Dogg, kill out of my house!"
Cries Rascona in response.
A blow is given out.
And at the same moment, everyone (at least all black actors) is unravelled by a hoax.
Green laughs louder than everyone.
"What is," Ascona asks.
He is concerned and embarrassed.
AM I reeling?
"No," Green says through laughter.
"I just don't think the whites then said 'Dogg'."
"Yes-yes," one of the black performers laughs.
"You have to nickname the solid 'r'."
And so does the energy in the room: Discomfort is replaced by a sense of partnership.
Everyone should do everything right, not only for the sake of the play, but also for the memory of the four people killed.
The scene starts first.
This time, when Rascona says a word on the letter "n," it turns out to be clear and sharp.
No man laughs.
The play ends brutally and quickly.
Screams, shots, and then silence.
A woman in mourning black clothing stands over the actors' bodies and performs a gruesome song by Billy Purday's "Strange Fruit."
Her voice is interrupted through the word.
A hundred yards away from her, half a hundred spectators wipe out tears and sweat from their eyes.
There are almost equal numbers of black and white among the audience.
One couple arrived from Ithaca, New York, to watch the submission; many live quite nearby.
They all endured the heavy doughnut of Georgia for almost eight hours while Brooks drove them on a pilgrimage to the graves of Malcolm and Dorsey.
Until that moment, the killings remained only history, but now that they are standing in the same place where people were lynched, it seems that their ghosts are being advised immediately in the air.
When the song's last note is tipped, Green invites people to come closer and examine the bodies.
Children bend to their heads, touch paint depicting blood, and motionless bodies and whisper something to each other.
"They're not really dead," one little boy muttered, as if to remind himself.
A few minutes later, Green thanks the audience, and suddenly everything ends.
Actors drop ropes from their neck and wipe away tears.
Bradshaw hugs Marbo, the man in the suit who played the chief cuckoff.
Nick Rascona hugs two other actors and suddenly, crying, falls into their embrace: The emotional load of the performance finally hit him.
"Everything is okay," one of the women whispers.
"We know you have a good heart.
You had reasons for that. '
Later, the audience sits down to have dinner with the actors.
At one table, a white couple from Atlanta are lively discussing the performance with a black couple they've just met.
Denise Daplinger is struggling to find words to describe what she feels after the performance.
"It's hard to listen to these horrible, burning words, and actions... people who look like you, and who do it because they look like you," she says.
"After that, I think the lynchings are still happening," she adds, "only now it's called that shooting police."
In the other corner of the room, Tyrone Brooks, who remembers his work as a human rights activist, took general attention.
He says he has already begun planning next year's submission.
"The staging inspires us because it not only describes the horror of what we have experienced, but also teaches us," he says.
'Because if you don't extract from that lesson, it can happen again.
Those who don't study their history, who don't know their history, are doomed to repeat it. '
Court fined Navalny for violations on "campaigning Saturn"
Simonovsky court of Moscow fined Alexei Navalny 300 thousand rubles for violating the order of organization of the rally.
The opposition leader was found guilty of an administrative offence under Part 8 of Article 20.2 of the Administrative Code of the Russian Federation.
Earlier, the judge of the Simonovsky court of Moscow, Szyr Mussakayev, had finished considering the administrative case against Leonid Volkov, the chief of staff of the opposition leader Alexei Navalny, who had been brought to justice under the same article as Navalny.
Volkov was found guilty and sentenced to a fine of 300,000 rubles.
In such a sum, Judge Mussakayev estimated the distribution of leaflets on the "campaign Saturday" that Navalny's supporters held in Moscow on July 8-9.
After seeing the agitmaterials that followed the participants of the Saturday police found that the organizers of the event deliberately concealed its true essence - a public action (for which it is necessary to request prior permission from the capital authorities).
Leonid Volkov and his lawyers Ivan Zhdanov and Alexander Pomazuev applied for the termination of the administrative proceedings due to the absence of the composition of the offence and pointed out that the police allowed certain failures in the drafting of the protocol.
On the very "campaigning Saturday," Volkov was not detained, but he received a summons requiring him to appear at the police station for a story about the event held with his active participation.
The same agenda was received by Navalny himself and another associate of the opposition - Nikolai Lyayev.
Shooting bride and three wedding guests arrested in Mordovia
A court in Mordovia arrested a local resident who shot four people at the wedding, including the bride.
This was reported by the Republican Office of the Investigative Committee.
The incident took place on the evening of July 29.
During the quarrel, the 42-year-old Saranska resident shot several times at guests of the event who had come to the rural pond to swim.
Three women and one man were injured.
Criminal proceedings have been initiated under article 213, paragraph 1 (a) of the Criminal Code ("Huliganism"), article 30, paragraph 3, and article 105, paragraphs (a), (e), and (2) of the Criminal Code ("The murder of two or more persons, committed in a generally dangerous manner, out of hooligan motives").
According to Interfax, local media reported that the man opened fire because the guests of the wedding, having decided to swim, passed through the territory of his site to the water.
Ministry of Energy to tighten requirements for turbine suppliers for power plants
The Ministry of Energy of the Russian Federation will update the rules for providing information to suppliers of critical equipment, in particular, turbines for power plants.
At the start of gas turbines, hydropower turbines, oil pumping facilities and oil production, equipment suppliers will be obliged to share data on access to it with the Ministry of Energy and the Federal Service for Technical and Export Control.
The draft resolution of the government is already ready and put to public discussion.
The new requirements will only affect "critical energy equipment" supplied to Russia.
Potential threats in the document are such phenomena as obtaining information and access to the management of the object by foreign special services, criminal elements and structures, unscrupulous partners and hackers.
EU expands anti-Russian sanctions due to Siemens
The European Union press service said on August 4 that anti-Russian sanctions had been expanded due to a scandal over the supply of Siemens production turbines to Crimea.
This was previously reported by Arguments of the Week.
The EU Council press service said sanctions against the Russian Federation had been expanded due to the Siemens production turbine scandal, which was allegedly brought to Crimea bypassing the sanctions.
Today, the Council of Europe is considering all possible complaints and proposals from member states to expand anti-Russian sanctions.
It was previously reported that a final decision would be made before the end of the day, and that's the decision taken, sanctions on Russia expanded.
Pearson cuts 3,000 more jobs and reduces dividends to bring business back to life
On Friday, British education group Pearson announced it would cut another 3,000 jobs and reduce preliminary dividends by 72 per cent in the wake of the launch of another restructuring programme aimed at tackling the challenges facing their businesses.
These job cuts, which chief executive John Fallon said will mostly occur in late 2018 and early 2019, come in addition to the 4,000 jobs reduced under the previous restructuring.
Pearson announced that it plans to cut spending by another 300 million pounds ($394 million) in May in a third cost-cutting program to try to bring back to life a business hit by a rapid shift to digital learning methods.
The company, which last month agreed to sell its stake in Penguin Random House to its partner, Bertelsman, said its forecasts for the year remained unchanged, after it announced a 1 percent increase in core product sales in the first half of the year to 2.05 billion pounds.
Kabul convoy attack: Nato soldier killed in suicide bombing
According to official sources, a suicide bomber attacked a military convoy in Afghanistan's capital, Kabul, killing one NATO soldier and injuring several others.
Five soldiers and an interpreter were injured, according to NATO.
According to unverified data from local sources, the incident in the city's Karabakh region also killed three civilians.
The blast is the latest of Afghanistan's bloodshed this month: On Tuesday, an explosion at a mosque in Herat killed more than 30 people.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
According to NATO, Thursday evening's explosion happened when a joint convoy with the Afghan army was attacked with a "man-portable improvised explosive device."
According to the report, all of the wounded are in stable condition and are being treated at an American military hospital at Bagram airfield.
Correspondents report that the growing power of the Taliban and the group known as the Islamic State (ISIS) in Karabakh is a major source of concern for NATO forces stationed in Bagram.
According to UN reports, there were at least 1,662 civilian casualties in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, and about 20% of them in the capital.
In late July, a suicide bombing by car caused the death of at least 30 people in the Shia district of Kabul.
The Taliban said they carried out the attack.
On May 31, a powerful explosion in the center of the city killed more than 150 people - the most serious human-casualty attack in the country since United States-led troops removed the Taliban from power in 2001.
The violence focuses on the uneasy situation in Afghanistan, while US President Donald Trump is assessing whether to increase the number of US military forces assisting troops and police in the country.
According to correspondents, the terrorist attacks in Kabul in recent weeks have also created a crisis of public confidence in the government, its lines of conduct, and especially the reputation of President Ashraf Ghani.
Environmental Protection Agency after lawsuits cancels decision to delay air pollution law
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency reversed a decision to delay an Obama-era law requiring states to limit air-polluting emissions a day after 15 states sued the agency because of the move.
On Wednesday evening, the Environmental Protection Agency announced its decision to implement so-called "ozone measurements - 2015," stressing that the move shows the agency's willingness to cooperate with the states.
"We believe in dialogue with our partners in the states and responsiveness towards them," Environmental Protection Agency Chief Scott Prüitt said in a statement.
In June, Prüitt announced the Environmental Protection Agency's intention to delay ozone measurements, where existing air pollution is measured in different parts of the country to determine where to reduce it to meet stricter air purity standards, by one year, until October 2018.
On Tuesday, a group of 15 states, mostly Democratic, along with the federal District of Columbia filed a lawsuit alleging that the intention was illegal.
President Donald Trump's administration is trying to roll back a wide range of environmental protection orders introduced by previous President Barack Obama as part of a broader program aimed, Trump said, at shiny economic growth.
But action in this direction has drawn resistance from Democrats and environmental organizations concerned about the possible impact of large emissions on public health.
The Environmental Protection Agency's website says that the use of ozone-containing air for breathing "can worsen the function of the lungs and increase respiratory symptoms," such as asthma.
European Business Association opposes new anti-Russian sanctions
The European Business Association has expressed opposition to US economic sanctions against the Russian Federation.
According to Abid, such measures could lead to a serious reduction in production and the number of jobs.
Astor said in a statement that business is one of the important links between countries and people, so the principles of free trade cannot be limited.
European business brings together more than 500 companies from the European Union and the European Free Trade Association.
The Association calls on the heads of state and government of the EU, the US and Russia to develop a new line of conduct that would separate business from politics and find a common, mutually acceptable solution in a spirit of peace and harmony.
MPs ask police to limit traffic on embankment in Pskov
The people's deputies sent an address to the head of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the city Sergey Surin about the problem of movement along the embankment of the Great River.
Duma deputies Konstantin Bolotin, Grigory Storonenkov and Valery Lesnikov believe that motorists prevent people from walking and resting in this place.
In their view, control of drivers will help make this territory more calm and secure.
The problem is that offenders ignore the signs of the "Peak Road" and ride freely along the waterfront.
It turns out that the overhaul and improvement have been carried out in vain.
Sports and playgrounds because of the machines become uncomfortable.
According to the Pskov Information Agency, in the evenings the central embankment is patrolled by PPP motopatrul staff and friends.
Thanks to them the number of passing cars becomes smaller, but the whole traffic does not stop.
Putin demanded investigative authorities not seize hard drives
Russian President Vladimir Putin has proposed banning investigative agencies from removing servers and hard drives from working computers at businesses.
The head of state said this at the meeting on investment programs for the development of the Far East.
According to the President, it is necessary to "exclude the use in the interests of the investigation of measures leading to the suspension of the activities of enterprises, including the removal of hard drives from working computers and servers."
Putin noted that if investigators have such a need, "it is enough to remove the copies, assure them and use them in the course of the investigation."
The head of state added that it is not possible to "create conditions that prevent the continuation of the activity of the enterprise up to the impossibility of paying taxes."
Olga Buzov told how much she wanted to call her ex-husband
TV presenter Olga Buzov admitted that she very much wanted to call her former husband - footballer Dmitry Tarasov.
The celebrity is currently in the US, where he deals with work issues.
Just the day before, Olga visited Las Vegas, then decided to publish a post on the social network Instagram.
She reported that she did not get married, did not make new tattoos, and did not name the former spouse with the words that he had damaged her life, although she was very keen to do so.
Buzov said she would remember this trip forever as she was perfectly hanged.
British actor Robert Hardy has died
British actor Robert Hardy, who played Magic Minister Cornelius Farage in a screening of a series of novels about Harry Potter, has died at 92.
The Post reported on Thursday.
The actor's death was told by his relatives.
They said he had lived "a huge life, having achieved success in film, theatre and television in 70 years of career."
Hardy was born in 1925 in the English resort town of Cheltenham.
In 1959, on the stage of the Royal Shakespeare Theatre, he played alongside Lawrence Olivier in "Tragedy About Coriolane."
Hardy is also remembered for repeatedly performing the roles of Prime Minister Winston Churchill, including in one of Agatha Christie's exuberant works about Miss Margot.
He was awarded the British Academy of Motion Picture and Television Arts (BAFTA) Award for his role as Churchill in the BBC TV drama "Winston Churchill: The Wilmington Years" (1981).
Robert Hardy has also served as US President Franklin Delano Roosevelt on more than one occasion.
Swallowed something in the Danish state: Prince Hendrick, and in fact Henri Marie Jean Thae, Count de Labord, refused to be buried along with his venomous wife, Queen Margrete.
This year, the deductions have a "golden" wedding, but the couple's agenda is not to prepare for the celebrations, but a androgynous dispute.
His high-handedness gave up the title of the Prince-of-the-Consort, and he complained to the Queen that he had never complained about the title of the King-of-the-Consort.
Hendrick lives in France, although he remains officially the Queen's spouse.
Russian Foreign Ministry urges Washington to stop shelving Moscow
The Russian Foreign Ministry responded to remarks by Mike Pence, who accused Moscow of trying to destabilize the Balkans.
The relevant statement was issued by the Foreign Office some time ago.
In its commentary, the Foreign Ministry pointed out that the United States is increasingly using Cold War stamps that are inadequate to modern reality.
In addition, Russian diplomats called on the US authorities to stop purging the Russian Federation.
As Arguments of the Week wrote the day before, US Vice President Mike Pence accused Moscow of trying to destabilize the Western Balkans and orchestrating a failed coup in Montenegro.
Jerky Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for the first time, there is a conversation about the possibility of a decisive duel
Vasyl Lomachenko and Maiki Garcia, who appear to be steadily moving to host the most exciting boxing match in weight to 147 pounds in the near future, met for the first time on Thursday.
They occupied separate rooms in the offices of the ESPN channel in Los Angeles until Garcia, the undefeated lightweight champion of the World Boxing Council, walked down the corridor to greet Lomachenko, the champion of the World Boxing Organization in the second half-light weight.
After Garcia's unanimous victory over the former world champion in four weight categories Erien Broner on Saturday on the channel "Showtime" both bauxers are included in the fifth of the best bauxers regardless of weight categories.
Garcia stretched out his right hand and said, "How are things, champion?
Good luck to you. "
Lomachenko defends his belt in a duel with Miguel Marriaga on Saturday at 7 p.m. on ESPN.
When the boxers posed for the photo, Lomachenko's manager, Evans Klimas, noticed that a potential decisive fight between them would be the most time.
"I used to be at half-light weight," Garcia recalled.
'i rose to the category for Broner's sake [to 140 pounds], but I'm not that big.
I'm small for 140.
I want to go down to half-light.
And he needs to rise to half-light [to 135 pounds], and then we will arrange a duel.
The fans want it.
Let's arrange it for them. "
Lomachenko agreed.
"Boxing needs this duel."
Klimas asked if the fight should be broadcast through the PPV service as part of the strategy he follows for Lomachenko to carry out his debut fight in the weight of 135 later this year to appoint for next summer a meeting with Garcia (37-0, 30 knockouts), who is also keen to fight the winner of the duel between Jorge Linares and Luke Campbell after their fight for the world champion title in the light-weight arena on September 23.
"The fight could be on PPV because all the fans asked for it," Garcia said, expressing later a willingness to fight on that channel that would offer better financial terms.
"We are the main names.
No other names will cause such interest.
As soon as they are ready... "
Garcia said he believes Lomachenko is a "tremendous boxer" and maybe will visit his Saturday duel.
But Lomachenko did not immediately slam Garcia with praise and said he thought the three-weight champion from Riverside looked "very slow, sorry, Mike... you were asking for a knockout."
Garcia said he focused on showing the strength of the impact, and already then boxing.
They both said they felt like the tension was mounting before their own duel.
"This fight has to take place.
No other fight causes so much interest and talk.
I'm more than happy to work on it, "Garcia said.
Lomachenko said: "I was waiting for any of the top bakers, and here he is, Maiki.
It's going to be a great fight. '

Putin instructed Prosecutor General's Office to check Baikal
Russian President Vladimir Putin has instructed the Prosecutor General's Office of the Russian Federation to check the territory of Baikal for illegal and environmentally harmful activities.
"I ask the Prosecutor General's Office to check Baikal territory for the facts of illegal and environmentally harmful activities," Vladimir Putin said at a meeting devoted to the environmental development of the region.
In addition, the Russian leader asked for action if the facts of the violations were revealed.
New test results to assess age of asylum seekers in Sweden published
The latest test results of asylum seekers in Sweden, who were subjected to a new method of medical age assessment, show that more than 80 percent of those tested were rated as those over the age of 18, but not all trust the accuracy of these results.
The Swedish National Agency for Forensic Medicine (Rättsmedicinalverket) began conducting tests earlier this year.
They were designed to make the assessment of the age in the asylum process more accurate, after the Swedish Migration Agency was criticised for failing to determine the true age of some refugees who claimed to be minor.
At the moment, it has sent 6,880 cases for testing, and the forensic medicine agency has now published the results of 2,481 tests between mid-March and July 31, 2017.
Eighty percent (2002) of those tested were rated as people 18 or older, and in another 25 cases, the forensic medicine agency estimated that the tested was "probably a person 18 or older."
In the case of 432 cases, the conclusion stated that the person was "probably less than 18."
Tests are only carried out in cases where a person's age is in doubt.
According to Johan Göransson of the forensic medicine agency, the results are in line with the results of the past months.
"We're not seeing a big difference with the statistics over the past months, the numbers are quite appropriate," he told The Local.
The high proportion of cases in which people were assessed as having reached the age of 18 does not necessarily indicate that asylum seekers lied about their age.
In May, the agency published the results of 581 tests and said that in 442 cases, "it is likely that the age of the test is 18 years or more."
However, after reviewing 581 published results, the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet found that, in 243 cases, a person had openly stated that 18 was being performed this year.
The method of conducting a medical assessment of age, consisting of making an X-ray of wisdom teeth and tomography of knee joints and giving them for analysis to dentists and X-ray scientists, has also drawn criticism in some instances.
One of the skeptics is an endocrinologist from the Caroline Institute, Claude Marcus, part of whose work is to assess people's biological maturity in order to determine whether they have gone through sexual maturation sooner or later than usual.
'i've had reasons to think about it and I don't think you need to use the ways of measuring that are being used now.
The biological age is thus determined very inaccurately.
If we can't define it with confidence, we shouldn't pretend we can, "he told the Metro newspaper.
However, Gölssen, from the forensic medicine agency, argued in favor of the accuracy of the tests: "In general, it can be said that the risk of wrongly taking a child for an adult is small.
With the biggest risk we face when a person will soon be 18, in which case he's about 10 percent. '
I think whether to run for president
During his working trip to Buryatia, Vladimir Putin said that he was ready to think whether to run for president of Russia in the 2018 elections, Interfax reports.
This statement was a reaction to the request of the residents of the village of Chekyushka, Buryat region.
During a video conference dedicated to the elimination of the fire in Buryatia and Irkutsk region, the interlocutor addressed Putin with the words: "Mr Putin, we have a request to you: When the next presidential election will be, we all ask you to run for office again."
"Well, I'll think thank you," the president said in response.
On July 28, Russian presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov commented on remarks by some media outlets that Vladimir Putin's campaign headquarters would be headed by the head of the Russian president's administration, Anton Wyno.
Peskov called these assumptions "on nothing based, hypothetical reasoning."
"While there is no headquarters, until the establishment of the headquarters is far away, until the election campaign is far away," Peskov said.
"While it's not on the agenda," Peskov said.
West Virginia governor says he's moving to another party
West Virginia's governor, Democratic Party Representative Jim Justis, announced Thursday during a rally with President Trump that he was moving to another party.
"Whether you like it or not, but the Democrats got away from me," Governor Jastis said.
"Today I tell you with many prayers and many reflections... today I tell you, the people of West Virginia: I can no longer be useful to you by remaining a Democratic governor."
The rally exploded with applause.
"So tomorrow I will change my registration for a Republican," Justis added.
'as a coach, I would tell you that the time to play is different. '
Earlier, Trump promised that an important statement would be made at a rally in West Virginia.
Trump won in West Virginia with an overweight of 42 percent, and Justis did not support the Democratic candidate, Hillary Clinton.
Jastis, who, according to Forbes, is the only billionaire in the state, was elected in 2016.
Forbes notes that he owns coal mines in five states as he inherited the coal business from his father.
His fortune is estimated at $1.59 billion.
Meanwhile, the Republican Party's National Committee on Thursday night issued a statement that "Governor Justin's move to another party is another blow to the Democratic Party, which is more of an obstacle than working to make our country great again."
"Given just 15 governors and control of the smallest number of state legislatures in history, Governor Justis's statement is just another rejection of a party that has no leaders from top to bottom and is unable to find a positive, unifying message," Republican Party National Committee spokeswoman Ronna McDaniel said in a statement to CBS News.
Cote heavyweight flier Krasavczyk has found a home thanks to social networks
The kennel of the city of Chessboro (North Carolina, USA) has built a cat named Mister Krasavchik weighing more than 14 kilograms after it became famous thanks to the internet.
This is reported by Mashable.
In late June, the nursery's Facebook account published a photo of the cat asking to find its host because "its clearly someone used to feed."
In the comments, users noted that the expression of the animal's morda could become a new meme.
The publication picked up more than 3.2 thousand licks and 15,000 comments.
In the comments, dozens of people expressed a desire to shelter Heller Krasavchik.
As a result, he was given into the hands of Angela Frazee, who promised to take up his extra weight.
In an interview on WNCN radio, the American said she already had a similar experience: She took home a cat weighing about 10 kilograms, and now he weighs just over five.
In July, Reddit users drew attention to a cat from Australia with unusually long paws.
A post with a photo of the animal gathered more than 68,000 views.
Commentators noted that she could well have made a career in the model business.
Kew praises Russia's' sincere 'apology over doping scandal
International light athletics specialist Kevin Cow on Thursday praised what he called a sincere apology from Russia over the doping scandal, but reiterated that it was now an inappropriate moment to allow the country to participate in sports competitions again.
Russian light athletics federation representative Dmitry Shlyakhtin told a congress of the International Association of Athletics Federations, which was held on the eve of the World Athletics Championships, that his country's suspension from sports competitions was fair and that he was determined to fight doping.
He apologized to "all athletes who had gold and silver medals stolen at the competitions."
Despite his comments, the Congress of the International Association of Athletics Federations voted to maintain the suspension imposed in November 2015 after the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) published a report on found evidence of state-funded doping.
"It seemed to me that today's response, today's report was very sincere," Keow, president of the International Association of Athletics Federations, said.
"The whole council and the whole Congress liked... that the Russian Federation itself recognizes that it has experienced extremely hot times and is now doing its best to take care of the restructuring of the federation."
Kew said he also "liked" that Russia had agreed to the criteria for its recovery.
"I believe it was a very constructive day and that we are moving forward, but Congress supports the recommendations of the special commission that now is not the time to restore Russia to rights," Kew said.
"Over the next few months, we must do everything to resolve this situation.
Our leading principle was our desire to separate clean athletes from the tainted system, "he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes who meet the strict criteria of the International Association of Athletics Federations will be under a neutral flag to participate in the World Athletics Championships, which will start on Friday in London.
The head of the special commission of the International Association of Athletics Federations, Rune Andersen, said Monday that a number of requirements have yet to be met to rebuild Russia.
As he told reporters in London after a report on the board of the International Association of Athletics Federations, drug testing is still not being carried out sufficiently, and suspended coaches are still quietly doing their job.
Court arrests Ukrainian journalist suspected of gosizman
Detained by the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) journalist Vasyl Muwicki has been sent under arrest for two months, the SBU reports.
An employee of the Internet publication "Zhytomyr Journal" is suspected of treason by posting his publications on Russian sites and encroaching on the territorial integrity of Ukraine.
At the same time, Russia does not support the measures of the Ukrainian authorities against the journalist, considering it a "barbaric policy" against the media.
Two years after the peak of Europe's migration crisis, Italy has decided on a limited military operation in the Mediterranean.
The Command Borneo patrol ship entered Libya's territorial waters to then, together with that country's Navy, stop the influx of illegal migrants.
The decision to start the operation was made by the Italian parliament on Wednesday.
Rome has aligned it with Libya's internationally recognized government, which, however, does not control much of the country.
The opposing cabinet and the Tobhand-based Libyan parliament accused Italy of violating Libya's sovereignty.
And the commander of the Libyan National Army, paramedic Marshal Mukhtar, ordered his subordinates to oppose the Italian ships.
Rome, however, said it did not believe these threats and intended to send another military vessel to Libyan territorial waters.
The situation was discussed last week in talks between Italian prime minister Paolo Jentiloni and the head of Europe's recognised Libyan cabinet, Faiza Saraja.
Italian authorities have gone on to set up a maritime mission to combat illegal migration after statistics were released in July on the number of illegals coming into the country from Libya: 95,000 since the start of the year.
The government said resources to receive migrants had been exhausted.
Large-scale failure occurred on Skype
The global failure of the Skype service was recorded today in several countries around the world.
Users on Thursday, August 3, began massively sending complaints to the program's developers.
Microsoft stressed that specialists are already actively working to address the problems faced by the people of Europe and North America, RIA Novosti said.
We would like to remind you that in June this year Skype also failed.
Users have been unable to receive and send messages for some time.
The two leaders of the Ukrainian athletics team have been suspended from participation in the World Cup
Olga Zemlyak and Olesya Povh, who specialize in running for short distances, are excluded from the Ukrainian national team for the 2017 World Cup in London.
This is reported on the website of the Federation of Athletics of the country.
This decision was taken by the executive committee of the organization in connection with the initiation of disciplinary proceedings against athletics by the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF).
Coach Zemlyak Sergey Basenko is also excluded from the Ukrainian delegation.
According to Sportarena, the IAAF suspects sportswomen of using doping.
Povh - the bronze prize-winner of the Olympic Games-2012 and the World Cup-2011, the champion of Europe-2010 in the relay 4 by 100 meters, Zemlyak - the winner of the European championship of 2012 in the relay 4 by 400 meters.
The World Athletics Championships in London will take place from August 4-13.
How football's financial rules will affect Neymar's move to Paris
Rules aimed at preventing unlimited spending by European football clubs will not interfere with Neymar's world-record transfer from Spain's Barcelona to France's Pari Saint-Germain.
Whatever consequences may come further down the chain, for Pari Saint-Germain by UEFA, the governing body that controls European football, in whose power to ban teams from participating in the prestigious Champions League tournament.
It follows from the financial "fan-play" rules introduced by UEFA in 2011 that PSW will eventually have to show that Neymar's transfer was funded without major losses.
Barcelona paid 222 million euros ($262 million) only to free the Brazilian from the contract, and Neymar will receive a salary that will reach tens of millions of dollars a year.
Here are some financial aspects of Neymar's move to France.
PSW can accurately split to hire Neymar and add him to the galaxy of other callers, given the team's funding from Qatar's energy-rich ruling family.
Clubs have the right to spend large sums to acquire players, but they have to balance them at the expense of legitimate sources of income to reach the threshold of profitability in their football business.
The FFP was joined by Michel Platini after his election as president of UEFA in 2007.
The former French footballer believed that clubs that were in huge debt in their quest for success were, in fact, cheering and risking ruin if banks or owners stopped funding.
In 2011, the FFA stopped focusing on clubs "debts and instead switched to tracking their losses.
As a result of this change, the business model originally used by Roman Abraovich at Chelsea in 2003 - to buy a club with good potential and then spend heavily to improve the team and create a global brand - has become a difficult plan.
During this three-year assessment period, exciting 2018, clubs can incur losses of 30 million euros.
And, despite Platini's disgraceful removal from the presidency in 2015, his successor in Vermont, Alexander Cheferin, is still determined to curb excessive spending.
"Of course, the FFP is alive, and we, moving forward, will tighten the rules," Kevin Traverso, who controls the FFP in Baltimore, told the Associated Press last week.
Although "PSW" will pay for the purchase of Neymar's contract at one time, it can distribute this amount for the entire duration of his contract.
Neymar has signed a five-year contract so the transfer value can be shown in the annual report as a cost of 44.4 million euros over the next five years.
During the first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014, severe sanctions were applied to PSW, as well as to Abu Dhabi-owned Manchester City.
PSW was fined 60 million euros (at that rate it's $82 million), which was later reduced to 20 million euros, and was ordered to limit the composition of its team in the Champions League during the 2014-15 season to 21 players instead of the usual 25.
KPMG tracks clubs that may try to overturn its financial inspections by inflating their income at the expense of companies associated with the club's owners.
Although the Qatari company could have amassed "PSW," but if the amount of funding had been deemed to be higher than the standard market prices, the broker would not have allowed it to be considered a legitimate income.
That is what happened in 2014, when the Pentagon ruled that the amount of PSW funding from the Qatar Tourism Authority had been inflated.
It was reported that some of Neymar's earnings at PSW could have come in the form of payments from the 2022 World Cup organising committee in Qatar.
But PSW and Qatar 2022 deny that Neymar will become a World Cup ambassador, and a similar maneuver could easily be discovered by UEFA inspectors.
Past sanctions imposed on PSW mean that the Pentagon will even more closely monitor any attempt to circumvent the rules.
As people familiar with the situation reported on Thursday, Ross did not have preliminary discussions with PSW about Neymar's transfer.
They spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because they are not authorized to discuss the PSW provision.
According to the latest published report, PSW received more than 10 million euros in profit in 2015-16, with a turnover of 542.4 million euros.
The report for the last fiscal year has not yet been published.
PSW expects Neymar's arrival to be a favorable ground for sponsorship deals, selling attributes and T-shirts with the team's logo.
The club assumes that turnover will grow by at least 30 per cent as a result of hiring a new player.
Undoubtedly angry that one of the best footballers is leaving, the Spanish league tried to thwart Neymar's transfer, saying the PSW would breach the financial "foul play."
"This is an obvious case of" financial doping, "with the club and the state," La League president Javier Tebas told Spanish newspaper AS, bearing in mind that the ultimate owner of PSW is Qatar.
Arsenal coach Arsène Wenger, whose club is owned by the American sports magnate, shares La League's doubts about the club's funding by the state.
"These are all the consequences of equity participation, and it has completely changed the landscape of football over the last fifteen years," Wenger said on Thursday.
"When the club belongs to the country, everything is possible.
It becomes very difficult to comply with the financial fan-play, because the country can have many ways and many reasons to be represented by such a serious player.
The order and place of the oath will be determined by the president
Where and how new Russian citizens will swear allegiance to the Russian Federation will be determined by the president - such amendments to the second reading in the relevant law have been developed by the State Duma committee on legislation and state construction.
A week ago, MPs planned to directly determine the order of swearing in the law.
Children under the age of 18, as well as those who are incapacitated, will be released from the solemn oath, according to the revised text of the amendments to the draft law "On citizenship of the Russian Federation" (available to "Tsai"), which the committee will consider on July 11 before the second reading at its meeting.
President Vladimir Putin supported the idea of swearing in Russian citizenship instead of the formal signing of the documents on June 6 during a meeting with the Speaker of the State Duma, Vyacheslav Volodym.
The deputies drafted this idea in the form of an amendment to the second reading of the bill providing for the abolition of the decision to grant citizenship to those who were subsequently convicted of a number of crimes of a terrorist or extremist nature: For example, for public appeals to terrorism or its public justification in the media or on the Internet (Part 2 of Article 205.2 of the Criminal Code), as well as for the hijacking of a plane, train or water transport, but only if the act is connected with terrorism (Part 4 of Article 211 of the Criminal Code).
According to the bill, the logic of it was this: By issuing documents for citizenship, a person is signed under a promise to comply with Russian law - by getting on the path of extremism, he violates that promise.
The bill in April was introduced to the State Duma by the leaders of the Duma factions Vladimir Vasilyev (United Russia), Gennady Zyuganov (KPRF), Vladimir Zhirinovsky (LDPR), Sergey Mironov (Fair Russia) and the speaker of the DG Vyacheslav Volone.
On May 19, MPs accepted it in the first reading.
Last week, the DG Committee on State Building and Legislation approved the text of the bill for the second reading, but it has now been revised again.
Now it says that the procedure for taking the oath will be set by the President of the Russian Federation.
Earlier, parliamentarians were going to describe the procedure directly in the law "On Citizenship of the Russian Federation," indicating that the ceremony should take place in a solemn setting in front of the state coat of arms and the flag of Russia in the presence of a representative of the Ministry of Internal Affairs.
However, it was not clear from the text of the bill where such an event should take place - the list of places where it is possible to place the coat of arms of the Russian Federation is regulated by the relevant federal constitutional law.
They include courts, offices of heads of state bodies, municipalities, judges, prosecutors, heads of federal executive bodies, etc.
Most likely, it could be ZAGSs as well.
To make a solemn oath to those wishing to obtain the citizenship of the Russian Federation will be after the officials check their documents.
But a person will receive a Russian passport only after taking the oath of office, according to the finalized text.
A week ago, the draft stated that the oath should precede the signing of the decree.
The updated text states that swearing in Russia will be from the age of 18, not 14.
There is a rule by which incapacitated or restricted persons, as well as those who cannot pronounce, read or sign the text of the oath, will be released from taking the oath.
In addition, the President of the Russian Federation has the right to exempt "other persons" from this procedure,
Also in the updated bill there is a special procedure for admission to Russian citizens of citizens of Ukraine who are considered to be native speakers of the Russian language.
They will have to formally renounce their Ukrainian citizenship by providing an appropriate application to the authorized body of Ukraine.
A notarized copy of the application will need to be handed over to Russian officials.
The rejection of "alien" citizenship, as it is now, will not be required if it is provided for by an international treaty or if it is not possible "for reasons beyond the control of the person."
The corresponding amendment to the law was proposed by a group of deputies, among them the first vice-speaker of the State Duma Ivan Melnikov (KPRF), Natalia Poklonskaya, Pavel Krasheninnikov and Ayrat Farrakhov (all - "United Russia").
I think many of you know that getting a certificate from Ukraine is unrealistic, just impossible.
Accordingly, a lot of people are waiting for the decision of their fate regarding the citizenship of the Russian Federation, - the head of the Duma committee on state construction and legislation Pavel Krasheninnikov (EP) explained the day before.
In addition, it was clarified in the text that restrictions on the occupation of certain positions for foreigners would not apply to those who had given up their "other" citizenship in writing and had surrendered their former passport to the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs, but "for reasons beyond his control" he had not ceased to be considered a citizen of another country.
Now foreigners are not allowed to hold positions in the municipal service, to be employed in facilities and organizations whose activities are related to the security of Russia.
Also, a person with dual citizenship or a residence permit of another country cannot become a deputy of the State Duma or a member of the Federation Council.
The law is scheduled to come into force on September 1, 2017, by which time the necessary bylaws must be ready.
Nostalgia becomes a niche in "hot American lete" and "Product Detective"
The current iteration of history is nostalgically reminiscent at the same time of the glorious days of the characters in the 80s; of the granny era in the 90s (around the time that outstanding masters David Wayne and Michael Schovalter made the treasurer's comedy "The State" for MTV); and of itself - that is, about 2001, before its stars like Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poler and Paul Rudd moved on to more serious things.
As a fact of culture, it is simultaneously the elevation and embodiment of our era with its constant reminders from Facebook.
But as a franchise it seems anachronistic.
"The first day of the camp" was surprisingly good, and not just because of the absurd humour (including the original story of a talking jar of vegetables voiced by H. John Benjamin).
The result doubles the main joke: Middle-aged actors play sexually concerned children who have only just reached adulthood; thanks to this, the impossibility of getting back in becomes part of the joke.
"Ten years later," where adults have played already adults, has less profound emotional roots, and its parodibility is more haphazard and includes a ripper from the stalker films of the 1990s type "Rucky, rolling cradle."
In one episode, the character delivers an Apple Powerbook, four-wheeled roller skates and "a bunch of other things from 1991."
Many story moves are the same.
Good-natured Cole (Schoolter), now a writer, still hasn't achieved reciprocity from Katy (Margerit Moro).
Victor (Felipe Marino) still hasn't parted with virginity.
And there's still a mad and subdued conspiracy involving Ronald Reagan (also Schoolter), who is now incited by George W. Bush (a tried-and-tested parochial performed by Michael Jan Blake).
As always, the best part of the franchise is the retreat from it.
It is particularly amusing to see the eternally young Radda, who is singing Matt Dillon's song from "lonely," whose character, former big man Andy looks now an old man.
To bring this franchise success could be casual insanity in the spirit of the type of rerun series "Seven Up" until it reaches what I think would be its logical conclusion: "Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later," where in the last scene the whole company would go to the cinema for the premiere of "Hot American Summer."
"Comrade Detective" on Amazone turns to a different type of nostalgia: Memories of the Cold War from "Americans," "Bang blonde" or even "Bleska" with its images of the struggles of East and West.
This comedy, created by Brian Geithwood and Alessandro Tanaka with director Rizom Thomas, depicts a TV film: The Romanian police drama of the 1980s about two police officers in Bucharest fighting for truth, atheism and the Marxist-Leninist way.
The main roles - the life of Gregor and the idealist Josef - are played by Florin Piertner, Jr., and Corneliu Ulich, and announced their dialogues in English by Chenning Tatum (he is also an executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levit.
It's a brilliant idea.
But only the idea.
There are a few visual jokes (police spend time watching a chess match as Americans could watch football).
The team of famous voices behind the frame - among them Jenny Slaith, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloya Sevigny - makes it interesting to play "guess the voice."
But "Toward Detective" is so held up for a plausible clumsy propaganda drama - there's even a killer in Ronald Reagan's mask - that often looks like it.
Six long episodes are delayed, and funny happens not very and not often.
If it were to be made quiet, the Toward Detective could better handle its satire in the spirit of agitprop; for example, every time Gregor and Josef come to the American embassy, there are two thick people sitting in the lobby, absorbing a bunch of hamburgers.
To an imaginary communist viewer, this image says that Western culture is capable of making roasting out of anything.
The fictional Romanian authors of the film are not so wrong: We do so even with our own recent history, and with them too.
The prize fund of the match for the Super Cup of Russia in football between "Spartacus" and "Lokomotiv" will be about 30 million rubles.
This was announced by the President of the Russian Football Premier League (RFPL) Sergey Prydkin at a press conference.
According to the head of the RFL, the winner will receive 70% of that amount, according to RT.
He also added that by now there were almost no tickets left for the match.
The Spartak - Lokomotiv match will take place on Friday, July 14, at 21: 30.
According to TASS, "Spartak" is the current champion of the Russian Federation, and "Lokomotiv" is the owner of the Cup of the country.
Two young Ufimts cleaned furniture shop for 200 thousand rubles
The other day, the 37-year-old Ufimec, who has a furniture firm, addressed the police.
The man claimed the theft of expensive tools from the shop, causing serious damage to his production.
Two welding machines, a perforator, a hydraulics, a winch.
The guards began to search for the criminals and soon came to the residents of Blagoveshchensk district of Bashkortostan, buddies of 23 and 24 years.
According to the press service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Republic, the accomplices entered the territory of the enterprise, hacked the entrance door and delivered the tools.
Immediately afterward, the guys sold the stolen technique to the first hit car service.
A theft case has already been brought against them, and law enforcement has managed to return only a fraction of the stolen tools to the rightful owner.
The State Department commented on Medvedev's words about the relations between the Russian Federation and the United States
The US and Russia must be able to work with each other.
This statement was made by the official representative of the State Department Heather Nauert in response to the words of Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev on the relations between the two states.
Earlier, the head of the Russian government said that by adopting new anti-Russian sanctions, the US had put an end to the hope of improving bilateral relations and declared the Russian Federation a full-fledged trade war.
Commenting on these words, Nauert acknowledged that Russian-American relations are at a "low level," but noted that it is necessary to look for "areas for interaction."
"Look at the truce in southwest Syria, which has been respected for almost a month."
"And this is an example of good cooperation between the United States and Russia," the diplomat told RIA Novosti.
At the same time, a foreign ministry spokesman declined to comment on the Russian prime minister's statement that the sanctions amounted to a trade war.
A bill for new sanctions on Russia, Iran and the DPRK, U.S. President Donald Trump signed last Wednesday.
At the same time, he acknowledged that the document failed and contradicted the American Constitution.
Dior "grown" roses from amethysts and quartz
The jewelry division of the French fashion house Dior - Dior joaillerie - has added the Rose Dior Bagatelle and Bois de Rose collections.
They featured five new rings and three ring-chokers on velvet ribbons.
The Rose Dior Pré Catelan line has released two new rings and a pendant of amethysts, pink quartz and diamonds, made in the technique of glyptic (hand carving on a stone) and pavaya and dedicated to the 70th anniversary of the house.
The head of Dior joaillerie Victuar de Castellan was inspired by the roses that grew up in his estate in Granville by fashion designer Christian Dior, and the Parisian gardens of Bahamas and Bad Catelan.
Trump found guilty of deteriorating relations with Russia
Us President Donald Trump has issued harsh criticism of members of Congress.
According to the American leader, their actions have led to a deterioration in relations with Russia.
Our relations with Russia are at an unprecedented low and dangerous level.
"You can thank Congress, these same people can't even give us medicine," the president wrote on Twitter.
The day before, Donald Trump signed a law on new sanctions against Russia, Iran and the DPRK.
They will affect Russian banks and energy companies in particular.
The White House subsequently circulated a presidential statement in which he indicated that the law would prevent the United States from making lucrative deals and would further bring Russia, China and North Korea closer together.
Belarusian entrepreneur refused to buy Ukrainian daughter of Bundesbank
Viktor Prokopenya, an entrepreneur from Belarus, withdrew an application from the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) for the purchase of a subsidiary of the Bundesbank.
The businessman explained his decision with the intention to "concentrate on our other planned investments and projects we are working on."
According to Mr. Prokopeni, such a move would be "the best investment of the time," despite the investment appeal of buying a daughter of the Bundesbank.
Mr. Prokopenya became the main challenger for the purchase of a Russian bank unit in Ukraine after the NBU rejected in July the application of the consortium of Northeastern Bank Grigory Guselnikov and the Belarusian company Said Gutseriev.
Russian banks began to leave the Ukrainian market after the country's president, Petro Poroshenko, imposed sanctions on their subsidiaries in March.
One such financial institution - in addition to VTB and Vnesheconombank - was Sberbank.
Novak named cause of blackout in Crimea
The Ministry of Energy of the Russian Federation named the cause of the blackout in Crimea.
The head of the department, Alexander Novak, made an explanation about the incident.
According to him, the peninsula was left without electricity due to a traffic accident on the territory of Krasnodar Territory.
The truck caught in the accident caught the transmission lines, resulting in the outage of the Kuban and associated Crimean networks.
Power failures in major Crimean cities were recorded last week.
The specialists eliminated the problems within a few hours.
It was initially reported that the cause of the blackout could have been abnormal heat.
Bank of England to keep interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will not change after weak economic growth and weakening inflation forced stifling rumours of a possible rise.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain unhurried, and has left interest rates unchanged among the growing pressure on family incomes.
Specialists at the bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted with a result of 6 to 2 for keeping rates at 0.25 per cent, with fewer committee members in favour of a rate increase this month because weak economic growth weakened support for the increase.
In its quarterly inflation report, the bank capped its forecasts for an increase of 1.7% interest in 2017 and 1.6% in 2018 and warned that pressure on family incomes will continue, while inflation is still expected to rise to around 3% in the autumn.
However, the bank warned that rate increases in the next few years would be needed to control Brexit-induced inflation, and said it was likely that borrowing costs would have to be raised stronger than expected in financial markets.
Members of the committee also voted to abandon part of a huge set of measures to develop the economy launched a year ago as a result of Brexit.
Starting next February, the bank will close an urgent funding plan under which it provides cheap loans to banks, although it said it now has to provide an additional 15 billion pounds - up to 115 billion pounds - as part of the plan.
In the rate decision minutes, the bank said: "According to the MPC's main forecasts, gross domestic product (GDP) growth remains slow in the near term, while pressure on real household incomes continues to affect consumption."
On the issue of rates, he repeated that to suspend inflation would require "some tightening of fiscal policy," at a "slightly larger" size than markets expect.
At the moment, markets are predicting a first increase in the third quarter of next year and another one in 2020.
But the bank stressed that all increases would be "gradual" and "limited."
The bank's forecasts for increases in this and next year are lower than forecasts made in May, which were equal to 1.9 per cent and 1.7 per cent.
The bank left unchanged its forecast of 1.8% in 2018.
After that news, sterling fell against the dollar and the euro.
The pound fell 0.5 per cent to $1.31 and 0.4 per cent to 1.11 euros.
The decision not to change the rate was made after recent disappointing growth figures weakened the increased was the expectation of a rise; GDP then rose 0.3 per cent in the second quarter versus 0.2 per cent in the previous three months.
According to a bank spokesman, growth appears to remain at 0.3% in the third quarter, although it will start to increase slightly at the end of the year.
The bank's latest inflation report gave little reason for joy to households hit by high inflation and very minor wage increases: The bank said the pressure would intensify before declining.
The bank added that financial policy "cannot prevent" the impact on earnings in the next few years, but expects wages to "significantly" recover by the end of its three-year forecast.
The economy is also set to grow as a result of growing demand for British goods, driven by the low rate of the pound, which offsets some of the lower consumer spending.
The decision came a year after rates were cut to 0.25 per cent last August following the shocking results of a referendum on leaving the European Union causing the pound to fall.
The bank estimates it will likely take four years to make a full impact on prices and the economy.
Before the bank made its latest decision on rates, there was an increase in the noise surrounding the expected rate hike, as inflation increasingly pressured households: Three members of the committee were asked to raise rates to 0.5% in July.
Last month, inflation fell to 2.6 per cent from 2.9 per cent in July, although the bank said this drop was expected and is being offset again in the coming months.
The bank said the higher figure compared to the planned 2 per cent was entirely a consequence of the pound's low rate.
Andrew Montleck, director of Mortgage Brokers Koreco, said: "Given the recent fall in swap rates, it appears the mortgage market will become even more competitive again as lenders demand business opportunities and expect a good end to the year.
The market looks particularly favorable for those approaching the end of their existing contracts, as loan refinancing, often with the possibility of no commission as well as a low rate, becomes more popular than ever. "
State Health Service to write controversial HIV drug 10,000 people
Starting in September, patients will have access to a "revolutionary" HIV prevention drug after a High Court battle over funding for the drug from State Health Service funds.
The National Health Service of England has announced that pre-exposure HIV prevention (PrEP), a pill taken before sex that has been proven to reduce the risk of infection in at-risk individuals by an average of 86 per cent, will now be provided by the health service during the initial three-year probation period of about 10,000 people.
She agreed to fund the test after an appeals court upheld a High Court ruling last year alleging that the National Health Service had the ability to pay PrEP despite her claims that it should be funded by local authorities.
The move, announced on Thursday, was called a "crucial innovation" by the president of the National Health Service of England, Simon Stevens, and the National AIDS Control Authority (NAT) called it a "turning point."
Before the full launch of the programme across England by April 2018, venerological dispensaries in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield are among the first to start registering people, and more dispensaries will join the programme in October.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a course of HIV drugs taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
Research has shown that PrEP significantly reduces the risk of HIV infection among people at risk.
When taking PrEP before sex in the human body, there are enough certain drugs to prevent HIV infection.
Such drugs can be taken daily or no later than two hours before sex.
Patients eligible for the drug include homosexual and bisexual men, transgender people and people whose partners are HIV-positive and do not receive successful treatment.
Dispensaries will select suitable participants who have agreed to participate in the study, including men, women, transgender people and individuals whose partners are not aware of whether their HIV status is constrained by antiretroviral therapy.
People living and assigned to a general practitioner in England will also be able to apply for potential participation in the nearest venerological dispensary taking part in the program.
The program will cost 10 million pounds, and England's National Health Service signed a contract to provide the drug this week after an international procurement tender.
The study is designed to assess all the possibilities of PrEP by collecting clinical data on who is the target audience of the drug, its absorption and application on a large scale.
"This critical innovation should complement and strengthen large-scale and increasingly successful HIV prevention efforts.
This is another milestone in more than three decades of success in the fight against one of the biggest health threats facing humanity.
Deborah Adams, president of NAT (National AIDS Control Authority), said: "This is a turning point in the fight against HIV.
PrEP, if properly targeted at people in need of help and at risk, provides an opportunity to change the state of the HIV epidemic in England.
Starting in September, people at risk for HIV, through this study conducted in England at the expense of the National Health Service, will have access to a new enabling tool, the use of which a person can control himself without discussing it with a partner, leading to the improvement of many lives.
We warmly welcome this news. "
Jan Green, president of the Terence Wiggins Foundation, said: "The first thing to do now is to ensure that the test is deployed quickly across the country, and that no one at risk for HIV is forgotten.
Now that we are provided with the experimental drug PrEP, we are going to protect more than 10,000 people at risk for HIV. "
Shadow Public Health Minister Sharon Hodgson said: "We very much welcome the start of the PrEP test, it has been very late due to months of delays and delays by the government."
The data demonstrate how revolutionary this drug can become as part of our approach to preventing HIV and ending the transmission of this fatal infection.
This test will bring us a step closer to a full understanding of the benefits of PrEP.
It is now important that the test be deployed as soon as possible across the country to protect people at risk for HIV and move us a step further towards ending the spread of HIV in society.
World Tatars Congress passes resolution to support Tatarstan-Russia treaty
The Sixth Congress of the World Tatars Congress (WCC) adopted a resolution in which it noted the importance of maintaining the position of president in Tatarstan.
According to the document, the post is "a positive form of organization of the highest state power in the republic and expressing the national interests of all Tatar people."
In addition, the Congress stressed in the resolution the importance of the treaty on the separation of powers between Russia and Tatarstan.
According to the document, he "played a positive role in the ethnocultural, socio-economic and socio-political development of Tatarstan and the Russian Federation as a whole."
The agreement between Moscow and Kazan, which has been in force since July 24, 2007, has been concluded for 10 years.
On July 11, the deputies of the State Council of Tatarstan asked the President of Russia to extend the agreement and retain the title of the post of the head of the region.
Now Tatarstan is the only subject of the federation that has a treaty with Russia.
The head of the region is the only one whose position is called "president."
In Russia, there have been difficulties in obtaining international driver's licenses
Traffic police units are experiencing a shortage of international driving permits (MBA).
To get such rights, you have to wait for a few weeks, which has become a real problem for holiday-makers who want to leave for a holiday abroad on their car or rent it there.
It is worth noting that the situation with international driving permits remains contradictory.
The MBA was introduced to make it easier for foreign police to understand what is written in the national certificate, as the information in it is explained in five languages.
The requirements for international rights are recorded in the 1968 Vienna Convention on Road Traffic, but in countries that have ratified the Vienna Convention, Russian rights are recognized as well.
In fact, however, everything depends on a specific police or rolling office: Some require an MBA, and someone has enough national rights.
To insure, drivers of international rights do get, but it should be borne in mind that in countries that have not ratified the Convention (for example, the United States, Spain, Mexico, Indonesia), the authorities have the right not to recognize either national rights or an MBA.
Now there is a problem with forms in almost all units of traffic police, Kommersant reported, having conducted a study in a number of regions.
Thus, in Moscow in the units of the traffic police the talkers are simply not issued, the forms are not enough for four months.
It is possible to sign up for a reception on the site of public services, but there the queue has already stretched until mid-August.
In Krasnoyarsk the MBA cannot be obtained "for technical reasons," without going into details, in the Samara region honestly say that there are no forms, a similar situation is developed in other cities.
Many Muscovites have already encountered the problem, and there are more and more such messages in social networks:
Irina Burmikawa: "Guess why you can't get international rights in Moscow?"
Right, because all traffic police departments have run out of forms.
Elena Podkolinform: "The question to the knowledgeable people!"
We need to get international rights very urgently.
In Moscow all the time scored far ahead, on the place talons are not issued at all (the button is, but the talon can't give).
It seems that the portal of public services shows that in Spb of time free to fig.
Has anyone tried to get in another city?
Will it work?
According to the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation, the requirements for the forms of international driving permits have changed.
With this and the deficit may be linked, however, it is not clear what changes are in question, it has not been previously reported.
The forms are purchased by the Center of special purpose in the field of road traffic safety (CDN BDD) of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation and then supplies them to the traffic police units.
In recent years, all contracts have been concluded with Gosign JSC: In 2014-2015, nearly 200,000 MBA forms were produced, 15,000 forms were purchased in 2016, 90,000 in 2017, but the last contract was concluded on July 18 with First Print Court LLC for the production of 70,000 forms.
There is a version that the CTN simply did not manage to hold the tender in time, which caused the deficit.
However, there are other versions of the shortage of forms: Because of the crisis, many people began to travel on their own not to Europe, but to cheaper Asian countries - China, Thailand, and so on.
What rights take there is not clear until the end, so people are reinsured, so there has been an agonising demand for international "crowns."
It has recently become known that professional drivers will have to take an exam to confirm their qualifications.
The Ministry of Transport made such a proposal.
The international driving licence (MBA) of the new model has been valid since May 31, 2011.
Ukraine's justice minister refuses to believe in construction of Crimean bridge
Ukrainian Justice Minister Pavel Petrenko said he did not believe in Russia's ability to build a bridge to Crimea.
About it on Friday, August 4, he said in an interview with the portal "Explorer."
No self-respecting international company will even put a swamp or gamble there because it risks losing its business on the territory of the EU, the United States, Japan - in countries that have joined sanctions against Russia over Crimea.
"That is, I am deeply convinced that there are no prospects for this project," Petrenko said.
He added that he believes Russia is incapable of implementing a major infrastructure project on its own.
Russia cannot build smaller facilities as well.
I know that after the Sochi Olympics whole stadiums have already begun to be destroyed.
"Therefore, I believe the best tool in this situation is sanctions against companies that have been so short-sighted to join this project," the official said.
On July 31, the builders completed the construction of the car arch of the Crimean bridge.
On the Kerch bank the construction of the road arch of the Crimean bridge has been completed: Its structure is closed at the height of 45 meters from the base of the construction.
"At the same time, the bridge builders prepared a railway arch for installation on the fairway supports," the project's information center reported.
In April, the head of the Ministry of Transport, Maxim Lebedev, informed Russian President Vladimir Putin that the construction of the facility was ahead of schedule.
The Crimean bridge will connect the Crimean peninsula and the Krasnodar region.
Spain fired official who didn't go to work for 10 years
What angelic patience (or absolute indifference to public service) should the boss of Spanish official Carles Rojo have?
The permanent stroll stretched for 10 long years.
However, Mr. Rojo was still fired.
But not by his immediate chief.
What only in the world of bureaucrats doesn't happen.
They seem to have long been used to all the saloons of the "servants of the people."
And yet officials all the time manage to surprise those on whose taxes they live well.
This time, the "sensation" complained from Spain.
There, Valencia archive officer Carles Rojo managed for a decade not to go to work.
At the same time, he regularly received a salary.
And all solid - 50 thousand euros a year.
And here Mr. Rojo's "miracle times" are over.
He was fired by a decision of Valencia's legislative assembly.
The investigation revealed that the ill-fated trucker came to the office at 07: 00 every working morning to mark up in the electronic system.
And immediately I went home.
Once again he appeared in the workplace at 4pm to mark again in the system that he was gone.
And so 10 years.
It also became known that all the free time the absentee devoted to drawing comics at home.
Now, members of Valencia's legislature are thinking about how to punish Mr. Rojo's immediate chief, who could not help but know how to "work actively" in his workplace by his subordinate.
Judges offer to protect from chairmen
The Presidential Council for Human Rights (HRC), on behalf of Vladimir Putin, has developed proposals to strengthen the independence of the judicial branch.
The HRC proposes that the powers of the chairmen of the courts be limited and that they be elected.
For appeal and appeal courts, the HRC wants to introduce special districts that will not be tied to the administrative-territorial division in the Russian Federation.
The Supreme Court should also submit its proposals within the framework of the presidential order.
The HRC has finalized proposals that will strengthen the independence of Russian justice.
The HRC conducted this work on behalf of Vladimir Putin on January 3, 2017, which the president gave after meeting with council members.
The meeting with members of the council on December 8, 2016 discussed, among other things, individual cases of judicial arbitrary conduct, as well as problems of public control in places of detention of citizens (see "The Post" dated December 9).
The work of the HRC resulted in 25 proposals addressing both the issues of ensuring the independence of judges and the detection of judicial errors, as well as the financing of courts and legal education.
One of the ideas of Kremlin human rights activists is to limit the powers of court presidents to increase the independence of the remaining judges.
If a candidate for the position of judge has successfully passed the contest and received the support of the judicial community, the chairman of the court, according to the HRC, should submit it to the appointment without having the right to refuse, as the law now allows.
It is also proposed to deprive the President of the right to allocate cases between judges.
To do this, experts admit, can a specially written computer program.
The HRC also considers that the chairman does not have the right "to determine the results of the qualification certification of the judge, to initiate his disciplinary responsibility, to make decisions on the establishment of additional material payments."
At the same time, the Presidential Council considers it necessary to proceed to "the election of the presidents of the courts by the judges themselves" and "to empower them for a relatively short period of time with mandatory rotation."
Now all the presidents of the courts (from republican to district) are appointed for six years by the president on the proposal of the Chairman of the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation.
In order to protect judges from the pressure of regional administrations, the HRC proposes to organize a new appeal and appeal in the courts of general jurisdiction.
Now their structure is tied to the administrative-territorial division in the Russian Federation.
The HRC says that "it is necessary to ensure the organization of separate courts of appeal and appeal courts not at the level of the regional judicial bodies in the constituent entities of the Russian Federation, but in the judicial districts."
Experts take as a basis the practice of arbitration courts.
There are "judicial districts" that do not coincide with the administrative division in the Russian Federation, but thus guarantee greater independence from regional officials, who are hampered by the use of "telephone law."
The HRC's justices of the peace are proposing to strengthen the people's jurors to consider some "categories of civil and administrative cases" with their participation.
For example, deprivation of parental rights, restoration at work, protection of honour and dignity, deprivation of driver's license, etc.
"These are just our proposals," a member of the HRC, retired Constitutional Court judge Tamara Morschmidt, explained to the Post.
She also recalled that the president's order related not only to the HRC, but also to the Supreme Court (SC), which has yet to disclose its proposals.
The time for execution of the order from the Armed Forces (among the co-performers - the Prosecutor General's Office and the Commissioner for Human Rights in the Russian Federation) is still there.
To report to Vladimir Putin on how effectively the independence of justice is ensured in the Russian Federation, the chairman of the Armed Forces, Vyacheslav Lebedev, is due until September 1.
Living a high life: The half-floor and tricky design receptions have turned this small apartment in Earls Court into a spacious dwelling
Joan Lee, a former banker fond of renovating the property, moved from a spacious house in Naytsbridge to an apartment in Earls Court in 2014.
The apartment is on the ground floor of a nice Queen Anne-style model house, and in favour of the new design says that Joan has not collected his belongings and has not moved again.
"I used to live with my ex in Naytsbridge on a much larger square," Joan tells me.
"I was looking for something comparable for my money.
I was shown this apartment in Earls Court, and there were the same high ceilings here.
I fell in love with her and offered a price on the same day. '
Since first viewing, the 1,000-square-foot apartment has undergone a complete renovation.
Initially it was an apartment with a one-bedroom complex layout - to get into the bedroom, needed to go through the kitchen - and Joanna wanted to add spaces to store things and a half-floor to squeeze the maximum benefit out of the generous height of the ceilings.
"I wanted high ceilings, big windows, a lot of light.
Those were my demands, "she says.
To that end, she hired Erfan Astor from the Notting Hill-based architectural and design studio, Duck & Shed, to use the 12.5-foot-high ceilings and create a dwelling that would not only be a successful project, but would year Joan for life.
The ceiling was not high enough to arrange two premises one over the other, so the architectural challenge was to create a half-floor where one could stand in full growth.
Erfan had to think creatively to deal with the briff.
"Working with steel designs is very complex," he explains.
'We needed to so position the premises so that they were one over the other, and didn't have to bend.
It was necessary not just to build a simple platform, but to curl the structures so that they were at the right height and allowed to use the premises from above and below. "
This decision allowed Erfan to arrange two full-size rooms one over the other in a given space - and a lot more interesting.
From the half-floor through a vintage copper light window from "Retrouvius" overlooks the chic living room below.
Mirrored furniture with golden trim, silver accents and vintage lighting fixtures from Serge Muya set the style of the project.
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding spectacular, expanse and light.
The short corridor is framed with mirrors to make it seem longer.
In the kitchen, a mirrored protective panel seems like a window into another room.
At the entrance, mirror cabinets serve to store all of Joan's utensils.
To create a sense of a more luxurious space, the beauty of the living room can country the kitchen when it is not enjoyed.
There is nothing new in the folding kitchens.
The uniqueness of this kitchen is that it's sliding up the door like in the garage.
"Engineering art was involved here," erfan said of the reinforced steel of the fibrous shield door.
'it's equipped with a counterweight, so when you push the door up, it slips very easily. '
Thanks to the reasonable use of space and storage spaces, Joan received an extra 16 square metres, an extra bedroom and an improved layout.
"At the end of the day, the floor area is exactly what you will sell, that is, what your real estate is valued for," says erfan.
"Roughly speaking, the real estate agent will enter and make calculations on the basis of the floor area."
Here they were able to increase the floor area using high-quality materials that give the space a shade of luxury.
"Materials are what we touch, so they help create an emotional connection with the home," says erfan.
"No one falls in love with the wiring in the walls.
It's important, but it doesn't defy the strings of our hearts. '
This is a testament to the fact that the apartment can turn from something ordinary to something stunning.
In fact, like Joan, you can decide to stay.
The government has approved the creation of a commission on cultural policy
The Russian government has approved the creation of a commission on state cultural policy.
The relevant ruling is published on the government's website.
According to the document, the main task of the commission will be to develop and adjust strategic approaches to the implementation of cultural policy.
The commission will also develop draft strategies of cultural policy, clarify tasks and prepare new programs for its implementation.
The head of the commission was appointed Deputy Chairman of the Government of the Russian Federation.
The composition of the commission will be approved separately.
Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev in 2016 approved a plan to implement the state cultural policy strategy until 2030.
The plan includes 193 events and includes measures to expand the influence of Russian culture in other countries, to preserve a single cultural space and cultural heritage, and it will contribute to the creation of conditions for the development of culture in the country.
G20 inflation falls to eight-year low
Consumer price growth in the G20 countries has fallen to minimum values in the past eight years, The Wall Street Journal reported, citing data from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).
The OECD estimates that inflation in June 2016 was 2% - lower values were recorded in October 2009, when the price growth index reached 1.7%.
Rossini has previously reported a 0.1% decline in Russia's consumer price index.
So the agency recorded the first week-long deflation in 2017.
The rate of inflation in Russia, according to the Ministry of Finance, is 4.1%.
The Ministry of Economy, however, believes that the target value has already been achieved - according to this department, the figure is 4%.
Putin warns against illegal cutting of Baikal taiga
Russian leader Vladimir Putin warned against illegal destruction of forests during a meeting on the ecological development of the natural Baikal territory.
During the event, Minister of Natural Resources Sergei Donskaya noted that a bill had been prepared earlier.
It permits logging during the elimination of fires, and the government plans to take it in the fall.
In turn, the president said that this project should be monitored to ensure that the cutting process "does not cut everything in a row."
Donskaya noted that this bill involves control by the Ministry of Emergency Situations and supervisory agencies.
Media: WSU fighters in secret from command agree with Donbass militia
A regular telephone connection has been established on the armed confrontation line in Donbass.
The fighters of the opposing sides constantly communicate with each other on mobile phones, and about this communication is not known in the headquarters.
WSU fighters and the Donbass militia set up cell phone communication in secret from their high command.
This was reported on August 4 by "Strana.ua" referring to the participants of the military operation in Donbass.
According to the publication, the unit commanders are well aware of the names of their colleagues on the opposite side of the front and communicate with them on a daily basis by phone.
Communication is not domestic at all: Commanders are trying to reach some "tactical arrangements."
Often according to the results of such conversations there is a truce on a certain section of the front.
Journalists were made aware of cases where birthday greetings were received by an officer from behind the front line, from his formal enemy.
WSU fighters and DNR and LHP militias have been sitting in trenches on the boundary line since the spring of 2014, when Ukraine launched a combat operation against Donbass.
Ministry of Foreign Affairs ousted blocking of UN Security Council statements on attacks on Russian Embassy
The Russian Foreign Ministry is outraged by the actions of individual Western diplomatic representatives who block statements by the UN Security Council in the press condemning the terrorist attacks on the Russian Embassy in Syria.
This is reported by the Russian Foreign Ministry.
The ministry recalled that on August 2, the territory of the Russian Embassy in Damascus was shelled for the third time in a month by terrorist groups Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (formerly Jabhat al-Nusra, banned in the Russian Federation) and Faylak Al-Rahman.
Taking into account that the international community is unanimous in the qualification of "Nusra" as a terrorist organization, and the UN Security Council resolutions call for opposition to this structure, the Russian Foreign Ministry noted that "it would seem self-evident that the terrorist attacks of" Nusra "should be met with universal unconditional and decisive condemnation, and there should be no ambiguity in the assessments of the attacks against diplomatic missions."
However, as the diplomatic department stressed, "for the third time in a month, the diplomatic representatives of the United States, the United Kingdom, France, and Ukraine on the UN Security Council, alternately, varying the tone of objections, covering up arguments about the alleged lack of necessary information, blocked the Russian Federation's proposal to adopt a standard short draft of a Security Council statement to the press condemning terrorist attacks on Russian diplomatic representation in the Syrian capital."
The unwillingness to show diplomatic solidarity with us will remain on the conscience of these delegations.
"The most outrageous thing is that the failure of the Security Council to condemn terrorist acts encourages them to engage in new provocations and terrorist attacks, gives them a sense of impunity," the Foreign Ministry said, adding that "it would not be desirable for these barbarians to create a belief that someone in the Security Council is with them."
Vladimir Putin has advocated limiting the number of out-of-plan business checks
Russian President Vladimir Putin said during a meeting on investment projects in the Far East that the number of out-of-plan inspections of entrepreneurs should be reduced to 30% of the number of planned ones, as well as the need to limit the duration of inspections to ten days.
"Extraordinary checks are carried out, as a rule, without appropriate coordination with the prosecutor's office; only 2-3% is agreed with the prosecutor's office, everything else goes on its own," the president was quoted as saying by TASS.
Vladimir Putin also said it was necessary to ban investigators from seizing servers and hard drives at businesses.
In addition, according to the president, business associations should be given the right to defend the interests of their members in court.
"This, I hope, will make a certain positive in the consideration of business-related cases or related to the violation of the law in the sphere of entrepreneurship," the head of state said.
As Kommersant reported, due to the moratorium on scheduled inspections, the number of other types of inspections of entrepreneurs is increasing.
In May, a survey was commissioned by the business ombudsman under Russian President Boris Titova, which revealed that there had actually been a substitution of scheduled checks by out-of-plan (the proportion facing them rose from 21.9 per cent in 2015 to 30.8 per cent in 2016), prosecutors (from 16.9 per cent to 21.8 per cent), raiders (from 7.9 per cent to 13.3 per cent), as well as checks on citizens' applications (up from 15 per cent to 19.5 per cent), and administrative investigations (10.8 per cent to 15.5 per cent).
More about the business checks in the material "Ural" "To small business came from the other side."
Brothers fight for a real estate empire worth more than $500 million
The two brothers are fighting for one of Victoria's largest real estate empires worth more than $500 million - forty years after their Italian ancestors founded the dynasty.
Former Fulton Football Club director and developer Colin de Lutis lives in Turak Palace three doors away from his younger brother Paul, who has filed a lawsuit against him in the Supreme Court over the division of possessions and assets.
Paul wants to leave the family business since 2014, but a fierce dispute over the terms of the divorce is pending in the Supreme Court.
Along with their mother Anna, the brothers own 87 objects worth more than half a billion dollars bought since their family bought a shop on Smith Street in Collingwood in 1973.
There, the family founded the firm Westco Jeans, which grew into a network of 160 outlets.
It was sold in 1999 for $85 million.
The money has been invested in real estate, and the De Lutis family's list of possessions today includes office buildings, development sites in Chesapeake and Sorrento, apartments on the Gold Coast and Mount Buller and shopping malls in the suburbs.
Under an arrangement with the late father, Colin - whom Paul describes as the "main driving force and dominant personality" of the De Lutis family - owns roughly two-thirds of the company's assets, and Paul is about one-third.
According to the court, that means Colin's property is 316 million and Paul's is 176 million.
The division of property and money has become a stumbling block for Paul.
"The section proposed by Colin gives him, in my opinion, the best parts of the property," he wrote in his first testimony in 2015.
The first Supreme Court hearings were held last Friday after several failed reconciliation attempts.
The brothers are now arguing about who will control the existing business - of which Paul believes Colin has ruled it out.
Colin claims this is not the case, but accuses Paul of incompetent management of some objects.
In testimony given by Colin early in the process, he says he hopes to resolve the dispute.
"My Italian roots make me consider family a top priority," he wrote.
Court costs are rising as a snowball: Hundreds of pages of testimony, emails and reports from companies such as Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer are attached to the case; both sides have attracted the most prominent lawyers, including royal lawyer Allan Myers, and the best shake-ups.
Mrs De Lutis and her late spouse Luigi were immigrants from Italy; since the late 1950s, they have run milk bars and gastronoms, and in the early 1970s bought a shop in Chesapeake.
Under financial guarantees, they bought a shop in Collingwood in which Colin opened the first family jeans shop.
Colin says he launched Westco when he was "in the last grades of school, and Paul was then a boy (about 10 years old)."
Anna De Lutis says they with Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to hand over their possessions to sons without conflict.
"Luigi often told me that he did not want the brothers to be dealt with in court," she wrote.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of De Lutis's group of companies; Colina says Mark got 10 million when he went out of business, and Luke 26 million.
According to Paul, both Luke and Mark were "unhappy with the financial conditions of their office."
Colin was not a public figure, although he was a former member of the AFL club's board of directors and, according to a 2015 biography of Eddie McGir, the TV star's best friend.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul and their lawyers on Friday.
Only Colin replied, with a text message saying that because the case had not yet been heard in court, "I have nothing to say."
"I am very-very sorry that my brother Paul decided to file a lawsuit against me and crack down in court the name of our family," he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote in testimony that he had tried to satisfy his brother's demands.
"Our father wouldn't want to see us with Paul arguing in court," he said, adding that he "still hopes to resolve the conflict."
On Friday, that hope apparently dissipated.
"The judgment in our case will soon be handed down by the court," Colin wrote.
Trump's new chief of staff plans to limit the flow of information to the president.
Others tried to do it and were defeated.
Maybe John F. Kelly will really succeed.
In that case, he will be the first.
Politico reports that the new White House chief of staff plans to limit the flow of information coming to President Trump, including news reports from the media - hoping to keep the Swede in a quieter state.
That's what reporter Josh Lizzie reports.
"At a meeting held by the new White House chief of staff, John F. Kelly, with the leadership of the apparatus on his first working day, he outlined the main problem in the White House under President Donald Trump, which he hopes to address: Bad channels of getting information to the president."
Kelly told staff that information should go through it - in paper form or through briefings - because the president would be better off making decisions if he was getting the right information.
Kelly's diagnosis is perfectly true, but others have already failed in trying to pacify Trump by tracking the proceeds of information to him.
President Trump's relationship with television developed decades ago - and now that he's in the White House, his habit of watching TV is still strong.
"When Trump, as a candidate, resented unfair coverage of the campaign, it was helpful to demonstrate to him that he was getting fair coverage in publications that could be reconvinced," Sam Nanberg, a former adviser to the election staff, told Politico in February.
Tara Palmeri wrote at the time in Politico that "according to six former members of the election staff, to keep in check Trump's habit of writing on Twitter, it was necessary to ensure that there was a constant stream of praise in the information coming personally to him."
Good.
But the idea that Trump's habit of writing on Twitter has ever been "under control" is simply ridiculous.
Maybe these members of the election staff know something that we don't know - for example, that if it weren't for them, Trump's tweets would be even more provocative.
We may never know about tweets that Trump has not published.
If his staff ran him out of trouble at least a few times, their efforts were not in vain.
But no one has always been able to keep Trump from pouring oil into the fire.
Part of the problem is that in a White House divided into rival factions, people are constantly trying to advance their agenda by feeding Trump material - reliable or not - that confirms their views.
"Politico" - just to this story - wrote in May about the propensity of advisers to constantly subpoena the president with questionable information.
Here's one example described by reporter Sheen Goldmacher:
'current and former Trump staffers say Trump can respond very sharply to negative press reports, especially containing dangerous leaks of information, and won't calm down until he finds who was behind them.
That was the case at the end of February, when someone succumbed to the president's printout of an article with GotNews.com, the website of the internet watchdog Charles K. Johnson, in which Deputy Chief of Staff Katy Welsh was accused of being "behind a number of leaks" at the White House.
It doesn't matter that Johnson is forever banged on Twitter for aggressive behavior, that he didn't provide specific facts or that in the past he launched false accusations and then denied them.
Trump read the article and started asking staff about Welsh. "
Goldmacher adds that then-Chief of Staff Reince Pribus and Secretary of Staff Rob Porter "tried to build a system to manage the flow of papers that Trump receives and document them."
How did it work?
Three months later, Kelly is trying to do the same.
Maybe he will prove to be a more effective manager than Pribus, but Trump still has an impulsive onslaught, and his aides are still fighting each other for influence.
These constant factors make Kelly's task very difficult.
Tyumen prosecutor's office fights HIV dissident
The prosecutor's office challenged the ruling of the Kalinskiy District Court of Tyumen, which terminated the criminal case against a local woman who died of HIV from a young daughter.
According to the investigation, the child was killed because the mother was an HIV dissident and refused treatment.
However, the court relieved her of responsibility for the reconciliation with the injured father.
The prosecutor's office believes the crime cannot be left unpunished so as not to set a precedent for other HIV dissidents.
The case against a resident of Tyumen was brought under Part 1 of Article 109 of the Criminal Code (causing death by negligence) in April - after her three-year-old daughter died of HIV infection.
According to the prosecutor's office, the mother herself is HIV-infected.
"The woman did not treat herself and refused to treat her daughter, believing that HIV infection does not exist," the prosecutor's office of the Tyumen region explained.
The criminal case came to the Kalininsky District Court of Tyumen, which on July 25 decided to terminate it.
A motion to do so was filed by the father of the deceased girl, explaining that he "forgave his wife, has no claims against her, she has made harm and has apologized."
The prosecutor's office disagreed with the court's decision and appealed, demanding that the order to dismiss the case be overturned and sent to a new hearing.
The girl died, and the harm caused by the crime is not possible.
The HIV-infected mother, contrary to the recommendations of doctors, refused to examine the baby and treat her from a dangerous infection, "the press service of the prosecutor's office reported.
According to the oversight body, it should be punished, otherwise other HIV dissidents will follow suit.
According to the Tumen AIDS Center, now in the Tyumen region about 12 children with HIV do not receive medical care due to the refusal of their parents.
"And this situation has already improved - during the year of work of the special group, half of parents who categorically refused to treat children from HIV changed their opinion - allowed to carry out diagnostics, began to take drugs," said Elena Loseva, a spokeswoman for the AIDS Center.
According to her, the legislative way to influence parents is impossible, and as a result not all HIV-infected children can be found - mothers are not allowed to examine them, hide, run away with children from hospitals.
What the dangers of HIV dissidents are
Late last year, St. Petersburg sociologists presented the results of Russia's first study of the so-called HIV-dissident movement.
HIV dissidents call people who deny the existence of HIV and refuse to take medication.
NGOs and activists of AIDS-service NGOs call such views anti-medical, and in their spread see a serious threat.
The grisly photo session, which ended in tragedy, took place on Thursday, August 3, at Grechana railway station in Khmelnytsky.
The fun company of drinking young people was walking a bridge over the railway tracks where a freight train was just standing.
One of the friends had the idea of making a spectacular selfie on the roof of the wagon, FACTAM reported in the police communications sector in Khmelnytsky region.
The guy began to descend from the bridge to the train, but because of his indiscretion, chased over the power line and instantly got hit by the current.
Fortunately, this case became known to the station dispatcher, who immediately caused "urgency."
Prior to the arrival of the doctors, the victim was moved to a safe place and then hospitalized in the burn department of Khmelnytsky Regional Clinical Hospital.
The man was diagnosed with burns to the torso of 1-2 degrees.
Now his condition doctors assess as stable.
Law enforcement officials recall that extreme selfies on the roofs of multi-floors, bridges, moving transport have become increasingly popular recently.
Police are urging people to be vigilant and prevent similar photo sessions, especially among children and teenagers.
Scientists allowed the existence of oceans on ancient Venus
Oceans could exist on ancient Venus.
This assumption was made by French scientists.
Specialists created a computer model that demonstrated the process of water formation on the surface of planets, writes Science News.
It turned out that the oceans formed on Venus at the beginning of its history, which had 10% more water than it is now on Earth.
Earlier, Arguments of the Week wrote that, according to the scientists' hypothesis, the ocean 4 billion years ago could exist on Mars.
Foreign specialists in the course of their research concluded that the water object was located on the northern hemisphere of the Red Planet.
Three people injured in San Francisco park shooting
In San Francisco, three people were injured in the shooting, the Associated Press reported.
The incident took place in Dolores Park when a significant number of visitors were there.

The concert of rock band Louna will take place in Barnaul on October 17.
The musicians will present their new album, "The Wild New World," which has become one of the most anticipated releases of the year.
The team is preparing a conceptual show, which will be the brightest in the band's concert history.

Its name is associated with O.Huxley's well-known novel-anti-utopia "About the wondrous New World."
The new songs do not recount the book, but talk about a society that lives by the law of anti-utopia, "believing in propaganda and imposed values."
The project was supported by more than 1200 people.
Louna released her first album, "Make Gromce!" In 2010.
Two years later, the musicians presented the album "Time X," and in 2013 they recorded the album "We are Louna" (2013).
In the fall of 2015, the Louna band performed with the Symphony Orchestra at Crocus City Hall with the Songs of the World program.
As a part of the band Larrie Tsykyan (vocals), Vitaliy Demisoko (bass-guitar), Nikita Kazaryan (guitar), Sergey Ponmultiyev (guitar), Leonid Kinzbursky (drums).
The concert will take place in the Barnaul club "Farage" on October 17 at 19.00.
Ticket price: From 1200 to 2,600 rubles.
Louna is one of the popular bands on the Russian rock scene.
The team was founded in 2008.
Their debut concert took place in 2009.
The band has won several times in different nominations of the hit parade "Chertov Dustin."
Roma overcame rov and returned to "millionaires street"
Some of the West Midlands's wealthiest homeowners are again in conflict with determined gypsies who have overcome a dug-out by municipal authorities to retake the field next to their homes.
Roma have parked 20 homes on wheels in a field bordering the rich Solihalla street, which has been jokingly called "millionaire street."
Bringing with them horses, babies and many houses on wheels, they returned after they were driven no further than in May, and they were not prevented by the roars dug up by municipal authorities to prevent them from invading.
This tactical company found a gap in defensive structures and wiped its vehicles through the site, which left unsecured to leave room for a path.
Angry residents attacked the municipality of Solihalla, saying it was "unable to solve this problem."
An anonymous local resident said: 'They arrived here on Monday evening, after being driven out of Bentley Hit, where they shoved rocks at passers-by.'
The municipality should be ashamed and forced to act because they are completely unable to solve this problem.
Roma were here in May, they were swallowed, and here they came back again.
More Roma arrived last night, and perhaps more today.
"The municipality of Birmingham knows how to solve this problem, they get long-term court orders to protect their parks," she added.
I live on Stritsbrook Road and I don't like that I keep paying municipal tax and the municipality can't even put an end to it. '
One local resident, who wished to remain anonymous, said: "It's funny, we've just seen these gypsies leave the previous time, and here, please, this attack continues."
This time there were more of them, and we even saw a horse on the meadow. "
A spokesman for Solihalla municipality said: "We are aware of an illegal camp on the ground near Stritsbrook Road and are cooperating with Solihalla Police; we are taking the necessary legal action to drive them out as soon as possible."
To help us collect evidence, it is very important that as many locals as possible report any anti-social or criminal behaviour to the police on 101.
This provides an insight into the situation that the court will consider when we present our case to them.
Crimea accompanies "New Light" champagne wine factory
According to the order of the Minister of Property and Land Relations of Crimea Anna Anyukhina.
100% of the shares of the enterprise will remain in the state property of Crimea.
The authorized capital of the joint-stock company will be 595.5 million rubles and will consist of 5,955 million ordinary shares with a nominal value of 100 rubles each.
The Ministry of Agriculture of Crimea stated that if there were no funds to upgrade the plant within the next three years, there would be a threat to stop the plant.
The wear of fixed assets at the enterprise is about 60-70%.
Due to the peculiarities of the organizational and legal form it is obliged to give 50% of the profit to the income of the budget.
What remains is not enough to implement the modernization plan.
"Getting money from the owner is problematic, talking about raising borrowed funds of big credit institutions is difficult," said Sergey Petelin, deputy head of the Ministry of Agriculture of Crimea, in April this year.
Crimea's parliament has included the enterprise in a forecast privatization plan for 2017.
It was suggested that it be acclaimed and put up for auction.
The source of "Interfax" in the authorities of Crimea estimated the possible cost of selling the enterprise at $40 million, the investor's investment in modernization - another $30 million.
"New Light" in 2016 increased the production of sparkling wines by 2.8% compared to the level of 2015 - to 1.52 million bottles.
In 2017, New Light intended to release 1.6 million bottles.
The enterprise was founded in 1878 by Prince Leo Golitsyn as a plant for the production of sparkling wine in his acquired estate New Light.
The plant is located on 11 hectares of land.
Lower-town anglers have smashed more than 40 gravestones
Employees of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Nizhny Novgorod region identified the citizens who destroyed 46 gravestones in the cemetery of the city of Lyskovo.
The attackers were third-grade students.
The first statement that the graves were damaged by the unknown came to the Russian police department in the Lyskovskiy district as early as June 27.
A total of 24 people contacted the police on this occasion.
As a result, a criminal case was initiated under Article 244 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation "The destruction, damage or desecration of burial sites."
As a result of the investigation, the police identified the suspects, and they were two schoolchildren aged 8 and 9.
Juvenile offenders told police they were interested to see how the monuments were falling, which prompted them to hooligan actions.
Preventive measures were carried out with children and their parents.
Italy is tightening the tone on NGO ships rescuing migrants.
Italy has warned NGOs owned by rescue vessels in the Mediterranean that they will not be able to continue working unless they comply with the new rules governing their activities.
"If NGOs do not comply with the new code of conduct, it is difficult to say whether they will be able to continue their activities," Interior Minister Mario Minniti told the Turkish daily Stampa.
Minniti's warning came a day after Italian authorities confiscated a vessel belonging to the German humanitarian organization Jugend Rettet on suspicion that its crew was actually cooperating with human traffickers and facilitating illegal immigration.
The humanitarian organization, which has worked for just a year, declined to comment on the merits of the detailed charges brought against it by Italian prosecutor Ambrodjo Cartorella.
"For us, saving human life is and will remain a top priority, so we are very sorry that we cannot continue to operate in the search and rescue zone now," reads the organization's statement on social media.
'We'll be able to assess all the allegations made now only after we gather all the information and be able to assess the situation. '
Italian authorities have been monitoring the Jugend Rettet-owned Yuventa vessel since October.
His crew is suspected of having whole lifeboats take on board migrants whom traffickers sent directly to them and allowed smugglers to leave along with boats they could use anew.
At least one such meeting is understood to have taken place just 1.3 miles from the Libyan coast, according to prosecution records, the contents of which were published in Italian media.
The crew is suspected of violating the prescriptions of the Italian coast authorities, who control rescue operations in the area, rather out of humanitarian zeal than for any other reason.
The code of conduct assumes mainly that Juvents-type vessels will have an Italian police officer on board to monitor their activities.
So far, only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have agreed to submit to the code: "Save the Children," Maltese moas and "Pro-Activa open arms" from Spain.
The latter said on Thursday that it considered the new rules unnecessary but acceptable provided they did not cause any "significant change or interference" to its rescue operations.
The Nobel Prize-winning Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) is among those who refused to sign.
Meanwhile, Minniti said the sharp decline in recent weeks in the number of migrants arriving in Italy as a result of rescue operations indicates that efforts to support the Libyan coastguard and cooperation with local mayors are bearing fruit.
"In recent days we have started to see the light at the end of the tunnel," the minister said.
He announced plans for further talks with Libyan mayors on economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving those countries in the hope of reaching Europe.
"In Libya, we do not want to be associated with either side of the conflict"
The authorities of the Russian Federation have recently significantly stepped up their policy in the Libyan direction, and with visits to Moscow the delegations of the opposing Libyan sides have been invited.
The head of the Russian contact group on the intra-Libyan settlement under the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation and the State Duma, the assistant to the head of the Chechen Republic, Nikita Dengov, told "Kommersant" what goals Moscow is pursuing in this region and on whom it is betting.
Almost nothing is known about the contact group on Libya that you lead.
Here, say, the contact group on Ukraine - everyone knows about it.
And here is the veil of mystery.
What exactly do you do, what goals do you pursue?
The Contact Group was created on the initiative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation and the State Duma.
Her activities are supervised by Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Bogdanov and Adam Delimkhanov (Duma deputy from Chechnya).
The latter is authorized to work in the Libyan direction by the Speaker of the State Duma, Vyacheslav Volodym.
The impetus for the formation of the group was the detention in Libya of the Russian tanker "Mechanic Chebotarev" (in September 2015, there were 11 people on board. - "Ural").
We thought about how to help the crew.
At that time a contact group of military specialists, representatives of the State Duma was created, and our work was supported by the head of Chechnya Ramzan Tigrov.
And how did it turn out that it was you who headed it?
Since I have been working on Libya since 2008, I have been asked to lead the group.
Our activity was not limited to the release of sailors from the "Chebotarean Mechanic."
We have been able to establish contacts with representatives of all the major groups opposing each other in the Libyan conflict - and from Tripoli (where the UN-recognized government, led by Faiza Saraj, is based), and with Tobruk (a parliament residence that opposes the government and supports Marshal Khalifa Thatar, who controls eastern Libya).
Thanks to the active participation of Ahmed Metig (Libya's vice-prime minister, Hezbollah), we were able to quickly negotiate the release of Russian sailors.
Then it was decided to use these contacts more effectively, to create a contact group.
Its task is analysis of the situation, identification of key factors and players, dialogue with all parties to the conflict.
I would like to emphasize that in Libya we do not want to be associated with any of the parties to the conflict, we are in dialogue with everyone.
How many people are in the contact group and how many of them are permanently in Libya?
The contact group now includes five people.
Among them are people with experience in the security forces, including the Ministry of Defence.
We also want to join a group of specialists in the region, representatives of the Institute of the Middle East of the Russian Academy of Sciences.
No one is permanently in Libya from our staff, there is no need for that yet.
Whether there are Russian military advisers, instructors in Libya now.
And if so, on whose side?
There are no Russian military specialists in Libya.
All conversations and publications about this are not true.
But in your contact group, the former military includes...
Yes, and their presence is necessary.
For example, when we visit hot spots.
Or so closed to a certain point for us a city like Misurata (where the militias that played a role in the overthrow of Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi in 2011 and visibly intensified in the following years are based).
We came to Misurat in January this year.
We were scared, they said that there were all Islamists, terrorists.
But it was important for us to assess the situation there, to analyze the real military potential, who is in charge, why there are such rumors, what the role of Islamists really is.
In Misurat, we met with all the representatives of the squad who were engaged in the destruction of ISIS in Sirte (in December 2016, this city on the Mediterranean coast was taken away from the militants of Russia's banned Islamic State, the Pentagon).
We wanted to look at them, to get to know these people, to check the information that it was they who played a crucial role in the destruction of ISIS in Libya, and not Khalifa Mukhtar, who attributed these merits to himself.
And to what conclusion have you come?
"The Islamic State" in Libya has not won the Mukhtar?
He was not doing it.
Ultar carried out operations on a different front, in Benghazi.
And with ISIS in Sirte fought structures subordinate to the government in Tripoli.
And, by the way, we invited the people who carried out this anti-terrorist operation to Russia.
And they arrived - the visit lasted from 19 to 23 April this year, the Libyan delegation took in the Federation Council, the Duma, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the RosGuard.
You, as we have understood, are in all Libyan regions and probably imagine the sentiments of local elites and field commanders.
Do you think it will be possible to implement the cease-fire agreements, the elections reached at the end of July in Paris by Khalifa Mukhtar and Faiz Saraj?
Or again, as has happened repeatedly in the past, the agreements will be thwarted, the fighting will resume, the parties will try to seize power alone?
For us, it was already a good signal that Saraj and Mukhtar agreed to another meeting, not so long ago it was impossible.
In the recent past, the two leaders have been extremely negative about each other.
And as for Russia's position...
It is often written and said that Moscow is an active supporter of Naftar, many believe in it.
We were faced with this situation when we were in Misurat, and the Russian aircraft carrier Admiral Kuznetsov was on board that day.
It was a coincidence.
But Misurat did not believe in coincidence.
We were told, "You're probably very brave people that came to us just today."
But our task is just to show: We do not support only the Nustar, we are engaged in a dialogue with all the key actors in the conflict in Libya.
You have been in touch with the Emperor.
Does mutual understanding with Russian partners on a human, emotional level facilitate the fact that he studied twice in the USSR?
And, by the way, does Rittar know the Russian language?
The Russian, if he knows, is very concerning.
But what he has learned from us, of course, facilitates dialogue with him.
And by the way, not only with him.
When we communicate with the military in Tripoli and Misurat, we meet generals who have studied either in Russia or in the Soviet Union.
And here they speak perfectly in Russian.
And are drawn to Russia, to some extent experience nostalgia for it.
Do you think that the arms embargo imposed on Libya is likely to be lifted?
Are your Libyan interlocutors interested in the supply of Russian weapons?
We are interested, of course, but, as I have already said, we do not take any side in this conflict and do not want to arm some to the detriment of others.
We would like everyone to be in roughly equal positions.
With regard to the arms embargo, there are constant calls from the Libyan people for Russia to somehow facilitate its withdrawal.
The constitution-making process is now actively advancing in Libya.
We hope that the parties will reach compromise solutions and achieve internal consensus.
Then the elections are to be held, as was mentioned at the meeting of Saraja and Khaztar.
If elections are held and a legitimate authority is finally elected (and now neither party has such a status), it is possible to put the issue of lifting the arms embargo in the UN Security Council.
Raising this issue is now pointless and dangerous, it will only lead to an escalation of the conflict.
The other day, the media reported that Italy, faced with the problem of African refugees sailing from Libya, feels abandoned by EU allies.
Can Moscow, in this situation, help Italian partners by using its ties with the Libyan?
How realistic, for example, is the option that the Nustar units will establish control over the coast and put an end to the business of smugglers moving immigrants to Europe?
A very timely question.
We are actively working on this.
The Italians need the support of Russia, because Moscow is engaged in a dialogue at the same time with Naftar, and with Saraj, and with Misurat and the south of the country.
And in this matter, tribes in southern Libya play a big role, and they are ready to cooperate with Russia.
Is it for southerners to stem the flow of migrants on far-flung subways?
That is to say, the buses in which the Nigerian migrants are travelling have been deployed back?
We achieve that.
But it's not easy.
Some clans and groups are keen for these flows to keep going.
We hope to help bring the southerners together in the negotiation process between Saraj, Naftar and the tribes in the south.
But for a start, we would like to see a unity of opinion on this issue between Abertair and Saraj.
The head of the government in Tripoli, Faiz Saraj, is considered an Islamist, a supporter of the introduction of sharia law in the country.
How radical does he hold?
Wouldn't this be an obstacle in building relations with Russia or the West?
I will express my personal opinion of him.
In my opinion, he is, on the contrary, a veteran of radical Islam.
But the Islamists are in his coalition.
Yes, but he himself holds the position that Libya should be an absolutely normal country - a moderately Islamic, open world.
And he is also actively fighting terrorists.
Where does he have such a reputation?
It is created by those countries that are not interested in Russia communicating with Tripoli.
Tripoli is the capital, there is a legislative, executive and judicial branch.
There's a national oil corporation, a national bank and other state structures.
Of course, some countries were keen for us not to get there.
And we mixed all the cards and started to communicate actively with both Tripoli and Tobruk.
And we already reap the fruits of this work: Rosneft has entered into a cooperation agreement with Libya's state-owned oil company, NOC.
NOC director Mustafa Sanderson, with whom Rosneft chief Igor Sechin concluded the deal, himself directly from Tripoli.
And two weeks ago, there was the first shipment of Libyan oil to Rosneft.
What will Russia do with it?
I believe that to resell.
And what are Russia's economic interests in Libya?
There are plans to re-sign the contracts concluded under Muammar Gaddafi.
These include previous arrangements in the transport sector (railway construction), energy (electrification) and a number of others.
And the Libyan people have something to pay?
Well, they have oil.
That is to say, as with Iran, is the oil-for-services scheme?
I don't know what the scheme will be, I don't deal directly with these issues.
In fact, the economy for Russia in Libya is not the main thing.
We are there, in fact, doing peacekeeping work.
For us, the main thing is to stop the bloodshed, to help the Libyan to agree among themselves so that they can establish order and Libya has ceased to be a favorable environment for the development of terrorism.
For Russia, this is the main task - to help the Libyan people and bring out terrorists from there.
Do you have data on the presence in Libya (now or earlier) of radical fighters from Russia or other countries of the former USSR?
One of the tasks of our contact group was to find out this.
I met with a representative of the Libyan State Security Committee, who said that to date no outsiders from Russia and other countries of the former USSR are there.
He said he had about 50,000 records of telephone conversations by representatives of Islamist and radical groups (in Libya. - "Hezbollah") and Russian speech did not sound there.
And of which states are these fighters then?
I wouldn't want to go into those details.
Then we will formulate the question differently.
How much among the Islamist militants in Libya are the Libyan themselves?
There are virtually no Libyan people among them, no more than 5%.
The rest are outsiders.
Can Moscow hold intra-Libyan talks following the example of Paris?
There are such plans.
We are in active negotiations with the Libyan people, several delegations from Libya have already visited Moscow, and have declared their readiness to come to Moscow or Grozny.
And when can such negotiations take place?
Now it's hard to say.
Several visits have yet to take place, and then hopefully there will be clarity about the time and place of the negotiations.
At the Chekhov Museum, philanthropists collected money for an expensive gift to a sick boy
A nine-year-old boy, Sasha Lowola, who has an MRI, brain hydrocephaly and complete blindness, will receive a specialized treadmill as a gift on August 5.
A useful despicable will be presented to Sasha by the Minister of Culture of the Moscow region, Nikita Kosarev, and the director of the museum, Konstantin Bobkov.
The money for the simulator was collected during the charity marathon "Don't get tired of doing good," which took place in Chekhov on July 15 on the Memorial Day of Chekhov.
On the eve of the marathon, the museum received a letter from Sasha, who lives in the village of Manushkino, Chekhov district: "I don't see eyes at all, so I asked my mother to write this letter."
"I'd really like to get a treadmill as a gift so that my legs get strong, and I'd learn to walk a little bit."
And here's Sasha's dream come true!
After the presentation in the museum-reserve there will take place "Concert-postscriptum" - well-known piano, honored artist of Russia Alexander Gindin will perform popurri from popular classical works.
During the charity marathon the choir of the Woznesenskaya Davydova Pustyni, Zvonari of the workshop Ilya Drozdikhin, students of the Moscow Conservatory named after P.I. Tchaikovsky and the Russian Academy named after Gnessin, artists of the Chekhov Theatre "Chekhov Studio" performed.
Auctions were held for visitors, a book fair and a charity sale of souvenir products with a marathon logo were organized.
The museum-reserve "Chekhovo" took the initiative to make the Memorial Day of Chekhov on July 15 a single day of charity in all the museum of the Moscow region.
A 30-year-old resident of the Olevsk Zhytomyr region near the local football stadium was shot several times in the direction of the teenagers who were there.
According to the suspect, he was angered by the noise, FACTAM reported in the police communications department of the Zhytomyr region.
The man then went to a cafe nearby.
In the building, he had a conflict in which a man used a device to fire rubber bullets, injuring one of the visitors.
The 34-year-old was given the necessary medical care and there is no threat to his life.
Police and ambulance arrived at the scene, but the shooter had fled by that time.
Law enforcement officers identified him and detained him on the same day, August 2.
The man was unable to explain his actions.
He seized a device for firing rubber bullets, which was sent for examination.
Criminal proceedings have been initiated under Article 296 (hooliganism) of the Criminal Code of Ukraine.
The detainee faces 3 to 7 years in prison.
We remind that in Kiev on Lukyanovka in the area of the street of Tatarstan on the night of July 28 there was an attack with shooting.
Michelle Carter's sentence for messages prompting Conrad Roy's suicide
A Massachusetts resident has been sentenced to two-and-a-half years in prison for prompting the suicide of her boyfriend, Conrad Roy, through text messages and phone calls.
Michelle Carter, who is now 20, will have to serve 15 months of his term behind bars and another 5 years of probation.
Carter was found guilty in June of the manslaughter of Conrad Roy, who committed suicide on July 13, 2014.
Roy's father said at Thursday's hearing: 'My family is killed by grief.
My son was my best friend. '
Carter was allowed to remain at large pending an appeal.
She was threatened with a maximum term of 20 years, but her lawyers said both she and Roy suffered from mental disorders.
Carter, dressed in red trousers and a cream blouse, listened to the sentence standing, squeezing his hands and dropping his eyes.
"By her actions she killed Conrad Roy," the prosecutor told the court.
'she interrupted his life to improve his own.
She did not acknowledge responsibility, "she said.
'she didn't show remorse. '
But Carter's lawyer said it was a "tragic case that she deeply regrets."
However, Judge Lawrence Monis said he believed her "age, level of maturity or even mental illness did not significantly affect her actions."
The Prosecutor read out statements from Roy's mother, Lynn Roy, which said: "No day has passed when I would not mourn the loss of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and the way I cope - I try to support his sisters despite all the pain that will remain with us forever, "it reads.
Roy's sister Camdin Roy said she was irresistibly haunted by the idea that she would never be able to attend his wedding or become the aunt of his children.
"To lose a person who has been with me always since my birth is a pain that will stay with me until the end of my life," she said.
The case would appear to be a legal precedent, because Massachusetts does not have a law that would provide for the responsibility of advising a person to commit suicide.
Carter was 17 years old in 2014 when Roy was found dead in a car with symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning.
The case caught the attention of the entire country when it became known that he had been pushed to suicide by Carter's message.
"You can hang up, jump off the roof, tangle yourself with a knife don't know there are many ways," she wrote in several messages sent two weeks before his death as he rested with his family.
A few minutes before her suicide, she wrote, "You have to do this, Conrad" and "You only have to turn on the monitor, and you become free and happy."
Judge Monis said Carter wanted to get attention through Roy's death, and banned her from communicating with the press to prevent her from getting the desired one.
Lawyers "opinions on the matter were divided.
One of the few to defend Carter was Amanda Knox, who was convicted in 2007 of the murder in Italy of her British neighbor's apartment and acquitted two years later.
The 30-year-old Knox published his special opinion in the Los Angeles Times, claiming: "Michelle Carter deserves sympathy and help, not prison."
Eugene Bogachev: "I let Langford down like a high-flight bird"
One of VTB United League's best basketball players, 33-year-old Kevin Langford left UNICS.
The departure of the American protector of the "mosques" was commented by the president of the UNICIDE, Evgeny Bogachev.
Diana made this decision for family reasons, "said Evgeny Bogachev.
He has a small child, a wife who didn't want to move to Kazan.
Diana wants to be closer to home.
I decided to go to meet him.
Of course I could say "no" and extend his contract, but he deserved a different attitude.
He played three seasons in UNICIDE and in each match showed a high level, laid out on all 100%.
So I let it go like a high-flying bird.
We thanked him.
We wish him success in family life and playing career.
Kevin Langford played three years at the Kazan club, winning the 2015 / 16 United League silver.
In the 2016 / 17 season, he won the award to the most effective player of the Euroleague season.
He scored 21.75 points on average per match.
This result is the second since 2004, when the award was established.
Langford, who won the award also in 2014, became the second player in Euroleague history to receive that prize more than once.
Langford will soon sign a contract with China's Shenzhen, informs Eurohoops.
The American is expected to enter into a 2-year, $5 million contract.
Langford will be the second Euroleague star in July to move into the Chinese championship.
Yannis Burusis, the ex-centre-back of Panatinaikos, had previously moved to the Chinese CBA.
A sun-burned tourist from the Moscow region was evacuated by helicopter to Limassol
Adygean rescuers today were evacuated by helicopter from a mountainous area of the republic by a Moscow-based tourist who received the strongest sunburn.
The man was resting at the Fisht shelter, located at an altitude of 1.6 thousand metres.
The 27-year-old tourist had increased pressure as well as difficulty breathing.
A preliminary diagnosis is a serious allergic reaction.
The rescuers were approached by the head of the tour group, who told that the burns the man received in the hike.
Ford to modify up to 850,000 diesel cars
The day before the announcement by Ford, BMW said it would offer to upgrade the software to more than 350,000 vehicles.
The BMW chairman said the company believed "there are more backward paths than driving restrictions," referring to European cities - including Munich, where BMW is located - that were considering banning or restricting the use of diesel cars.
Daimler said on Thursday it would modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce their diesel exhaust.
Neither company called its move a recall.
European automakers have actively promoted the use of diesel cars in Europe and the United States to help comply with carbon emissions regulations.
But nitrogen oxides that throw out diesel engines are considered carcinogens and can cause asthma.
The cost to automakers of installing equipment that neutralizes the exhaust gases of diesel cars is also rising, and maintaining a competitive price for cars becomes difficult.
While German automakers are under scrutiny, Chancellor Angela Merkel's government has also been accused of scuttling influential automakers and ignoring signs of a problem.
The companies try not to repeat the mistakes of Volkswagen, which concealed the use of so-called "defeat devices," which, during testing, could correct the amount of harmful gases emitted to comply with the rules and, under normal driving conditions, shut down.
In the United States, several Volkswagen executives have been convicted, and the rest are under investigation on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, a former chief of the thermodynamics department was arrested in Germany as part of the Ford engine development group.
The former manager, Zackeo Giovanni Pamio, an Italian, is therefore not protected from extradition and can stand trial in the United States.
Earlier this year, Ford came under a German criminal investigation involving Volkswagen after authorities accused Ford of installing a system to bypass European emissions rules and expanded an investigation that had previously focused on the United States.
The inclusion of Ford in the investigation could create serious problems for Volkswagen: The maker of luxury cars is the source of a disproportionate share of Volkswagen's income.
In Astrakhan, a visitor to the cafe paid false money
The police received a report from the employee of the branch of the bank about the discovery of a suspicious bill with a nominal value of 5 thousand rubles.
A study at the Expert Forensic Center found it to be false.
According to the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia in the Astrakhan region, one of the visitors of the cafe who bought the shaurma paid the banknote.
It should be noted that the box office was not equipped with a bill authentication device.
At present, police officers install persons involved in the manufacture and sale of a deliberately fake ticket of the Central Bank of the Russian Federation.
Such crimes are punishable by imprisonment for up to 8 years with a fine of up to 1 million rubles.
The Regional Office of the Ministry of Internal Affairs urges the residents of the Astrakhan region to be attentive in carrying out financial transactions; the workers of the objects of trade are encouraged to install devices to verify the authenticity of the received funds.
Astronomers have found a "hell" planet on which even iron can float
For the first time, having studied the properties of the stratosphere of a giant extant called WASP-121B, astrophysicists were much surprised by its temperature, which is able to vaporize iron and other metals.
The specialists pointed out that the water molecules are so warmed by the light of the star that they emit infrared radiation.
The Hubble telescope has captured the radiance of water molecules on this gas giant: This high temperature causes water in the planet's atmosphere to glow in the infrared range.
The Wasp-121B refers to the so-called "hot jupiters" - gas giants, in size and mass comparable to the largest planet of the solar system, but located dozens of times closer to the parent star.
Because of this year, there are only 1.3 "terrestrial" days on the excretion, "and its gas shell is hardened to nearly 2,500 degrees Celsius.
Climate change threatens Lavande in Provence.
It has become a symbol of Provence and southern France, but there are now fears that it is threatened by climate change.
Lavender has grown worse due to arid weather and disease-carrying insects; this has caused constant headaches for scientists and farmers who are trying to find a solution.
Eric Shees, an expert from the Provence-based agricultural research institute CRIEPPAM, says: "Lavender in Provence is really at risk because in recent years this plant has been feeling the effects of climate change: In the spring and especially in the autumn the rains have become much smaller.
This affects the lifespan of lavender.
And there are still little cicadas jumping on the leaves of insects carrying micro-bacteria; in very dry weather, there's a lot of them. '
There is a lot at stake.
Lavender not only attracts holiday makers; lavender oil is very popular in perfumes and cosmetics.
Eric Shees says: "Instead of very long bells with a large number of large flowers, we have small, underdeveloped, weakened or generally absent.
That's why we have fewer parts containing essential oil. '
The solutions now being considered include improving water distribution and slowing evaporation from the soil, as well as spraying plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and breeding varieties more resistant to drought.
Ambassador of Winter Universiad-2019 met with Krasnoyarsk schoolboys
Two-time world champion in hockey, Ambassador of the Winter Universion-2019 Alexander Semin met the day before with starting hockey players and gave autographs to fans.
The meeting took place in the tent of the Winter Universion-2019 as part of a thematic week devoted to hockey with the puck.
Any visitor to the shuttle could ride skates on the site with artificial ice.
In addition, batches, quizzes and games were organized with the drawing of souvenir products of student games, a warm-up from the aerobics federation.
50 schoolchildren participated in the event.
Alexander Semin advised the children to engage as much as possible on sports grounds and stressed that the most important at the initial stage of training is hard work and a huge desire to engage in hockey.
"It is great that in Krasnoyarsk there is such a platform as the tent of the Winter Universion-2019, where novice athletes can directly ask questions to the coaches of teams," - said the champion.
It should be noted that the ambassadors of the Winter Universion-2019 help to promote student sports and healthy way of life among Krasnoyarsk people.
The universion tent will work throughout the summer season until September 25, according to the press service of the Directorate of Winter Universion-2019.
The State Department commented on Medvedev's words
U.S. State Department official Heather Nauert, commenting on Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev's speech at the briefing, said it was necessary to find "areas for interaction" with Russia.
She said such areas should be found to "improve bilateral interaction."
Nauert cited the Syria armistice agreement as an example of such successful cooperation.
We are two nuclear superpowers.
"And people around the world agree that the United States and Russia should be able to work with each other," the diplomat said.
At the same time, Nauert declined to comment on Medvedev's claim of a full-fledged trade war between Russia and the United States.
"If Russia said this, it certainly has the right to speak, but more on this topic I can't say anything," a State Department spokeswoman said.
Earlier, US President Donald Trump signed a bill to tighten sanctions against the Russian Federation.
Commenting on the new sanctions package, Russian Prime Minister Medvedev said Washington had declared Moscow a full-fledged trade war, ending the hope of improving bilateral relations.
Medvedev also said U.S. sanctions would be in place for decades.
In addition, according to the prime minister, the American establishment "clean beat" Trump.
A bodybuilder who disappeared in the Moscow region was found to have lost memory on someone else's hand
Bodybuilder Shamil Hanmanov disappeared on the road in Noggia on July 25 under very picky circumstances: He got out of the car's cabin to go to the toilet.
Seven days he was unsuccessfully sought by acquaintances and locals.
And I found Shamil on someone else's hand in Ramensky.
He was completely naked discovered in his toilet by the owner.
The Dagestan athlete couldn't explain how he was here and what happened to him.
He couldn't even remember how his name was, and the passport was missing.
The identity was helped by the announcement of his missing.
The medics who arrived on the call recorded a partial memory loss and brain injury at Hanmetov, according to the Mash pablik.
Probably the athlete is waiting for other surprises as well.
The attackers who kidnapped Shamil had probably already visited his apartment, the keys of which he had also stolen.
Oil and gas revenues of July exceeded forecast by 7.4 billion rubles
In fact, the oil and gas revenues received in July 2017 exceeded the estimate by 7.4 billion rubles, according to the Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation.
The excess, as the agency explains, was mainly due to the higher exchange rate of the US dollar to the ruble compared to the average monthly value of June used for the valuation, as well as due to the excess of actual gas production and the volume of oil products exports of projected levels.
"The deviation of the federal budget's oil and gas revenues from the monthly estimate corresponding to the Federal Budget Act for 2017-2019 is projected to be + 40.2 billion rubles in August 2017," the Ministry of Finance said.
Thus, the total amount of funds allocated for the purchase of foreign currency on the domestic currency market in the period from August 7 to September 6, 2017 amounts to 47.6 billion rubles.
Accordingly, the daily volume of foreign currency purchases will be equivalent to 2.07 billion rubles.
The Bank of Russia will be involved in the purchase of foreign currency by the Ministry of Finance of Russia.
Each working day during the specified period the Central Bank will enter into transactions of purchase of foreign currency at the organized trades of the Moscow Exchange evenly during the trading day.
The acquired foreign currency will be credited to the accounts of the Federal Treasury in the Central Bank.
The murder of a journalist highlights that it is becoming increasingly dangerous in Mexico.
Staff at the weekly Riodose newspaper usually meet Wednesday to discuss plans to cover the latest violent crimes in Sinaloa state related to organized crime, corrupt officials or the ongoing war of drug dealers.
But today, depressed by their own tragedy, they met to talk about security.
They were told they had to change their habits.
Two senior journalists discussed what seems safer: Taking children with them to an office that was already throwing a grenade in 2009, or leaving them at home.
Security experts wrote three words on the board hanging in the room: Enemies, neutral people, allies.
They asked journalists to name names for each column - evidence is not needed, suspicions and internal sensations will be enough.
They are drug traffickers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected of being held by the government or the cartels, a whole list of underlings that make the work of covering the chaos in Mexico dangerous.
The violence offers no respite, and among the corpses that multiply in the country, more and more journalists: According to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists, at least 25 since President Enrico Pena Nieto took office in December 2012; 589 people after attacks and threats are under federal protection; and this year, at least seven people have died in seven states.
Among the latter are their publisher and inspiration, Riodos co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.
"The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his many books on violent drug crimes.
His absence feels very acute, though his presence is ubiquitous - a large photo of Valdez showing the middle finger, with the caption "Justice" hanging on the facade of the Riodose building; two reporters years for 30, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramírez, wearing T-shirts that depict his smile, face in glasses or his firm panama.
The seminar takes place less than two months after his death; journalists discuss their shared trauma, their nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.
Although a special federal prosecutor's office was set up in 2010 to investigate journalistic cases, so far, according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists, only two cases have been investigated.
As with most of the thousands of killings each year related to drug trafficking and organized crime, murderers of journalists are rarely brought to justice.
Riodose journalists insist they will write about the violence in Sinaloa, though they are killed by grief, though it is much more dangerous around now.
Without information about the killers, without justice from talking about security at meetings, there is little benefit, "Ibarra says.
"It's very foolish to waste time at this seminar," he says.
'as long as we don't know the cause, we suspect everyone. '
On the morning of May 15, Valdez left the Riodose office in the state capital, Culiacan.
He managed to drive only a couple of quarters before his red Toyota King was stopped by two men; he was dragged out of the car and shot at him 12 times, probably because of the newspaper's name - which means "Twelfth River."
The gunman left on his car and smashed it nearby.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He was left with a wife and two adult children.
Rumours usually quickly diverge on Kuliacan.
But almost everyone is silent about Valdez.
Since Guzman was arrested and extradited to the US last January, Sinaloa has become one of the bloodiest battlefields in the country as rival factions struggle to fill the resulting vacuum.
Let's not say that one or more people are killed every day on the streets of Sinaloa, or that the cemetery is filled with decorated two-story mausoleums of drug kings that are larger than the homes of many living people.
Let's forget for a minute that the state of "calm" is simply when one of the cartels takes control of a seaside state with important ports and drug trafficking routes leading to the United States.
Despite this and the fact that Valdez was well aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Favorquez, a 60-year-old co-founder and director of Riodos, is crushed by a sense of guilt for failing to protect a friend.
He thinks the murder was helped by two mistakes.
First, an interview was published in February with Damaso Lopez, the leader of one of the cartel's rival factions, which is fighting Guzman's sons.
The publication could have angered the sons; people believed to be gang members bought all copies of the publication as soon as they were taken to the kiosks.
The second mistake was that he did not force Valdez for his own safety to leave the country after being captured by another newspaper that wrote about the same story.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his murder was seen as another milestone in the development of violence against journalists in Mexico.
He had gone from danger for so long, his friends and colleagues thought he would always be.
He was an experienced reporter at Noroesta and in 2003, along with five colleagues, founded Riodos, selling his 50-dollar shares.
In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to engage in journalism without affecting the subject of drugs," Favorquez said.
Over time, the newspaper earned a reputation for bold and honest publishing, sales and advertising revenues grew.
Journalists liked that they could publish bold reports without fear of censorship, and readers attracted that in this edition they could read about what no one else dared to write about.
Eight years after its founding, Riodose won the prestigious Maria Murs Cabo Award for reporter work in Latin America.
That same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award for his courage in investigating Mexico's drug trafficking wherever it leads.
He candidly admitted he was scared.
"I want to live on," he said at the CPJ Awards.
Drug trafficking in Sinaloa "is a way of life," he told Romsinger TV last October.
'you have to accept the tasks that lie on you as a journalist - either so or you just roll a fool. '
I don't want to be asked, "What did you do when there were so many deaths around... why didn't you say what was going on?"
"Riodose" staff miss Valdez, a joke who was rumoured as a cargo man in the port, a friend, generous on embrace and advice, a teacher who knew how to be concussed alive.
They relied on their order.
He had to always wear his hat.
He had to walk to "El Guayabo," a bar opposite the office, and always sit there at the same table.
Now they ask: Has he been destroyed by the love of the once-established order?
His death made them question their calculations of how best to do their job and stay alive.
'they don't like when you deal with their wives, children, in their legal business and in clandestine airfields to carry drugs.
"These things were behind the line," Favorquez said.
The result, even at the best of times, was a high level of self-censorship and a desire for self-preservation.
You have to believe your instincts.
Keep away from that bad smells.
The problem, says "Riodose" editor Andres Villareal, is that "the smell can be fooled... and then what happened to Javier happens."
The old rules, he and others say, are no longer in place in Sinaloa - as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states, where there is a poisonous mix of lucrative smuggling routes, weak state institutions and corrupt officials.
The landscape is constantly changing.
In a room where Riodose employees gathered for a security training, it was suddenly forbidden to make cell phones: A few days before it became known that spy programs, which are sold exclusively to governments, were being used in Mexico to monitor journalists and public activists.
Outside, two police officers take shelter in the shade of a tree from the 104-degree heat (40 degrees Celsius).
They were given a task by the state government to guard the office of "Riodose," which is located in a four-storey building in the bourgeois quarter of Kuliakana.
Some journalists asked whether these police officers included in those 50 percent of the officers of the order, about whom the governor himself said they could not be trusted.
A few months ago, journalists went to the mountainous terrain, which is de facto controlled by drug gangs.
In the nearest room "Riodose" counted on three main themes.
This is the murder in Sinaloa of the brother of former boxing champion Julio Cezar Chavez.
Still, they had an expose of government spending concentrated in the governor's hometown.
And there was a group kidnapping at one of Culiacan's most expensive restaurants, a block from the prosecutor's office.
It was not officially announced who was kidnapped or how it happened, so it was necessary to be careful when it was time to write about what everyone in the city knew: That it was a favorite restaurant at the same time by drug dealers and authorities.
One of their journalists learned from open databases that the restaurant was registered in the name of a politician belonging to the ruling Anti-Revolutionary Party (PRI), which has dominated all levels of government for almost the past century.
High-profile corruption allegations have recently been made against several PRI governors.
Villareal asked journalists to write about previous incidents at that restaurant, including when Guzman's "El Chapo" son eluded the military's cloud.
A few months ago, readers would have been looking for a Valdez column with the most reliable information about the kidnapping.
"Before, we would already know what happened," says the 46-year-old Villareal, for his fine physique nicknamed "El Flacco."
"Today, all channels of communication with our sources are ruined."
Valdez's cabinet is now used as a warehouse for posters and stickers with protests against the killings of journalists, because employees have become who they never thought to become: Activists acting on behalf of the press.
Journalist Miriam Ramírez took several posters and went the next morning to a demonstration at the local prosecutor's office dedicated to another journalist.
Salvador Adame disappeared in Michoacan state in the west of the country three days after Valdez was killed.
Found the burned body, and authorities said it was him, based on DNA tests.
Across the country, journalists began to speak louder, organize protests and write "SOS Press" on the sidewalks and walls of houses.
On that day, Director Favorquez was in Washington trying to win international support in demanding justice in the Valdez case.
At a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa the day after Valdez's murder, Ramírez accused the authorities of spying on journalists and ordering their killings for telling the truth.
She then asked not to give her more assignments to cover the government's activities, fearing that anger would damage her objectivity.
Valdez has said many times that journalists in Mexico are "surrounded" by organized crime, its accomplices in government and an indifferent society.
In his latest book, "narco-journalism," he wrote that reporters are killed not just by gangs of drug traffickers; they do so on the orders of politicians and security services colluding with organized crime.
The Articulo 19 Press Protection Committee believes half of the attacks on journalists last year were carried out on the orders of police and government officials.
"In Mexico, you're dying because they want to shut you up," Ramírez says.
Of course, the killings are intimidating people.
Everyone remembers the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias six years ago in the northern border state of Tamaulipas.
On her body found a note supposedly written on behalf of the Zetas cartel: "I'm here because of my articles."
A computer keyboard and headphones lay next to her severed head.
Some publications chose to shut down as the newspaper El Grande in the northern border state of Chichester after its correspondent, Miroslav Brich, was killed in March.
Others continue to hold on like "El Manyana" from Nuevo Laredo after the murder of its leader in 2004.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed drug cartels with an editorial on the front page entitled "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists have left their home states or the country altogether.
It's a painful decision.
In exile, it's hard to find work, and they still look out for danger in the streets.
And sometimes they are killed, as obviously happened to photographer Ruben Espinoza, who was killed in 2015 along with four women in a Mexico apartment three months after fleeing Veracruz.
Those who remain and continue to work balance every day between risky decisions.
Ibarra - who once dreamed of being a poet - admits he is scared to write about drug trafficking.
"Mexico is rolling into hell, and that's why I became a journalist," he says.
Last Friday, at midnight, when the latest issue was already ready to print, Riodose publishers sat on the sidewalk next to the office and drank beer when suddenly their phones rang at the same time.
A series of shootings between rival gangs and security forces near the resort town of Masatlan left 19 corpses behind, according to confirmed data.
The war continued to unravel, as promised in a series of messages from cartels found in the area.
Sitting on the sidewalk, they posted the news to the Riodose website through a mobile phone.
The next day it was necessary to remake the first page.
Nearby sirens took off - another shootout in the vicinity.
Favorquez looked at whether the police guarding them were ready for defense.
If they were scared, they didn't show it.
Sitting under a huge portrait of the deceased founder of their newspaper, whose middle finger was put on display all over Sinaloa, Riodose's staff continued his case.
"How can you think of shutting down," Todorquez said, "if on the very day that Javier was killed, the practitioner asked me to send her to the street to do a report?"
Dinosaur enjoyed camouflage to avoid enemies
At first glance, it seems like a statue, albeit a flood of horror.
The researchers said that the first found remains of an incredible creature the size of a rhinoceros, discovered by a Canadian miner, were preserved so well that experts called it "Mony Lisa among dinosaurs."
It was so well preserved that they were even able to determine that the color of his Czech skin was red-brown - and to say that he had, in some ways, a "dark past."
In a report published in the journal Modern Biology, it was described as "the most well-preserved of Tireofor in the history of findings and one of the best dinosaur copies in the world."
It's a fossil - a recently found instance of a nodosaur living in the middle of the chalk period, between 110 million and 112 million years ago.
His incredible good fortune stunned researchers who call it "really remarkable."
It is the most well-preserved fossil of this species in the history of the findings, according to articles in the journal National Geographic.
He was found by Sean funk when he went to work at Sancor's Millenium mine near Forth McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011.
He came across something that seemed different from the surrounding breed, and decided to look more closely.
The fossil, discovered by him, was sent to the Royal Squirellovsky Paleonological Museum.
The next six years, work was carried out to detect the animal inside an earthen mammoth with a mass of 2,500 cases (1,100 kilograms).
Now that all this hard work is done, the finished result can be demonstrated.
"It's only worth a bit of a snub, and one can practically believe that he's asleep," said lead author Caleb Brown, a researcher at the Royal Viorellovsky Paleonology Museum, where the creation is being demonstrated.
'it will enter the history of science as one of the most beautiful and most well-preserved instances of dinosaurs - the Mona Lisa among dinosaurs. '
Studying his skin, the researchers found it was travorous, despite it being covered in pancirem and resembling a walking tank, apparently exposed to significant danger from carnivorous dinosaurs.
This powerful pancirem dinosaur used red-and-white camouflage to hide from predators, and used a protective technique known as protective colouring, which is also enjoyed by many of the animals of our days.
This would allow him to break down more quickly with the surrounding environment and avoid meeting enemies, experts say, suggesting that larger dinosaurs hunted him.
This 110-million-year-old creature, which belongs to a family of nodosaurs, was widely covered in print in May, and is now on display at the Royal Farrell Paleonology Museum.
Scientists have already studied the animal and given it the name Borealopelta markmitchelli in honor of museum laborant Mark Mitchell, one of the group's participants who spent more than 7,000 hours for his painstaking excavation.
The astonishing safety of the instance allowed Dr. Mitchell and an international group of scientists to document the drawing and shape of the Czech and pan-circus plates on his body.
They found protective colouring, a common method of protection in the animal kingdom, meaning that the top of the creature was darker than its lower side.
Although protective coloring is common, the discovery came as a surprise because the size of the Borealopelta dinosaur far exceeds the size of the now-living animals with protective colouring.
It can be assumed that this dinosaur was so actively hunted by carnivorous dinosaurs that evolution preferred masking confrontation as a way of survival.
But most modern animals with protective coloring - such as deer, zebras or bronzes - are significantly smaller and are more accessible prey, indicating that the nodosaur had to fight hard for survival.
"The earthy threat from predators for the massive, covered by a powerful dinosaur pancirem shows just how dangerous the predatory dinosaurs of the chalk period were," Brown said.
The chemical analysis of organic compounds in the Czech dinosaur also shows that its skin was supposed to be red-brown.
Scientists continue to study the animal, seeking information about his life, including the preserved contents of his digestive tract, to find out what he ate during his last meal.
They believe that when the dinosaur died, it fell into the river and was taken to the sea, where it sank and back down the ice to the bottom of the ocean.
In those times, Alberta was as warm as it is now in southern Florida, and rivers and oceans were likely to spread much further inland than they are now.
"This nodosaur is truly remarkable in that it is completely covered with preserved Czech skin, and at the same time completely preserved in three dimensions, preserving the original shape of the animal," Brown said.
'as a result now the animal looks almost the same as it looked then, in the early chalk period.
It is not necessary especially to resort to imagination in order to recreate it, it is necessary only to touch slightly, and it is possible to practically believe that it is asleep. "
The chalk period is an era when giant theropods, carnivorous dinosaurs standing on two feet, wandered the Earth.
Although the most remarkable of them, Tyrannosaur rex, lived millions of years later than Borealopelta, one of his formidable ancestors could have been hunted at the department store.
They include an acrocantosaur, a 38-foot (11.5 meter) monster weighing six tons.
The scientists, whose latest discoveries are published in the journal Modern Biology, believe Borealopelta was after death claimed at sea and mummified in the ile.
The creature was found by Sean fank when he took work at the Millenium mine near Forth McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011.
According to the museum's staff, it is the world's most well-preserved foothold, along with skin and pancirem, and it sleeps, from the mornings to the thigh bones.
On average, these creatures reached roughly 18 feet (five meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kilograms).
Their characteristic sign was two twenty-inch studs protruding from the shoulders.
The researchers believe that this travorous foothold stepped hard on what is now Canada until the spilled river took it to the open sea.
But the dinosaur's underwater burial kept its pancircus with precision to the smallest detail.
The stoned remains of this particular instance are so well preserved that the remains of the skin still cover the busty pancircus plates along the dinosaur's skull.
As Michael Greshko wrote in an article for National Geographic magazine, such a degree of preservation is "rare as winning the lottery."
The longer I look at him, the more striking he seems.
The stoned remains of the skin still cover the busty pancircus plates trundling the animal's skull.
His right front leg is pulled along the side, five fingers on it banged up.
I can count the scales on his soles. "
Mikhail Saakashvili managed to get to Poland without documents
Mikheil Saakashvili, who previously headed Georgia and then the Odessa region in Ukraine, flew to Poland.
In doing so, he did so without documents proving his identity and citizenship.
Saakashvili's arrival is reported by Polish publication Telewizja Republika, who posted a video of his performance on his YouTube channel.
Saakashvili spoke at an event to commemorate the anniversary of the Warsaw uprising against Hitler's troops in 1944.
Since the politician does not know Polish, although he tried to start speaking in that language, he had to speak English through a Polish translator.
During his speech the politician touched upon the topic of Georgia's cooperation with Poland and also spoke about Ukraine.
That Ukraine's migration service stripped him of his citizenship, the wholesale politician learned while in the United States.
How exactly he managed to make a transatlantic flight without documents is not yet known.
Earlier, the former governor of the Odessa region, Mikheil Saakashvili, said his signature on a questionnaire to obtain Ukrainian citizenship had been forged.
The politician stressed that he did not fill in any questionnaires.
The investigation period in the Weinzicher and Olhovica case has been extended until Jan.
The term of the preliminary investigation in the case of the co-owner of the group of companies "Renova" Evgeny Olhovika and the head of the energy holding "T Plus" Boris Vainziher has been extended until January 2, 2018.
An extension of the accused house arrest is being considered at Basman Court on Thursday, August 3.
The representative of the SC at the meeting informed about the last decision to extend the period of the preliminary investigation.
"The special complexity and duration of the investigation is due to the necessity of removing and carrying out the examination of a large number of documents, as well as carrying out investigative actions on the territory of several subjects of the Russian Federation," the investigator said.
He added that the suspects regularly gave bribes to Comey's leadership.
Their total size is estimated to be at least one billion rubles.
According to the investigation, Vainziher, Olhovik, as well as the former head of JSC "Integrated Energy Systems" Mikhail Slobone, who until September 5 headed the company "Vimpelcom," handed over bribes to the top officials of the Republic of Komi for setting the most favorable tariffs for heat and electricity, as well as for creating favorable conditions for business.
Weinziher and Olhovik were detained, stabbed in Syrawkar and arrested for two months, Slobone fled the investigation and was declared federal wanted.
How did one activist learn the answer to the question "What are the streets?"
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrel was shaken to the depth of the soul.
Just a day after arriving in New York as part of a tourist trip, the St. Louis native was sitting on a bed in an apartment rented through Airbnb, browsing a fake buck tape on the phone.
She was pushed into the post by someone from high school.
It said: "The police have just killed an eighteen-year-old child, and he is still lying in the middle of the street."
Drawing attention to the fact that no one else from her tape poked this information, puzzled, she shut down the firebook and opened the tweet.
In her tape there were many reposts of the user with the nick @ TheePharoah.
A rapper from Greater St. Louis in real time covered in a tweet the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black eighteen-year-old undergrowth killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri.
He published a photograph of Brown's lifeless body, spread out among the street, where it will be four hours.
"It's wild," Ferrel thought.
But death was nothing new to her and her circle.
She delayed the phone, and later in the evening returned to tweets that people were gathering on the Canfield Drive.
There were photos of signal tape and screaming people and a man claiming to be Brown's father holding a poster with the words: "A policeman from Ferguson just killed my unarmed son!"
She watched the live broadcast as a police officer stands in front of a group of protesters with a lashing dog.
On another video, another policeman, "she said," took up a pile of rifles and yelled, "I'll kill you all... animals!"
"It's a non-standard situation," Ferrel said at the time, according to his own memories.
'it's not a murder like the ones we're used to and which we can call typical.
At that point, I felt chills.
I was angry and crying. '
She took a ticket for a return flight and took her body home the next day.
Landing at 11pm, she took her six-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided they would both go to Ferguson the next morning.
What was happening with Ferrel and with Ferguson in the next nearly three years was the subject of a new documentary, "Chey Street?," which will be released on August 11.
It's a story of survival and protest, of love and loss, strength and resilience in terms of people living in the community and filling the streets, demanding answers.
While Ferrel was travelling to Ferguson with her daughter, dressed in a dress in flowers and a wreath under colour, they recalled a conversation that had led up to this morning countless times, "about the experiences of black people and their position."
She recalls saying: "Remember how I told you about how black people had to fight for what they believed in?
We're now going to Ferguson because a police officer killed an eighteen-year-old boy and that was wrong. '
"I couldn't help but take it," Ferrel said later.
'What's happening today is the culmination of that... that's been happening before.
She should know about it, see it and be brought up on it.
It should not only be well versed in activism and organization, but also understand the different levels of black people's experiences and their positions and what we should do to become free to free ourselves.
Even if I manage to provide her with an environment in which she does not personally face obvious racism, she is no different from any other black girl.
I feel like I would have given her a bad service if I had garnered her from it. '
When they arrived in Ferguson, the first stop they made on South Florissant Road, on a platform across the road from a police station that had become something like a tent camp while activists waited for reports of the final failure of Officer Darren Wilson
There, Ferrel and her daughter joined a local entrepreneur who was preparing lunch packages.
They collected packages and helped distribute them to protesters.
A new type of activism took shape in Ferrel's consciousness.
"My activism changed completely after August 9," she said, noting that as a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, she was president of the Association of sanity students, members of national minorities, and dealt with food justice and health inequality among black communities.
"I had no experience as an organizer.
It's come by itself. '
A few weeks later, at an evening demonstration, Ferrel met Freda Folayan, one of his co-directors.
Folayan said she and her chief operator, Lucas Alvarado-Fairbauer, "just wanted to document" the events.
Ferrel came to the head of the question: "Do you want to document, or try to find a story on which to play?"
This scepticism was inspired by numerous people, often white, who came to the community to benefit from his pain and resilience.
As Folayan explained in a recent interview, "We heard that the voices of people who were born and grew up in Ferguson don't fall into the spotlight, and wanted to do it differently."
Folayan by then had already teamed up with his co-director, Damon Davis, a local artist known for his activism on death row issues.
His involvement awakened sympathy for the project from Ferrel and six other locals with whom the Chya Street Project team kept in touch during the years after Brown's murder.
"In this documentary, not someone speaks for us or with us, it's us talking ourselves," Davis said.
'it was the most important thing for me, how these people will be represented, because that's how I will be represented myself. '
And while the aim of the project was not to focus at all on Ferrel's experience - in an effort to show that the movement "is not about the leader-savior, but about how the community is united," as Folayan said - it turned out to be the most open of the film's participants.
As a result, "Chya Street?" Shows unexpectedly personal aspects of Ferrel's life, such as how she fell in love and married his wife.
"I felt hungry," Ferrel said, with a laugh about seeing the finished product for the first time.
'but I understood that when you do such a job and humanize blacks, there has to be some level of vulnerability. '
In addition, Ferrel's story again discusses and emphasizes the role of a black homosexual woman in the broader context of the "Life of Blacks matters" movement.
Two of the movement's three founders - those who created the # BlackLivesMatter tag on social media after the murder of black teen Trayvon Martin in 2012 - identify themselves as homosexuals.
"Black homosexual women in leadership positions support all this movement," says Ferrel. "And all because we are constantly fighting on several fronts.
Black homosexual women have to bear all this burden. "
Folayan agreed with the allegation, noting that "the movement is actually supported by black women and a host of homosexual black women."
Still, she insists that "this is not a case of positive discrimination," and that Ferrel was not elected as the film's central character because of its distinctive features.
"She was the person who awakened that energy," she said.
"On the other hand, it's not a coincidence that it turned out to be at first, because when"
You can feel its energy through the screen. "
Meanwhile, there have long been no film cameras in Ferguson, but complex racial links between the community and the police remain.
Ferrel will be on probation for another two-and-a-half years for cutting off the highway during the demonstration.
She describes the socio-political atmosphere of a place that calls home, simply: "Bardak."
She is still holding on to the speech she learned when she took to the streets of Ferguson full three years ago.
We must fight for our freedom.
We have to win.
We have to love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose except our chains. "
Two El Salvador footballers disqualified for bite of US players

During the quarter-final match of the Gold Cup of the North and Central American and Caribbean Football Confederations (CONCACAF), Salvadorians were bitten by American players.
The first featured defenseman Henri Adams.
The salvador snatched the attacker, Josie Altidor, then snatched him by the chest.
Then midfielder Seren was bitten by US defender Omar Gonzalez when filing a corner in the penalty of his square.
As a result, Lyon was disqualified for three matches and Seren for six.
The meeting itself ended with a victory for the Americans with a score of 2: 0, Goal.com.
Emergence of similarities: Artist creates portraits using Chelsea Manning's DNA
In the center of the hall at Friedman Gallery in New York, people's faces are whipped from the ceiling on the wire - white, black and brown, all something awkwardly similar to each other.
The 30 portraits were created by artist Heather Dewey-Harrison of smears from the cheeks and trim hair sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent trimming from Fort Levenworth prison, where a former intelligence analyst is serving a 35-year sentence for the famous transfer of confidential diplomatic telegrams on the WikiLeaks website.
The new exhibition, which broke out on August 2, is called "The Influence of similarities."
It's the result of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Harrison, whose art combines technology, information and art, and Manning, a transgender woman and famous dissident whom Barack Obama commuted sentence just three days before the end of his presidency.
By analyzing, through a computer program, the DNA obtained from Manning, and using it to create three-dimensional portraits of individuals who might be in humans with such a genome, Dewey-Harrison created a deep, though hard-to-perceive novel dedicated not only to the plasticity of DNA data - the various ways in which they are interpreted and the ingenious feminism of these interpretations - but also to the notion of identity.
Manning, who was born with the name Bradley Edward but has spoken openly since his teens that he considers himself a woman, was sentenced to 20 episodes in 2013, including six violations of the Spying Act, computer fraud and theft.
Her photos in prison were unavailable, so only one of her photos was known: A grainy black-and-white selfie on which Manning in a platinum hue wig, clearly feeling embarrassed, sits at the wheel of the car; with this photo of her and became associated.
In 2015, Dewey-Harrison completed his 2012 project, "Visions of strangers," with great success.
In it, the artist created portraits of unknown people using court evidence like okurks and chewing gum, highlighting DNA from that debris and creating images of what these people might look like.
And then she received an email from Paper Magazine.
"They took an interview with Chelsea Manning in prison and wanted some portrait to illustrate the article," Dewey-Gibbs explained at a preliminary screening of the new press exhibition.
At the time, Chelsea could not be visited and photographed, so they contacted her and asked if she wanted to get a portrait created from her DNA.
In such an unusual way, the artist and her jailed muse became friends in correspondence and exchanged several letters over two years.
They even wrote the comic book "suppressed images," illustrated by Shoili Canungo, who portrayed how in the future the president would soften Chelsea's punishment and that would be able to visit the exhibition in person.
That Obama really decided to release Manning just days after the book came to light turned out to be a pleasant surprise after seven hard years in a Kansas military prison.
There is something deep and strong and in that the exhibition opens just now that Donald Trump is declaring war on people revealing secret information in government, and inventing new ways to foment on Twitter the animosity he is meant to soften.
When Dewey-Harrison was asked about the coincidence of this all over time, she said "by chance nothing happens."
In the artist's statement, written on the wall of the galeria, Manning's huge signature at the bottom (with a heart instead of a point over "i" in her surname) calls for an end to "automatic separation based on gender, race, sexual orientation and culture."
On the opposite side is her mitochondrial DNA, a long caterpillar from the discharged pencil C, G and A.
By including 200 letters (or nucleotides, as the artist has learned), Dewey-Harrison hoped to show how we are all remarkably similar, at least according to our biological structure.
"I hope to explain to people that our genome doesn't define what we are, how open genetic data is to interpretation and how subjective it is," Dewey-Harrison said; her 2007 video work, "Loose memories," is also exhibited here.
'the DNA data can tell us a lot of different stories, and 30 of those stories are here. '
The last part of the exposition, which was able in one room, is the above-mentioned ritual in the comics.
On it, the King Kong-style Manning appears above the U.S. Correctional Cazar building with a loudspeaker in his hand.
"If they kill your speech, they will win," it is written there.
"So never be silent."
"This is a direct quote from the letter she wrote to me," says the artist welcoming us from Philadelphia.
"I still have murals on my skin when I'm talking about it."
Manning has yet to see the exhibition in person - as it was vividly portrayed in the comics - but when it comes, she will be greeted by masks in the center of the room, her own genomic simulators gathered like crowds of protesters.
It's also made deliberately, like everything in the exhibition right up to the height (5 "2, the growth of Manning), on which the pencil was drawn by genetic gaplogroups.
"Before, I would dispel them on the walls, but now I wanted them to look like a crowd of people," Dewey-Harrison says of the portraits.
'i wanted them to be like the mass movement that formed around Chelsea as a movement that stood up for her release as well. '
Northwestern University professors and Oxford University employee are wanted by police on murder charges
According to a police report, there is a nationwide cloud on a Northwestern University professor and an Oxford University employee who are being sought as suspects in connection with a man being found stabbed to death in a luxury room in Chicago.
According to Cook County Court records, detention warrants were issued on Monday for premeditated murder without the right to bail of 40-year-old Windham Latham and fifty-six-year-old Andrew Warren over their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton G. James Correa-Duranlo.
According to the documents, twenty-six-year-old Correa-Duranlo died after suffering multiple barbed wounds.
A warning issued by the Chicago Police Department says the body was found on July 27.
Police received a call, they arrived at the Grand Plaza apartment complex and found the victim with several wounds on his body.
According to officials, Correa-Duranlo was declared dead at the crime scene and detectives are now investigating the death from stab wounds, considering her murder, while police are strenuously searching for two suspects.
Latham has held the position of adjunct professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Kabbadge, the university's vice president of communications, said in a statement filed by email that Latham is on administrative leave and that he is prohibited from going to Northwestern University campuses.
"Now this is a criminal case that is being investigated by authorized individuals, and Northwestern University is cooperating with the investigation," Kabbadj said.
Warren works as a senior finance officer at Oxford University.
A spokesman for the university and Somerville College said in a statement filed by email: "We have communicated with UK police and are prepared to provide any necessary assistance to US investigative authorities."
The statement also said Warren's colleagues are shocked and want him to surrender.
Chicago Police Department communications chief Anthony Gulelmi said he very much advises the suspects to surrender to the bodies.
"The police have assumptions about their whereabouts, but our attempts to find them are amplified," Gulelmi said.
Gulelmi said local, regional and federal authorities are helping in the search for suspects.
According to Gulelmi, police called the administrator of the Grand Plaza building, who had just received a mysterious report that something had happened in Room 1008.
Police called the crime scene horrific.
Gulelmi said it was not clear whether the incident itself occurred on July 27.
He said data from video cameras confirm that Latham and Warren were in the building.
"We believe that Professor Latham and the victim linked the relationship," Gulelmi said.
Grand Plaza management issued an appeal to bystanders, which reported: "Police are currently working on a chronology of the incident, gathering information about the victim and considering a number of motives, including a possible domestic accident."
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mutko: "We will meet the requirements of the WADA road map in the near future"
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said the terms of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), set to resume the work of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA), would be met in the near future.
"A certain stage in meeting the requirements has been passed, RUSADA has been given the right to plan and conduct tests in conjunction with UKAD (UK Anti-Doping Agency).
The WADA road map has been updated accordingly, "Mutko said on Thursday.
The Prime Minister commented on the second part of the WADA road map to restore compliance with the Code, which lists the conditions for the resumption of RUSADA's work and was recently published on the organization's website.
According to Mutko, it does not contain anything that could present difficulties for Russia.
"Everything has been announced, everything will be fulfilled.
And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA in the near future, "he added.
However, one of the requirements on the list implies that Russian anti-doping structures should publicly acknowledge the results of a WADA-commissioned investigation by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren alleging that doping in Russian sport is controlled by the state.
Touching on the matter, Mutko said: "We are investigating as our anti-doping system has allowed a failure.
All measures were taken.
But there were no state programs, and we will not recognize what was not. "
Mutko repeated the words of Vitaly Smirnov, head of the Russian Independent Public Anti-Doping Commission.
On the morning of the same day, in an interview with the Russian publication Rsport, the Pentagon acknowledged previous problems in Russian anti-doping structures, but added: "We have repeatedly said that the report contains certain controversial positions and provisions.
Unconditionally, no one is going to accept this report, "Ross added.
Wada suspended RUSADA from carrying out doping control in November 2015 following a doping scandal.
However, in June this year he was allowed to plan and coordinate testing under the supervision of international experts and the British Anti-Doping Agency (UKAD).
After visiting the organization's Moscow office in July, WADA CEO Olivier Niggli said RUSADA was "moving in the right direction" to rebuild its work.
Fire extinguished in 79-storey tower in Dubai
A major fire that occurred in one of the world's tallest residential buildings, The Torch tower, has been extinguished, Reuters reports.
It is noted that firefighters managed to cope with all fire hotspots by 4.00 local time (3.00 msk).
Local authorities said no one was injured in the incident.
At the time of the fire, the streets adjacent to the skyscraper were closed.
The cause of the incident is not yet known.
The 79-storey residential skyscraper The Torch, which is one of the tallest buildings in the world, was previously reported to be burning in Dubai.
All residents were evacuated on time.
Buzov's unimaginable outfit shook fans: Trousers not covering cowards
The scandalous leading reality show "Dom-2" Olga Buzov struck the audience of the Europa Plus Live festival dancing in cowards.
In the eyes of thousands of fans, the new singer duo with Nasty Kudri performed the song "We'll be hot."
Both girls took to the stage in provocative "trousers," sewn in such a way that the singer's underwear was in sight.
Buzova and Kudry graffiti were made on the trousers.
Earlier it was reported how the changes in the appearance of Buzovoy were commented by a specialist of one of the Moscow clinics of plastic surgery.
Stoltenberg acknowledged deteriorating relations between NATO and Russia
The Radio 4 news service reported on Friday, August 4, citing foreign media.
According to him, the Russian authorities are responsible for the deterioration of relations between the West and Russia.
In an interview with CNN, the NATO Secretary General also criticized Russia for the situation with Crimea and "destabilization in eastern Ukraine."
At the same time, Stoltenberg assured that dialogue with Russia is nevertheless possible, and further escalation of the situation will not benefit any of its participants.
Earlier on Thursday, US President Donald Trump said relations between the US and Russia were at a dangerously low level, and blamed the US Congress.
Yekaterinburg metro is mastering a new way of payment
According to Pavel Vedernikov, General Director of JSC "I-Network" in an interview with "Regional newspaper."
Our goal is to introduce the same subway fare system for the 2018 FIFA World Cup as in other major cities: Moscow, St. Petersburg, Nizhny Novgorod and Novosibirsk.
"We want fans from other countries, guests of the uniform, to be able to use the subway using their bank cards without acquiring tokens and not standing in line," he said.
Start-ups that will help your company not become another "Uber"
Amy Earnest wanted to gauge the level of satisfaction among employees of his e-commerce startup, but the polls didn't work.
The answers were often vague, useless or, worse, insincere.
And even though she promised anonymity, some employees didn't trust the process.
"He's never been consistent and objective," said Earnest, who runs the 75-person Madison Reed, a San Francisco-based company engaged in e-commerce in hair care.
So she appealed to third parties for help.
Now there is a new kind of start-ups in the HR industry that help companies figure out how their employees feel.
By developing and licensing software designed to measure employee engagement, they allow companies to do express surveys, reach out to certain teams and demographic groups, offer employees anonymity and hot lines for complaints, and in some cases allow informants to mine top management and contact the directorate directly.
"Now we have tools like Strava and Fitbit to monitor health, and where is Fitbit for your company?" Says Jim Barnett, co-founder and president of the "clay" startup from Redwood City, whose analytical programs are used by companies to measure employee engagement.
Earnest said that she has reached a greater understanding of what her employees think and feel over the three years of using the "glider."
In addition to express surveys and questionnaires of certain commands, the product offers a heat map of the company and shows in visual form which units have more complaints and which managers have a low approval rating, which allows it to understand why.
Companies are fully aware that they need to control the workplace, otherwise they will be the next "Uber" to be implicated in the scandal, when a former employee published a blog post describing an aggressive environment in which those who expressed discontent were punished.
For start-ups like Glover, it's a desire to control the situation - an opportunity for a profitable business.
The Internet portal Let's Talk About Pay, dedicated to financial technology, estimates that the global governance, regulation, and compliance industry could be worth more than $118.7 billion by 2020.
The Convercent startup from Denver, Colorado, which helps companies prevent and detect bad behavior, noted a slight increase in interest and activity earlier this year amid a fall in Uber's reputation.
Convercent has nearly 600 customers, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber recently appeared among customers.
The "Convercent" allows companies to send customized surveys of staff opinions, collect confidential responses in real time, and view heat maps of problem zones.
It also provides a hotline for anonymous text messages that allows employees to report bad behavior.
And if a top manager is affected, the complaints go straight to the directorate.
"The court of public opinion intercepted power from inspectors," said Patrick Quinlan, founder and president of Convercent.
If it turns out that the company is ill-treated by employees or behaves unethically, even if inspectors don't fit in, the company could face costly consequences in the form of customer boycotts, employee outflows and lawsuits, Quinlan said.
Ruby Tuesday, a restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees in 500 establishments, has used Convercent for more than a year to make sure employees are aware of the rules and procedures, and to offer a simple way to contact the company's head office.
Previously, if a staff member wanted to report a problem, he or she had to look for a phone number or head office mail, file a formal complaint and hope that it would be taken seriously.
It was often a frightening and embarrassing experience, said James Witrano, chief of law at Ruby Tuesday, who said there was no normal way to track employee complaints.
Now that the company uses the Convercent service, problems that used to be hidden from managers sitting in offices in other cities or states - such as discrimination, harassment and unfair pay - can be quickly discovered and dealt with.
"I can get closer to a holistic, comprehensive understanding of the staff situation," said Vitrano, who runs the Ruby Tuesday network's risk management team.
'and we're protecting our shareholders from litigation with employees. '
According to Queensland, the companies began to take more seriously the ethics, values and involvement of employees in 2002, after the accounting firm Arthur Andersen collapsed due to ethical irregularities as a result of "Case Enron."
But it was only when "social networks became widespread" that companies realized that they would not be able to keep their dirty linen from viral distribution online.
"Before you start using technology to control ethics, people used hope as a strategy," he said.
Both "Greg" and "Convercent" offer their software as a service, requiring companies to pay regular fees for the use of their products.
It's a business model and an opportunity that has been endorsed by venture investors who have backed both start-ups.
In February, Convercent received $10 million in funding from firms such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, bringing the company's total capital to $47 million.
The company received $10 million in November from Bessemer Venture Partners, bringing the company's total capital to $60 million.
This investment is hardly surprising given the interconnected nature of companies, culture, and venture capital.
A growing body of research demonstrates that today's employees expect more of their jobs than they did before.
In markets with stiff competition, such as Silicon Valley, high wages and interesting projects are just a necessary minimum.
Employees want to feel that they are accepted and valued, and that they devote their time to companies with a positive mission.
"When people are happy to work in a company, feel that they're being heard, and that the work they're doing brings a result, they're more trying to make such a company successful," says Nina McQuin, vice president of global benefits and employee satisfaction at LinkedIn, which uses both Convercent and Groll.
Investors get an income when things at companies from their portfolio go well; things at companies go well when employees are dedicated and involved.
If third-party analytical tools promise to increase employee loyalty and engagement, it is not surprising that they find support.
According to workplace culture experts, it is important to have data on employee engagement.
But the data is useless until the company's trustees take action.
In fact, if a company asks employees for feedback, it can give the impression that change is coming.
And if change doesn't come fast enough, or doesn't come at all, frustration may develop, and employees will lose interest.
"If you're going to ask for 4,000 offers, you have to be willing to have 4,000 conversations," says Russell Rath, president of consultancy at management firm Kotter International, who has had to see companies make a mistake by relying too much on data collection.
"Because if you don't get to the end, the staff will be guessing," Did you hear me the truth?
??????????????????
And if you are the same, why shouldn't I be the same? "
According to Earnest, Madison Reed, which now conducts monthly employee surveys, is in a position to take action on the same day that anyone reports the problem with the help of a "glider."
And, after collecting feedback from employees unhappy with the speed of decision-making and the quality of communication, she was able to reorganize several teams within the company and introduce communication training to solve problems.
Ruby Tuesday is gaining new knowledge of its employees and hopes that, in the long run, this knowledge will help it more effectively retain employees in an industry known for high staff turnover.
"If you don't try to create a culture of transparency, you will lose people," Vitrano said.
If you lose people, you lose customers.
And if you lose customers, you lose company.
New asphalt on Krasnodar Avenue is opened in Barnaul
In Barnaul took drastic measures to eliminate the cause of asphalt failures on Krasnoarmy Avenue.
The place where the pits appeared twice on the recently paved carriageway (intersection with Youth Street) was decided to "open."
It should be reminded that the collapse of a small section of the road near the tram tracks was due to the fact that the land in the area of the powerless unexploited network was lost.
According to the deputy chairman of the city committee on road management, improvement, transport and communications Ivan Garriat, a detailed survey will be carried out for a detailed survey and elimination of the prerequisites for the collapse.
Depending on its results, the necessary measures will be taken.
It is assumed that it will be necessary to restore the formwork of non-economic communications and their bettering.
This is reported on the official website of the regional capital.
The Bruins team have to deal with longer because the National Student Sports Association canceled workouts twice a day
Time is approaching eleven in the evening; a crowd of footballers from the University of California in Los Angeles are delayed to chat on one side of the team's new training fields located on campus.
Some of them pulled their T-shirts, exposing their backs, shiny from sweat after a tense first day of sports camp.
For many of the team's players, these minutes of shirtless make up a break in the middle of the day.
Players enrolled in summer classes will go back to the dormitories after a three-hour workout to prepare for the final exams, and the next morning will return to the Wasserman Football Center for meetings at 6: 30.
Shortly before Monday turned on Tuesday, Bruins team coach Jim Mora said, "In the next three days, these guys are waiting for a butcher."
That the National Student Sports Association cancelled workouts twice a day, which was invented to reduce the burden for players, actually lengthened their workday - at least until the end of exams on Friday.
So the start of the first three workouts of the University of California Los Angeles team was scheduled for 7: 15 p.m. to be placed in an already tight player schedule.
The side effect of not having two workouts a day has been more days with one workout, and the Bruins are moving the start of camp for almost a week compared to last year and are doing workouts during summer school for the first time in Mora's six seasons at Westwood.
According to the schedule, they will have 18 workouts until August 20 inclusive before starting official preparations for the first game of the season against the Texas A & M University team in September.
Mora said he supported changing the rules by the National Student Sports Association, despite having another item in the players' tight schedule because of it.
"For three or four days we give them this huge load, it's a serious test," Mora said.
'and they just overcame it, they work, they're wonderful guys.
I think when we live up to Saturday and we'll have more time, it's going to be really great. '
When the camp ends, the University of California in Los Angeles will make the workout closed; it's an easy task as its fields are in direct sight from an adjacent parking lot and from the nearby Laskin Center, an expensive hotel that has already been bombarded with soccer balls that have overcome the protective net behind the gates.
Players from the Bruins should occupy the hotel starting this weekend, but Mora admits that when rooms are free during the season, there may be a problem.
"We will have security," Mora said.
'it's a serious problem and I'm not exaggerating the danger, assuming anyone can take down a room, sit there and record a workout on video.
If you have a video recording of the workout, it's very serious.
But we will have security there and there will be security at parking number 8.
We will do everything we can with what we have.
I won't worry too much because of it.
We have a plan. '
All victims of the terrorist attack in St. Petersburg are discharged from hospitals
All those injured during the terrorist attack in the St. Petersburg metro in April have been discharged from hospitals.
This was reported in the press service of Vice-Governor Anna Mityanina.
According to data at the end of July, three people remained in hospitals, TV Center reports.
Let's remind, the explosion in the metro of St. Petersburg was carried out on April 3 of the current year.
The bomb was detonated by suicide bomber Akbarzhon Dzhalilov.
The attack killed 15 people as well as the perpetrator himself.
In the criminal case, 11 people, including alleged organizer Abror Asimov, were arrested.
We would like to remind you that on the eve of Rosconsunadzor recommended the metro of St. Petersburg to revise the plan of measures to ensure transport security, in particular, increasing the number of frames of metal detectors.
Facebook reinforces fact-cheering in fight against fake news
Facebook will be more likely to send texts suspicious of the hoax to independent experts and show their conclusions under original posts, the world's largest social network, which is trying to combat so-called fake news, said on Thursday.
In a statement on its website, the company said it was beginning to use improved machine learning algorithms to recognize possible hoax, send them to check and possibly show fact-cheering results under the source post.
Facebook has been criticized as one of the main ways to spread so-called fake news, which many believe had an impact on the 2016 US presidential election.
The issue is also being actively debated in Europe after French voters were misled by false reports ahead of the presidential election in May, and in Germany before the September election expressed support for a plan to sanction social media if they did not promptly remove hate posts.
On Thursday, in a separate statement in German, Facebook reported testing a new fact-cheering algorithm that was launched in the United States, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
"In addition to seeing which messages are being challenged by independent verifiers, people want to have a broader context to make informed judgments about what they read and what they share," Sarah Sue, Facebook's news tape manager, wrote in her block.
She added that Facebook would continue to test the "related articles" feature and work on other changes to the news tape to address the problem of fake news.
Create a neo-comic: One castle in English history
In the recent past, the tiny Scotney Castle was filmed in the music video "Squeeze," and served as a haven for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970s and 1980s.
But 700 years from his cosy spot in the Bury River Valley in Harrison County, he watched the tumultuous story around, and now inspired Jamie Rhodes, a Yorkshire with smoky hair and with a propensity for historical documents, on a mega-comic.
"I think it's so beautiful - to look at the handwriting of a man who died 300 years ago," he says with enthusiasm.
'you feel it so personally when you keep that letter in your hand. '
"Castle in England" covers a period from the Middle Ages to the Ewardian era and tells about the families who lived in Scotney; each story was illustrated by one of the young British artists - Aigine Lenkevich, Bryony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
This is not Rhodes's first book, which is based on archival data: In 2014, he wrote "The Zubs of a Dead Man and Other Stories" - a collection of British Library documents; this project unexpectedly touched him to the depths of the soul.
"I could be rattled by just a fingerprint on the edge of a letter written in the 1700s by a double agent who worked on the magnets," he tells us.
"It's the imprint of his finger"
And the letters are always smeared with smoke, because in those times the fire was lit for lighting.
And after 300 years, in the future, you seem like you're there too.
Ah, how I love the archives! "
For a man engulfed in such passion for old papers, to get support from the National Trust and the English Arts Council and to live in the castle for four months ("Honest speaking, I'm a bit of a guest there") seems too good to be true.
Rhods had spent days studying the "new" Vicorian castle, walked through the archives and considered numerous treasures of the estate and ancient things - for example, heads of hyen on walls or bottles, centuries lying in the ditch.
He walked through the park and through the ruins of the old castle, talking to foresters, gardeners and sometimes with artists working on illustrations to his book.
Then at night he was "drinking whisky and sitting down to write."
The history of Scotney Castle is not much studied because the National Foundation only gained full access to it in 2006, when the last heir, Elizabeth Hassey, died.
When Rhods arrived there a decade later, the staff were just beginning to deal with the archive, which he describes as "what aristocrats have been swinging on the attic for centuries."
Diaries, letters from the times of the British Empire, maps showing who owned what: "You think land disputes are boring," says Rods, "but that's why two families fought for this birch.
It happens so, guys! "
In some stories of the collection, the castle becomes the starting point for broader research in English history: For example, in a "worker," the hero leaves the newly built castle to join the Cross Revolution of 1381.
"There is evidence of a riot that took place at the castle in 1380, in a book called The Knight Families of Kent and Sussex," says Rods.
"The peasant uprising started in these places, and I thought the revolt was the right beginning.
Maybe they were connected? "
Other stories are strongly linked to the history of the castle - for example, "The Priest," which tells of a Jesuit priest whom the Darrels family had been hiding for seven years during the English Reformation.
Or "Conservative," about 18th-century smugglers Arthur Darrell, who is believed to have staged his own funeral by stoning the coffin (it was discovered a few years later when the coffin was dug up).
Darrell is a beloved Rhodes family of all that inhabited Scotney: "Gentlemen seem to have been a perfect scam, eternally drawn into debt and spent money on what they couldn't afford.
In different generations, Darrell's men have solved their debt problems by marrying rich older women - I imagine them as a company of nice guys who are able to care for the heirs of great fortunes. "
After finishing work at the castle, Rods is looking for other opportunities to get a unique writing experience.
He lived for two weeks in the Finnish dumb, where he wrote a graphic novel about Elyanmäki, a place where at the beginning of the 20th century there was a sanatorium, and then it grew up again in the forest.
But Scotney remains a special place for him.
"I was sad to leave," he says.
"I felt like this: Hell, I have to go back to real life again."
Fifteen largest banks choose "Russia"
The conflict in the Association of Russian Banks (ARB) is developing: Following Sberbank, VTB, VTB-24, Alfa-Bank, Gazprom, Rosagricultural Bank, Sberbank and FC "Opening," seven other credit institutions are going to leave this public organization.
Thus, at least 80 percent of the market will come from ARB organizations.
But this is not just a way out - all the banks that have declared a break with the ARB are negotiating with another public organization that unites credit institutions - the Association of Regional Banks "Russia," which is headed by the well-known politician Anatoly Aksakov, the chairman of the State Duma Committee on the Financial Market, recognized, by the way, by the results of the last session and the most effective head of the Duma committee and deputy on the number of bills prepared.
The beginning of the conflict within the ARB took place during a discussion in the Federation Council, when the Interregional Banking Council considered new bills, in particular, involving a new classification of banks depending on the size of the authorized capital.
Then Garegin Tdranyan, president of the ARB, said the association believed the bill was being passed in the interests of the largest banks, which were thus trying to limit the capabilities of small and medium-sized banks in the regions by intercepting their clientele.
Among other claims was criticism of the Central Bank, which, according to Tdranyan, does not always justify the withdrawal of licenses from some banks, which, however, was followed by an objection from the representative of the Central Bank: Many of the heads of past banks, in particular, Vnesprombanka, were part of the governing bodies of the ARB.
Apparently, this exchange of mutually exclusive opinions in very sensitive to the relations with the main regulator of the banking environment and became a visible reason that the fifteen largest banks, expressing disagreement with the policy of the ARB, began to prepare for joining the association "Russia," noting that "the effectiveness of the ARB's work will be at a low level, and constructive dialogue within the banking community is not actually carried out."
Depositors will be better off
What will the case end?
Let us answer at once the main question that arises at the slightest failure or conflict in the banking sphere or near it: The depositors are not at risk, rather, on the contrary, the reliability of the banking system will increase.
Anatoly Aksakov is the head of "Russia," known for his sensitivity to the interests of banks and their clients, a high-level broker highly appreciated by the Central Bank: Practically all the management of the Central Bank is present at the annual events of the association, and all significant legislative initiatives of the regulator pass through expert assessments of "regionals."
In the frame-organizational plan, obviously, there are no special shocks as well.
Unquestionably, the ARB gets into a difficult financial and management situation after losing such powerful and influential participants with their contributions and lobbying opportunities.
However, in this oldest - established in 1991 - an organization that advocates the interests of the banking community, there is considerable potential to continue to improve banking law and the sphere of monetary circulation as a whole.
It is impossible to say that in the association "Russia" with open arms are ready to accept new members on any terms, judging by the reaction of its leader, Anatoly Aksakov ("may want too much"), who as early as July 21 at a briefing in the press center of the Parliamentary newspaper, said that "just the next day representatives of the ARB banks asked me to consider the possibility of increasing the potential of our association" Russia. ""
Their proposals are to strengthen the voice of bankers in the Association Council, and to pay more attention to new banking technologies.
Now the negotiation process is underway, the proposals of both sides are being studied, the agenda of the extraordinary congress of the association, which will be held in Sochi in mid-September within the framework of the international banking forum, is being prepared.
There and we will decide.
Also, Anatoly Aksakov, stressing that "the chair does not hold," called possible the new head of the renewed association "Russia" Georgy Luntovsky, who leaves the post of Vice-Chairman of the Central Bank in September, highly describing his business and human qualities.
On August 18, Anatoly Aksakov, who is now holidaying in Crimea, plans to suspend his vacation for one day and arrive in Moscow, at an extraordinary meeting of the Council of the Association "Russia," where it is planned to consider the agenda of the extraordinary congress "Russia."
Entry of petrol-powered cars to Russia's major cities will not be restricted
The deputy head of the Ministry of Transport, Nikolai Asaul, said that, contrary to media reports, the entry of petrol-powered cars into Russia's major cities would not be limited yet.
This is a more radical form of our concept.
Our concept is that we should gradually raise the ecological class.
And there's a concept to immediately switch to zero emissions.
I believe that technically we are not ready for it.
The question is still: From what year?
It's the same phrase on the level of slogans - let's ban.
Where and when?
Tomorrow?
Will the whole city close?
"After 20 years - I don't know, maybe it will happen," Price quoted the minister as saying.
Earlier, the newspaper "Gloria" reported that by August 17, Vice-Prime Minister Arkady Palkovich was instructed to study the proposals on possible variants of state support of electric transport presented to the government by the CEO of PJSC KamAZ Sergey Kogogin.
Among the suggestions, according to the newspaper, is the use of ICE machines in major cities and resorts.
Washington changes the rules for getting a card.
According to media reports, President Donald Trump has said that a new U.S. immigration plan would be adopted that would change the rules for getting a mega card.
The plan calls for reducing the number of legal immigrants to 50,000 a year, stricter rules for obtaining temporary work visas and restrictions on obtaining family visas.
The new rules are proposed by the Republican Party and supported by the president.
The bill will be debated in two chambers of Congress.
"This law will reduce poverty, raise wages, and save taxpayers billions of dollars, and it will do so by changing the way the United States gives out cards to citizens of other countries.
The law would reduce chain migration and replace the existing scheme.
The new application process will provide benefits to candidates who own English, have cash resources that allow them to contain themselves, and have skills that will benefit our economy, "Trump said, according to U.S. media.
The emergence of sex robots is real and it should bother us
We didn't have time to think that 2017 could no longer get worse, a new report on technological successes in the production of sex robots has been released.
Reporter.
Sex robots are now in the spotlight.
The Responsible Robotics Foundation (FRR) recently released a report on the development of sex robots in the next 5-10 years.
According to Noel Sharkey, a well-deserved professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of FRR, we should take their appearance seriously.
Users will be able to choose robot eye color, nipple shape and nail type.
"People are chipping at this, but firms are already sending them to consumers in large numbers, and soon we'll see them much more," Sharkey said at the presentation of the new report.
Modern sex dolls have evolved from their inflatable fellows into robots with silicone skin, warm to the touch, and with almost human replicas managed by artificial intelligence.
Users can also "tune" their robots to their taste, choosing everything from the color of the eyes and shape of the robot's nipples to the shape and color of the nails.
But the fact that many robots have a "personality," compared to which the Longford Jena would appear to be very progressive, worries even more.
Modern sex dolls have become robots with silicone skin.
The RealBotix robot, for example, allows users to customize in robots the quality they find attractive - for example, shy.
There are still Roxxxy Gold sex robots, developed by "True Saturon," which come with an already programmed individuality - for example, "Cold Farrah" makes an impression shy, and "Wild Wendy" has a "bold" character.
"Roxxxy Gold has a character that is perfectly suited to yours," according to the "True Saturon" website.
So she loves what you love, doesn't like what you don't like, and so on.
She changes her mood during the day as a real person!
She might want to sleep or chatter, or she might "be in the mood"! "
In the emergence of sex robots, there is a lot of concern - not least because they replace real human relationships - but most worrying is the subordinate image of a woman, the association with rape that evokes the mastery of the Cold (read: Resisting) Farah.
Roxxxy is compared to a vibrator, only for men.
"If a woman (sic!) can have a vibrator, why can't men have Roxxxy?" The website says.
But these sex robots are not just fetishes or just new sex toys.
Their emergence and ever-increasing complexity points to something darker and deeper in our culture, a retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards the desire for sex with subordination as an optional supplement.
Most men certainly won't buy sex robots, and although FRR notes their growing popularity, they still remain on the periphery of consumer culture.
But what comes down to us from the periphery can be very instructive about the murals of the era in which we live.
And many people are not bad or aggressive until the free market gives them the opportunity to do so.
It's no coincidence - that these complex sex robots have emerged precisely when women's rights around the world have been at risk when there is a president in the White House who is praised for coming up with women.
The most dreadful thing in the TV series "Rasmus of the Handmaid" is not graphic images, twisted bodies and outstanding eyes, namely how realistic this vision seems.
The Republic of Gilead is an exaggeration, but it doesn't seem so big now.
The goal of the sex robot industry is to achieve such a physical likeness to real women (only with the proportions of porn stars) as technology allows.
Their creators want them to seem like people in touch to copy the movements of the human body.
But it is by their "inverters" that robots are not like real women.
They can't break with their partners or get away from them.
They don't have their lives or biographies - nothing that could point to independence or anything else that could destroy the illusion of complete dependency.
In other words, they are beautiful slaves.
Or, as they say in 2017, are maids.
Los Angeles native Eugene (Pooh) Jeter, who has been in charge of Ukraine's national team since 2013, will not help our national team at the European Basketball Championship, the final part of which starts on August 31.
In an interview with the portal BeBasket, the general manager of "blue-yellow" Andrey Lebedev said.
We tried to negotiate with Jeter, but unfortunately he won't arrive for family reasons.
We'll go to Eurobasket without a naturalized player because we don't want to take someone we don't know.
"This situation will provide opportunities for the development of our young players," he said.
I will remind: With the direct participation of Jeter the national team of Ukraine took a record sixth place on Eurobasket-2013 and for the first time got to the World Basketball Championship, at which the "yellow-blue" couldn't overcome the group stage, and the native of the USA scored an average of 15.4 points per game, made 3 selections and gave 5 assists.
Jeter has stopped advocating for Ukraine's national team since leaving the post of head coach of our national team, American Mike Fratello, who left that position in 2015.
Men's Eurobasket 2017 will be held simultaneously in four countries: Turkey, Romania, Israel and Finland.
The Ukrainian team will hold their matches of the group tournament on the Earth promised.
The wards of Eugene Murzin in Group B will have five matches: With Germany (August 31), Italy (September 2), Georgia (3rd), Lithuania (5th) and Israel (6th).
In preparation for the tournament our men's national team held two control matches, in which they conceded to the Dutch and Belarusians.
Trump's great feat?
Portraying Mita Romney seems very reasonable
In the Trump era, the common place has been the fact that political disputes polarizing the American electorate have smashed some families at the micro level.
Between Thanksgiving Day and Christmas, American newspapers peppered columns about how to deal with terrified relatives voting for Trump.
It seems we are all strained in a way that will soon burst.
Less is said about Trump's ability to connect families.
I write about it because my cousin, a left-leaning poet from Chicago who has long been on knives with Republicans in his family, was coming to me in New York this week.
She reminded me that uniting in the fight against a common enemy can have a strong effect.
Under Trump in the White House, everyone she knows, including a Republican brother with whom she has argued about politics for decades, has suddenly and strangely been on one side.
Over dinner, it's undoubtedly good; but I can't help but think that in a broader context it can be quite dangerous.
Trump has breathed strength into the left-wing flang, but the deforming effect of his rule can move us all to the right.
When we talk about Trump and "normalization," we mean the unlikely possibility that one day we will stop hitting his exits.
There is, however, an even more dubious scenario in which Trump "normalizes" the most right-wing Republicans, who, amid his standards, will unexpectedly show up as a model of common sense.
I caught myself on being very bored today by Mitt Romney's old-fashioned madness - with a dog on the roof of a car and a 14 percent income tax (but we at least knew what his tax declaration looks like) - compared to Trump both seem a very small evil.
When Trump leaves, the next Republican candidate will have enough to just be in his mind to see a huge step forward in it.
When my cousin went to the center, we went with the kids to a carousel in Central Park - the biggest carousel in the New York Department of Parks farm and the best way in the city to spend three dollars if you don't need caffeine.
The horses of Grozny are enormous, the pictures of fiberglass on the central drum - grimacing clowns and animals that, curled up, look at their back in horror - are extremely ominous, and the link music, ironically, leads to delight.
So many famous things in this city are frustrating: The views from skyscrapers are out of date, the silhouettes of buildings have too come to evoke tremors, and the reality of the city doesn't have time for a dream.
Thirty-five years have passed, and I'm still worried the day I learned that the Suárez cottage area is not actually a Swiss chalet (the theme pub "Ye Olde Swiss Cottage" is not into account), but a large circular intersection in North London.
And the carousel in Central Park is still an unusual, magical place in which a child of two, a child of eleven and two women for forty can have a great time.
If I could put a carousel assessment, I would put five, but luckily no one asked me about it.
And in Wisconsin this week, I was asked before holding a card on the terminal to rate my "experience" of shopping on a scale of one to five stars.
In the coffee shop on the corner of my street all the same plus the option to co-evaluate tea at 15 percent is for the order at the rack.
As a result, not only is the idea-neutral interaction slowing down, but it is also necessary to make a personal attitude to a situation that does not involve it.
A poor salesman in Wisconsin smiled furiously while I was tired of valuing my experience of giving her a five-star credit card.
Oscar PHistorius transferred from prison to hospital due to chest pains
PHistorius leaves prison because of a visit to the doctor for the second time.
Last year, he was transferred to a hospital for treatment for cuts to his wrists, which the prison administration claimed he received as a result of a fall in his cell.
PHistorius was convicted of premeditated murder following an appeal by the prosecutor's office against the original sentence for manslaughter.
He killed Steenkamp in the early hours of Valentine's Day in 2013, firing at her several times through the door of a toilet room at his home in Pretoria.
PHistorius said he accepted his girlfriend for a night thief hiding at him in the toilet.
The prosecutor's office has announced its intention to file another protest, this time against Pretoria's six-year term, which it says is too miniscule.
The attorney general's office said it would appeal to South Africa's Supreme Court and an appeal would be heard this year.
Pretoria's term could increase by 15 years if the prosecutor's office succeeds.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
Suspect in beating of NTV journalist elected to sign not to leave
Metropolitan law enforcement officers have elected a measure of restraint in the form of a non-exit subscription for a man who attacked NTV journalist Nikitu Razvojaev during a live broadcast from the Gorki Park on August 2.
This is reported by TASS with reference to the official representative of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation Irina Volk.
"As part of the investigation of a criminal case brought under Article 116 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation (" Pwallpaper ") against a 32-year-old man who struck in the face of a correspondent of one of the TV channels in the Central Park of Culture and Recreation named after Gorki, the suspect was elected a measure of restraint in the form of a subscription of non-departure and proper conduct," Volk clarified.
An Interior Ministry spokesman added that an administrative protocol had been drawn up against the suspect for disobeying the police.
On Wednesday, August 2, a drunk man approached the correspondent and hit him in the face.
As it turned out later, the hooligan has nothing to do with the HFA.
According to Razvojaev himself, the paratroopers, on the other hand, tried to detain the Muscovites.
Two Bulgarian nationals detained in Greece for illegal tent parking
According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, two Bulgarian citizens were detained in Greece for illegal tent parking.
On the morning of August 1, a group of people who had put tents in the wrong place, including two Bulgarian citizens, were detained in Sitonia.
They were released on the same day, while the investigation is still under way.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs told the BBC-Vi TV channel that the citizens of Bulgaria were then released.
Greek authorities have tightened controls on free camping and are already imposing serious fines on anyone caught while parking in an undesignated location.
Checks will be carried out throughout the season.
The ministry said the court could impose a fine.
Russian Foreign Ministry accused US vice president of Cold War-era rhetoric
Statements made during US Vice President Michael Pence's European tour have been criticized by the Russian Foreign Ministry.
"It is with regret to state that Washington is increasingly sliding toward the primitive ideological strains of the Cold War era that are completely detached from reality," the Russian foreign ministry said in a statement.
Thus in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs reacted to Pensa's words about the "Russian threat" and the attempts of the violent crossing of the borders, which he said in the Matrix.
The Russian Foreign Ministry pointed to the destructiveness of the choice "either with the West, or with Russia" and the invisibility of the thesis about the supposedly non-alternative entry of all of Southeast Europe into NATO.
Russian diplomats also recalled that it was the US that violated international law by using force to reject Kosovo from Serbia and thus created another hotbed of tension.
"We call on American colleagues to stop the shelf of Russia and its foreign policy line, which is invariably based on respect for partners and readiness for joint constructive work, on mutual consideration of interests," the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
Paramedic injured in ambulance accident in Moscow region
The accident took place in the near-Moscow Stupino, as a result of a collision of an inomarka with a carriage "Scores of Aid" suffered by a paramedic.
Today at about 08: 10 p.m. there was a collision of a Mitsubishi car with an ambulance in Stupino, Moscow region.
"As a result of the collision, the ambulance turned over," TASS said in the press service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs in the Moscow region.
Law enforcement officers are working at the scene of the accident and the circumstances of the incident are being investigated.
In the Odessa region, a woman threw her newborn son on a construction site, wrapped in a cellophane package.
On the evening of August 3, the Razdelnan Police Department received a report from a local resident that he had found a package with an infant in an unfinished private house.
"Law enforcement officers and doctors went to the scene and promptly took the child to a medical facility," the Odessa head of the National Police reported.
Medics determined the boy was born hours before he was discovered, as evidenced by the presence of the umbilical cord.
A 36-year-old local woman has been identified in the course of priority operational and investigative activities.
The woman was also found to have three other young children.
As noted in the head, in the field of view of law enforcement the family had not previously been caught and there was no special registration.
At present, police officers determine the circumstances and reasons that led the woman to the act, after which a procedural decision will be taken.
The infant is now under the supervision of doctors.
As previously reported, in Nikolaev, a 21-year-old woman threw her premature baby into a garbage pipe.
Gregory Leps: "I'm vomiting in a fight, though 55 - not 30"
One of the most successful artists of the Russian epic, Grigory Leps, will celebrate its 55th anniversary next Sunday.
Before the celebration, the singer talked to a "spray" columnist.
I remember how your "poltinnik" was celebrated.
A special tent in "Luzhniki," Gloria Gaynor sang for a birthday party, a powerful salute over the Moscow River.
You certainly had a miscarriage then, as if you wanted to spend your next five years.
Have the designs come true?
Speaking of the profession, it was a successful period.
I worked hard, went three times with tours the whole country, gave 120-130 concerts a year.
He released two good albums.
Of course, now I am no longer that, say, 20 years ago.
The biological clock is not to be fooled.
Singing the way I sang in my 30 becomes all heavy.
Yet I vomit into the fight, I don't want to stop.
And I with new people, it seems to me, go to a different level.
With them you and the new album are recording, the first in three years.
Yes, work on it is now underway.
Actually, we have already recorded everything in my studio and now we will send it to Los Angeles.
It is called "Are you so serious?" By the song of the same name, which is written together with Timati.
It's not quite ready yet, so we haven't put it anywhere yet.
Let's do it later when and the clip on it is taken down.
And the album will be presented in November - to a series of my anniversary concerts in Moscow "Crocus City Hall."
A classy American drummer, Chris Coleman, attached his hand to your new plate.
Do you seem to want him and into your touring line-up to attract?
In my opinion, Coleman is today one of the world's most outstanding drummers.
He was coming to me in the studio, recording his parties.
I suggested that he be part of my band, and Jeremy Colson (a well-known drummer involved in different projects. - "Gloria") suggested.
But for long work in Russia, they put forward, to put it mildly, excessive conditions.
It was about fees ranging from €35,000 to €45,000 a month.
Then I thought that in the post-Soviet space I would play worthy musicians.
And found excellent drummer Max Malyshev.
Generally it is better to feed your own (smiles).
At times I want to fight to some of them, not for what.
For example, guitarist Nikita Dosumov is highly quoted internationally.
Western music magazines write about him, he is invited to various guitar festivals.
Steve Wai, who listened to his game, said "a new generation of guitarists has come, with another performing technique."
Your album comes down in Los Angeles, American musicians cooperate with you, but you still can't come to the USA?
Are you trying to lift this ban?
Now, frankly, I do nothing.
There are a number of lawyers who are dealing with the issue.
As a musician I'm really genuinely sorry that I can't get to America.
I said more than once that I was learning there.
The more you communicate with real professionals, the more useful it is.
We don't blunt them, but we don't have that experience, school.
Our performers of popular music for 70 years have not been given the tasks that American musicians have always solved.
They were striving for the highest quality sound.
And I'm trying to follow the same principles.
Now for some reason and the UK has denied me entry for ten years.
But I will still apply for a visa to the British embassy every year so that I will be allowed to travel there again and the most important thing is to work there.
The rest of Europe treats me favorably.
And already in August you are planning a concert in Monaco, not ordered, but a poster, right?
Yes, there's a good Sporting Hall in Monte Carlo, I've been performing there once.
Now invited again, and as far as I know, all tickets for the concert have already been sold out.
On "Randeva Lyma Vaikule," which will start on July 20 in Jurmala, will you go?
She invited me, and I certainly responded.
Lyme is a wonderful singer and a gorgeous woman, able to submit herself and fine vocals, and even a whisper.
After touring and anniversary concerts, as far as I know, you want to turn to the creative work of Vladimir High.
You already have two albums with his songs in discography.
When will the third come out?
Probably next year.
But it will be completely differently made.
I want to record about 80-90 of High's songs in about the same filing as he himself did.
Only voice and guitar.
No other arrangement.
Accompaniment to me will be our famous musician Timur Vedernikov.
I will try to attract Alexander Yakovlevich Rosenbaum to participate in the album.
I talked to him about this topic, we have a good relationship, but he's a busy person, so we'll see how it comes up.
You and Boris Gchild's songs were gradually introduced into his repertoire.
???????????????????????????????????????
Boris Borisovich is a wonderful man and a great musician.
I crossed with him several times and asked: Can I sing some of his songs?
He answered, "Gregory, I write songs for them to perform."
Please try, sing.
Probably interesting and such an album to record.
As long as I have no such task, but in the future, in a year or two, if Boris Borisovich does not object, I may make such a project.
If you don't focus entirely on the affairs of your production center.
I believe, while you have not yet realized its potential, have not signed contracts with all the artists that are interesting to you?
There are a number of performers I would have dreamed of having under my wing, but they are independent, accomplished people.
Do you mean Sergey Lazarev?
Silver is a brilliant singer, I invited him.
I can disagree with his repertoire, but he is a professional and he has his own development strategy.
And in my center now there is Alexander Panayotov, whom I led in "Goetz."
We have signed a contract with him and are working.
In our pop music, such singers are rare.
It will be a sincere pity if he does not reach the heights that are worthy.
I try to pick him a repertoire, I shoot clips.
I hope for a good result.
I also try to promote other artists of my center: I buy them songs, I pay poets, sometimes their tracks get in the rotation of TV and radio channels.
If they do not reach great heights, I will still bring our cooperation to a logical conclusion.
At the exit, they'll get a recorded album, a few clips.
And further, if they want, can go their way, and I will not insist that they return the money invested in them.
Although I will be pleased if any of them achieve commercial success and pay me the interest we negotiated in the contract.
But if that doesn't happen, no one is going to cut off the oxygen.
Let everyone work, punch, prove, as I once proved.
If tomorrow you are offered to make a tour of Ukraine and guarantee entry to the country, will you go?
I'm still invited there.
It's mostly about closed events.
And as for the big tour...
I am a man of my country, a Russian, by my own conviction flew to Syria on that very plane, which then crashed.
If tomorrow is told that it is necessary to fly to some other point in the interests of the state, - I will fly.
And I'm pleading that bloggers and other critics will think about me.
I sincerely regret that we had such a situation with Ukraine.
Because I believe: We are one people and should be together.
I regret that this is unlikely to happen, at least in the near future.
I used to give 40-50 concerts in Ukraine in a year.
Greeted like nowhere.
A very grateful public.
And with several Ukrainian artists collaborated: Ani Lorak, Light Loboda, Imam Loic...
There are a lot of gifted people in Ukraine, and it is a sincere pity that now they cannot fully splash out their talent to a wide Russian audience.
Music should unite and entertain people.
I would be happy to invite some class Ukrainian performer to Russia, such as Slava Visochuk, and make a joint concert with him.
But I think at the moment it's unlikely...
Andrey Oslakov transferred from the cosmodrome
As it became known to "Ural," the technical director of the cosmodrome East Andrey Oslashkov started work at the State Space Research and Production Center named after Khrunichev.
Previously, he was de facto involved in the construction of the Eastern Cosmodrome, but due to disagreements with the management of the Center for the Operation of Ground and Space Infrastructure (CENCI), he was transferred to an enterprise in the Moscow Films, where he will coordinate production.
Mr. Oslakov will not have a replacement: The post of the technical director is likely to be abolished, and the functionaries will be distributed according to the units of CENCI.
The top managers of several space industry enterprises, as well as a member of the government apparatus, told about the fact that the technical director of the Eastern and Deputy General Director of the CENCI for technological development Andrey Oslashkov has moved to work at the Khrunichev State University.
"He has been working in a new post for a few weeks now," the industry's interlocutors said.
It was not possible to get an operational comment by CENCI on Thursday, and Mr. Oflakov himself was unavailable for comment.
However, the information "Ural" has been officially confirmed in the GKDC.
He decided to move to the position of director of production coordination, - said at the enterprise.
Mr. Oflakov went on to work at CENCI in 2013, serving in space troops, particularly in Baikonur, and in Plesetsk - at the "northern" cosmodrome served as the first deputy commander in the rank of colonel.
In 2009 he became a figure in the criminal case.
The investigation accused him of bribery: Allegedly from his filing, regional merchants received state orders for kickbacks, but failed to comply with the commitments made to clean the separated parts of the launch vehicles in the Arkhangelsk region and the Republic of Komi.
In 2012, a jury found him not guilty.
The responsibility for technological development assigned to him in CENCI was extended to different projects, but the main one was the construction of a cosmodrome in the Far East.
Oleg Ostapenko, then head of the Federal Space Agency, said in an interview with the Monitor that the state of affairs in the East "was critical as early as October 2013."
The fact is that a strategic error was made in the planning: The completion of the construction and the first launch of the Soyuz-2.1 launcher were planned for the same time - the end of 2015.
To carry out the launch before the end of the year, the completion of the construction was decided six months earlier and the terms were shifted from December to July 2015.
In order to speed up the process it was necessary to go on a trick: Specialists of CENCI began to conduct parallel installation of technological equipment on unfinished objects.
The main supporter of this idea was Andrey Oflakov.
Despite the risks and the fact that the transfer occurred (instead of December 2015 "Soyuz" only took place on April 28, 2016), this idea justified itself, says the source of "Ural" at the cosmodrome: "Otherwise we would still not have carried out a single launch from the East, but would be engaged in construction."
Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin, who is in charge of the creation of the cosmodrome, jokingly referred to Andrei Oslakov as his "spaceman," but he almost always asked for information about the progress of the construction.
For example, in an interview with Kommersant, he proposed to deprive the Federal Agency for Special Construction of the status of the sole executor for the East and to work directly with the subcontractors: "Why should we put all the eggs in one basket?"
This idea has found support in government.
Since 2017, CENCI has taken over as general contractor to complete construction and installation work at the start-up and technical complex by the planned fourth-quarter launches.
According to "Kommersant," the reason for Mr. Oslakov's transition to a new place of work was the disagreement with the management of CENCI regarding the ways to complete the construction of the facilities and complexes of the cosmodrome, as well as the methods of working with subcontracting organizations.
"It was decided that it would be better for everyone," says one of the top managers involved in building the East.
A government official, in turn, calls the decision strange: "He was one of the best specialists, finding him an equivalent replacement will not be easy."
According to Kommersant, this will not be necessary: The position of the technical director of the cosmodrome will be abolished and its functions will be distributed to the CENCI units.
Music schools will have a program to teach two specialties
In the future pupils of children's music schools will be able to receive two specialties at the same time.
According to the deputy director of the Department of Science and Education of the Ministry of Culture of the Ministry of Culture, it is possible to re-read repeated disciplines to students, and the issue with payment of other classes in the second specialty is solved with the help of special grants, RIA Novosti reports.
"The Ministry of Culture has taken this issue to control, and we, together with the expert community, will develop a mechanism that will allow to master two specialties, but at the same time will not contradict the current legislation in the field of education," Galbenko said.
Last Friday, during Vladimir Putin's "Non-Child Talk" with pupils of the Sirius Children's Center, student Maria Andreeva said that she had to pay for recurring items in the second specialty at the Moscow Conservatory.
The girl said that she learns in violin and piano class and has awards contests in both directions.
The head of state recognized her question as very relevant and promised to help.
In Mexico, a 17-year-old Russian is detained on a wall on a skyscraper
In Mexico, a 17-year-old Russian, Kirill N., was detained on a wall on the roof of a high-rise building, according to the El Universal portal.
The incident took place in the capital, Mexico City.
The young man, with the help of two unknown men, moved through a three-metre fence into the grounds of Nestle's office building complex and took himself to one of his towers.
At the same time, he did not use any special equipment, insurance and ropes.
Detained a young man already on the roof.
Staff at the Ministry of Public Security lowered him to the ground by helicopter.
He was then sent to the National Migration Institute.
It finds out whether the young man is legally in the territory of the country.
Meanwhile, a video of a young man climbing a high-rise has become popular on the web.
Users called the young man a "man-spider."
As the media writes, such experiments are a hobby for him.
Red meat, dairy products and chocolate can help ease the OVC.
Red meat and chocolate is considered a nightmare for your digestive tract.
But recent research suggests otherwise: A diet rich in meat proteins and dairy products can help ease symptoms in those suffering from inflammatory bowel diseases.
This incurable disease, which affects an estimated 1.3 million people in the US and 300,000 in the UK, leads to colics and abdominal swelling, chronic or bloody ponos, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
Usually, patients are advised to avoid meat and dairy products to mitigate symptoms, but researchers at the University of Washington have found that the main amino acid protein tryptophan contributes to the production of immune cells that increase gut tolerance.
Lead researcher Dr Marco Collette explained that immune cells in the gut ensure that malicious microbes coming with food do not penetrate the body.
Cells capable of launching an inflammatory process are balanced by cells that increase tolerance while protecting the body without harming sensitive tissues.
If the balance is too much disturbed towards inflammation, it can lead to inflammatory bowel disease.
Experiments have shown that mice that have a certain bacterium in the gut appear to increase the tolerance of the cell.
And this bacteria needs tryptophan - one of the building elements of the protein - to launch the appearance of these cells.
Professor Colchester said: 'We have established a link between one type of bacteria - Lactobacillus reuteri, - which is part of the normal gut microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that increase tolerance.
The more tryptophan was contained in the mice 'diet, the more these immune cells they had.'
He suggested that the same would work in humans: A combination of L. reuteri and a rich tryptophan diet could contribute to a more tolerant and less inflammation-prone environment in the gut.
Dr. Louise Cervantes-Barraganvas, studying a variety of tolerance-enhancing immune cells, found that one group of experimental mice had these cells, and the other group, which belonged to the same line but was contained separately, did not have them.
She suggested that the difference could be caused by the gut microbites of mice - communities of bacteria, viruses and fungi that usually live in the gastrointestinal tract.
The DNA of mice 'bowel cells has been sequenced, and six species of bacteria present in mice that have immune cells but are absent from mice that do not have them have been found.
Mice grown in a sterile environment that did not have a good microbiome and did not develop this kind of immune cells were given L. reuteri, and their immune cells appeared.
To understand how bacteria affect the immune system, researchers MRI or L. reuteri in a liquid environment and then carried small portions of the liquid - without bacteria - to under-developed immune cells allocated from mice.
Immune cells have become cells that increase tolerance.
When the active component was separated from the liquid, it turned out to be a byproduct of tryptophan processing, known as indol-3-lactic acid.
When researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in mice 'food, the number of these cells increased by about 50 percent, but when tryptophan levels were halved, the number of cells also fell by half.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explains that humans have the same tolerance-enhancing cells as mice, and most of us have L. reuteri in their gastrointestinal tract.
It is not known whether by-products of tryptophan from L. reuteri contribute to cell development in humans just as in mice, but people suffering from inflammatory bowel disease have found defects in the genes associated with tryptophan.
She says: "Perhaps the development of these cells should be strengthened, because these cells depend on inflammatory processes on the inner surface of the brush.
High levels of tryptophan in the presence of L. reuteri can potentially lead to an expansion of their populations. "
According to Jose Mourinho, Manchester United have hired a 'genius' in the face of Nemanja Matic
Manchester United have hired a "genius" in the face of Nemanja Matic, according to Jose Mourinho after the midfielder made his debut in the match against Sampdoria on Wednesday evening.
The player, acquired for 40 million pounds at Chelsea, started with a 2-1 win in Dublin in United's last pre-season match before the UEFA Super Cup match against Real Madrid on Thursday and made an impression as a midfielder, while players like Paul Gibbs and Andreas Pereira broke forward when they were favored.
However, as Matic did not take part in Chelsea's pre-season tour of Asia, he was seriously lacking in preparation for the game and he sustained just 45 minutes, which Mourinho said required refinement before the start of the Premier League season.
"He needs time, but his experience, mind, genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football," Mourinho said.
"We will help him prepare sooner rather than later."
As well as Matic, his fellow new players Victor Lindelöf and Romelu Lukaku started the game at the Aviva Stadium when Mourinho began forming his main line-up by the start of next season.
The Post reported this week that Mourinho wanted to hire three more players, but stressed that the club had already achieved fantastic results by hiring three of the four players he would like to hire in the first place.
"I am grateful to the club for producing three out of four," he added.
"I'll think even more if they get me four out of four, but they've tried very hard for me."
Former leaders of Lithuania's Social Democrats persuade them to stay in ruling coalition
Former chairmen of the Lithuanian Social Democratic Party, ex-premiers Algirdas Butkevicius and Gethias Kirkilas, as well as the former speaker of the Seimas from the Social Democrats, Yurshenas, appealed to the one-party parties to remain in the ruling coalition.
According to the "Parliamentary newspaper," due to friction with the partners - the Union of peasants and the "Greens" - the Social Democratic Party initiated a discussion on whether to remain in the ruling coalition.
But the coalition with the "peasants" created for us not very easy, but still conditions for further implementation of the goals of social justice, which on our initiative are envisaged in the program of the government, and to preserve the political dominance of the left center over the right parties. "
According to the party's former leaders, the discussion has so far "prevailed with an emotion-based expression of opinion without concrete arguments."
The authors of the letter fear that their party's unfettered actions could lead Lithuania to political, economic and social instability.
A fine has been imposed on the disabled Antony Medvedev
The Moscow City Court reduced the punishment of wheelchair-disabled Antony Medvedev from four-and-a-half years in prison to a fine of 200,000 rubles.
Earlier, the convicted person was released from jail by a decision of the Timiryazev court.
At the same time, the Moscow City Court confirmed that the accused is a criminal because he organized the robbery and abduction of a scooter from a former special forces fighter.
The Moscow City Court, by its decision, reduced the punishment of Anthony Medvedev to 200 thousand rubles fine.
"Sergiev is the organizer of the robbery, which also forms the composition of the crime, and, accordingly, such a person should be prosecuted," a spokesman for the Moscow City Court, Ulyan Solopov, explained to the Post.
In this case the court took into account the state of health of Moses, the actual circumstances of the case, the absence of aggravating circumstances.
In addition, the court applied Article 64 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation, according to which it is possible to impose a penalty below the lower limit.
The court did not establish the circumstances that would give rise to a change in the category of gravity of the act and the change of sentence.
He said that he was not satisfied with the decision of the Moscow City Court.
I am disappointed with the court's decision.
The only legitimate solution would be an excuse, intends to further fight for justice.
His lawyer, Andrei Orlov, did not rule out an appeal against the sentence in the appeal court of the Moscow City Court and the Supreme Court.
"We will use all the leverage right up to the European Court of Human Rights," he told RIA Novosti.
Let's remind, 28-year-old Muscovite Anton Medvedev, who suffers from spinal muscular atrophy, became a figure in the criminal case last autumn.
Ross claims to have bought a scooter from acquaintances for 160,000 rubles to then sell.
However, the owners of the scooter, among them a former special forces fighter, said that Diana and his assistant, Vasyl Seropants, had taken away their property, threatening to use violence.
On June 30, the Timiryazevsky District Court of Moscow sentenced Basil Seroshatov to three years in prison, and Anton Medvedev to four-and-a-half years in prison, serving his sentence in a colony of general regime (under Part 2 of Article 162 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation).
After being placed in jail, the Public Chamber, the Prosecutor General's Office, the Commissioner for Human Rights under the President Tatiana Moskalkova joined the case.
As a result, in mid-July he was released from jail by a decision of the same Timiryazev court.
The defence, in turn, appealed the decision of the first instance to the Moscow City Court.
ONF to prepare a report on ecology to the president
The final "Action Forum" of the All-Russian People's Front (ONF) in 2017 will be devoted to environmental issues, said a source in the ONF and confirmed by the head of the executive committee of the movement Alexei Anisenko.
According to him, according to the results of the forum "front-runners" plan to prepare a report to the president on the problems of domestic ecology, as well as to propose a strategy for their solution.
Tsai's interlocutors at the ONF note that the report to the head of state will contain a "deep analysis" on the situation in all federal districts of the country.
According to Tsai, the final ONF forum will take place in the autumn.
The exact date of it has not yet been determined - as a rule, it is adjusted to the schedule of the president, who is the leader of the movement and has traditionally been present at key ONF events.
The Front held several interregional environmental conferences, one in two federal districts - in Rostov-on-Don, Kaliningrad and Kirowa.
The final event will be a conference in the capital of the Republic of Buryatia.
On the basis of the proposals that have been made and will be made at these events, we will form the system proposals for solving environmental problems, - said the interviewee at the ONF.
The co-chairman of the Central Staff of the Movement, Olga Timofeeva, who heads the State Duma Committee on Ecology and Environmental Protection, said that the "frontmen" will report to the head of state on the work carried out within the framework of the Year of Ecology in Russia.
The final environmental forum and the ONF Action Forum are likely to be combined.
During the year we grew up a powerful team of experts in the field of environmental problems, saw gaps in the legislation, stopped dozens of violations of the law.
All of this will be included in the report that we are preparing the president as the leader of our movement.
Besides this document, the "front-runners" also read about the work on the priority projects of ONF, - Olga Timofeeva told the "mosques."
According to her, Sergei Ivanov, the special representative of the head of state on environmental activities, ecology and transport, will be invited to the forum.
He previously took part in the ONF Media Forum, which was held in St. Petersburg in April.
In a few months, the Year of Ecology will go into history, and the most important thing to do today is to launch environmental mechanisms so that they work for years to come.
So that these issues do not fall out of the agenda, "added Olga Timofeeva.
Andrei Koladin, Head of the Regional Policy Laboratory of the Expert Institute for Social Research (EIGA), noted that by raising environmental issues, the ONF is acting in line with the presidential agenda.
Many things they as experts have offered in various forums, and these initiatives have received the support of the president, - said Andrei Kolyadin.
He stressed that today the economic potential of the environmental agenda cannot be ruled out, which could give the regions additional impetus for development.
In the future, with the help of ONF, the regions will be able to lobby not only for the solution of their environmental problems, but also for the development of eco-tourism, "the expert added.
The relevance of the environmental theme demonstrated a "straight line" with Vladimir Putin in June.
In particular, the president was asked questions about a garbage dump in Balashikh (already closed) and about coal dust in the port city of Nakhodka (a bill has already been drafted to ban open transshipment of coal in settlements, one of the authors - Olga Timofeeva).
Experts in the field of ecology believe that the legal basis for solving environmental problems in Russia as a whole has been created, the question consists in further law enforcement practice, as well as in the position of civil society.
We need a clear implementation of the decisions made by the state, "said Leonid Bochin, the head of the" Ecology for All "charity fund.
The member of the HRC, the head of the non-governmental organization "Greenpeace of Russia," Serhiy Tsyplenkov, in his conversation with "mosques," stressed that a responsible approach of society and business is necessary for the successful solution of environmental problems, and there are few legislative efforts.
As soon as the society and business realize that the solution of environmental problems is a much more profitable step in the strategic perspective, the situation will change, - said Serhiy Tsyplenkov.
The expert stressed that it is necessary to reverse the trend that violation of environmental legislation is a cost-effective solution for business.
British inventor infuriated himself with a microchip to get into a house and a car by the sigh of his hand
The British inventor became the first person in the country to be fitted with a microchip so he could open the door of his home, walk into an office and even plant a car with a simple shake of his hand.
Thirty-three-year-old Stephen Northam has devoured a tiny chip between big and index fingers and now, through his firm, Biotech, is offering this service to firms and individuals who want to simplify their lives through technology.
He teamed up with Dr Jeff Watson, an anesthesiologist consultant from the Royal in Winchester, taking care to ensure that the injection procedure is carried out in accordance with medical standards.
The technology is similar to a microchip that ignites cats and dogs, and the procedure takes just 30 seconds.
Northam's company is also replacing locks in homes and machines with chip-compatible ones at a cost of 300 pounds per lock.
The married father of one child has already installed the technology in his home and in his BMW Z4 car, which starts when his hand lies on the chair.
Props for White House cost taxpayers thousands of dollars
According to armed forces records provided to TIME magazine, the White House's decision last month to drive a Marine Corps helicopter to the South Lawn for an event dedicated to American industrial production cost taxpayers as much as $24,000.
The white-green Sikorsky VH-3D, known as "Marine One" when the president is on board, was the centrepiece of a July 17 event at the White House that showcased American construction programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and top White House officials have examined technology products from all fifty states.
The helicopter, made in Connecticut, was put up next to a yacht from Maine, a fire truck from Wisconsin and a truck from Mississippi.
According to records from the Marine Corps First Squadron (HMX-1), the department responsible for the management of the helicopter, the White House Military Office ordered the presence of the helicopter in a private order, or "Lego," just 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn on the occasion of the "unusual" event.
"I just wanted you to make sure you are aware because this is an unusual widely publicized event in the press," the HMX-1 commander wrote in an email to his chief, the Marine Corps' first deputy aviation chief, on the eve of the event.
The letter indicated that the helicopter would arrive on the South Lawn at about 7 a.m. on July 17 to attend the 3 a.m. event and remain there before the lawn is released between 6 and 9 p.m. on the same day.
The letter adds that if the departure from the White House is delayed, a second crew will be required for the return flight, in line with work-hours restrictions.
The first crew accompanied the helicopter during the event, and the unit's security officers remained close to the aircraft while it was on the ground.
It was not clear from the records obtained by TIME magazine whether a second crew was required as a result.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using public property for political purposes.
According to the records, HMX-1 clarified whether the event contradicted that ruling.
"Among other things, we asked if this was a violation of Hatch's law, and we were answered that no," the commander wrote.
"It looks like you have nowhere to go," the deputy chief replied.
The Made in America event was announced by the White House as an official event, and Hatch's law did not apply to it.
But even official events have political notes.
During the event, the president made an effort to advance the health care reform that was at the time in development in the Senate, and touted attempts to regulate government regulations.
The use of aircraft known as Marine One and Air Force One for political purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.
Presidents are required to use them for travel.
But to request them only in the interests of photo opportunity is unusual.
Trump was already the subject of discussions in February when the presidential plane drove in the background during his first campaign rally in Melbourne, Florida, and his Twitter account was littered with reports of complaints about the use of the presidential plane by his predecessor.
"The White House is delighted with the" Made in America "show, which featured products from 50 states made by American workers from American materials," said deputy White House press secretary Lindsey Walters.
HMX-1 crews often perform training flights around the Washington agglomeration and on the South Lawn to train the United States president's transportation to the White House with an inch accuracy.
When Trump was at the G-20 summit in Germany in early July, HMX-1 conducted 58 training landings at the White House.
According to one of the officials, the flight performed for the "Made in America" event was counted by the crew at the expense of the necessary training flights for the month.
The unit's helicopters also raided 11 extra hours that day as part of "non-presidential support tasks."
According to the White House, there was no cost to taxpayers for any of the other exhibits presented at the event.
A representative of Sikorsky said that the company did not take part in organizing a helicopter demonstration on the South Lawn.
HMX-1 does not take into account the budget for presidential flights, and it is difficult to determine the exact amount spent on the event.
But, according to Defense Department hourly rates for the 2017 fiscal year, the Department of Defense's reimbursement rate for VH-3D is $24,380 per flight hour.
The unit's records recorded that the aircraft's time in the air was 30 minutes each way from its base airfield at the Quantico Marine Corps Air Base in Virginia.
The White House argues that the real cost of using a helicopter is far below that rate.
"To calculate the cost to taxpayers based on the approximate reimbursement rate is completely mistaken," Walters says.
'these approximate rates include personnel, maintenance and many other irreversible costs that are included in annual assignations. '
According to a 2015 study by the REND Corporation, reimbursement rates do not include the cost of personnel, but do take into account the cost of fuel, maintenance and costs specified in the contract.
At the time, former White House press secretary Sean Spicer spoke out in defense of using a helicopter for the event.
"The idea is to demonstrate this week things made in America," Spicer said.
"And I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud of the fact that they contribute to national security, and that there are, I assume, hundreds, if not thousands, of people whose workplace depends on it.
And I think, like most Americans, that we are all proud of this helicopter and other military equipment that so many Americans have worked tirelessly to create.
So, of course, it's perfectly appropriate to pay attention to that. '
It was unclear whether Trump interacted with the helicopter, examining the South Lawn during the event, but he was exactly sitting in the driver's seat in the fire vehicle.
Inside the White House, Trump addressed representatives of Sikorsky, joking with the press on the subject of his own fleet of company products.
"I know Sikorsky perfectly," the president said. "I have three of them."
Moscow to allocate grants for resuscitation departments of city hospitals
Every year, "Save the Life" grants will be allocated to resuscitation and intensive care departments of the capital's medical clinics.
The funds will be directed to encourage doctors and nurses.
The Mayor of Moscow, Sergei Sobyanin, visited the Yudin City Clinical Hospital.
During an examination of the clinic, he presented a letter of thanks to an orthopaedic trauma doctor, Victor Propper, under the direction of which a complex operation was carried out to reconstruct the teen's foot.
Sergey Sobyanin also spoke about the decision to allocate annual grants to resuscitation and intensive care departments of city clinics.
Funds will be sent to encourage doctors and nurses.
According to the capital's mayor, the Yudin Clinical Hospital is one of the biggest in Moscow today.
In recent years, the clinic has received new state-of-the-art equipment allowing its doctors to carry out unique operations.
The clinic was opened in 1961 on the basis of the Colchester Rural Hospital.
At present, the departments of the medical facility are designed to receive more than a thousand patients.
In addition to resuscitation and inpatient care, there are day wards.
The hospital employs 2,800 people.
The total area of the medical clinic is 23.7 hectares.
In February of the current year, the medical institution became a participant of the pilot project on the organization of short-stay hospitals.
They are designed for relatively small operations.
In the process of surgical interventions, advanced medical equipment is used, which allows to significantly reduce the period of rehabilitation of patients.
After surgery in the hospital, they spend only a few hours.
In the first half of this year alone, 36 thousand patients were provided with inpatient care at the Yudina Clinical Hospital.
The clinic's medical staff performed 15,800 operations of varying degrees of complexity.
NBU informed about absence of buyers of Ukrainian "daughter" of Sberbank
The National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) reported that there were no applications for the purchase of the Ukrainian "daughter" of the Bundesbank.
This was reported by TASS on Friday, August 4, citing a representative of the NBU press service.
The NBU confirms that on August 3, 2017, a package of documents from the citizen of Belarus and Cyprus Victor Prokopeni to agree an indirect (via Paritetbank) acquisition of 100 percent of Sberbank's shares has been withdrawn.
"There were no documents from other potential investors to buy Sberbank's shares in the NBU," the report said.
On August 3, the Belarusian businessman Viktor Prokopenya withdrew an application for the purchase of a subsidiary of the Bundesbank.
On July 28 it became known that the National Bank of Ukraine refused Russian businessmen Said Gutseriev and Grigory Guselnikov to acquire the Ukrainian "daughter" of Sberbank.
The regulator justified its decision by the fact that the businessmen did not provide the necessary documents to verify their compliance with the requirements of the legislation of Ukraine.
Sberbank announced the sale of its Ukrainian "daughter" to a consortium of Norvik Limited and a private Belarusian company in March this year.
The majority shareholder of the consortium was Saeed Gutseriev, the son of Russian businessman Mikhail Gutseriev.
Sanctions against the "daughters" of five Russian banks in Ukraine, among them Sberbank, were imposed in mid-March.
Within a year, they are prohibited from withdrawing capital from the country in favor of parent organizations.
Narco's third season trailer: The Cali cartel plays a central role in the popular Netflix studio series following the death of Pablo Escobar
Although the identity of Pablo Escobar's killer was revealed in the second season of "narco," the Netflix studio series is far from over.
The streaming service has already confirmed that the third and fourth seasons are planned, and the third has already been presented with the first trailer showcasing the villains of the upcoming show.

The third season of "narco" will be released on the first of September.
Democracy in Afghanistan depends on the role of women in politics, the UN said.
Elections can only be representative when all members of society, including women, participate, the head of the U.N. mission in Afghanistan said Wednesday.
According to Nicholas Haysom, the current head of the U.N. Assistance Mission in Afghanistan, hundreds of women are running for provincial council elections, three women are fighting for vice president, and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women.
"The role of women cannot be overstated," he said in a statement Wednesday.
Choices can be fully representative only when women participate fully and are included in all stages of the electoral process.
Provincial council elections and presidential elections will be held in Afghanistan on April 5.
The Taliban are threatening to disrupt the election process, which coincides with the transition of international forces from combat operations to the role of advisers.
In this year's election, power for the first time moves peacefully from one democratically elected government to another.
Haysom said increasing the role of women would contribute to the success of democracy in Afghanistan.
According to Afghanistan's Independent Electoral Commission, out of a total of 3.6 million registered voters, 1.2 million are women.
Prosecutor General's Office approves indictment in Nikita White case
The Russian Prosecutor General's Office has approved an indictment in a criminal case against the former governor of the Kirov region, Nikita Belykh, accused of receiving a large bribe.
This was reported by the ministry on Thursday, August 3, RIA Novosti reported.
The materials were transferred to the Presnensky District Court of Moscow for consideration on the merits.
Venice tightened fines for tourists for inappropriate behaviour
Venetian authorities have tightened fines for swimming in channels from 50 euros to 500 euros.
For walking around the city in a swimsuit or with a naked cake will now be fined 200 euros.
100 euros will be required from those who arrange a picnic in a public place or ride a bike through pedestrian areas, TASS reports referring to the Association of Tour Operators of Russia.
In addition, it is mentioned that the authorities provide for a fine for graffiti on monuments of 400 euros and for debris of 25 euros.
To inform tourists about the need to observe the rules of conduct in Venice will be with the help of a special company "EnjoyRespectVenezia" (# EnjoyRespectVenezia) on social media, as well as through ads and posters on the website of the city council, on billboards and in places of the greatest accumulation of tourists.
The campaign will be conducted in 10 languages.
According to Venice tourism adviser Paola Mar, information about the fines will be passed to the embassies of the home countries of the offenders, so as to warn their compatriots against such mistakes.
"The problem is that Venice is perceived as a beach," she noted.
In April, the Italian city administration announced plans to limit the turnaround.
Venice already has a successful restriction on the number of tourists visiting the city centre.
Instead of 100,000 people wanting to watch the Festa del Redentore festival, only 60,000 guests were admitted to the venue.
There is also a moratorium on the creation of new fast-food hotels and restaurants in the historic part of Venice.

The Pentagon released Ozerov from the position of the head of the committee
The Federation Council on Wednesday backed a statement by the chairman of the defense and security committee, Viktor Ozerov, and relieved him of the post.
He remains a Senator from the Khabarovsk Territory.
A statement asking him to be released from his position, Ozerov wrote last week.
He attributed his decision to the need for rotation and his desire to "change the rhythm of life."
The Senator also noted that the decision to leave was not momentous.
Since 1996 Viktor Ozerov has represented the Legislative Assembly of the Khabarovsk Region in the Russian Federation.
The Senator has been in charge of the Defense and Security Committee since 2001.
Electricity is cheap for both residents and producers of Buryatia
The decades-long efforts of the Soviet and post-Soviet authorities of the Republic of Buryatia (Eastern Siberia) to establish fair tariffs for electricity consumers are beginning to bear fruit.
Since September 1, the cost of low voltage electricity for industrial recipients has been reduced by 25%.
The Federal Antimonopoly Service of the country in accordance with the Resolution of the Government of the Russian Federation "On amendments to the Rules of the wholesale market of electric energy and power and in the consolidated forecast balance of production and supply of electric energy (power) within the framework of the Unified Energy System of Russia on the subjects of the Russian Federation" (dated 17.07.2017, № 42) set indicative prices for electricity and power for industrial consumers of the Republic of Buryatia.
As a result, the cost of electric energy for Buryat producers is reduced by a quarter, which will make life much easier for small and medium-sized enterprises and individual entrepreneurs.
For many decades the leaders of the republic have offended the thresholds of the Moscow offices in vain attempts to equalize the region in tariffs with the neighboring Irkutsk region with a cascade of hydro-power plants on the Angara, stemming from Baikal, the main catchment area for which is Buryatia.
And it was only this year that the advances began.
In March, electricity tariffs for the population of the republic were reduced from 4.24 rubles / kWh to 3.93 rubles / kWh, or 7.3%.
With the inclusion of Buryatia by the decision of the federal government in the list of territories of the price zones of the wholesale market, for which the peculiarities of the functioning of wholesale and retail markets have been established, industrial consumers have become involved.
According to analysts, this is only the beginning, as the population of Irkutsk region pays 1.01 rubles per kilowatt / hour.
But no one is bothered to call at least the approximate date of new tariff moves downward for Buryatia.
Scooter was not frightened by Ukraine's Prosecutor General's Office and flew to Crimea
A legend of electronic dance music, the band Scooter flew to Crimea without fear of threats from the Ukrainian Prosecutor General's Office.
"The flight went well, and tomorrow I will have a concert," RIA Novosti quoted the group's frontman Eich Pi Baxter as saying.
Earlier, the German edition of Bild, referring to Ukraine's Deputy Prosecutor General Eugene Enina, reported that musicians could face up to eight years in prison for coming to Crimea, which in Kiev is considered to be temporarily occupied territory of Ukraine.
Scooter's performance at the Balaclava festival, called # ZBFest, is scheduled for August 4.
# ZBFest is held by Golden Balka Company in honor of International Champagne Day.
Scooter, one of Germany's most famous groups, was founded in 1993.
Ace's last album was released in 2016.
Besides Scooter, guests of the festival will be Sergey Galanin and his band "SerGa," as well as Marek Sukachev with "Legend C."
The Moscow metro will host the premiere of the new season of "Games of the throne"

National union of unskilled, municipal and boiler workers (GMB) is concerned about investment at McVitie's factory in Glasgow
The union is demanding assurances from the managers of biscuit manufacturer McVitie's over its long-term commitment to production at the Glasgow plant.
The Scottish branch of GMB reports that the company has gone silent on the issue of future investment at the Tolcrose facility.
The factory, which produces, among other products, Hobnobs and Rich Tea cookies, employs more than 500 people.
Pladis, the owner of McVitie's, says it has invested more than 5 million pounds in the facility over the past few years.
The company adds that in the event of any changes to the facility, employees and union representatives will "learn about them first."
In a letter to the head of the company-owned facility, the Scottish branch of GMB demanded McVitie's reaction to concerns that funding would not be released to upgrade production lines.
Senior organiser Drew Duffy said: "Members of our union are deeply concerned that we cannot achieve clarity from the facility's general manager on business needs and the investment plan regarding Tolcrossa's future."
Families have worked here for generations, and the concentration of workers is great in local society and in Greater Glasgow; it is a crucial pillar of decent work in a territory of high unemployment and social innovation.
So, in terms of jobs, wages and prosperity, and against the backdrop of Brexit, rising living wage and chronic production decline, Glasgow's East End desperately needs a flourish of production at McVitie's factory.
According to a spokeswoman for Pladis, "The head of the tolkroom facility only yesterday received a letter from the Scottish branch of GMB and the company will respond immediately as we appreciate our ongoing cooperation with staff and union representatives."
Two months ago, we held a regular meeting with GMB staff and representatives in Tolcrosse, where a number of issues were openly discussed.
We have talked to staff that as all companies operating in the most competitive and unstable economic climate, we are constantly reviewing our actions - and this applies to all our facilities and activities - to remain competitive.
'in recent years, we've invested more than 5 million pounds in our tolcrose facility, especially in production lines and improving functional performance. '
We are fully aware of the value of Tolkross as a production facility, and in the event of any changes in the work at this facility, employees and union representatives will learn about it first. "
Putin says authorities will not give instructions to Rosneft and Gazprom
Vladimir Putin said that the issue of gas supplies to the Eastern Petrochemical Company should be joined by the Kremlin and the Cabinet of Ministers, but that no one would give instructions to Gazprom, like Rosneft.
So Russian President Vladimir Putin responded to Igor Sechin's request to help resolve the controversy.
The head of state pointed out that the relations between Rosneft and Gazprom should be resolved solely on the basis of market principles.
Earlier, the head of Rosneft, Igor Sechin, at a meeting on the implementation of major investment projects in the Far Eastern Federal District, said that the lack of an agreement with Gazprom on gas for the VNDC would jeopardize the project's implementation period.
Sechin noted that the dialogue with Gazprom on this issue is ongoing.
Gazprom is proposing to find gas resources from the Rosneft perimeter, but we don't have such resources, "Sechin added.
It should be reminded that Rosneft requested that it be allowed to use gas from the Kirinskiy field of Gazprom, located on the Sakhalin shelf, for the "Eastern Petrochemical Company."
In June, Gazprom said talks on the issue were ongoing and there were "no sharp corners there."
Did PSW warn Barcelona of Neymar's transition three years ago?
La League participant may regret his interest in Marco Verratti
Betting Saint-Germain will not stop pursuing Neymar after the club offered 189 million pounds for his ransom, but did they warn Barcelona of a world-record raid held three years ago?
The sensational offer revived the summer transfer window when the League 1 club were poised to beat the world record for the cost of the transition, more than double the previous mark associated with Paul Gibbs's return to Manchester United last season for 89 million pounds.
When the transition is completed, Neymar will become the most expensive player in the world, as well as the highest paid professional athlete in the world, as PSW offers him a salary of more than 500,000 pounds a week clean.
Barcelona are known to be furious at how the offer was made and how Neymar ruined the contract despite the fact that, as a source close to the Catalan club's management insists, the club has always done everything possible for the player since his move from Santos in 2013.
But wasn't the football world warned of such a possibility three years ago by the president of PSW?
When Manchester City expressed an interest in hiring Roberts for Matyugo in 2014, Amir Al-Kheongfi issued a stern warning to every club that would like to rein in one of PSW's best players.
"I'm not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players, then we will speak out against them, we will make offers to their players," Al-Hebbfi said.
'We respect all clubs.
But if they try to recruit one of our players, they're waiting for the consequences. '
Barcelona appear to have crossed that line when the Spanish club earlier this summer expressed interest in PSW midfielder Marco Verratti.
PSW has made it clear that it will not let the Italian player of the national team on any terms and now it is likely Barcelona are feeling the consequences of their offer in the form of the loss of one of their prized players, Neymar.
