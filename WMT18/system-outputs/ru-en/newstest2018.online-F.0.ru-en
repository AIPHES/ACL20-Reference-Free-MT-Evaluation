The President of Russia Vladimir Putin signed law about the introduction to the administrative responsibilities for the violation of period and order of the payment of goods (works, services) with the realization of purchases for the state and municipal needs.
This law is called to solve the very acute problem of the nonfulfillment of its obligations by customers with the realization of state and municipal purchases.
Already two years ago the situation, when owners could not obtain payment for the already completed state and municipal contracts, was general.
At the same time the President of Russia gave commission to the General Procurator's office RF to take problem for the special control.
Because businessmen themselves could not manage the unconscientious customers, who concluded the not reinforced by financing contracts, in every way possible attempted to deviate from the undertaken obligations on the payment and were included in agreements illegal conditions.
Problem was system as a whole in the country.
Since 2015 in the interests of the protection of the rights of owners to obtaining of payment for public orders the prosecutor's office introduced 9,700 ideas, according to the results of their examination to the disciplinary responsibility are drawn 4,500 officials, to the administrative - 533, into the investigation organs for organizing the processual checkings are represented 75 materials, the criminal cases are excited on 46 of them.
Was as a result extinguished debts before the owners for sum more than 66 billion rubles.
Moreover these enormous sums were accumulated by no means not as a result of neoplaty of multibillion contracts.
Numerous, systematic delays on the payment of services to owners for far the more modest sums led to the legendary debts.
Here is the characteristic case.
The leader of small company won competition to the rendering of services on the social transportation by several million rubles.
Man put all his circulating capital, completely fulfilled obligations, but the assumed money in time not obtained.
Result - increasing financial kilohms from the debts on the wages, taxes, credits, which would lead to bankruptcy, if owner did not turn for help into the prosecutor's office.
Now in a number of regions it was possible to maximally level problem.
Nevertheless as of the first half-year of 2017 the joint volume of debt on the state and municipal contracts, revealed by the attorneys of the subjects of the Russian Federation, was about 27.4 billion rubles.
In the regions, where the indices of debts continue to reach critical values, the prosecutor's office works in the mode of manual anticrisis control.
Attorney General personally carries out visiting conferences with the representatives of the local authority, on which objectively are investigated all revealed by attorneys disturbances and measures for their immediate elimination.
Such operational conferences in this year already took place in Yaroslavl' and Ekaterinburg.
To qualitatively improve pay discipline of public customers will be able the realization of the federal law of № 189-FZ “about the introduction of changes in the code of the Russian Federation about the administrative offenses in the part of the establishment of the administrative responsibilities of the officials of customer for the violation of period and order of the payment of goods (works, services) with the realization of purchases for guaranteeing the state and municipal needs”, which the President of Russia last week signed.
The project of law was developed the Ministry of Economic Development of Russia on the initiative of the Attorney General's Office.
New law will supplement the code of the Russian Federation about the administrative offenses with the article, which provides for penalty from 30,000 to 50,000 rubles for the disturbance by the official of the customer of period and order of the payment of goods, works and services with the state and municipal purchases.
But if official already underwent administrative punishment for the similar offense, then disqualification for the period from one year to two years waits it.
All attorneys of the subjects of the Russian Federation already obtained commission to ensure the application of these legislative short stories in practice.
The advocacy group of civil rights declared warning on the movement in Missouri
The national association of the assistance to progress of colored population published warning for the colored people, which travel in Missouri, because of the discrimination policy of state and attacks on the racist soil.
The statement of group sounds as follows: “Warning for the ways of the national association of assistance to the progress of colored population, real until August 28, 2017, calls African-American those travelling, guests and citizens of the state of Missouri to be especially attentive and to manifest the increased caution with the journeys on the state in connection with a number of the doubtful incidents on the racist soil, which recently occurred throughout the entire territory of state and given here”.
According to the national association of assistance to the progress of colored population, to declare warning on the movement group it prompted the recently taken in Missouri law, therefore the people began to more difficultly win the actions, connected with discrimination, and also that the fact that the law-enforcement agencies of state are disproportionately frequently selected by their objects of the representatives of minorities.
“In you people undergo the disturbance of human rights.
Them they stop on the roads because of the color of the skin, them they beat up and kill”, described to newspaper “Kansas City it was old” the kind of Chepel, the President of the national association of assistance to the progress of the colored population of Missouri.
“We hear complaints frequently, as it is earlier never”.
This is – the first warning of this type, declared by organization with respect to U.S. States.
Group referred to such incidents as humiliation of black students according to the racial sign at the university of Missouri and death of the dvadtsativosmiletnego Tory of Sanders, black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died with the suspicious circumstances earlier in this year after in it ended gasoline during the trip on the state, and the police of the state of Missouri arrested it, without having produced charge in the crime.
In the warning also is mentioned the recent report of the General Procurator's office of the state of Missouri, according to which the probability to be stationary on the road for the black drivers 75 percent is higher than for the white.
“The purpose of warning that the people would be up to date in the situation and they warned their relatives and friends and colleagues about that which can happen in Missouri”, said Chepel.
“People must be one way or another prepared, they will take with themselves money for the guarantee or they will report to relatives that they travel on the territory of state”.
According to last data of program the FBI according to the communication about the crimes owing to the hatred, in Missouri in 2015 were registered 100 crimes owing to the hatred, which makes state the sixteenth in the state for the number of similar disturbances.
Also warning on the movement is answer to the new state law of Missouri, after adoption of which it will more complexly institute proceeding against the juridicial person in connection with housing or working discrimination.
The previously American union of the protection of civil liberties (ACLU) declared warnings for those travelling on Texas and Arizona after these states they accepted the new laws of the immigration control, according to which to local law-enforcement agencies it was prescribed to arrest people for the disturbance of immigration laws, which, in the opinion of ACLU, it had to increase the number of checkings in the racial sign.
Warnings on the movement are usually let out by the State Department in connection with other countries, but recently the public organizations of pribegli to this measure in response to the specific laws and tendency within the limits of the USA.

The head of Rosturizma Oleg Safonov stated in the interview for the television channel of RBC [RosBusinessConsulting] that “positively” it relates to the adoption of law about the cancellation of the free transport of luggage with the irrevocable airline tickets.
“It is necessary to create conditions, with which man, whom has there is no luggage, it can purchase ticket more cheaply, than that, whose luggage exists”, he emphasized (quotation on TASS).
In this case Mr. Safonov noted that, in spite of the fears of citizens, to pay for the transport of outer clothing and cell phone in hand luggage it is not necessary.
“It would be correct to calm down all our citizens and tourists and to state about this, to say that this to the outer clothing, to the umbrella, to the cell phone, to aypedu or even some computer of relation have will not be”, he said the head of Rosturizma.
The previously President of Russia Vladimir Putin signed the law, which foresees the right of airlines to exclude standard about the free transport of luggage with the irrevocable airline ticket.
The discussion deals about the fact that the airlines can themselves determine number of packages and weight of luggage, included in irrevocable tariff.
Vladimir Putin charged to liquidate the pollution of Baykal
The President of Russia Vladimir Putin at the conference on questions of the protection of Baykal reported that in recent years the significant territories of lake underwent extreme pollution.
It charged to determine sources of funds, plans and executors for the liquidation of pollution.
Mr. Putin also charged to conduct valuable recultivation of the contaminated territories.
“It is necessary to be dismantled, also, with the objects, which continue here to work, the cleaning construction of majority of them is worn”, cites “Russian International News Agency” of the President.
It also added that the General Procurator's office of Russia must conduct checking on the development of ecologically harmful activity.
According to him, in the region of lake there are problems, connected with the advent of spontaneous dumps and with a number of disturbances in the sphere of ecology from the side of the organizers of leisure.
“I want this to emphasize: not all contract to check, here also measure must be known, but precisely - illegal and ecologically harmful activity and taken the corresponding measures”, he, emphasized.
The previously Attorney General's Office reported the reduction of the reserves of fish in the lake Baykal and proposed to increase the number of objects, which fall under the ecological supervision.
Let us recall, on June 15 Vladimir Putin in the course of straight line stated about the need of changing the legislation for guaranteeing the rights of citizens, which live in the natural territories of the special regime of protection.
On the problems with conducting of economic activity to it reported the inhabitants of Olkhiy island, which enters into Baikal natural territory.
The head of Minprirody Sergey Donskoy immediately proposed to solve problem by refining the boundaries of the water-guarding zone of Baykal, but in the government of Buryatia they remembered that this change it is insufficient, since constraints were associated with a whole series of normative reports.
Earlier in Minekonomiki they proposed to solve problem by changing in the land code and law about the protection of environment.
In Yugre will appear the new temple
In Sosva settlement the members of community from the representatives of the radical small peoples of the north “of Rakhtynya”, together with the inhabitants of Berezovsky of region participate in the building of orthodox temple in the honor of the Saint of Nikolai Miracle worker.
Its locations - river shore, temple will be well visible from a distance; therefore it will serve for the fishermen as travelling lighthouse.
According to the representatives of community, work on the building they will be completed already in this year, are now established cupolas, there are in the presence church bells.
Igrimskaya REB of fleet showed transport tracking.
Temple is named in holy Nikolai Chudotvortsa's honor, since it will be read a little by orthodox church as the patron of the travellers, including of fishermen.
However, in Sosve fish trade gives to settlers work, feeds them.
Local residents wait, when temple opens its doors, and children even write in the school compositions about it as about the local sights.
Disneyland with capital punishment.
Why in Singapore are observed laws?
I talk with the local businessman by Chang, sitting in the snack in open air.
Commenting on situation in Singapore, Chang smokes to one cigarettes for another, whereas he accurately stores cigarette-butts into iron box the caught with himself from the office.
After the end of conversation the businessman is bound toward the nearest urn - to it meters one hundred - and ejects there bull calves.
Penalty for the garbage in the public place - 500 local dollars, reports Chang.
You know, in me from the childhood simply the reflex was manufactured: it is not possible to throw fantik from the candy to the bridge, immediately they will fine.
But now generally everywhere video camera.
And actually - the pavements of Singapore in the city center are clean, as if in the museum.
Chang says: three months ago the 18-year son of his neighbor scribbled all over graffiti the wall of old colonial building.
Court recognized fellow as the guilty of vandalism and sentenced to the flogging.
What?!
Visualize.
It obtained ten impacts by wooden stick on the buttocks and conducted week in the prison.
We have generally solid punishments not rarity.
As in Singapore are combined the highest standard of living and incredibly severe laws, it was investigated at the place of the reviewer “of Argumenty i Fakty Magazine”.
Here no one thinks to abolish capital punishment, explains attorney Victor Li Khong.
And to government to long ago spit to the opinion of both the European Union and USA in regard to this.
If man transports the large party of narcotics or deals in them - gallows is assumed to it.
In 2002. in the airport of Changi they detained the 22-year-old citizen of Australia: it conveyed with itself 400 g of cocaine.
In its protection they came out Australian Premier, threatening with sanctions, international human rights activists and even Pope.
However, they as a result nevertheless hung fellow.
After this, the drug smugglers our country diligently go round by side.
Matter in the following: in Singapore it is assumed, that the laws are obligated to observe ENTIRE contract, but not only modest and well-off people.
It is unimportant, who you - millionaire, Vice-Premier, well-known artist or the inhabitant of the European Union.
Version in this case one: if in you they find half a kilo of cocaine, you will be hung.
When you walk on Singapore and you everywhere meet tables with the heap of warnings, to wonder you are simply given - how much in this city-state prohibitions!
For example, chewing gum is sold only in the drugstores, and to purchase it is possible strictly on the prescription (!) of doctor.
In tourist on the arrival chewing they will not take away, but it is worthwhile to stick “elastic” in the metro, they will put penalty in 1 thousand local dollars
In four days I met two people with the white tables on the neck: “I littered”.
For the deserted past the urn cigarette-butt besides the penalty frequently they sentence to “the reference in yard-keepers”: week to remove parks and beaches.
6,000 rub pays “criminal”, who forgot to wash off after himself water in the public toilet, and with the attempt to celebrate small need in the elevator of apartment house special detector operates - doors are blocked and leaves signal for the police.
In the number of entirely exotic laws - prohibitions to the feeding show blue on the street, the public performance of songs and even the excessive irrigation of room plant (!): it is considered that the abundance of water draws gnats.
In avoiding of fires to smokers it is not possible to carry cigarette lighter in the metro, otherwise they will fine to 5,000 Singapore Baxes.
On the whole, appears the thought: however try, necessarily you will destroy something.
This completely not so, attempts to dissuade me Mohammed Kabir-Kadzhariya, the owner of local turagentstva.
Especially fantastic laws exist only on paper, and I did not see in the last twenty years so that for their disturbance of someone they would draw.
Why they do remain?
So that the citizens would not weaken.
The observance of fundamental rules they follow strictly.
Let us say, if cigarettes sell to minor in the kiosk, then all on the chain will be punished: the owner of store will pay enormous sum, disturber himself will obtain the impacts by sticks on “the tail end”, and they will also flog and will plant salesman into the prison.
Specifically, because of the such severe laws of offense in Singapore it is very rare.
Is justified this?
As early as the Seventies chaos on the roads was created - motorists ignored light signals, they drove as they wanted, they sat down by drunk for the control.
Everything was quieted after the introduction of penalties in the year.
Now driver, after drinking the portion of whisky, he knows: if they stop, policeman will not let go for the bribe, they will put penalty in the size of the cost of apartment and for years will send for the lattice.
Many foreigners city-state in southeastern Asia seems by the variety of concentration camp.
In 1993. American writer William Gibson named Singapore “Disneyland with capital punishment” - guest from the USA led into the horror universal wealth of inhabitants, “pugayushche clean airport” and “cultivated nature”.
Allegedly, similar things are unnatural, they appear artificially, and so in principle there must not be.
The first days in Singapore and correctly you frighten to throw paper to the pavement, you recollect, if it visited in the metro with the ice cream.
But then you arrive into “small India” region, and suddenly - “the break of template”: in bus stop plastic cups are dragged along.
“A as this?” - you are surprised.
But thus, smile singapurtsy.
Everyone occurs.
Not for each similar “crime” they will grip on the spot; however, you must know: if they calculate you, not you otmazheshsya - indeed you broke rule.
Most frequently this it is sufficient so that the man would behave normally.
Of course authority in Singapore completely to itself authoritarian.
But you do know that?
I was moved very carefully in Vietnamese Khoshimine - motorcyclists frequently snatch out from the hands of tourists smartphones and cameras.
In the center of Paris of fully dirty homeless and beggars.
On our streets also not all try to throw garbage into the urns.
However, Singapore because of the collection of Draconian penalties and ruthless (up to capital punishment) laws became the calmest, cleanest and safe city on the Earth.
You will hesitate in thought.
Human nature is such: you will recall, and in Russia no one fastened after the control, until they begin to fine.
Although the main thing in Singapore not penalties, but the voluntary observance of laws.
And it is necessary to think, in our Russia the people would be also glad to clean streets, to the absence of garbage in the metro and would greet the arrest of those, who confuse elevator with the public toilet.
Here solid punishments - thanks, it is not must.
However, in other respects the laws of Singapore as the minimum cost at them to look.
Nothing saint?
The now White House of Tramp was aimed at the statue of freedom.
The most reliable sign of change of regime - this when it begins to fight with the statues.
Americans understand this not worse than everything else - it is hence intended the theatrical removal of the statue of Saadam Hussein over the area of Firdos in Baghdad in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of Tramp's government, undoubtedly knew that he made, when it carried the symbolic axe above the statue of freedom during the bitter dispute with the journalist of CNN Jim Akostoy about the proposals of the President for sharp reduction in the legal migration.
We will be honest, Miller did not attempt to statue itself.
The hordes of the owners of strolling ships and artists, who depict the statue of freedom, would lynch it, if it tried to make this.
But it attempted to its sense, and especially to that sense, which was by it assigned in 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, when Emma Lazarus's verses were added to the pedestal.
As Miller it grumbled to Akostu: “I do not want to here enter deeply into history, but the statue of freedom - this… the symbol of American freedom, which lights peace up.
The poem, about which you speak, was added later and is not the part of the original statue of freedom”.
Miller correctly presented facts, but as he said itself, this in reality not about the history.
This about the current sounding of the striking words Lazarus, only, in which the state invites not any immigrants, but poor: “Your tired, your poor,/your crowds, which dream to sigh freely,/the unhappy repulsions of your abundant shores”.
Never still “unhappy repulsions” were so they were visible on our screens.
Miller did not deal with history of literature - he gave to understand that in America Tramp these people they do not wait.
This dispute about the sense of statue - part of the wider political and cultural war: this is actual dispute about the sense of America.
Lazarus - and its friends, who were struggling for that in order to place its words to the base of statue after its death, very well understood, that they commit completely political act.
Sculpture according to the concept had to designate the connection between the French and American republics with the aid of the commonplace classical figure - the female means of freedom.
Lazarus it changed its sense: in its poem female figure more is not abstract, it has voice.
And it obtained completely different name: Mother of those banished.
The connection of poem and means was the bright feministic motion and crushing attack against American nativizma.
And as Lazarus it changed the sense of the statues, right although to change him conversely.
Loud Rasch limb, his kind Hans Krestitel, who announced Tramp's advent, into 2010 discussed, that the freedom no one invites, faster it - early neo-conservative, who carries the flame of America to lying at the dark peace: “Freedom goes forward.
It bears the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
Torch is necessary not in order to illuminate way in the USA”.
Against the habit of limbs here actually it fell into the point.
The sense of statue depends exclusively on the visual angle.
Great creative reaching Lazarus it was see it in the manner that it would see the emaciated, unhappy, but complete hopes people on the decks of ships after long and frequently heavy floating.
This means in the literal sense to look at peace by the eyes of people, which search for the refuges also of chance to the best life.
Its statue we answer them by the words of hope and hospitality, which they dream to hear.
And, of course, this is not that prospect, which Miller and Tramp will sometimes want to recognize.
Their torch is necessary not in order to illuminate way, and in order to kindle the hatred, which there is a sole source of their strength.
World championship of 2017: The Nile Blake highly evaluates the Scottish members team Great Britain.
Eylid Doyle recalls the time, when in team Great Britain it was only two Scotsmen
The Nile Blake, director on the game of the federation of the track and field sports of Great Britain stated that the consisting of 16 people Scottish part of the composite on the world championship will make “the noticeable contribution to the game of command”.
A record quantity of Scottish athletes was selected to the incipient on Friday London championship of 2017.
Blake assumes that in Scotland “is born something special” and the federations of the track and field sports of Great Britain it must this consider.
“We know this and we attempt to understand and we will support, until they have potential”, said Blake.
“I spoke to people in the institute of the sport of Scotland, and they think, that this is connected with the fact that they made.
The Scottish federation of track and field sports thinks, that with the fact that they made, it is necessary to work.
British federation of the track and field sports: with the fact that they made, it is necessary to work.
And people on the street think so.
I do not know, why circumstances thus were formed, but this completely lustrously”.
Some of the Scottish athletes pretend on the medal, including Laura Myur and Andrew Bachert - which will compete with sir of mho by Farakhom on the distance 5000 m; and Eylid Doyle command selected by its captain.
“Eylid pretends modesty.
Its captain's speech was splendid”, says Blake.
“Many athletes, it is regardless of the fact, Scotsmen they or not, and from that, where they live or are trained, they left this room, feeling pride and attitude to the victory.
The passion and sincere feelings, which put in it Eylid, were remarkable”.
The possessor of the silver medal of the championship of collaboration, who on her fifth world championship will break into a run the distance of 400 m with the obstacles, says that 16 Scotsmen in the British team - this “is improbable”.
Previous record in a quantity of Scotsmen on the world championship was equal to seven, in 1983 and 2005.
In front goes Laura Myur, who specializes in the run to the average distances and who beat in the past year five British and two European records.
It will break into a run to 1500 and to 5000 meters.
Chris o ' Kher, which will participate in the round on 1500 m, this one additional Scotsman, to whom it is worthwhile to focus attention: after the back it has the successful season, in which there were the victories on the elimination competitions of British team and on the yearly competitions.
Doyle recalls about his first world championship, when besides it only Scotsman in the command was Makkonnell.
The captain of command says that it “is improbably proud” by the fact that as many its compatriots not only they entered into the composite, but they will in certain cases pretend on the medal and fight for the output into the finale.
“The captain of composite select other crew members; therefore this there was in any event enormous honor, but to know that your comrades voted for you and they selected you, for me this is completely special thing”, it added.
“Certainly, I am very proud for all Scotsmen, who entered into the composite.
This shows, we to what extent attained much.
And they everything - the taking place themselves athletes, who will attempt to fall for the pedestal of honor.
But concerning my captain's speech?
Yes, I think, it was not bad.
I simply focused attention on the fact that to us greatly transported to assume houses world championship.
So that this is simple about how it is important to obtain support from the fans and to use the fact that we will again prove to be on the Olympic stadium.
I obtained one additional chance to leave to his arena and to participate in the competitions, and the atmosphere there will there be simply remarkable”.
Blocking of critics in Facebook: it is not necessary to be advanced to the public post, if you are not ready to listen to criticism from the voters
The founder of our country understood, what is critical press is.
Americans loved George of Washington, but this did not prevent them from criticizing it for everything from the domestic policy to its political principles.
Its criticism, of course, irritated.
But it did not stop up mouth to its critics.
Because still in 1783 Washington it said: “it is possible to take away the freedom of speech and us, deaf and mutes, they will bring as sheep to the slaughter”.
Now I will switch over to the governor of Maryland Larry Hogan, whom it should be try to be more similar on Washington.
Hogan's subordinates blocked and erased the posts the minimum 450 people, which expressed their opinion on his official page in Facebook.
And on this week the American union of the protection of civil liberties gave to it for this to the court.
The subordinates of governor named this action negligible, and commentary in the Internet was written in the spirit “well and that”.
“This only Facebook”, will say many.
But this is also important.
And this is especially important, when the discussion deals with the fellow of Hogan's type.
He is amazingly popular republic governor in the democratic chiefly state.
It in the second place in the rating of approval among 50 governors of the country.
Hogan - the not rested reactionary.
It demonstrated solid hand in control of state and adherence to its principles.
It also deftly uses to Facebook as primary means of communication with its voters and with the jokes demonstrates on its page its bald after chemotherapy head.
Therefore to block people, which come to the page of governor - which is declared as official public forum and is conducted by the colleagues of administration to the money of taxpayers - this is unnecessary and in the final analysis detrimentally.
In the interview “Washington Post” press-secretary amelia of Ches protected the actions of governor, asserting that blocking commentaries - this is simple their moderation.
But this too easily to use means trolley, is spammer and kheyterov, which bear malice in the Internet.
“Post” had a talk with some of the real people, which Hogan blocked.
And these are precisely real people, not trolli, teacher, businessman, minister, which turn to their selected leaders.
They all tell that their commentaries were valid, in meaningful and not rough.
Minister cited Bible, appealing to the fact that Hogan - catholic.
Attorney Lakshmi Sarma of Raman of Boui, state of Maryland, did not express hatred, but it asked about the crimes owing to the hatred.
“I wrote polite commentary about the fact that I am disappointed by the absence of his reaction to the crimes, accomplished owing to the hatred, and to other news of last time”, it wrote in the division of commentaries to the article in “post”.
“Me also does not please idea, that when many people leave commentaries to one and the same theme, some they immediately indicate that this so-called winding, instead of recognizing that they deal concerning the large group of dissatisfied citizens”.
That that the subordinates of governor they call “concentrated spam-attack”, others would, probably name “the active stand in life”.
In the era of Facebook it is easy to podredaktirovat its means, simply blocking critics or erasing negative commentaries.
This much less dusty work, than it is earlier, when for this it was necessary to send people, to gather and to burn newspapers with the critical editorials or to arrest and to stop mouth up by that protesting.
But this is exact that occurs now, only in the number.
Khogen - the not first official, whom they criticize for the fact that he does not want to listen to Facebook and other social networks.
Was produced for President Tramp action from the users of Twitter, who were zabaneny in its Twitter-account.
One of the first, rotary solutions by this theme was accepted by this week in Virginia.
In the opinion of the district judge of the USA from Alexandria James K. Kesheris, the chairman of the observant council of the county of Laudon it destroyed first amendment, zabaniv voter in its account in Facecbook.
But in Kentucky to republic governor Mett to Bevinu produced for claim the American union of the protection of civil liberties for his behavior in Facebook and Twitter.
This must be not so difficultly.
In the times of Washington the era of accessible post expenditures carried out much the same coup as today the Internet.
It grew four times with 1776 until 1800 number of newspapers, and the authors of anonymous letters badly brought down its authority.
And even then Washington dealt concerning anonymous trollyami.
People under the pseudonyms “of Yurikola”, “Valerius”, “Belizarius” and “Portsius” wrote letters into the newspapers, which ridicule the solution of Washington.
According to the data of the historical sources, assembled by online-project “the documents of George of Washington”, his office it was covered with the petitions, which criticize his position by agreement about the friendship, trade and to navigation.
But it did not attempt to force them to become silent.
The freedom of speech, dissent and appearances lies at the very base of our state.
And true leadership indicates agreement with this.

British roads will learn to absorb the harmful ejections
The unique tunnels above the mains, capable of absorbing oxide of carbon the ejected by automobiles, already pass testing on the roads of Great Britain.
The transport agency of the country, as reports the publication of Autocar, reported about the positive results of the tests of the 100-meter tunnel, established on one of the highway on the north of the country.
Tunnel is built with the height of 6 meters from the certain newest polymeric materials, which are capable of absorbing the harmful substances, which are contained in the automobile exhausts.
However, the creation of the entire network of similar tunnels is only the part of the scale measures, which are collected to accept the authorities of Great Britain for an improvement in the atmosphere.
Besides the network of tunnels, the Englishmen intend to enlarge the network of charging stations for the electric cars, to realize a number of measures for the decrease of automobile flow on the roads, to enlarge the use of commercial transport on the electrical thrust and to modernize the park of heavy trucks.
According to the official statistics, fourth of all pollution of the atmosphere are fallen precisely to the transport, and the unsatisfactory quality of air becomes reason to 40 000 premature deaths per year.

Misery and death in the Indonesian “gold earth”
Preparing dinner, Bardeen for Degei it does not use plate.
It uses rarely even pot.
In her wooden house in Enarotali, capital of Paniay region in the rebellious Indonesian province of Papua, the housewife usually simply places the sweet potatoes, which here is called “note”, directly into the center.
Through half-hour the charred tuber they obtain and eat up by the impatient, unwashed hands.
Of Degei it sits on the earthen of semi- furniture in it no – and precisely here it carries out its work on the house, such as the washing of clothing by turbid water from the located near swamp.
As restroom serves bucket in the room without the roof.
It youngest of four wives of its husband, and therefore to it they did not charge to work in the field.
Polygamy is here extended.
Certainly, to work til late can be dangerously: many men from this village drink unemployed, many, and still indeed there are soldiers.
“No one is decided to walk on the village after five in the evening”, she says.
This is the rare opportunity to look to the daily life in the high mountain region of Papua, former Dutch colony, which was connected to Indonesia in 1969 after the doubtful referendum, when only 1026 elders made it necessary to vote, prilyudno raising the hands before the occupying troops.
The existing motion, which speaks in favor of independence from the Netherlands, rapidly turned its anger against the government of Jakarta, which preserves the tight control over the region, without allowing foreign journalists and human rights activists.
In 2003 province was officially divided into Papua and Western Papua, and independent state Papua-new Guinea occupies the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali – city just as removed as neglected; road here includes 1.5-hour overflight from Dzhayapury, administrative center of province, in Nabire, and then – five-hour shaking in the hired machine.
There is no public transport here.
City with the population approximately 19 000 people consist of the wooden houses, enclosed by bamboo fences; roofs from that corrugated became colored by rust into the diverse reddish nuances.
Almost no one here reached from the Indonesians, speaking already about the journalists, and almost no one of the foreigners.
Prior to the arrival of Christian missionaries Papuans mee pago worshipped to god by the name of UGA Tamee.
There were other changes.
“To us it was unusually bear this clothing”, it tells Degei, showing to its bright, woven by hand turban, dark skirt and bright jacket.
“Earlier we bore to the only leaves”.
Papua – the poorest province of Indonesia, 28% of its population lives after the poverty line, and the levels of child mortality and literacy among the worse in Asia.
But still this is the Indonesian gold earth.
Largest in the world and the most profitable gold mine, Grasberg, which belongs to the located in Phoenix company “Freeport McMoran”, are located only in sixty miles from Paniay, alpine province by size approximately with New Jersey, where 000 people live by 153.
Only in 2015 company “Freeport” obtained here gold and coppers approximately to 3.1 billion of dollars.
In addition Papua can brag of the reserves of forest, whose cost is evaluated at 78 billion of dollars.
These riches, however, entail one misfortune for Papuans, guaranteeing, that the powerful armed forces of Indonesia preserve here their strangling presence.
According to the investigation of the newspaper “New York Times” in 2005, between 1998 and 2004 for years companies “Freeport” paid local soldiers and subdivisions of almost 20 million dollars, including to 150 000 dollars to one officer.
The requirements of larger autonomy from the side of Papuans threaten existence of this gold vein and ruthlessly are suppressed.
On the assertion of human rights activists, since 1969 the military forces of Indonesia killed more than 500 000 Papuans, and thousand more were raped, subjected to tortures and they were deprived of freedom.
On the assertion of the Asian Commission on Human Rights, the mass murders in the populated by natives high mountain regions of Papua in the Seventies can be considered genocide.
Only in the past year the police of Indonesia arrested more than 3900 peaceful those protesting in the region.
“We will lose everything”, the report, published in 2016 by Brisbenskoy diocese, contains evidence about the atrocities, perfected in the previous year, such, as executions without the court, torture – it is especially frequent, as is asserted in other report, rape and defeat by electric current – and the brutal suppression of peaceful demonstrations.
“It is difficult to compute body count, because incidents occur each week”, says Andreas Kharsono, who carries out studies in Indonesia for “Human of Rights Watch”.
Nuts were tightened, since the resources of Papua drew the inflow of migrants from other regions of Indonesia.
3,5 - the milionnoe population of province to 83% consists of the Christians, but demographic determinants change in proportion to the arrival of Muslim economic migrants from the densely populated Indonesian islands – Java, Sumatra and Sulavesi.
Javanese shops, “varungi”, sell fried hen and mixture of vegetables “to reptile-reptile”, supplied with the peanut sauce.
Local residents attempt to maintain competition.
“Migrants began on the traditional market to sell hen and vegetables more cheaply than the natives of Papua”, explains It abet to You, the dvadtsatichetyrekhletnyaya native of Paniay, which moved to Dzhayapuru, administrative center of province, because of the work.
“Because of this the natives of Papua – the mom-mom (women) of Papua – lost their market for sale”.
The President of Indonesia Dzhoko Vidodo, known in the people as to Dzhokovi, was vowed to study inequality and disturbances of rights into Papua in the course of his presidential campaign in 2014.
On his way to the presidential palace in Jakarta the former carpenter secured by support to 27 of 29 regions of Papua, including of Paniay.
But almost nothing it changed into Papua, and local residents feel themselves devoted.
“Our hearts are broken, because in 2014 we voted for Dzhokovi, expecting that it will carry out our hopes for the restoration of justice”, it tells You.
In actuality, in all after two months after the October inauguration of Dzhokovi Paniay survived tragedy.
On December 7, 2014 group of 11 children was on the street and it sang Christmas hymns in bonfire in Enarotali, when two Indonesian soldiers on the motorcycle were pulled out from the darkness.
The frightened children told them that them should be included the headlights.
As reported local minister Dzhavedt Tebay, one of the soldiers offended to their tone and after a certain time returned with four soldiers.
According to the victims and eyewitnesses, the soldiers, who were drunk, chased the children and they beat by their butts of rifles.
Then one of the soldiers shot on the group of children.
One child, sixteen-year-old Yulianus Eymo, were so is strongly beaten, that it was hollow into the coma.
The pair of hours after someone it set fire the located near government building of election commission, and next day situation aggravated.
About thousand Papuan of men, women and children were assembled in the football field before the local police station and military command center in order to require justice.
They brought with themselves ritual hunting bows and carried out the isle of wight, the dance of Papuan tribe mee pago: they ran and depicted bird singing as circles.
Some protesting began to fling stones into the police station and military base.
When situation incandesced, to soldiers on the internal radio communication was daN the order: “If crowd resists of more than three times, you will shoot down them”, then it sounded, as it is asserted in the official document, which saw the correspondents of the periodical “TIME”, but which was not published in the local media outlets.
Pyatidesyatishestiletniy Eremias to Kayame, the head of the region of Kego coto bark in Enarotali, felt the approximation of danger and called to calmness, after turning to the crowd with the request to radiate on the houses.
No one wanted to listen to it.
“When I was turned, to me into the left wrist suddenly fell bullet”, it described to the periodical “TIME”, costing on the porch of its vividly painted wooden house.
Kayame, until now, does not know, who shot, but he indicates that the bullet arrived flying from the side of the ranks of the gathering soldiers.
“There was crowd, shots there was much”, it adds.
In the local resident of Alfiusa Youva fell three times, as says its cousin brother, who became the witness of shooting.
“I ran up to it and looked around his body in order to ascertain that this is it”, it darkly described to the periodical “TIME” of Yokhanes, which, as many Indonesians, uses only one name.
“I saw, that he was dead… I kissed him”.
General Yotdzhe Mende, the senior inspector of the police of Papua, said to reporters that its officers only " protected” their base, because it underwent attack.
“We must protect, when people threaten us to kill”, stated in 2015 the representative of the police of Papua commissioner Pudzho Sulistiyo.
“This is a matter of life or death”.
According to the data “Human of Rights Watch”, five young protesting were killed, and much greater it was injured.
The news about the murders reached Jakarta only next day.
In three weeks of Dzhokovi pronounced in Dzhayapure the ardent speech, in which it expressed condolences to the families of victims and was vowed to study a question of the historical abuses of authority into Papua.
“I want so that this situation would be settled immediately so that it never no longer would be repeated in the future”, he said.
In October 2016 minister on the security concerns Viranto said that he will found non-judicial organization in order to put an end to the historical disturbances of human rights.
But excuses almost immediately went.
“The large part of the disturbances has long ago occurred.
Some of them occurred into the ninetieths or at the beginning of zero.
The fact is that we undoubtedly want to study these disturbances, but there are procedures, which must be passed”, he said.
Then Viranto it forewent its words, speaking with the periodical “TIME” on June 5 in Jakarta, and he said that it does not plan to found organization for examining the complaints into Papua.
He said instead of this: “Everything will be solved through the court”.
Viranto, which the United Nations accused of “the crimes against humanity” in connection with the loss more than 1000 people during the bloody affirmative vote the independence of eastern Timora in 1999, he said that 11 cases of the disturbance of human rights into Papua were already settled, including incident into Paniay.
The families of victims from Paniay received similar statements with gloomy distrust.
“In past three years me they questioned four times, but there were no completely any changes”, says Yokhanes.
“I got tired”.
He indicates that years later still it lives in the fear.
“To me it is terrible”, he says.
“I fear, that me arrest the servicemen, I fear, that me they will shoot down”.
Its brother Jacobus also expressed the opinion that the inhabitants of Paniay fear to discuss incident.
He said that it beat up servicemen after it helped to bury four victims.
“After we buried bodies, after me arrived the servicemen”, he, says.
Shooting did not cease.
On Tuesday the Indonesian police shot at the country mans in region of Deiyay the adjacent from the Paniay.
In the course of the collision between the country mans and manager of construction company, who refused to help to transport man, who is located without the consciousness, into the hospital, died one person and 17 more were injured, including children.
Man, dvadtsatichetyrekhletniy Ravianus Douv, which sank during the catching of fish in creek the flowed near, died along the road into the hospital.
The angered inhabitants of village protested before the office of the construction site, which belonged to company.
According to the policemen, the inhabitants of village flung stones into the officers, who as the answer produced the warning shots.
But local residents assert that the mobile brigade (Indonesian Special Force) began to shoot at the crowd and she killed one person.
“We were in such a panic, we fear retribution”, it reported to the periodical “TIME” of dvadtsatidevyatiletniy Dominggu Badii, which lives near the hospital and it saw, as they in a hurry reached injured.
“I hid at home two days”.
The parliament of Deiyay required so that they would bring to account officers the mixed in the incident, and mobile police brigade they recalled from this region.
Paniyay was always sore point for the Indonesian government.
A deficiency in the significant development causes the dissatisfaction of tribes mee, moni, tribute and damal, scattered throughout the entire territory of the covered with verdure central alpine regions of Papua.
Many were joined to “the movement for free Papua” (OPM), insurgent army, which asserts that it protects the rights of Papuans by the fact that the sporadic attacks and attacks with the hostage taking to the Indonesian soldiers are arranged.
Some of the highest leaders of OPM occur from Paniay, including of Tadius yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoyya.
In recent years into Paniay thousands of people were arrested as the reciprocal measure and it is groundless detained by servicemen under the pretext “of the protection of national independence”.
Some so did not return.
Among the population of Papua Paniay is considered as the “sad, forgotten place”.
Misery strengthens dissatisfaction.
The small portion of the rice, which is sold in Enarotali, costs too dearly for the local residents.
Bread to the same accurately degree is inaccessible.
People here rear everything how they feed: in essence, note, and also some fruits and sheet vegetables.
Agriculture – this is the work of the women, each of whom can handle chetyrmya-pyatyu by the fields of sweet potatoes.
Usually they preserve the large part of the harvest for the family, and rest is sold on the local market.
Ten tubers note cost only 10 000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
The economic inequality between native Papuans and new migrants, whom profit in the large numbers after the introduction of new air flights into the airport to Nabire, in the course of time increased.
A few existing vacancies usually are obtained to the more educated and well-off migrants.
Papuans rarely have enough money or necessary habits in order to conduct its own competitive business.
“Young people do not want to remain in the village… because here there is neither work nor money”, says John Gobai, the chairman of the tribal council of Paniay.
Isolation holds Papua far from the views of the rest of the world.
Moreover, the limitations to the work of international media outlets remain rigid.
Are earlier in this year French journalists Frank Eskyudi and Basile Lonshan they were deported from Papua for “insufficient coordination with the appropriate organizations” in spite of the fact that the rare permissions for conducting of video gave out to them.
According to Felima Keen, deputy director for Asia of organization “Human of Rights Watch”, promises, given in the course of the pre-election campaign of Dzhokovi, to cancel limitations to the work media outlet in order to contribute to transparency and development, were not executed.
“Now foreign journalists, who attempt to conduct reportings from the rebellious eastern Indonesian provinces, Papua and Western Papua, encounter the new dangers: by failures in the visa and by the blacklist”, he said in the statement.
A deficiency in the attention from the side of press means that the international pressure on the government of Indonesia, in essence, is limited by the direct neighbors of Papua.
In March six Pacific Ocean states – Tonga, Nauru, Palau, to Tuvalu, are Marshall islands and are Solomon islands – turned to the United Nations Human Rights Council with the request to investigate “the diverse and widespread disturbances” into Papua, including shooting into Paniay.
The same countries in the past supported OPM.
The representative of the ministry of foreign affairs of Indonesia Arramanata Nasir the statement of group, after reporting to journalists in Jakarta, that “in Indonesia still acts the democratic system and there is free press; therefore to hide evidence of the episodes of the disturbance of human rights would be complicatedly”.
Local residents want so that the larger number of foreign governments would focus attention on situation.
When official delegation from the Netherlands, headed by Netherlands ambassador on human rights by Kiysom by Van Baar, visited Dzhayapuru on May 4, local residents destroyed silence, the mole: “We want freedom”, as asserts the source, which also attended meeting, but it wished to remain anonymous.
In Indonesia new presidential elections in 2019 take place, but Papuans say that hardly again they will vote for Dzhokovi.
“Dzhokovi – man, whose good intentions, but it is surrounded by people, participating to the shooting into Paniay”, tells Gobai, the chairman of advice to tribe.
He wants so that Dzhokovi he would know that the inhabitants of Paniay, furthermore, that they live in the shadow of threat from the side of greedy army, they wallowed in misery, both formation and public health in them are in pathetic state.
Gobay says that the inhabitants of Paniay as other Papuans, count their voice, returned for Dzhokovi, in the debt, which must pay that.
“To them not necessary money, they simply want justice”, he says.
In spite of the threats and intimidation, the families of the victims of shooting into Paniay brought for the performance the last symbolic report of the insubordination: they concealed body of one of the victims in the section of the earth directly opposite the police and military section.
Knowing that, probably, never it will triumph, they, at least, they will not allow guilty to forget justice about their crimes.
“They killed the member of our family”, says Jacobus, without raising head.
“Which still to us was make?”
Fire the second time covers Dubai skyscraper “torch”

Became known the reason for mass fight in the Ural military center
In the Elanskiy training center, where occurred mass fight, arrived the workgroup of the senior officers of central military district for the investigation of the circumstances of incident.
Already became known some details of this slaughter.
According to the data of pablika of Mash, which were appeared on the page “Vkontakte”, the volunteer contract soldiers of Ural military part number 31612 brutally fought because of the not fueled bed.
Began everything from the fact that the Private by the name of Sayan demonstratively ignored the order of officer to fill the projected sheet.
The soldiers from the sixth company arose to the side of officer.
Sayana supported the first company.
After half-hour of 140 young fellows they destroyed in the barracks of bed and shell, knocked glass out.
In the mass fight they suffered more than ten people.
In TSVO they refuted information about the throat-cutting.
A study showed that not less than one fifth of passengers to the USA carry the forbidden objects into the aircraft.
A study showed that more than 20 percent of air passengers consciously or randomly carried in the luggage onboard the aircraft of the points of the examination of the administration of transport safety of the USA the forbidden objects, including the minimum of 6 percent they emplaned, on the oversight having with themselves the forbidden knives or other sharp objects.
Almost 1 percent reported that later they revealed that randomly had with themselves firearms, ammunition or explosives.

The head of EPA Pryuitt rejects the intention to put off the fulfillment accepted rules on reduction in the ejections of the accepted during Obama's lifetime
Next day after the action of 15 states the head of agency for the protection of environment revoked its decision to put off the fulfillment of the accepted during Obama's lifetime rules, called to decrease the ejections of the substances, which contaminiate air and leading to the formation of smog.
Pryuitt explained its solution thereby that now its agency greater than with the previous administrations, listens to the needs of the regulators of the protection of the environment of separate states.
It did not mention about the action against its previous position, subject into the federal court of appeals.
Dispute was developed around the period on October 1, to which the states must ensure the correspondence to the standards of 2015 on ozone at ground level.
In June Pryuitt declared, which will put off their observance for one year in order to give to its department more than time for studying the plan and to avoid “nonconformity to the local solutions or obstacles for economic growth”.
Pryuitt, which before it was appointed as President Tramp to its current post, he was the Attorney General of the state of Oklahoma, was familiar as the logical enemy of the stiffening of ecological n.
After the passage into Washington of Pryuitt repeatedly it blocked or put aside the introduction of standards, to which they opposed chemical or gas-petroleum industry.
The unexpected change of course on Wednesday - this is next the juridical defeat of that undertaken Pyuittom of course on recovery to the previous standards.
In the past month federal court of appeals in Washington decreed, that the head of EPA exceeded its authorities, attempting to put off the fulfillment of accepted by administration Obama the rule, which requires from petroleum and gas companies to track and to decrease leakages methane.
In the statement, released on Wednesday in the evening, Pryuitt proposed to consider that, having sharply replaced course with respect to standards on ozone, it simply fulfilled duty of EPA to collaborate with the states in the complex process of the timely performance of new standards.
“With the previous administrations EPA frequently could not be packed in the outlined periods, after this it waited actions from the groups of activists and from the others and discussed periods in the course of regulating the matter”, said Pryuitt, which gave more than dozen actions against EPA to its previous post.
“We do not believe in the regulation via court trials, and we relate to the periods presented seriously.
We also seriously relate to our regulations and to the authority, which it to us gives”.
Nevertheless, in the statement EPA is said, that Pryuitt can at some moment again use its “authorities for the postponement and other given by law authorities” in order to ascertain that standard “jcyjdfys in the clear course and on the entire accessible information”.
Republicans in the congress insist on the wider revision of the rules, which are concerned ozone.
The bill, approved by the House of Representatives in the past month, attempts to put off the fulfillment of the rules of 2015 as the minimum to eight years.
The senate on this question yet did not vote.
The Attorney General of New York Eric Shneyderman, who headed the coalition of the states, which gave to this week lawsuit against EPA, said that the group will intend to continue juridical pressure.
“Changes in the course of EPA - after our actions - this is important victory in the fight for the health and safety 6.7 million new-yorktsev and more than 115 million Americans, whom directly influences it was able, that covers their cities”, said Shneyderman.
To the action of New York were joined California, Connecticut, Delaver, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Kind-Island, Vermont and Washington, and also region Columbia.
Ozone at ground level appears, when the usual pollutants from the machines, power stations, oil-refining and chemical plants and other sources it enters in the atmosphere in the reaction with the sunlight.
That appearing from this was able it can cause serious problems with the respiration in people sensitive to this, leading to thousands of premature deaths per year.
The defenders of public health and defenders of environment greeted the unexpected change of the course of Pryuitta.
“It is sad to think about that, how much pressure was required in order to attain this completely logical step from the man, to whom it is charged to protect air, by which we breathe”, said Laurie Ann Baird from the center of biological variety.
“We must continue the resistance of the ideological campaign of Tramp's administration and the protection of those, who contaminiate air, and their special interests”.

Offensive defeat
Within the framework of 3 stages of the Fonbet-superiority of Russia among the commands PFL Novomoskovsk “chemist” carried out visiting match against FC [Financial Corporation] “Kaluga”.
Only more than 10 days ago rivals played between themselves in the Russian Cup; however, this time the picture of game was completely different.
“Chemist” in nothing was inferior to opponent, but the weakening on the outcome of match per second led to the offensive goal and fiasco.
After recent defeat from kaluzhan with the score 0:3 many previously prophesied the light victory of owners.
However, since the beginning of the meeting of novomoskovtsy they made it necessary with itself to consider and acted from the defense, but from the position of force.
In 1 time kaluzhane they more greatly created and had an advantage in the ownership of ball.
Next very qualitative match conducted Aleksey Sirotin, who several times reflected dangerous impacts and by its actions it gave to partners confidence.
Unfortunately, in the attack “to chemist” was not sufficient efforts and luck, in order to place in the impasse the defense “of Kaluga” and to drive in the first goal on the departure.
After interruption the game began to flow in the head-on courses.
Novomoskovtsy more actively began to play in the attack.
By alarming zvonochkami for our command of steel of the errors in defense, which allowed kaluzhanam to create a number of sharp moments.
10 minutes prior to the end of the meeting “chemist” intercepted territorial advantage and it conducted several dangerous attacks.
But the experience of kaluzhan played its role - they more competently and cooly conducted tail piece, after waiting its moment for the taking of gates.
After dangerous attack “chemist” transferred the ball on the angular, whose supply the owners of field without the resistance crossed into the gates.

Murder in Morse Ford: activists will lose the judgments of Lynch on the scene in order to call to the justice
“Ford Merkyuri” 1948 passed past the spectators in Monroe's village in the state of Georgia and with the roar dashed to the small bridge Morse Ford.
When the machine, in which there were four black passengers and white drivers, drove up to the bridge, the group of white men with the guns barred way to it.
The main thing (man of average years in the suit into the thin strip )was tightened by cigar and looked through the windshield.
Those sitting inside shook from the fear.
“To us is necessary this nigger, Roger!” - bellowed man.
“You will land it from the machine!”
Shrill howls tore the silence, when they took out young black man from the front seat.
Fortunately, this terrible scene, which was played on July 22, only dramatization.
But when on “Roger's neck” they threw loop, almost all spectators really harbored respiration.
Since 2005 activists return to the bridge Morse Ford in order to anew lose that night, when in 1946 kukluksklanovtsy lynched two black pairs - Roger and Dorothy Young fish and George and Mey Murray Dorsi.
No one was condemned for these murders.
“It is surprising that not one person was arrested in all these years - although we see them next to ourselves; although we know, who they”, says Tyrone Brooks, who helped to organize setting.
“This spot on our history and this is stone at our showers”.
71--year Brooks - former member of the congress of Georgia, which entire life fights for human rights.
For it play - these are dramaturgical call to the action and yearly reminding to the inhabitants of Monroe, that the injustice so was not corrected.
“We want investigation, we want completion, we want healing, we want reconciliation, but first we must attain justice”, he says.
“We cannot pass to the healing and reconciliation, until we attain justice”.
Coroner covers with sheet body of one of the victims of lynching in Morse Ford on July 27, 1946.
According to the materials of the FBI, obtained by NBC Nyuz, more than 50 people in Monroe and adjacent counties were suspected of the participation in the lynching.
But no one so was produced charge.
Although those suspected remained decades on the freedom, human rights activists speak, chtov city they always wonderfully knew two connected motives of the lynchers: policy and sex.
In April 1946 the decision of the Supreme Court for the first time permitted black citizens to vote on the primaries, which had to take place that summer.
Approximately during the same elections, according to the communications to the FBI, black share cropper Roger Malkolm struck in the fight by Barnett knife Khestera, white landowner - po--visibility, because of the woman.
Brooks says that it is said resounded in the city, Khester fell with the wife of Malkolma of Dorothy, and that the child, whom it had to bear, it was not from the husband.
According to the communications to the FBI, on July 25, 1946 of Loy Harrison, important white landowner, paid 600 dollars of guarantee in order to help out Malkolma from the prison.
It went into the prison together with Dorothy and their cousins of Mey Murray and George Dorsi.
But when they went from the prison and drove up to the bridge Morse Ford, the crowd of lynchers surrounded machine.
“It is explained, that organized and commanded murders Harrison”, this conclusion is done in one of the reports to the FBI.
“It is also obvious that occurred the agreement between the law-enforcement agencies of state and city, which not only participated in the murders, but also destroyed evidence and hid the personalities of witnesses”.
Brooks calls this shorter.
“This was attempt on the selective rights”, he says.
“Them all they killed in order to send signal to black in the city: if you are registered and you will vote, with you there will be the same”.
Almost ten years Cassandra Green leads the yearly play, which reproduces the lynching in bridge Morse Ford.
Its play is visual, it seizes spectator and it narrates about that deep racism, which, as many would want to count, is not more in America.
It to difficult look and to even with more difficulty turn away, but Green considers that this is the main thing.
“We do not want to speak about Lynch's vessels, because they show to us our own deformity”, she says.
“But I cannot construct relation with you, if you do not hear me or will not hear, that I survived”.
The rehearsals of the play of this year began in June, and during the first day of almost 30 actors - dozen of white, remaining blacks - were collected in the accomodation and listened to survey of play the ground in the years.
Ueyd Marbo was director together with Green.
It several years played the role of the main member of clan, but he indicates that the role so did not become more easily.
“Me it seems that I was soiled, because this is not that person, that I”, says Marbo.
“But I consider that it is very important to remember this history, because we do not want to return at that time”.
In the accomodation actors Darrius to Bredshou it drooped Raskona, which play Roger Malkolma and Barnett Khestera, are repeated their roles.
Spektal begins from the fact that Malkolm, infuriated by the fact that Khester will sleep with its wife of Dorothy, it shouts and pushes it.
“I said, nigga, be removed from my house!”.
Shouts Raskona as the answer.
Impact is heard.
And at the same moment all (at least, all black actors) burst by laughter.
Green laughs louder than all.
“That such” - he asks coenanthium.
It is perturbed and confused.
I do re-play?
“No”, says Green through the laughter.
“I simply do not think that white then spoke 'nigga'”.
“Dada”, laughs one of the black executors.
“You must proznesti solid 'r'”.
And power engineering in the room so changes: discomfort is changed by a feeling of comradeship.
All must everything do correctly, not only for the play, but also for the memory four of those killed man.
Scene begins first.
In this time, when Raskona speaks word to the letter “n”, it is obtained clear and sharp.
Not one person laughs.
Play concludes brutally and rapidly.
Cries, shots, and then silence.
Woman in the mourning black clothing stands above the bodies of actors and he fulfills sad song the bills of Kholidey “Strange Fruit”.
Its voice is interrupted through the word.
In hundreds of yards from it of fifty spectators they wipe from the eyes of tear and perspiration.
Among the spectators a nearly equal quantity of blacks and white.
One pair arrived from Itaki, the state of New York in order to look idea; many live entirely by a number.
They all almost eight hours suffered the heavy heat of Georgia, thus far Brooks their moving support into the pilgrimage to the graves of Malkolmov and Dorsi.
To this moment the murders remained only history, but now, when they stand at the same place, where they lynched people, it seems that their spectres soar here in air.
When calms down the last note of song, Green invites people to approach nearer and to look around bodies.
Children are bent to their heads, they touch the paint, which depicts the blood, and to fixed bodies and whisper something to each other.
“They not properly dead”, mutter one small boy, as if in order to remind about this themselves.
Through several minutes Green thanks spectators, and suddenly everything ends.
Actors drop ropes from the neck and wipe tears.
To Bredshou it embraces Marbo, man in the suit, which played main kukluksklanovtsa.
Drooped Raskona it embraces other two actors and suddenly, weeping, it falls into their embraces: the emotional load of play finally attacked it.
“Everything in the order”, whispers one of the women.
“We know that the heart in you is good.
You had the reasons for this”.
Later spectators sit down to eat supper together with the actors.
At one table white pair of Atlanta lively discusses play with the black pair, to which they recently were introduced.
Deniza to Daplinski with difficulty seeks out words in order to describe, that she feels after play.
“It is heavy to listen to these terrible, terrible words, and the action… of people, which appear as you, and which make this because they appear as you”, she says.
“After this I think that the lynchings, until now, occur”, it adds, “only now this is called, that shoots the police”.
In other angle of room Tyrone Brooks, who after the food recalls his work of human rights activist, took possession of overall attention.
He indicates that already it began to plan the idea of the following year.
“Setting inspires us, because it not only describes the horror of the fact that we survived, but also it teaches us”, he says.
“Because if you do not extract from this lesson, this can happen again.
Those, who do not study their history, who does not know his history, they are doomed to its repetition”.

New test results for evaluating the age of the petitioners of refuge in Sweden are published
The last test results of the petitioners of the refuges in Sweden, which they subjected to the new method of the medical estimation of age, show that more than 80 percent of those tested thoroughly were evaluated as faces older than 18 years, but not all entrust the accuracy of these results.
The Swedish national agency of forensic medicine (Rättsmedicinalverket) began to carry out tests earlier in this year.
They were developed in order to make age in the process of assylm of more precise, after the Swedish migratory agency (Migrationsverket) they criticized severely for the fact that it could not determine the present age of some refugees, who declared, that they nesovershennoletnye.
At the given moment of Migrationsverket it sent 6 880 matters to testing, and the agency of forensic medicine now published the results of 2 481 tests within the period between the middle of March and on July 31, 2017.
Eighty percent (2002) of those tested were evaluated as people of 18 years either older, and in the 25 additional matters the agency of forensic medicine carried out estimation, which tested “is probable, man of 18 years or is older”.
In the case of 432 matters the conclusion said, which to man “is probable, it is less than 18”.
Tests are conducted only in cases when the age of man causes doubts.
According to Yokhana Geranssona from the agency of forensic medicine, results correspond to results in the past months.
“We do not observe the large difference with the statistics in the past months, number completely appropriate”, he said to portal “The Local”.
The high portion of the matters, on which the people were evaluated as the reached 18 years, necessarily does not indicate that the petitioners of refuge lied apropos of their age.
In May agency published the results of 581 tests and reported that in 442 cases “most likely, age of the tested 18 years or is more”.
However, after examining 581 published results, newspaper “Svenska Dagbladet” revealed that in 243 cases man openly stated that to 18 to him are fulfilled in this year.
The method of conducting the medical estimation of age, which consists of making of roentgen of the teeth of wisdom and laminography of knee joints and returning them to the analysis to dentists and roentgenologists, also caused criticism in some instances.
One of the skeptics – endocrinologist from the Caroline institute Claude Marcus, partly whose work appears the estimation of the biological maturity of people for the purpose of definition, they did pass through the sexual ripening sooner or later of usual.
“I had reasons to think about this, and I do not think that it is necessary to use those methods of measurement, which are used now.
Biological age thus is determined very inaccurately.
If we cannot determine it with the confidence, we must not make form, that we can”, he said to the newspaper “of Metro”.
However, Geranssen from the agency of forensic medicine expressed itself in favor of the accuracy of the tests: “In the general case it is possible to say that the risk erroneous to accept child for the adult is small.
We encounter the largest risk, when to man will soon be 18, in that case it about 10 percent”.

From the composition of Ukrainian delegation is also excluded the trainer Sergey Basenko compatriot.
As reports Sportarena, IAAF suspects sportswomen of the application of doping.

As the financial rules of football they will influence the passage of Neymara into Paris
The rules, aimed at averting of the unlimited expenditures from the side of European soccer clubs, will not prevent the placed world record transfer of Neymara from Spanish “Barcelona” to French “by the bet of hays-Zhermen”.
Any consequence they can begin further on the chain, for “the bet of hays-Zhermen” from the side of the UEFA, leading organ, which controls European football, in whose authority to forbid to commands participation in the prestigious tournament “League of Champions”.
From the rules of financial “feyr-pley”, introduced to the UEFA in 2011, it follows that “PSZH” finally it is necessary to show that the transfer of Neymara was financed without the great losses.
“Barcelona” paid 222 million Euros (262 million dollars) only for that in order to free Brazilian from the contract, and Neymar will obtain salary, which will reach tens of millions of dollars per year.
Here are some the financial aspects of the passage of Neymara into France.
“PSZH” accurately can become generous in order to hire Neymara and to add it to the galaxy of other stars, if we consider financing command from the side rich ruling family of Qatar of the rich in energy.
Clubs have the right to spend large sums on the acquisition of players, but them it is necessary to balance them due to the legal sources of income in order to reach the threshold of profitability in its football business.
“FFP” introduced Michelle Platini after its election by the President of the UEFA in 2007.
The former French football player considered that the clubs, which climb up into the enormous debts in their tendency toward the success, in the essence, swindled and risked by destruction if banks or owners ended financing.
In 2011 “FFP” ceased to be focused on the debts of clubs and instead of this was switched to the tracking of their losses.
Because of this change the business-model, which originally used Roman Abramovich in Chelsea in 2003 – to purchase club with a good potential, and then it is serious to be spent, in order to improve command and to create world brand – it became difficult to achieve plan.
During the present three-year period of estimation, which grips 2018, the clubs can incurred losses into 30 million Euros.
And, in spite of the fact that Platini with the disgrace removed from the presidential post in 2015, its successor in the UEFA Alexander Cheferin is still decisively disposed to hold in control excessive expenditures.
“Of course “FFP” is living, and we, advancing, will tighten rules”, stated last week to agency “Associated Press” Andrea Traverso, who controls “FFP” in the UEFA.
Although “PSZH” will pay the ransom of the contract of Neymara once only, it can for the account distribute this sum on entire period of its contract.
Neymar signed five-year-old agreement, so that transfer cost it is possible to show in the annual account as expenditures into 44.4 million Euros for the following five years.
During the first wave of the sanctions “of FFP” in 2014 to “PSZH”, and also to belonging Abu Dhabi “Manchester City” used the heaviest sanctions.
“PSZH” was established the penalty into 60 million Euros (on that course this 82 million dollars), which later was reduced to 20 million Euros, and were specified limit the composition of its command in “the League of Champions” during the season of 2014-1015 21 to player instead of usual 25.
The UEFA tracks the clubs, which can attempt to outwit its financial inspections, fanning its income due to the companies, connected with the owners of club.
Although Qatar company could prosponsirovat “PSZH”, if standard market valuations considered the sum of financing as that exceeding, the UEFA would not be allowed it to be considered as the legal income.
Specifically, this occurred in 2014, when it decreed the UEFA, that the sum of financing “PSZH” from the side of administration for the tourism of Qatar was bulging.
It communicated that the part of the earnings of Neymara in “PSZH” could enter in the form of the payments from the side of the organizational committee of world championship of 2022 in Qatar.
But “PSZH” and Qatar-2022 deny, that Neymar will become the ambassador of world championship, and the inspectors of the UEFA easily could reveal a similar maneuver.
The past sanctions, superimposed on “PSZH”, mean that the UEFA will even more attentively track any attempts to go around rules.
As reported on Thursday the persons, the acquaintances with the situation, UEFA it did not conduct preliminary considerations with “PSZH” apropos of the transfer of Neymara.
They associated with the agency “Associated Press” on the conditions of anonymity, since they were not authorized to discuss the position “of PSZH”.
According to the last published account, in 2015-1016 “of PSZH” it obtained more than 10 million Euros in profit with turnover into 542.4 million Euros.
Account in last financial year is not yet published.
“PSZH” expects that the arrival of Neymara will become favorable circumstances for the sponsor transactions, sale to atributiki and sports shirts with the logotype of command.
In the club they assume that the revolution will grow as the minimum by 30 percent as a result of the hire of new player.
Undoubtedly angered by the fact that one of the best football players departs, Spanish league tried to prevent the transfer of Neymara, after stating that “PSZH” will destroy the financial “of feyr-pley”.
“This is the obvious case “financial doping”, with the club and state”, stated to the Spanish newspaper “AS” the President la of league Javier Tebas, having, that the final owner “of PSZH” is Qatar.
The trainer “of arsenal” Arsene Wenger, whose club belongs to American sport magnate, shares the doubts la of league apropos of financing of club by state.
“These are still consequences of shared participation, and this completely changed the landscape of football in the last fifteen years”, stated on Thursday Wenger.
“When club belongs to the country, is possible everything.
It is begun to very complicatedly observe the financial of feyr-pley, because the country can have many ways and many reasons to be that presented by this serious player.
Order and the places of prineseniya of oath will determine the President
Where and as new Russian citizens they will swear to the loyalty RF, the President will determine - the committee of the State Duma on legislation and State building developed such corrections to the second reading into the appropriate law.
Another week ago deputies planned to directly determine the order of prineseniya of oath in the law.
From prineseniya of solemn oath will be freed the children to 18 years, and also incapable, it follows from the finished text of corrections into the bill “about the citizenship RF” (there is at the disposal “of Izvestia”), which committee on July 11 will examine before the second reading at its session.
Idea about the introduction of oath with the entry into the citizenship RF instead of the formal signing of documents President Vladimir Putin supported on June 6 in the course of meeting with the speaker of the State Duma Vyacheslav Volodin.
Deputies designed this idea in the form of the correction to the second reading into the bill, which foresees the cancellation of the solution about the delivery of the citizenship of themes, who was subsequently condemned for a number of the crimes of the terrorist or extremist nature: for example, for the public calls to the terrorism or his public justification in media outlets or in the Internet (h. of 2 st. 205.2 Criminal Code of the Russian Federation), and also for the theft of aircraft, train or water transport, but - only if this act is connected with the terrorism (h. of 4 st. 211 Criminal Code of the Russian Federation).
According to bill, its logic was such: shaping documents to the citizenship, man signs under the promise to observe Russian legislation - after embarking on the path of extremism, he disrupts this promise.
Bill in April introduced into the State Duma the leaders of the Duma factions Vladimir Vasil'yev (“United Russia”), Gennadiy Zyuganov (Communist Party of the Russian Federation), Vladimir Zhirinovsky (LDPR (Liberal-Democratic Party of Russia)), Sergey Mironov (“a Just Russia”) and the speaker of the State Duma Vyacheslav Volodin.
On May 19 deputies accepted it in first reading.
Last week committee the State Duma on State building and legislation affirmed the text of bill to the second reading; however, it again they now reworked.
Now in it is indicated that the order of prineseniya of oath will establish the President RF.
Previously parliamentarians intended to describe procedure directly in the law “about the citizenship RF”, after indicating that the ceremony must pass solemnly before the state coat of arms and flag of Russia in the presence of the representative of MVD (Ministry of Internal Affairs).
However, it was not understandable from the text of bill, where must pass this measure - the enumeration of the places, where is possible the arrangement of coat of arms RF, it was reglamentirovan by the corresponding federal constitutional law.
Into their number enter the courts, offices of the heads of organs to gosvlasti subjects, municipal formations, judges, attorneys, the heads of the federal organs of executive power and so forth.
Most probably, this could be ZAGS (Civil Registry Office).
To pronounce solemn oath desiring obtain citizenship RF will after officials they will verify their documents.
But Russian passport man will obtain only after it will bring oath, it follows from the finished text.
Week ago in the project discussion centered on the fact that the oath must precede the signing of decree.
In the updated text it is discussed the fact that swear to Russia they will be from 18 years, but not with 14.
Was preserved the rule, according to which from prineseniya of oath will be freed incapable or ogranichenno functioning, and also those, who cannot pronounce, read or singlehandedly sign the text of oath.
Furthermore, the President RF has the right to free from this procedure and other “persons”,
Is also in the updated bill prescribed the special order of method in the Russian citizens of the inhabitants of Ukraine, who are considered the carriers of Russian.
To them it is necessary to officially forego the Ukrainian citizenship, after granting for this the appropriate statement in the authorized organ of Ukraine.
Will have to transmit the notarially certified copy of statement to Russian officials.
Failure of “strange” citizenship as now, will not be required, if this is provided by international agreement or if this impossibly “in view of the not depending on the person reasons”.
The appropriate correction to the law proposed the group of the deputies, among whom the first Vice-Speaker of Duma Ivan Melnikov (Communist Party of the Russian Federation), Natalie Poklonskaya, Pavel Krasheninnikov and Ayrat Farrakhov (everything - “United Russia”).
I think, many of you know that to obtain information from Ukraine is unreal, simply impossibly.
Respectively very many people wait the solution of its fate apropos of the citizenship RF, explained the day before the head of Duma committee on State building and legislation Pavel Krasheninnikov (United Russia).
Besides this, in the text appeared the refinement, that the limitations to the lesson of the specific posts for the foreigners will not apply to those, who in writing forewent other “” citizenship and returned previous passport in MVD (Ministry of Internal Affairs) of Russia, but “for the not depending on it reasons” him they did not cease to consider the citizen of other country.
Now to foreigners it is forbidden to hold positions on the municipal service, to be taken to the work to the objects and in the organizations, whose activity is connected with providing of safety of Russia.
Also man with the dual citizenship or residence permit of other country cannot become Deputy of the Gosduma or Council member of federation.
It is planned, that the law must come into force since September 1, 2017, the necessary law-subjected reports must be ready to that moment.
Nostalgia becomes recessed in “hot American summer” and “comrade detective”
The current iteration of history nostalgically reminds one simultaneously of the glorious days of characters into the 80th; on the epoch of granzha into the 90th (approximately when the outstanding masters David Wayne and Michael Shovalter they made the comedy of sketches “state” for MTV); and about itself - i.e., about 2001 before its star as Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poler and gender of Radd passed to the more serious things.
As the fact of culture, these are simultaneously elevation and the embodiment of our epoch with its constant reminders from Facebook.
But as franchise it seems by anachronism.
“First day of camp” was to the surprise good, and not only because of the absurdistskogo humor (including original history about that speaking by the jar of vegetables, which recorded X. John Benjamin).
The main joke doubles result: the actors of middle age play the sexually concerned children, who just barely reached maturity; therefore the impossibility to return in becomes the part of the joke.
“Ten years later”, where adult played already adult, have less deep emotional roots, and its parody is more unsystematic and includes riffy from the stalkerskikh films of the 90's of the type “the hand, which rocks cradle”.
In one episode the character obtains Apple Powerbook, four-wheeled roller skates and “the heap of other things of 1991”.
Many subject motions the same.
Good-natured Kup (Shouolter), now writer, did not still attain reciprocity from To keti (Marguerite Moro).
Victor (Ken Marino) still did not part with virginity.
And here still there is the reckless and mean conspiracy, in which participates Ronald Reagan (also Shouolter), whom George Bush Senior now incites (tested parody in execution of Michael Jan Blake).
As always, the best part the franchises - these are retreats from it.
To especially amusingly see eternally young Radda, which sings the song of Dillon's Metta from “the lone persons”, whose character, former large person of Indy appear now by old man.
To bring to this franchise success they would can random follies in the spirit of the type of recursive series “Seven Up”, until it reached the point that would, in my opinion, become its logical completion: “Is hotter the American summer: twenty years later”, where in the last scene entire company would go in the cinema on to the Premier of film “hotter American summer”.
“Comrade detective” on Amazone turns to another type of nostalgia: to memories about the Cold War from “the Americans”, “explosive blond” or even “luster” with her means of the fight of the east and West.
This comedy, created by Brian Geytvud and Alessandro Tanaka with director Reese as Thomas depicts the telecine film: the Romanian police drama of the 80's about two policemen in Bucharest, who fight for the truth, atheism and Marxist-Leninist way.
Main roles - seen life Gregora and idealist of Yozefa - fulfill florin Persik-youngest and to Korneliu Ulich, and recorded their dialogues in English of Chenning Tatum (the very same executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levit.
This is bright idea.
But only idea.
There are several visual jokes (policemen spend time after the survey of match through chess, as Americans they could look football).
The command of famous votees in favor sequence - among them Jenny Sleyt, drooped Offerman, Makhershala of Ali and Khloya for Sevini - makes possible interestingly to play a little into " guess voice”.
But “comrade detective” so is held for the likelihood of clumsy propagandistic drama - there there is even killer in the mask of Ronald Reagan, which frequently and appears by it.
Six long episodes are tightened, and it is ridiculously not very and not frequently.
If we it make pokoroche, “comrade detective” would can better to manage his satire in the spirit of propaganda and agitation section; for example, each time, when Gregor and Yozef come into the American embassy, in the vestibule sit two thick persons, that absorb the heap of hamburgers.
This means tells the imaginary spectator-Communist that the Western culture is capable from what of conveniently making obzhiralovku.
The fictitious Romanian authors of film not are too unjust: We enter so even with our own recent history, and them also.
The prize fund for match for the super cup of Russia along the football between “Spartacus” and “locomotive” will comprise order 30 mln rubles.

Bank of England will preserve the interest rates at level 0.25%
It is expected that the Bank of England more lately will declare, that the interest rates will not change after weak economic growth and the weakening inflation made it necessary to calm down rumors about the possible increase.
Bank of England warned that economic growth will remain leisurely, and left the interest rates without the changes among the growing pressure on the family incomes.
The specialists of the committee of the money and credit policy) (MPC bank voted with result of 6 against 2 for the retention of rates at level 0.25%, in this case in this month a smaller number of committee members they supported an increase in the rate, because weak economic growth weakened the support of increase.
In its quarterly report about the inflation the bank limited its forecasts to the increase to 1.7% percent in 2017 and 1.6% – it in 2018 and warned that the pressure on the family incomes will be continued, whereas it is still expected that the inflation will in autumn rise approximately to 3%.
However, bank warned that increases in the rates into the near several years will be necessary in order to control caused brekzitom inflation, and he stated that, probably, expenditures on the loans it is necessary to raise more strongly than it was expected on the financial markets.
Also the members of committee voted for that in order to forego the part of the huge package of measures for economic development, neglected year ago as a result of brekzita.
Beginning from following February bank will be shut the plan of urgent funding, according to which it allows to banks cheap credits, although it reported that now for it one must within the framework of this plan grant 15 additional billion pounds – to 115 billion pounds.
In the protocol about making of a decision about rates the bank said: “According to the basic forecasts of MPC, an increase in the gross domestic product (GDP [Gross Domestic Product]) soon remains slow, while pressure on the real family incomes continues to influence consumption”.
It repeated regarding the rates, that, in order to stop inflation, will be required “certain stiffening of financial policy”, in “somewhat larger” size, than expect markets.
At the given moment the markets predict the first increase in third quarter of following year and even one- in 2020.
But bank emphasized that all increases will be “gradual” and “limited”.
The forecasts of bank to the increase in this and following year are lower than the forecasts, made in May, which were equal to 1.9% and 1.7%.
Bank left constant its forecast to 1.8% in 2018.
After these news sterling fell with respect to the dollar and Euro.
Pound fell to 0.5% to 1.31 US dollars and to 0.4% to 1.11 Euros.
The solution not to change rate was accepted after the recent uncomforting indices of increase they weakened that increased was the expectation of increase; The GDP [Gross Domestic Product] then grew by 0.3% in the second quarter against 0.2% in the previous three months.
According to the representative of bank, the increase, judging by everything, will remain at level 0.3% in the third quarter, although it will begin to a little increase at the end of the year.
The last report of bank about the inflation gave to little occasion for happiness housework, which struck high inflation and entirely insignificant increases in the wages: according to the bank, the pressure will be strengthened before to be reduced.
Bank added that the financial policy “cannot avoid” udao on the earnings into the near several years, but it expects that the wages “considerably” will be restored toward the end of its three-year-old forecast.
The economy is also disposed to the increase as a result of the growing demand for the British goods, proceeding because of the low exchange value of the pound, which compensates the part of lowered consumer spendings.
The solution was accepted in year after in the past August rate were reduced to 0.25% after the shocking results of referendum regarding the output from the European Union, which entailed a drop in the pound.
According to the estimations of bank, most likely, will be required four years, in order to completely exert the influence on the prices and economy.
Before bank it passed its last decision by the rates, increased noise around the assumed increase in the rates, since inflation is increasingly more weight on and so the experiencing strong pressure housework: three entering the committee of specialist they requested to increase rates to 0.5% in July.
In the past month inflation fell to 2.6% with 2.9% in July, although, according to the communication of bank, this drop was expected and again it is compensated in the next months.
According to the bank, higher index in comparison with those planned by 2% is completely the consequence of the low exchange value of pound.
Andrew Montleyk, the director of company “mortgage brokers Koreko”, he said: “If we consider a recent drop in the courses swap, judging by everything, mortgage market will again become even more competitory, since creditors require business-opportunities and rely on a good completion of year.
Market appears especially favorable for those, who approach an end of their existing agreements, since refinancing credits, frequently with the opportunity of the absence of commission, and also with the low rate, becomes never popular as”.

A study is built in such a way as to estimate all opportunities of PrEP due to the collection of the clinical data about that, who is the purposeful audience of preparation, about its comprehensibility and application on a large scale.
“This most important innovation must supplement and strengthen large-scale and ever more successful efforts, directed toward the averting HIV.
This one additional landmark after is more than three decades of the successes in the fight against one of the largest threats for the health, which encounters humanity.
Deborah Gold, the President of NAT (national control according to control of the spread of AIDS), she stated: “These are turning point in the fight HIV.
PrEP, if we competently aim it at people, which need aid and being undergone risk, gives the opportunity to change the position of the matters concerning the epidemic HIV in England.
Since September, people, which are located in the group of risk on HIV, because of this study, conducted in England due to national health services, will obtain access to the new opening new opportunities means, whose application man can control itself, without discussing this with the partner, which will lead to an improvement in a great many lives.
We warmly welcome this news”.
Jan Green, the President of the fund for Higgins's Terrensa, he said: “Now it is first of all necessary to care that the testing rapidly would be developed in the entire country, and so that no one of the group of risk on HIV would be forgotten.

The shady minister of people public health Sharon Hodgson she said: “We greatly greet the beginning of testing PrEP, it strongly was late because of the months of delay and procrastination from the side of government”.
The data demonstrate, how revolutionary can become this preparation as the part of our approach to the averting HIV and curtailment of the transfer of this fateful infection.
This testing will draw nearer us to the step toward the complete understanding of the advantages of PrEP.

In Russia the complexities with obtaining of the international driver's licenses arose
Subdivisions the GIBDD (State Inspection for Road Traffic Safety) experience the scarcity of international driver licenses (MVU).
In order to obtain such rights, are necessary to wait turn several weeks, which became present problem for the men on leave, who desire to leave to leisure abroad on its automobile or to take it there for hire.
It is worthwhile to note that the situation with the international driver licenses remains contradictory.
MVU was introduced so that the foreign police it would be more simply understand that it is written in the national certification, since information in it is explained in five languages.
Requirements for international laws are recorded in the Viennese convention about the road motion of 1968, but in the countries, which ratified Viennese convention, Russian rights acknowledge and thus.
However, in reality everything depends on the concrete policemen or of the rolling office: some require MVU, and to someone it is sufficient national rights.
In order to be insured, drivers nevertheless obtain international laws, but it is worthwhile to consider that in the not ratified convention countries (for example, the USA, Spain, Mexico, Indonesia) of authority it is right not to recognize either national rights or MVU.
Problem with the forms is now observed practically in all subdivisions of the GIBDD (State Inspection for Road Traffic Safety), reports “Kommersant”, after conducting a study in a number of regions.
Thus, in Moscow in the subdivisions UGIBDD talonchiki simply do not reveal, forms are not sufficient already four months.
It is possible to be written down to the method on the site of gosuslug, but there turn has already been extended to the middle of August.
In Krasnoyarsk MVU it cannot be obtained “for the technical reasons”, without going into details, in Samara region they honestly indicate that there are no forms, analogous situation occurs also in other cities.
Many Muscovites already encountered problem, in the social networks these communications increasingly more frequently appear:
Irina Burmistrova: “Guess, why in Moscow it is not possible to obtain international laws?”
It is correct, because forms ended in all departments of the GIBDD (State Inspection for Road Traffic Safety).
Elena Podkolzina: “A question to the knowing people!”
It is necessary to obtain international laws very urgently.
In Moscow always oppressedly far forward, on the spot the coupons generally do not issue (knopochka is, but coupon give it cannot).
Like the portal of gosuslug shows that in St. Petersburg the time of free to fig.
Did try who to obtain in other city?
It will operate?
As they explained in MVD (Ministry of Internal Affairs) RF, changed requirements for the forms of international driver licenses; therefore the delivery of new forms is achieved into the subdivisions of State Auto Inspection.
With this can be connected the scarcity, true, unclearly, with what changes the discussion deals, earlier about this it did not communicate.
Forms buys special-purpose the center in the region of safety of road motion (TSSN BDD) by MVD (Ministry of Internal Affairs) RF and then are supplied they the subdivisions the GIBDD (State Inspection for Road Traffic Safety).
In recent years all contracts were concluded with AO “goznak”: in 2014-2015 were prepared almost 200,000 forms MVU, were in 2016 stocked up 15,000 forms, in 2017 - 90,000, but last contract was concluded on July 18 with LLC (Limited liability company) “first printed court” for the production of 70,000 forms.
There is a version, that TSSN simply did not have time to in time conduct tender, because of what arose the scarcity.
However, there are other versions of the shortage of the forms: because of the crisis many people began independently to drive not into Europe, but into the cheaper Asian countries - China, Thailand and so on.
What rights assume there, unclearly; therefore the people reinsure to the end; therefore arose excessive demand for the international “crusts”.
It became recent known that for professional drivers it is necessary to pass examination for the confirmation of its qualification.
This proposal the Ministry of Transportation gave.
The international driver license (MVU) of new model acts since May 31, 2011.
The Minister of Justice of Ukraine refused to believe in the building of the Crimean bridge
The Minister of Justice of Ukraine Pavel Petrenko stated that it does not believe in the ability of Russia to construct bridge into the Crimea.
On this on Friday August 4, he said in the interview for portal “reviewer”.
Not one respecting itself international company even boltik or to gaechku will there place, because it risks to lose its business in the territory the European Union, USA, Japan - in the countries, which were joined to the sanctions against Russia relative to the Crimea.
“I.e., on my deep belief, prospects this project actually does not have”, stated Petrenko.
It added that Russia considers incapable to realize major infrastructural project independently.
Russia cannot normally construct less scale objects.
I know that the entire stadiums already began to be destroyed after the Olympics in Sochi.
“Therefore, I count, the best tool in this situation - sanction against the companies, which proved to be such short-sighted so as to be joined to this project”, noted official.
On July 31 builders completed the erection of the arch of the automobile arch of Crimean bridge.
The consolidation assembling of the highway arch of the Crimean bridge is completed on the Kerch shore: its arch is locked at the height of 45 meters from the base of construction.
“Simultaneously bridge builders prepared for the installation to the farvaternye supports railroad arch”, they reported in the information center of project.
In April the head of the Ministry of Transportation Maxim Sokolov informed the President of Russia Vladimir Putin, that the erection of object goes in advance of graph.
Crimean bridge will connect Crimean peninsula and Krasnodar Krai.
In Spain they discharged the official, who 10 years did not walk to the work,
What angelic patience (or absolute indifference to civil service) had to possess chief Spanish official Karles Resio?
Permanent truancy was extended to 10 long years.
However, Mr. Resio was nevertheless discharged.
But by not its immediate superior.
What only in the world bureaucrats it does not occur.
The average men, it seems, have long ago become accustomed to all pranks “of the servants of people”.
And, nevertheless, for officials always succeeds in astonishing those, to whose taxes they live rather well.
This time “sensation” granted from Spain.
There the colleague of the archive of Valencia Karles Resio managed entire ten years not to walk to the work.
In this case it regularly obtained salary.
Moreover entire solid - 50,000 Euros per year.
And the here “strange times” of Mr. Resio ended.
They discharged it on the decision of the legislative assembly of Valencia.
It was explained during the investigation that the malicious truant each working morning came into the office in 07:00 in order to be noted in electronic system.
And it here departed home.
Again it appeared at the job in 16:00 in order be noted to, in addition in the system that it left.
And so 10 years.
It became also known that the truant devoted entire free time to the drawing of comics at home.
Now the deputies of the legislative assembly of Valencia think, how to punish the immediate superior of Mr. Resio, who could not but know as “actively work” at his job its subordinated.
Judges they propose to protect from the chairmen
Presidential Human Rights Council (HRC) on the commission of Vladimir Putin developed proposals on strengthening of the independence of the judicial branch of authority.
HRC proposes to limit the authorities of Chief Justices and to introduce their electivity.
For the courts of the appellate and appeal instances of HRC he wants to introduce the special regions, which will not be attached to the administrative-territorial division in RF.
Its proposals within the framework of the presidential commission it must represent also the Supreme Court.
HRC completed the development of the proposals, which will make it possible to strengthen the independence of Russian justice.
This work of HRC was conducted on the commission of Vladimir Putin dated January 3, 2017, which the President gave after meeting with the Council members.
At the meeting with the Council members on December 8, 2016 were discussed including the individual cases of judicial arbitrariness, and also problem of public control in the prisons of the citizens (see “"” dated December 9).
25 proposals, which concern both the questions of the guarantee of independence of judges and detection of miscarriages of justice and financing courts and juridical formation, became the sum of the work of HRC.
One of the ideas of Kremlin human rights activists consists in the limitation of the authorities of Chief Justices for increasing the independence of remaining judges.
If designee of judge successfully passed competition and was obtained the support of judical association, then Chief Justice, in the opinion of HRC, must present its to the designation, without having a right to refuse, as this allows now law.
It is proposed to also deprive the chairman of the right to distribute the matters for the examination between the judges.
To make this, allow experts, the specially written computer program can.
In HRC they also consider that chairman not right “to predetermine the results of the qualification certification of judge, to initiate his attraction to the disciplinary responsibility, to make decisions about the establishment of additional material payments”.
In this case presidential council is considered necessary to pass to “the electivity of Chief Justices by judges themselves” and “to allot by their authorities for a comparatively short period with the required rotation”.
Now all Chief Justices (from the republic to the district) are assigned to six years as the President for the idea of the chairman of the Supreme Court RF.
In order to fence judges from the pressure of regional administrations, HRC it proposes to in a new way organize appeal and cassation in the vessels of general jurisdiction.
Now their structure is attached to the administrative-territorial division in RF.
In HRC they indicate that “it is necessary to ensure the organization of the individual courts of appellate and appeal instances not at the level of provincial judicial organs in the subjects RF, while in the judicial regions”.
_expert take for basis practice arbitrazhnykh arbitration court.
With them there are “judicial regions”, which do not coincide with the administrative division in RF, but which guarantee due to this the large independence against the regional officials, which hindered the use “telephone right”.
The world judges of HRC it proposes to strengthen by national assessors in order with their participation to examine some “category of civil and administrative proceedings”.
For example, about the deprivation of parental rights, about the restoration on the work, about the protection of honor and merit, about the deprivation of driver's licenses and the like.
“These are only our proposals”, it explained “"” the member of HRC, the judge of the Constitutional Court of retired Tamara Morshchakova.
It also remembered that the commission of the President related not only to HRC, but also to the Supreme Court (VS), which yet did not open its proposals.
Time for fulfilling the commission in the VS (among the co-executors - the Attorney General's Office and authorized on human rights in RF) still exists.
To report to Vladimir Putin about that, the independence of justice how effectively in RF is ensured, the chairman of the VS Vyacheslav Lebedev must until September 1.
To live the high life: half-story and sly designer methods converted this small apartment into Erls Kort into the spacious dwelling
Joan Li, former banker, who is fascinated by the repair of real estate, it in 2014 moved from the spacious house to Naytsbridzhe into the apartment into Erls Kort.
Apartment is located on the ground floor of likable standard house in queen Anna's style, and in favor of the new design speaks the fact that Joan did not gather her things and did not move again.
“Earlier I lived with my that been in Naytsbridzhe over the much larger area”, says Joan.
“I searched for anything that compared for my money.
Me they showed this apartment into Erls Kort, and there were here the same high ceilings.
I fell in love herself with it and proposed price during the same day”.
From the moment of the first survey the apartment with area into 1000 square feet withstood complete reconstruction.
This was originally apartment with one bedroom of complex planning – in order to fall into the bedroom, it was necessary to traverse the kitchen – and Dzhoanna wanted to add space for storing the things and half-story in order to squeeze out the maximum of benefit of the generous height of ceilings.
“I wanted high ceilings, large windows, there is much light.
Were such my requirements”, she says.
For this purpose it hired Erfana azadi from architectural-designer studio “of Duck & of Shed the located in Nutting-Hill” so that they would use the ceilings into 12.5 feet by height and would create the dwelling, which not only would be successful project, but it would befit to Joan for the life.
Ceiling was insufficiently high in order to arrange two accomodations one above another; therefore architectural task consisted in creating of the half-story, where it would be possible to stand into the total increase.
For Erfanu it was necessary to think creatively in order to manage brifom.
“Work with the steel constructions is very complex”, it explains.
“To we had to so to arrange accomodations so that they would be located one above another, and it was not necessary to be bent.
It was necessary not simple to construct simple platform, but so to bend constructions so that they would be located at the correct height and would make it possible to use accomodations from above and from below”.
This solution allowed Erfanu to arrange two full-scale rooms one above another in the diverted space – and there is still much interesting.
Is opened the view of elegant drawing room below from the half-story through the vintazhnoe copper light window from “Retrouvius”.
Specular furniture with the golden finishing, silver emphases and vintazhnye lighting fixtures from Serzh Muya assign the style of project.
The use of mirrors plays role in the addition of entertainment, space and light.
Short corridor is framed by mirrors so that it would seem longer.
On the kitchen specular shielding panel seems by window into another room.
At the entrance specular cabinets serve for storing the entire dishes of Joan.
In order to create the sensation of more luxurious space, the beauty of drawing room can enclose the kitchen, when they do not use it by itself.
In the folding kitchens there is nothing new.
The uniqueness of this kitchen in the fact that this is the shifting upward door as in the garage.
“Was here enabled engineering”, rasskazyvet Erfan about wood fiber shield door the reinforced by steel.
“It is equipped with counterweight, therefore, when you push door upward, she very easily slides”.
Because of judicious use of space and places for the storage, Joan were obtained additional of 16 square meters, additional bedroom and improved planning.
“Finally, the area of genders – this precisely that you will sell, i.e., then, on what is evaluated your real estate”, says Erfan.
“Speaking in general terms, agent on the trade in real estate will enter and will produce calculations on the basis of the area of genders”.
Here they could increase the area of genders, using the qualitative materials, which give to space the nuance of luxury.
“Materials – this that we touch; therefore they help to create emotional connection with the house”, says Erfan.
“No one makes fall in love into the wiring in the walls.
It is important, but it does not catch the string of our hearts”.
This serves as evidence of the fact that due to a good design and increased metric area the apartment can from something usual become something that staggering.
In reality, as by Joan, you can decide to remain.

However, as they emphasized in dipvedomstve, “already third time in the month the diplomatic representatives of the USA, Great Britain, France and Ukraine in the UN Security Council, alternately, varying the keys of objections, being covered by reasons about allegedly the absence of the necessary information, blocked the proposal of the Russian Federation to accept the standard brief project of the statement of the Security Council for the press with the censure of terrorist attacks on the Russian diplomatic mission in the Syrian capital”.
Unwillingness let will remain to show diplomatic solidarity with us on the conscience of these delegations.
“Is more scandalous anything the fact that the incapacity of the Security Council to condemn the acts of terrorists encourages them to the new provocations and acts of terror, it gives to them to feel impunity”, they stated in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and they added that “it would not wish so that in these barbarians would be created persuasion, that someone in the Security Council with them at the same time”.
Vladimir Putin came out for the limitation of the number of unplanned checkings of the business
The President of Russia Vladimir Putin in the course of conference on investproektam in the Far East stated that the number of unplanned checkings of owners must be reduced to 30% of the number of planned, and also he spoke about the need for limiting the period of conducting inspections ten times by twenty-four hours.
“Unplanned checkings are achieved, as a rule, without the appropriate agreement with the prosecutor's office; only 2-3% are coordinated with the prosecutor's office, everything else goes independently”, it cites the President of TASS.
Vladimir Putin also said that it is necessary to forbid to inspectors to withdraw servers and hard drives in enterprises.
Furthermore, in the opinion of the President, business-associations must obtain the right to protect the interests of their members in the court.
“This, I hope, will introduce the specific positive into the examination of the matters, connected with the owner's activity, or connected with the disturbance of law in the sphere of enterprise”, said the Head of State.

Brothers fight for the empire of real estate by the cost more than 500 million dollars
Two brothers war for one of the largest in the state Victoria empires in the trade in real estate by the cost more than 500 million dollars - in forty years after their Italian ancestors they established dynasty.
The former director of the soccer club of Karltona and housebuilder Colin de Lyutis lives in the palace of Turak through three doors from their junior brother of gender, whom the action about the division of the ownership and assets gave against it to the Supreme Court.
Gender wants to leave the family business since 2014, but in the Supreme Court the bitter dispute about divorce conditions thus far is pulled.
Together with their mother by Anna the brothers manage 87 objects with the cost of more than half-billion dollars, purchased from those times, as in 1973 their family purchased store on Smith-Street in Kollingvude.
There family established the firm “Westco Jeans”, which grew into the network, which counts 160 commercial points.
It was sold in 1999 for 85 million dollars.
Money inserted in real estate, and the list of the ownership of family De Lyutis includes today office buildings, sections under the building in Brunsvike and Sorrento, apartment on by gold to coast, also, in Mount-Buller and shopping centers in the suburbs.
By arrangement with the deceased father Colin - which the gender describes as “main motive power and the prevailing personality” of family De Lyutis - manages approximately two thirds assets of company, and gender - approximately by one third.
Vessels this means that according to the data the property of Colin composes 316 millions, and genders - 176 million.
The division of property and money became for the gender stumbling block.
“The division, proposed by Colin, returns to it, in my view, the best parts of the property”, it wrote in its first indications in 2015.
The first hearings in the Supreme Court took place on past Friday after several unsuccessful at attempts the reconciliation.
Brothers now argue about that, who will control the existing business - from which, in the opinion of the gender, Colin excluded it.
Colin asserts that this is not so; however, it charges genders with the incompetent control of some objects.
In the indications, given by Colin at the beginning of process, he indicates that it hopes for resolution of dispute.
“My Italian roots force me to consider family top priority”, it wrote.
Judicial expenditures grow as the snowball: hundreds of pages of indications, electronic letters and reports of such companies as Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer are introduced to the matter; both sides drew the best-known attorneys, including royal attorney Allan Myers, and the best attorneys.
Missis De Lyutis and its deceased husband of Luigi were immigrants from Italy; from the end 1950-X of years they governed milk bars and gourmets, and at the beginning of the 1970's they purchased store in Brunsvike.
Under the financial guarantees they purchased store in Kollingvude, in which Colin was opened the first family store of jeans.
Colin says that he launched Westco, when it was “in the last classes of school, and gender was then boy (approximately 10 years)”.
Anna De Lyutis says that they with Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to transmit their ownership to sons without the conflicts.
“Luigi frequently told me that he does not want so that the brothers would examine court”, it wrote.
Other two brothers, Mark and hatchway, no longer enter into the group of companies De Lyutis; Colin he indicates that Mark obtained 10 millions, when left the business, and the hatchway of 26 millions.
According to the gender, both hatchway and Mark were “they were dissatisfied by the financial conditions of their department”.
Colin was not public figure, although it was the former Council member of the directors of the club of AFL and, according to the published in 2015 biography of Eddie MakGir, by the best friend of television star.
“Fairfax of the media” on Friday it was connected with Colin and gender and with their attorneys.
Answered only Colin, by the text message, in which it was indicated that, since the matter yet it was not examined in the court, “to me truth especially something to say”.
“I ochen-ochen will regret, that my brother gender decided to give against me lawsuit and to scutch in the court the name of our family”, he wrote.
In the middle of 2016 Colin wrote in the indications, that he attempted to satisfy the demands of brother.
“Our father would not want to see, as we with the gender argue in the court”, he said, after adding that “still it hopes for resolution of conflict”.
On Friday this hope, apparently, was scattered.
“The solution by our matter will be soon carried out by court”, wrote Colin.
New the head of Tramp apparatus plans to limit the entering of information to the President.
Others attempted to make this and were defeated.
It can be, this will actually succeed for John F. Kelly.
_in that case it be first.
“Political” reports that new the head of the apparatus of the White House plans to limit information flow, which enters President Tramp, including news communications from the media outlets, hoping to hold chief in the calmer state.
This is what reports reporter Dzhosh Douzi.
“At the conference, which conducted new the head of the apparatus of the White House of John F. Kelly with the management of apparatus during its first workday, it designated the major problem in the White House during President Donald Tramp's lifetime, which it hopes to solve: the poor channels of the entering of information to the President”.
Kelly said to colleagues that the information must penetrate it - to paper form or through the briefings, because the President will better make decisions, if he will obtain correct information.
The diagnosis of Kelly is completely accurate, but others already failed, attempting to pacify Tramp, tracking the enterings to it of information.
The attitudes of President Tramp with the television were formed several decades ago - and now, when it in the White House, its habit to watch TV is as before strong.
“When Tramp, being by candidate, was agitated by the wrong illumination of campaign, it was useful to demonstrate to him that it obtained just illumination in the publications, which could be reconvinced”, said in February “political” Sam Nanberg, former adviser of selective staff.
The container of Palmeri wrote then in “the political”, that “according to six former members of selective staff in order to keep under control Tramp's habit to write into Twitter, it was necessary to follow so that in the entering personally it information there would be the direct flow of praises”.
It is good.
But idea, that Tramp's habit to write in Twitter was sometimes “under the control”, is simply ridiculous.
It can be, these members of selective staff know something such, what we do not know, for example that, if not they, Tramp's tweets would be even more provocative.
We, possibly, never learn about the tweets, which Tramp did not publish.
If its colleagues safeguarded it from the troubles at least several times, their efforts were not useless.
But no one it was impossible to always retain Tramp from podlivaniya of oil into the fire.
The part of the problem lies in the fact that in the White House, divided into the competing fractions, people constantly attempt to move forward their agenda, giving to Tramp the material - reliable or not, which confirms their views.
“Political” - exactly to this history - wrote in May about the tendency of advisers to constantly slip to the President doubtful information.
Here is one example, described by reporter neck by Goldmakherom:
“The current and former colleagues Tramp say that Tramp can react very sharply to the negative reportings in the press, which especially contain dangerous information disclosures, and will not calm down, until it finds, who stood after them.
Thus it occurred at the end of February, when someone slipped to the President the printout of the article GotNews.com, the site of the Internet-provocateur of Charles K. Johnson, in which the deputy of the head of apparatus To keti Welsh was charged with the fact that it “costs after a number of leakages” in the White House.
It is unimportant, that Johnson forever zabanen in Twitter for the aggressive behavior, that he did not present concrete facts or that in the past he started false charges and then rejected them.
Tramp read article and started to question colleagues about Welsh”.
Goldmakher it adds, that then-occuring the head of the apparatus of Rayns Pribus and secretary of the apparatus of robes porter “attempted to construct system in order to govern the flow of paper, which obtains Tramp, and to document them”.
How did operate?
Three months later of Kelly attempt to make the same.
It can be, it will prove to be by more effective manager than Pribus, but in Tramp as before impulsive nature, and his assistants as before battle with each other for the influence.
These constant factors make the task of Kelly very difficult.

Italy tightens tone with respect to the ships of NGO (Non-Government Organization), saving migrants.
Italy warned NGO (Non-Government Organization), to which the rescue vessels in the Mediterranean belong, that they cannot continue work, if they do not obey the new rules, which regulate their activity.
“If NGO (Non-Government Organization) does not obey the new Code of Conduct, it is difficult to say, they can continue their activity”, said the minister of internal affairs Mario Minniti in the interview for the Turin(sk) daily newspaper “Stampa”.
Warning To minniti sounded next day after Italian authorities they confiscated the vessel, which belonged to German humanitarian organization “Jugend Rettet”, on the suspicion of the fact that its crew actually collaborates with the merchants by people and facilitates illegal immigration.
The humanitarian organization, which worked only year, forewent the commentaries actually of the detailed charges, advanced against it by Italian attorney Ambrodzho Kartozio.
“For us rescuing human life exists and it will remain top priority; therefore we greatly will regret, that we cannot now continue activity in the field of search and rescuing”, says the statement of organization in the social networks.
“We will be able to estimate all charges, advanced now, only after we will gather entire information and will be able to estimate situation”.
Italian authorities follow the vessel “Yuventa”, to belonging “Jugend Rettet”, since October.
Its crew is suspected of the fact that it assumed entire lifeboats onboard the migrants, whom the merchants by people sent directly to them, and they made possible for smugglers to depart together with the boats, which they could use anew.
As the minimum one such meeting, as it is assumed, took place only into 1.3 miles from the Libyan coast, so it is asserted in the materials of the charges, whose content was published in the Italian media outlets.
Crew is suspected of the disturbance of the orders of the Italian coast authorities, which control relief operations in this zone, it is faster of the humanitarian zeal, than on any other motives.
The Code of Conduct assumes, mainly that vessels of the type “of Yuventy” will have on board the colleague of the Italian police, who will follow their activity.
Thus far only three of nine NGO (Non-Government Organization), that participate in the search and relief operations, agreed to obey the code: “To save children”, Maltese MOAS and “Pro-Activa the stretched out embraces” from Spain.
The latter stated on Thursday that consider the new rules unnecessary, but acceptable when they will entail no “significant changes or interferences” to its relief operations.
Among those, who refused to sign, to eat and the received the Nobel Prize organization “doctors without borders” (MSF).
Meanwhile, To minniti said that a sharp decrease in the recent weeks of the number of migrants, who arrive into Italy as a result of the relief operations, he indicates that efforts on the support of the Libyan Coast Guard and cooperation with the local mayors bring fruits.
“In the recent days we began to see light at the end of the tunnel”, said minister.
It reported the plans of further negotiations with the Libyan mayors about the initiatives on economic development and with Chad, Niger and Mali about the measures for reduction in the number of migrants, who leave these countries in the hope of reach Europe.
“In Libya we want to be associated not with one of the sides of conflict”
Authorities RF recently noticeably activated their policy in the Libyan direction, and with the visits to Moscow of zachastili of the delegation of the opposing Libyan parties.
The head of Russian contact group on the intra-Libyan regulating with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation and State Duma, assistant of the head of the Chechen republic Leo Dengov described “"”, what purposes Moscow in this region pursues and on whom makes the rate.
On the contact group on Libya, which you head, almost nothing it is known.
Here, let us say, contact group on Ukraine - about it everything they know.
But here - the curtain of secret.
How do specifically you deal, what purposes you do pursue?
Contact group was created on the initiative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation and state thought.
Its activity they treat the Deputy Minister of foreign affairs Mikhail Bogdanov and Adam Delimkhanov (Deputy of the Duma from Chechnya. - “"”).
The latter is authorized to work in the Libyan direction as the speaker of the State Duma Vyacheslav Volodin.
Push to the creation of group became the detention in Libya of Russian tanker “mechanic Chebotarev” (in September 2015, on board there were 11 people. - “"”).
We thought about how to help crew.
Then was created contact group of the military specialists, representatives of the State Duma, our work supported the head of Chechnya Ramzan Kadyrov.
But as it did come out that precisely you it did head?
Since I work on Libya since 2008, to me they were handled proposal to head the work of group.
Our activity did not limit to the release of the seamen s “mechanic Chebotarev”.
We succeeded in establishing contacts with the representatives of all main forces, which oppose to each other in the Libyan conflict - and from the side of Tripoli (where is based the acknowledged by the UN government headed by Faizom Saradzhem. - “"”), and Tobrukom (residence of the parliament, which resists government and is supported marshal the caliph of Khaftara, which controls the eastern regions of Libya. - “"”).
Because of the active participation of Ahmet Metig (Vice-Premier of Libya - “"”), we succeeded in rapidly agree about the release of Russian seamen.
Then it was solved in order more effectively to use these contacts, to create contact group.
Its task - appraisal of the situation, the development of key factors and players, dialogue with all sides of conflict.
I want especially to emphasize: in Libya we want to be associated not with one of the sides of conflict, we conduct dialogue with all.
How much man does enter into contact group and how many of them constantly they are located in Libya?
Now into contact group enter five men.
Among them there are people, which have work experience in the primary structures, including in the Defense Ministry.
We also want to introduce into the composition of the group of specialists in the region, representatives of the institute of the Near East RAN [Russian Academy of Science].
Constantly in Libya from our colleagues no one is located, for this as yet there is no need.
Are there now in Libya Russian military advisers, instructors.
And if yes, on whose side?
There are no Russian military specialists in Libya.
All conversations and publications about this do not correspond to reality.
But into your contact group the former servicemen enter…
Yes, and their presence is necessary.
For example, when we attend flash points.
Or such closed to the defined moment for us of city as Misurata (where are based the forces of militia, which played role in the overthrow of the Libyan leader of Muamar Qaddafi in 2011 and noticeably activated during the subsequent years. - “"”).
We arrived into Misuratu in January of this year.
They frightened us, they indicated that there everything continuously Islamists, terrorists.
But to us it was important itself to estimate there situation, analyze real military potential, who for which answers, why such rumors walk, which there in actuality the role of Islamists.
In Misurate we met with all representatives of the forces, which were occupied by destruction IG in Sirte (in December 2016 this city on Mediterranean coast it was repelled in the militants of forbidden in Russia “Islamic state” - “"”).
We wanted on them to look information, to be introduced to these people, to verify that precisely they played the decisive role in the destruction IG in Libya, but not caliph Khaftar, who assigned to himself these merits.
And to what conclusion you did come?
“Islamic state” in Libya did defeat not Khaftar?
By this was occupied not it.
Khaftar carried out operations at other front, in Benghazi.
But with IG in Sirte fought the structures, which were being subordinated to government in Tripoli.
And, by the way, we invited into Russia people, which carried out this anti-terrorist operation.
And they arrived - visit was prolonged from this 19 until April 23 year, Libyan delegation accepted in the Federation Council, in the Duma, Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Rosgvardii.
You, as we understood, are in all Libyan regions and, probably, you visualize the mood of local elites and field commanders.
How you do think, it will be possible to realize the understandings about the cease fire, about conducting of the elections, which did reach at the end of July in Paris of caliph Khaftar and Faiz Saradzh?
Or again, as this did already repeatedly occur in the past, agreements will be stripped, military operations will be renewed, sides will attempt to individual take authority?
For us a good signal became already the fact that Saradzh and Khaftar agreed to another meeting, yet not so long ago this it was impossibly.
Recently both leaders extremely negatively answered about each other.
But concerning the position of Russia…
Frequently they write and speak, that Moscow actively supports Khaftara, many in this believe.
We encountered this situation, when they were in Misurate, and Khaftar precisely during this day rose onboard the Russian aircraft carrier “Admiral Kuznetsov”.
This was agreement.
But in Misurate in the agreement they did not believe.
They told us: “You, probably very daring people, that they arrived in us precisely today”.
But our task consists exactly in showing: we do not support only Khaftara, we conduct dialogue with all key participants in the conflict in Libya.
You with Khaftarom associated.
Does facilitate mutual understanding with the Russian partners at the human, emotional level the fact that it twice did learn in the USSR?
And, by the way, does know Khaftar Russian?
Russian he even if knows, then very relatively.
But that it learned it, of course, facilitates dialogue with it.
And by the way not only with it.
When we associate with the servicemen in Tripoli and Misurate, we meet the Generals, who learned either in Russia or even in the Soviet Union.
And here just they wonderfully speak in Russian.
And they are pulled to Russia, into some the degrees feel nostalgia for it.
You do consider likely the fast cancellation introduced weapons embargo of introduced with respect to Libya?
Are interested your Libyan collocutors in the deliveries of Russian weapon?
They are interested, of course, but, as I already spoke, we do not occupy in this conflict someone's side and they would not want to arm some to the detriment of others.
We would want so that all would be located approximately in the equal positions.
As far as weapons embargo is concerned, calls constantly sound from the side of Libyans, so that Russia would somehow assist to its removal.
Now in Libya the process of producing the constitution actively moves.
We hope that the sides will leave to the trade-off settlements, they will attain internal consensus.
Then they must pass elections, which was discussed also at the meeting Saradzha and Khaftara.
If elections take place and the legitimate authority (but now not one of the sides such a status it possesses), will be finally selected, then it is possible to place in the Security Council of the United Nations a question about the removal of weapons embargo.
To raise this question is now thoughtless and it is dangerous, this only will lead to the escalation of conflict.
Recently in media outlets passed information, which Italy, which was encountered the problem of the swimming from Libya African refugees, feels itself the deserted to the arbitrariness fate by allies from the European Union.
Can Moscow in this situation help Italian partners, using its connections with the Libyans?
How, for example, is realistic version, that the forces of Khaftara will establish control over the coast and will put an end to the business of smugglers, who send immigrants into Europe?
Very timely question.
We actively at this work.
Italians need support to Russia, because Moscow conducts dialogue simultaneously, also, with Khaftarom, and Saradzhem, and from the Misuratoy also with the south country.
But in this question tribes in the south of Libya play large role, and they are ready to collaborate with Russia.
The discussion does deal that the southerners would suppress the flows of migrants on the distant approaches?
I.e., conditionally speaking, did turn conversely buses, in which will go Nigerian migrants?
We this seek.
But this is not simple.
Some clans and groups are interested in these flows continuing to go.
We hope to assist combining of southerners in the telephone-box process between Saradzhem, under Khaftarom and by tribes in the south.
But for the beginning we would want to see the unity of opinion on this question between Khaftarom and Saradzhem.
The Head of Government in Tripoli of Faiz Saradzh is considered Islamist, supporter of the introduction in the country of the standards of Sharia.
How radical a views it does adhere to?
Will not become this the obstacle during the formation of relations with Russia or West?
I will express my personal opinion about it
In my view, it, on the contrary, the opponent of radical Islam.
But Islamists exist in its coalition.
Yes, but itself it adheres to position, what Libya must be the absolutely normal country - moderately Islamic, opened to peace.
And it also actively fights with the terrorists.
However, from where it has this reputation?
It is created with those countries, which are not interested in Russia being associated with Tripoli.
Tripoli - this indeed the capital, legislative, executive and judicial authority there is located.
There national petroleum corporation, national bank and other state structures.
Certainly, some countries were interested in we there not climbing.
But we by them all maps mixed and began to actively associate, also, with Tripoli, and Tobrukom.
And we already reap fruits of this work: Rosneft concluded agreement about the collaboration with the state oil company of Libya - NOC.
The director of NOC Mustafa Sanalla, with which the head of Rosneft Igor Sechin concluded transaction, itself directly from Tripoli.
And two weeks ago occurred the first dispatch of Libyan oil of company “Rosneft”.
What Russia with it will make?
I assume that to resell.
But even what Russia has economic interests in Libya?
In the plans to perepodpisat the contracts, concluded with the Muamar Qaddafi.
The discussion deals, in particular, with the previous understandings in the transport sphere (building of railroads), power engineering (electrification) and number of others.
But Libyans there is how to pay?
Well, they have oil.
I.e., speech, as in the case with Iran, does go about the diagram “oil in exchange for the services”?
I do not know, what diagram will be, I do not deal with directly these questions.
In reality the economy for Russia in Libya and not main thing.
We there, in the essence, deal with peacemaking work.
For us the main thing - to stop bloodshed, to help Libyans to agree between themselves, so that they could establish order in themselves and Libya ceased to be favorable medium for the development of terrorism.
For Russia precisely this is the basic task - to help Libyan people and to press from there terrorists.
There are in you the data about the presence in Libya (now or earlier) radical militants from Russia or other countries of the former USSR?
The explanation of this was one of the tasks of our contact group.
I met with the representative of the Libyan committee of state security, which said that today there is not one descendant of Russia and other countries of the former USSR there.
He said that in it about 50,000 records of the telephone conversations of the representatives of Islamic and radical groups (in Libya. - “"”) and Russian speech there does not sound.
But from what states then these militants?
I did not want to go into these details.
Then we formulate a question otherwise.
How it is much among the militant-Islamists in Libya of Libyans themselves?
There are no Libyans among them practically, them not more than 5%.
Rest - alien.
Can Moscow conduct intra-Libyan talks on an example of Paris?
Such plans exist.
We conduct with the Libyans active dialogues, several delegations of Libya already visited Moscow, and they stated about the willingness to arrive still - into Moscow or into Groznyy.
But when they can pass such negotiations?
It is now heavy to say.
Still must take place several visits, and then, I hope, will appear clarity apropos of time and place of negotiations.

Sentence Michelle Carter for the communications, which prompted to Conrad Roy's suicide
The inhabitant of Massachusetts they sentenced to two and one-half to the years of conclusion for the fact that it with the aid of the text messages and phone calls impelled to the suicide of its boyfriend of Conrad Roy.
Michelle Carter, with which now 20 years, it will have to depart 15 months of its period after the lattice and the already 5 years of qualifying period.
Crankcase it was in June acknowledged guilty of the unpremeditated murder of Conrad Roy, who put an end to himself on July 13, 2014.
The father of Roy said at the hearings on Thursday: “My family is killed gorem (advance repair train, adreptrain).
My son was my best friend”.
Crankcase it was permitted to remain on the freedom to the appeal.
Maximum period into 20 years threatened to it, but its attorneys stated that also she, and Roy suffered mental disorders.
Crankcase, dressed in the red trousers and cream blouse, it listened to sentence costing, after pressing hands and after lowering eyes.
“By its actions it killed Conrad Roy”, it stated to court attorney.
“It interrupted its life in order to improve its.
It did not recognize responsibility”, she said.
“It did not demonstrate repentance”.
But attorney Carter stated that this was “the tragic case, about which it deeply will regret”.
However, judge Lawrence Monis said that, in his opinion, it “the age, level of maturity or even mental illness did not influence by noticeable means its actions”.
Accuser read the statement of mother Roy Lynn Roy, in whom it is said: “it passed not one day, when I did not mourn the loss of my dear son.
I want so that he would be proud by me and fact, as I manage - I try to support his sisters, in spite of entire pain, which will remain with us forever”, it is said in it
Sister Roy Kamdin Roy said that her persistently pursues the thought about the fact that it never will be able to be present on its wedding or to become the aunt of its children.
“To be deprived of man, who was with me always from my quite generation, this the pain, which will remain with me to the end of the life”, she said.
This case will, apparently, become juridical precedent, since in Massachusetts there is no law, which would provide for responsibility for advice to man to commit suicide.
In 2014, when Roy they found in the machine by dead with the symptoms of poisoning by carbon monoxide, Carter there were 17 years.
The case drew country-wide attention, when it became known that it they pushed slightly to the suicide of message Carter.
“Can hang, jump from the roof, stab itself by knife I do not know there are many methods”, it wrote in several communications, sent in two weeks to its death, when it rested together with the family.
For a few minutes it wrote to the suicide: “You must make this, Conrad” and “you should only include ignition, and you will become free and happy”.
Judge Monis said that Carter she wanted to attain attention with the aid of death of Roy, and it forbade to it to associate with the press in order not to give to it to obtain desired.
The opinions of lawyers in regard to this were divided.
One of few, who protected Carter, it was Amand Knox, which was condemned in 2007 for the murder in Italy of its British neighbor on the apartment and justified two years later.
30-year Knox published into “the Los Angeles Times” its special opinion, in which it was asserted: “Michelle Carter deserves sympathy and aid, but not prison”.

“For Audi” one must modify to 850 000 diesel automobiles
They stated in the day before the declaration from the side “of Audi” “of BMW” that they will propose to update software more than into 350 000 automobiles.
The chairman “of BMW” stated that the company considers that “there are more intelligent ways than limitation to the driving”, having the European cities – including Munich, where it is arranged “with BMW” - which examined the opportunity to forbid or to limit the use of diesel automobiles.
“Daimler” stated on Thursday that are modified three million automobiles “Mercedes” in Europe in order to decrease their diesel exhaust.
None of the companies named its step opinion.
European automakers actively moved the use of diesel automobiles in Europe and United States in order to assist to the observance of rules on the ejection of carbon dioxide.
But nitrogen oxides, which eject Diesel engines, they are considered carcinogens and they can cause asthma.
Cost for the automakers of the installation of the equipment, which neutralizes exhaust gases of diesel automobiles also rises, and to support competitive price of the automobiles it is begun complicatedly.
While German automakers they are found under close attention, the government of the chancellor of Angela Merkel they also accused of the fact that it indulges to influential automakers and ignores the signs of problem.
Companies try not to repeat error “Folksvagena”, which hid the use of the so-called “devices of the defeats”, which during testing could correct a quantity of ejected harmful gases so that it would correspond to the rules, but under the conditions of usual driving they were disconnected.
In the United States was carried out the guilty verdict to several leaders “Folksvagena”, rest they are under investigation on both sides of the Atlantic.
In the past month in Germany they arrested the former division head of thermodynamics in the composition of the group of the development of the engines “of Audi”.
The former manager, Zakkeo of Giovanni Pamio, Italian, and therefore are not protected from the extradition and can appear before the court in the United States.
Earlier in this year “of Audi” it fell for German criminal investigation with the participation “of Folksvagena” after authority they accused “Audi” of the installation of system for the purpose of the circuit of the European rules of ejection they enlarged the investigation, which earlier was concentrated in the United States.
The start “of Audi” in investigation can create serious problems “Folksvagenu”: the producer of high-end automobiles is the source of the disproportionately high portion of the income “of Folksvagena”.

Astronomers found “infernal” planet, on which can be melted even iron
Having for the first time studied the properties of the stratosphere of gigantic exoplanet by the name of WASP-121b, astrophysics they were several astonished by its temperature, which one can evaporate iron and other metals.
Specialists focused attention, that the molecules of water are so heated by the light of star that they emit infrared radiation.
Telescope “Hubble” imprinted the radiance of the molecules of water on this gas giant: this high temperature forces water in the atmosphere of planet to shine in the infrared region.
WASP-121b relates to so-called “hot Jupiter” - to gas giants, according to the sizes and throughout mass compared with the largest planet of the solar system, but located dozens of times it is nearer to the parental star.

A climate change threatens lavender in Provanse.
It became the symbol of Provansa and South France, but now speak out the fears that a climate change threatens it.
Lavender became worse grow because of the arid weather and insects enduring diseases; this became the reason of a constant headache of scientists and farmers, who attempt to find the solution.
Eric Shes, expert from the located in the Provanse agricultural research institute of CRIEPPAM, he says: “Lavender in Provanse actually is located under the threat, because in recent years this plant perceives on itself the consequences of a climate change: in spring and especially in autumn rains it became much less.
This influences the period of life of lavender.
And still are the small cicadas, that jump on leaves the insects, that transfer Microbacteria; in their very dry weather becomes much”.
Much is set on the map.
Lavender not only draws men on leave; lavender oil is very claimed in the perfumery and kosmetologii.
Eric Shes speaks: “Instead of the very long ears with the large number of large colors we have small, not developed, weakened or generally absentees.
Therefore it is less than the parts, which contain essential oil”.
The solutions, which now are examined, include improvement in the distribution of water and retarding evaporation from the soil, and also spraying plants by the shielding mixture of clay and water and the removal of types, more resistant to the drought.

The natural gas incomes of July exceeded forecast to 7.4 billion rubles
Actually obtained natural gas incomes on the sums July 2017. estimation to 7.4 billion rub exceeded, reports the Board of Exchequer RF.
Exceeding, as explains department, occurred predominantly due to the higher exchange rate of US dollar for the ruble in comparison with the average monthly value of June, which were being used for the estimation, and also in view of exceeding the actual volume of the output of gas and volume of the export of the petroleum products of the forecasted levels.

The murder of journalist emphasizes that in Mexico it becomes ever more dangerous.
The colleagues of the weekly newspaper “Riodose” usually are encountered on the media in order to discuss plans with respect to the illumination of the last violent crimes in the state of Sinaloa, connected with the organized criminality, corrupted officials or incessant war of drug pushers.
But today, depressed by their own tragedy, they were encountered in order to have a talk about the safety.
They told them that they must change their habits.
Two senior journalists discussed, which seems safer: to take children with itself into the office, into which they in 2009 already threw garnet, or to leave their houses.
Experts on the safety wrote on the board, which hangs in the room, three words: enemies, neutral people, allies.
They requested journalists to name names for each column - proof they were not necessary, suspicions and internal sensations it will be sufficient.
These are drug dealers, policy, businessmen, the journalists, whom they suspect of the fact that they are located on the content in government or in cartels, the entire list of the scoundrels, because of whom the work on the illumination of chaos in Mexico becomes dangerous.
Violence does not give respite, and among the corpses, which are multiplied in the country, it is more and it is more than the journalists: according to the data of the committee of the protection of journalists, not less than 25, since the President Enrico Pena Neto engaged its post in December 2012; 589 people after attacks and threats are found under federal protection; and in this year already minimum seven people it died in seven states.
Among the latter - their publisher and inspirer, co-founder “to Riodose” Javier Valdez Cardenas.
“Largest error - this to live in Mexico and to be journalist”, wrote Valdez in one of its numerous books about the violent crimes, connected with the narcotics.
Its absence is felt very sharply, although its presence everywhere - large photograph of Valdez, which shows middle finger, with the inscription “justice” it hangs on the facade of building “Riodose”; two reporters of years for 30, Aaron Ibarras and Miriam Ramirezs, bear the sports shirts, on which is depicted his smile, face in the glasses or his firm panama.
Seminar is passed less than after two months after its death; journalists discuss their general injury, their nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.
Although the office of special federal attorney for the investigation of the journalistic matters was in 2010 organized, until, according to the data of the committee of the protection of journalists, only two matters is investigated.
As in the case of majority of those accomplished each year of thousands of murders, connected with drug trafficking and organized criminality, killers of journalists rarely appear before the court.
Journalists “to Riodose” insist, that they will write about the violence into Sinaloa, although they are killed gorem (advance repair train, adreptrain), although all around now it is considerably more dangerous.
Without the information about the killers, without the justice from the conversations about the safety at the meetings little benefit, speaks Ibarra.
“It is very foolish to spend time at this seminar”, he says.
“Thus far we do not know reason, we suspect all”.
In the morning on May 15 Valdez left from the office “to Riodose” in the capital of state to Kuliakane.
He succeeded in passing the pair of blocks only before its red Toyota to Korollu they stopped two men; it took out of the machine and shot at it 12 times, probably, because of the name newspaper - which indicates “twelfth river”.
That shot left in its machine and broke it near.
To Valdez there were 50 years.
In it remained the wife even two adult children.
Rumors usually rapidly disperse on Kuliakanu.
But about Valdez practically all keep silent.
From those times, as Guzman it was arrested and given out in the USA in January last year, Sinaloa became one of the bloody pour on battles in the country, since the competing fractions fight for that in order to fill the formed vacuum.
We will not speak, that each day on the streets of Sinaloa they kill one either several man or about the fact that the cemetery is filled with the adorned two-story mausoleums of narkokoroley, which are greater than the house of many living people.
Let us forget for the minute, that the state “of calmness” - this simply when one of the cartels takes under its control seaside state with the important ports and ways of drug trafficking, which lead in the USA.
In spite of this and to the fact that Valdez perfectly well knew about the dangers of its work, Ismail Bokhorkes, 60-year co-founder and director “Riodose”, it was crushed by feeling of guilt for the fact that it did not know how to protect friend.
He thinks that two errors helped murder.
First, it was in February published by interview Damaso by Lopez, by leader of one of the competing fractions of cartel, who wars with the sons of Guzman.
Publication could anger sons; people, which they were supposedly the members of gang, bought up all copies of publication, as soon as they were delivered into the kiosks.
The second error was in the fact that it did not force Valdez for its own safety to leave the country after was seized another newspaper, which wrote about the same history.
Valdez was legend in Mexico and abroad, and its murder was estimated as next landmark in the development of violence against the journalists in Mexico.
It so for long departed from the danger, its friends and colleagues thought that it will be always.
It was experienced reporter in “Noroeste” and in 2003 together with five colleagues it established “Riodose”, selling its 50-dollar actions.
In Sinaloa “it was not possible to be occupied by journalism, without affecting the theme of narcotics”, said Bokhorkes.
In the course of time the newspaper deserved the reputation of daring and honest publication, sale and advertising incomes grew.
It pleased journalists, that they could publish daring reportings, without fearing censorship, but it drew the readers, that in this publication they could read about that, about which no one no longer it dared to write.
Eight years after its base “Riodose” obtained the prestigious reward to Mary Murs Cabot for the reporterskuyu work in Latin America.
In the same year Valdez won the international reward of freedom of the press for the courage in the investigation of narcotics trafficking to Mexico, where it not conducted.
It frankly acknowledged that to it is terrible.
“I want to live further”, he said at the presentation to the reward to CPJ.
Narcotics trafficking into Sinaloa - “this is a way of life”, he said in October last year in the interview Rompevento tv.
“You must accept the tasks, which lie on you as to the journalist - either so or you simply drag along fool”.
I do not want so that they would ask me: “That you made, when around there was so many deaths… why you they did not indicate that it occurs?”
Colleagues “to Riodose” are bored according to Valdez, joker, who was scolded as loader in the port, to friend, generous to the embraces and councils, to the teacher, who knew how to sotatsya in the living.
They relied on that brought by it order.
It had to always bear its hat.
It had to walk into “the ale Guayyabo”, bar opposite the office, and always sit there at one and the same table.
Now they ask: it did ruin love for the once routine?
Its death forced them to doubt its calculations of that how it is better to make its work and to remain in the living.
“They do not love, when you examine in their wives, children, in their legal business and underground airfields for the transportation of narcotics.
“These things were after the feature”, said Bokhorkes.
Result, even in the better time, was the high level of self-censorship and tendency toward the self-preservation.
It is necessary to believe to its instincts.
Be held further from the fact that badly smells.
Problem, tells editor “Riodose” Andres Vilyareal, in the fact that “the sense of smell can be deceived… and then occurs that happened of Javier”.
Old rules, he speaks and others, no longer act into Sinaloa - and in Tamaulipase, Vera Cruz, Guerrero and other states, where there is a poisonous mixture of profitable contraband ways, weak state institutes and corrupted officials.
Landscape constantly changes.
In the room, where the colleagues “Riodose” were gathered for the training on the safety, suddenly it proved to be to forbidden introduce the cell phones: after several days to that became known that the espionage programs, which are sold exclusively to governments, are used in Mexico for the shadowing after the journalists and public activists.
Outside two policemen they are concealed in the shadow of tree of the 104-degree heat (40 degrees according to Celsius).
To them gave task the government of state to guard office “Riodose”, which is located in the four-storied building in the bourgeois block of Kuliakana.
Some journalists half in joke asked, do not enter these policemen into those 50 percent of the servants of order, about whom governor himself said that to them it cannot be entrusted.
Several months ago journalists left for the mountainous country, which de facto is under the control of the gangs of drug dealers.
In the nearest number “Riodose” relied on three main themes.
This is murder into Sinaloa of the brother of the former champion of Julio Cesar Chavez's boxing.
Even they had the disclosure of government spendings, concentrated in the home town of governor.
And there was group hostage taking in one of the most expensive restaurants of Kuliakana, in the block from the office of attorney.
It was not officially declared, who was stolen or as this happened; therefore it was necessary to observe the caution, when it arrived to write time about the fact that everyone in the city knew: that this was the dear restaurant simultaneously of narkodilerov and authorities.
One learned their journalists from the open databases, that the restaurant was registered to the name the policy, that belongs to the ruling Institution-revolutionary party (PRI), which prevailed at all levels of authority during almost entire past century.
Recently loud charges in corruption were advanced against several governors from PRI.
Vilyareal requested journalists to write about the previous incidents in this restaurant, including about that, when son “ale Chapo” Guzman slipped off from the round-up of servicemen.
Still several months ago the readers would search for the column of Valdez with the very adequate information about the theft.
“Earlier we already knew that it occurred”, says 46-year-old Vilyareal, for its thin build called “ale Flako”.
“Today all communication channels with our sources are torn”.
The office of Valdez is used now as storage for the posters and stickers with the protests against the murders of journalists, because the colleagues of steel of themes, whom they never thought to become: by activists, who appear on behalf presses.
Woman journalist Miriam Ramires took several posters and she left for the following morning to the demonstration in the local prosecutor's office, dedicated to another journalist.
El Salvador Adam disappeared in the state of Michoakan in the West of the country in three days after was killed Valdez.
They found the burnt body, and they stated to authorities that this is it, on the basis of the tests of DNA.
The journalists began to speak out more loudly in the entire country, to organize protests and to write “SOS Press” on pavements and walls of houses.
During this day director Bokhorkes was in Washington, attempting to secure by international support in the requirement of justice in the affair of Valdez.
At the meeting with the governor Sinaloa next day after the murder of Valdez Ramires accused authorities of the fact that they spy after the journalists and order their murders for the fact that those speak truth.
After this, it requested not to give to it more than tasks with respect to the illumination of the activity of government, fearing, that anger will damage its objectivity.
Valdez many times indicated that the journalists in Mexico “were surrounded” by the organized criminality, its participants in the government and indifferent society.
In its last book “Narko-journalism” it wrote that reporters kill not simply the gangs of drug dealers; they make this on the orders of the politicians and security service, which are located in the agreement with the organized criminality.
Committee on the protection of press “type of merchandise 19” considers that half of attacks on the journalists was in the past year perfected on the order of the police and government officials.
“In Mexico you die because they want you to plug”, says Ramires.
Certainly, murders frighten people.
Everything remember, about the loss of the blogger of Mary Elizabeth Masias six years ago in the northern near-boundary state of Tamaulipas.
On its tele- they found the note, supposedly written from the person of the cartel of Zetas: “I here because of my articles”.
Computer keyboard and head sets lay next to its cut off head.
Some publications preferred to be shut as newspaper “ale North” in the northern near-boundary state of Chikhuakhua after in March killed its correspondent Miroslav Brich.
Others continue to be held as “the ale of Manyana” from Nuevo of Laredo after the murder of its leader in 2004.
In 2010 “Diario de Ciudad Juarez” publicly turned to narkokartelyam with the aid of the editorial article on the first page, entitled “what you from us you want?”
Some journalists left their native states or generally the country.
This is the agonizing solution.
In the expulsion it is difficult to find work, and they as before look out danger on the streets.
And they sometimes kill them, as this, obviously, occurred with photographer Ruben Espinozoy, who was killed in 2015 together with four women in the apartment in Mexico three months after flight from Vera Cruz.
Those, who remain and continue to work, daily balance between the risky solutions.
Ibarra - which once dreamed to be poet - it recognizes that it is terrible to write it about narcotics trafficking.
“Mexico rolls into hell, and for this very reason I became journalist”, he says.
On past Friday, in midnight, when last release was already ready to press, publishers “Riodose” sat on the pavement next to the office and saw beer, when suddenly their telephones simultaneously began to ring.
A series of the skirmishes between the opposing gangs and security forces not far from the health resort city Mazatlan left after itself, according to confirmed data, 19 corpses.
War continued to burn, as it was promised in a series of messages from the cartels, discovered in this region.
Sitting on the pavement, they through the cell phone laid out the news to the Web site “Riodose”.
Next day it was necessary to alter the first page.
Near set up a howl sirens - one additional skirmish in the environments.
Bokhorkes looked ready to defense their guarding policemen.
If they were frightened, they in no way this showed.
Sitting under the enormous portrait of the killed founder of their newspaper, whose middle finger was put out to the review of entire Sinaloa, colleagues “Riodose” continued its matter.
“As you can think about being shut, said Bokhorkes, if during that day itself, when Javier was killed, praktikantka requested me to send it to the street to make reporting?”
Dinosaur used camouflage in order to avoid the enemies
At first glance it seems by the statue, although which directs horror.
Researchers described that the first obtained remains of improbable essence by size from the rhinoceros, discovered by Canadian miner, were preserved so well that the experts named him “Monoy of Lizoy among the dinosaurs”.
It so was preserved well that they even could determine, what color of its scaly skin was reddish-brown – and to say that he had, in a certain kind, “dark past”.
In the report, published in the journal “contemporary biology”, it was described as “well preserved itself from Tireofor during entire history of findings and one of the best copies of dinosaur in the world”.
This fossilized – recently obtained copy of nodozavra, which lived in the middle of Cretaceous period, between 110 millions and 112 million years ago.
Its improbable good state stupefied the researchers, who call it “actually remarkable”.
This herbivorous tireofor – very well preserved mineral of this form during entire history of findings, according to articles in the periodical of National Geographic.
It was found by Sean Fank, when that conducted works on the mine of Millenium of the company of Sankor not far from the fort Poppy-Murray in north Albert, in Canada, on March 21, 2011.
It stumbled on something, which, seemed, it differed from the surrounding species, and it decided to look more attentively.
Discovered by it mineral was sent for the royal Tirrellovskiy paleontological museum.
The following six years was conducted work on the detection of animal inside the earthen chunk by mass into 2500 futnov (1100 kilograms).
Now, when this entire hard work is made, the final result can be demonstrated.
“It is worthwhile to only slightly squint, and it is possible to practically believe that he will sleep”, described chief author Kaleb Brown, the scientific worker of the royal Tirrellovskogo paleontological museum, where creation is demonstrated.
“It will enter into the history of science as one of the most beautiful and very well preserved copies of dinosaurs – Mohn Liza among the dinosaurs”.
Studying its skin, researchers revealed that this herbivorous, in spite of the fact that it was covered with armor and resembled walking tank, in all likelihood, underwent significant danger from the side of carnivorous dinosaurs.
This covered with powerful armor dinosaur used red-white camouflage in order to hide from the predators, and used the shielding technology, known as the protective paint, which also use many animals our days.
This would make possible for it more rapidly to merge with the surrounding situation and to avoid meeting with the enemies, speak experts, assuming, that it hunted the larger dinosaurs.
This essence by age into 110 million years, that relates to the family of nodozavrov, was widely illuminated in the press in May, and now it is located on the exposure in the royal Tirrellovskom paleontological museum.
Scientists already studied animal and gave to it the name of Borealopelta markmitchelli in the honor of museum laboratory assistant Mark Mitchell, one of the participants in the group, which conducted more than 7000 hours after its tedious raskopkoy.
The surprising safety of copy allowed doctor Mitchell and international group of scientists to zadokumentirovat figure and the form of fish-scales and armored plates on its tele-.
They revealed protective paint, extended method of protection in the reign of animals, which means that the top of essence was darker its lower side.
Although the protective paint is well extended, discovery became unexpected contingency, because the size of the dinosaur of Borealopelta considerably exceeds the size of the now living animals with the protective paint.
It is possible to assume that the carnivorous dinosaurs so actively hunted this dinosaur, that the evolution preferred masking the confrontation as the method of survival.
But the majority of contemporary animals with the protective paint – for example, deer, zebras or Battleships – considerably smaller size are more accessible of outputs, which attests to the fact that for nodozavru was necessary seriously to fight for the survival.
“The serious threat from the side of predators for the massive, covered with powerful armor dinosaur shows, how dangerous were the predatory dinosaurs of Cretaceous period”, described Brown.
Chemical analysis of organic compounds in the scale of dinosaur also attests to the fact that its skin had to be reddish-brown.
Scientists continue to study animal, searching for the information about his life, including preserved contents of his digestive tract in order to explain that it ate during its last meal.
They consider that when the dinosaur died, it fell into the river and it was taken away in the sea, where it sank and it downward lay back on the bottom of ocean.
In those times in Albert there was so heat-, as now in the south of Florida, and river and oceans, most likely, they were extended much further into the depths of the land, than now.
“This nodozavr is truly remarkable fact that it is completely covered with the preserved scaly skin, and at the same time completely it was preserved in three measurements, after preserving the original form of animal”, said Brown.
“Animal as a result now appears almost, just as it appeared then, in the early Cretaceous period.
It is not necessary especially to come running to the imagination in order it to recreate, it is worthwhile to only slightly squint, and it is possible to practically believe that he will sleep”.
Cretaceous period – this is the epoch, when gigantic teropody, the carnivorous dinosaurs, that stand on two feet, wandered along the Earth.
Although most remarkable of them, tirannozavr Rex, lived to millions years more lately than Borealopelta, tireofora could hunt someone of his terrible ancestors.
Into their number enters the acroedgingforVerkhovna Rada [Parliament], the monster with length into 38 feet (11.5 meters) with weight into six tons.
Scientific, whose last discoveries are published in the journal “contemporary biology”, they consider that Borealopelta was after death taken away in the sea and was mummified in the silt.
Essence was found by Sean Fank, when that conducted works on the mine of Millenium not far from the fort Poppy-Murray in north Albert, in Canada, on March 21, 2011.
According to the communications of the colleagues of museum, this is well preserved tireofor itself in the world, together with the skin and armor, and it is entire, from the snout to the femoral bones.
On the average these essences reached the approximately 18 feet (five meters) into the length and they weighed to 3000 pounds (1300 kilograms).
Their characteristic feature were two dvadtsatidyuymovykh shafts, that come out from the arms.
Researchers assume that this herbivorous tireofor heavily stepped on the fact that is now Canada, until the spilled river takes away it to the open sea.
But the underwater burial of dinosaur preserved its armor with an accuracy to the smallest components.
The petrified remains of this concrete copy so were preserved well that the remainders of the skin, until now, cover uneven armored plates along the skull of dinosaur.
As wrote Mikhael Greshko in the article for the periodical of National Geographic, this degree of safety “was rare as gain into the lottery”.
The longer I at it look, the more striking he seemed.
The petrified remainders of the skin, until now, cover the uneven armored plates, which cover the skull of animal.
Its right nose wheel strut is elongated along the side, five it is finger on it they are turned upward.
I can compute fish-scales on his sole”.
To Mihail Saakashvili succeeded in arriving in Poland without the documents
Mihail Saakashvili, who earlier headed Georgia, and then Odessa region in the Ukraine, arrived flying to Poland.
In this case it made this, without having documents, which confirm its personality and citizenship.
About Saakashvili's arrival reports the Polish publication of Telewizja Republika, which placed on its channel in YouTube of video with its appearance.
Saakashvili appeared on the measure in the honor of the anniversary of Warsaw uprising against the Hitler troops in 1944.
Since the politician does not know Polish, although he attempted to begin speech in this language, for it was necessary to speak in the English through the Polish translator.
During his speech the politician touched the theme of the collaboration of Georgia with Poland, and also he spoke about Ukraine.
About the fact that the migratory service of Ukraine deprived its citizenship, disgraced politician learned, being located in the USA.
As precisely he succeeded in completing transatlantic flight without the documents, until it is unknown.
The previously former governor of Odessa region Mihail Saakashvili stated that his signature on the form for obtaining the citizenship of Ukraine was counterfeited.
Politician emphasized that he filled no forms.
The period of the consequence on business of Vaynzikhera and Olkhovika is prolonged until January
The period of the preliminary consequence on business of the co-owner of the group of the companies “Renova” of Yevgeny Olkhovik and head of energy holding company “T plus” Boris Vaynzikher is prolonged until January 2, 2018.
On Thursday August 3, in the Basmanny court is examined a question about the prolongation by that accused of the house arrest.
The representative of SK (Investigative Committee) at the session reported the solution to the last time prolong the period of preliminary consequence.
“Special complexity and duration of consequence is caused by the need for withdrawal and conducting the examination of the large number of documents, and also conducting of investigation actions in the territory of several subjects RF”, stated inspector.
It added that those suspected regularly gave bribes to management by the Komi.
Their overall size is evaluated in not less than billion rubles.
According to the data of consequence, Vaynzikher, Olkhovik, and the also former leader of a privately held company “integrated power systems” Mikhail Slobodin, who until September 5 headed company “VimpleCom”, transferred to the senior officials of the republic of the Komi bribes for establishment of maximally advantageous tariffs on the thermal and electric power, and also for the creation of favorable conditions for the business.
Vaynzikher and Olkhovik were detained, transported under guard into Syktyvkar and they were arrested for two months, Slobodin was hidden from the consequence and it was declared in the federal search.
As one activist learned answer to a question “whose streets?”
On August 9, 2014 Brittani Ferrel was shaken very deeply.
Only day later after arrival into New York within the framework of the tourist trip the native of Saint-Louis sat on the bed in the apartment, leased through Airbnb, examining the tape of Facebook on the telephone.
It encountered the post of someone of the secondary school.
There it was said: “Policemen recently killed a eighteen-year old child, and it still lies among the street”.
After focusing attention on the fact that is more no one of its tape not of zapostil this information, puzzled, it shut Facebook and opened Twitter.
In its tape there were many perepostov of user nikom of @TheePharoah.
Rapper from large Saint-Louis in the regime of real time illuminated in Twitter death of Michael Brown, unarmed black eighteen-year-old young forest, killed by the white officer of the police in Ferguson, the state of Missouri.
It published the photograph of the lifeless body of Brown, stretched out among the street, where it will be located four hours.
“This is savagery”, thought Ferrel.
But death was not something new for it and its circle.
It put off telephone, and more lately in the evening it returned to the tweets about the fact that people are gathered on Kenfild-drive.
There were there the photographs of signal tape and shouting people and person, who asserted that he is the father of Brown, who held poster with the words: “Policeman from Ferguson recently killed my unarmed son!”
It looked straight translation, as the officer of the police it stands before the group of those protesting with the layushchey dog.
Another policeman, it described on other video, mounted the cock of rifle and began to bawl: “I all you will kill… animals!”
“This is nonstandard situation”, on its own to memories, said then Ferrel.
“These are not such murder as is those, to which we became accustomed and which we can name typical.
At that moment I felt a chill.
I was angered and cried”.
It took ticket for the reverse voyage and it flew away home next day.
After landing in 11 in the evening, it took away its six-year-old daughter from the house of her father and solved, that they both will leave in Ferguson for the following morning.
That did occur from Ferrel and with Ferguson in following the almost three years, did become the theme of new documentary film “whose streets? ”, which will leave on the screens on August 11.
This is story about the survival and protest, about the love and loss, force and durability from the point of view of people, which live in the association and filled streets, requiring answers.
Thus far Ferrel went in Ferguson with the daughter, dressed in the dress into the flower and Viennese under the color, they recalled the conversation, which they conducted until this morning a countless quantity of times, “about the experience of black and about their position”.
It recalls, as she said: “You do remember, as I did tell you about how for Blacks it was necessary to fight for that, in that they did believe?
We now will go in Ferguson, because policeman killed a eighteen-year old boy, and this was incorrectly”.
“I could not but take it”, said Ferrel more lately.
“That which occurs today – this is the culmination of that… which occurred earlier.
It must know about this, see this and bring up on this.
It must not only well examine activism and organization, but also understand the different levels of the experience of black and their position and that we must make in order to become free in order to be freed.
Even if me succeeds in ensuring with it the medium, in which it itself personally will not encounter obvious racism, it differs in no way from any other black girl.
I feel, that she would show to it poor service, if it would fence in it from this”.
When they arrived in Ferguson, the first stoppage they made to Saut-Florissant-Roud, on the area, located through the road from the police station, which became something like the tent camp, until activists waited communications about total neobvinenii of officer Derrena Wilson
There Ferrel with the daughter were joined to the local owner, who prepared lunch-packets.
They collected packets and they helped to give their to those protesting out.
In the consciousness of Ferrel gradually found form the new type of activism.
“My activism completely changed after August 9”, she said, after noting that being the student of university Missouri-Saint-Louis, it was the President of the association of student-medical orderlies, representatives of national minorities, and it was occupied by food justice and inequality in the region of health among the black associations.
“I did not have the experience of organizer.
This arrived auto”.
Through several weeks at the evening demonstration of Ferrel was introduced from Sabaa Folayan, by one of its co-producers.
Folayan said that she and its chief operator Lukas Alvarado-Ferrer “simply wanted to zadokumentirovat” event.
Ferrel came to mind the question: “You want to zadokumentirovat, or you attempt to find the history, on which it is possible to play?”
This skepticism was blown by numerous people, frequently white, who arrived into the association for the purpose to extract benefit from its pain and durabilities.
As it explained in the recent interview of Folayan, “we heard, that the voices of people, which were born and grew in Ferguson, do not fall to the center stage, and they wanted to make this otherwise”.
Folayan up to that moment has already been combined with its co-producer Deymonom by Davis, local artist, noted for his activism on questions of those sentenced to capital punishment.
Its participation woke up sympathy to the project in Ferrel and in six more local residents, with whom the command of project “whose streets?” was supported connection for the years, which passed after Brown's murder.
“In this documentary film not someone speaks for us or to us, this we themselves speak”, said Davis.
“This was for me very important, as these people will be represented, because this that, as will be represented I myself”.
And although the purpose of project it was completely to not be focused on the experience of Ferrel – in the tendency to show that the motion “is this not about the leader-rescuer, but about how is united association”, as said Folayan - it proved to be most open from participants in the film.
As a result into “whose streets?” are shown the unexpectedly personal aspects of the life of Ferrel, for example, that, as it fell in love itself and concluded marriage with its wife.
“I felt itself naked”, said Ferrel, with the laughter telling about how the first time saw finished product.
“But I understood, that when you make this work and you ochelovechivaesh black, must be a certain level of vulnerability”.
Furthermore, the history of Ferrel again discusses and accentuates the role of black homosexual woman in the wider context of motion “the life of black it has a value”.
Two of three founders of motion – those, who created the tag of #BlackLivesMatter in the social networks after the murder of the black adolescent of Treyvona of Martin in 2012 - add themselves to the homosexuals.
“Black homosexual women at the leading positions support all this motion, says Ferrel. – A all because we constantly battle at several fronts.
For black homosexual women it is necessary to bear all this burden”.
Folayan agreed with this assertion, after noting that “the motion, in reality, is supported by black women and many homosexual black women”.
Nevertheless, it insists on what “this is not the case of positive discrimination”, and that Ferrel was not selected by the central character of film because of its distinctive special features.
“It was that person, who woke up this energy”, she said.
“From the other side, this is not agreement, that it proved to be first and foremost, because when”
It is possible to feel its energy through the screen”.
Meanwhile in Ferguson already long ago there are no movie cameras, but remain the complex racial connections between the association and police.
Ferrel two more and one-half of year will be during the qualifying period for the overlap highway during the demonstration.
It describes the sociopolitical atmosphere of place, which is called house, it is simple: “Mess”.
It still is held for rechevku, which it learned, when it left to the streets of Ferguson of complete three years ago.
We must battle for our freedom.
We must defeat.
We must love and support each other.
To us something to lose, besides our chains”.

Appearance of the similarity: artist creates portraits with the aid of DNA of Chelsea Menning
In the center of hall in the gallery of Friedman in New York from the ceiling on the wire overhang faces of people - white, black and brown, all by something elusively similar to each other.
These 30 portraits were created by artist Dewey-Kharborg Khizer from the smears from the cheek and trimmings of hair, sent by it Chelsea Menning.
Menning sent trimmings from the prison the fort-Levenvort, wherever intelligence analyst departs 35-year period for the famous transfer of confidential diplomatic telegrams on the site of WikiLeaks.
The new exhibition, okryvshayasya on August 2, is called “the appearance of similarity”.
This is the result of the two-year-old correspondence between Dewey-Kharborg, whose art unites technology, information theory and art, and Menning, under woman-transsexual and by famous dissidentkoy, by which Barack Obama softened the sentence only in three days to the end of his presidency.
Analyzing with the aid of the computer program DNA, obtained from Menning, and using it for creating the three-dimensional portraits of those, who could have the people with this genome, by Dewey-Kharborg created the deep, although difficult for the perception manifesto, dedicated not only to the plasticity of the data of DNA - for different ways of their interpretation and to the ingerentnomu determinism of these interpretations, but also to the concept of identity.
Menning, which was originated with the name of Bradley Edward, but with the teenage period openly spoke that itself is considered woman, it was in 2013 sentenced on 20 episodes, including six disturbances of the report about espionage, computer swindle and theft.
Its photographs in the prison were inaccessible, so that its only one photograph was known: the grainy black-white of selfi, on which Menning in platinum nuance wig, clearly feeling itself uncomfortably, sits at the control of machine; they began to associate with its this photograph.
In 2015 Dewey-Kharborg with the great success completed its project of 2012 “of the visions of strangers”.
In it the artist created the portraits of unknown people with the aid of judicial evidence of the type of cigarette-butts and chewing gum, separating from this garbage DNA and creating the means of that how these people they could appear.
And then it obtained electronic letter from Paper Magazine.
“They took the interview in Chelsea of Menning in the prison and they wanted any portrait in order to illustrate article”, explained Dewey-Khagborg on the preliminary showing of new exhibition for the press.
Could not be attended and photographed at that time of Chelsea; therefore they were connected with it and asked, she does not want to obtain the portrait, created from its DNA.
Thus uncommon artist and its sitting in the prison Muza of steel by friends on the correspondence exchanged several letters for a period of two years.
They even wrote the book of the comics “depressed means”, illustrated of Shoili Kanungo, which depicted, as in the future the President will soften the punishment of Chelsea and that will be able to visit exhibition personally.
That that Obama actually decided to free Menning in all after several days afterward the outputs of the book into the light, it proved to be pleasant surprise after seven heavy years in the military prison in Kansas.
There is something deep and strong and in the fact that the exhibition is opened precisely now, when Donald Tramp declares war to people, which reveal secret information in the government, and develops the new ways to kindle in Twitter enmity, which he is called to soften.
When Dewey-Kharborg they asked about the agreement of this entire in the time, she said that “randomly nothing it occurs”.
In statement of artist, written on the wall Galerius, the enormous signature of Menning below (serdechkom instead of the point above “i” in its surname) calls to put an end “automatic separation on the basis of gender, race, sexual orientation and culture”.
On the opposite side - its mitochondrial DNA, long caterpillar from those extracted by pencil C, G and A.
After including 200 letters (or nucleotides, as scientifically izyskanno expresses herself artist), Dewey-Kharborg hoped to show, as we all are amazingly similar, in any case according to our biological structure.
“I hope to explain to people that our genome does not determine how we is, to what extent genetic data for the interpretation are opened and how it is subjective”, it said Dewey-Kharborg; its videorabota of 2007 “false memories” is also put out here.
“The data of DNA can describe to us very many different histories, and 30 of these histories here”.
The last part of the exposure, which was accomodated in one room, this is the mentioned above novel in the comics.
On it Menning in the style King-Konga appears above the building of correctional barracks of the USA with the loudspeaker in the hand.
“If they kill your speech, they will defeat”, it is written there.
“Therefore never become silent”.
“This is straight quotation from the letter, which it to me wrote”, says artist, who greets us from Philadelphia.
“In me still ant on the skin, when I about this speak”.
Menning yet it did not see exhibition personally - as this was providcheski represented in the comics, but when it will arrive, it they will greet masks in the center of room, its own genomic simulyakry, which were collected, as if the crowd of those protesting.
This also sdelanno is intended as everything at the exhibition up to the height (5 " 2, an increase in Menning), at which pencil drew genetic haplos-group.
“Earlier I would hang up them on the walls, but it now me wanted they to look like the crowd of people”, speaks Dewey-Kharborg about the portraits.
“I wanted they to be similar to the mass motion, which was formed around Chelsea as the motion, which stood also after its release”.
Professor Severo-Zapadnogo university and colleague Oksfordskogo university searches for the police for charge in the murder
According to the communication to the police, goes the general national round-up to professor Severo-Zapadnogo of university and colleague Oksfordskogo university, which they search for as those suspected in connection with this that of the luxurious number in Chicago it was found the stabbed to death person.

In October passage in the Ekaterinburg metro can be paid by bank map, stated the director general of PLC [Public Limited Company] “And-network” Pavel Vedernikov in the interview “provincial newspaper”.
Our purpose - to introduce to the World Cup of 2018 the same system of the payment of passage in the metro and in other large cities: To Moscow, St. Petersburg, Nizhniy Novgorod and Novosibirsk.

The startups, which will help your company not to become next “Uberom”
By Eymi Errett wanted to estimate the level of satisfactoriness among the colleagues of its startup in the region of electronic trade, but interrogations did not work.
Answers were frequently diffuse, useless or, which is worse, insincere.
And even in spite of the fact that it promised anonymity, some colleagues did not entrust to this process.
“It never was sequential and objective”, described Errett, which controls the located in San Francisco company of 75 people “Madison of Reed”, occupied electronic trade in the region of maintenance of hair.
Therefore it turned to the third persons for help.
Now appears the new form of startups in the sphere of the works with the personnel, which help companies to explain, as their colleagues feel themselves.
Developing and licensing software, designation of which is the measurement of the engagement of colleagues, they make possible for companies to make Exspress-oprosy, to turn to the specific commands and demographic groups, to propose to colleagues anonymity and goryachii of line for the complaints, and to in certain cases make possible for informants to pass top-management and to turn directly to the board.
“Now is such tools as Strava and Fitbit for monitoring of health, and where Fitbit for your company?” - says Jim Barnett, co-founder and President of startup “Glint” from Redwood-City, whose analytical programs are used by companies for measuring the engagement of colleagues.
Errett described that it reached the larger understanding of the fact that think and feel its colleagues in three years of the use “of Glint”.
In addition to Exspress-oprosam and to the forms of the specific commands the product proposes the thermal map of company and it shows in the visual form, in what subdivisions more than complaints and what managers have the low rating of approval, which makes possible for it to be investigated, why.
Companies gradually realize, that they should control situation at the job, otherwise they will become next “Uberom”, which proved to be mixed in the scandal, if colleague published post in the blog, in which he described the aggressive situation, in which those, who expressed dissatisfaction, they punished.
For such startups as “Glint”, this desire to control situation - opportunity for the profitable business.
According to the estimations of Internet portal “give let us have a talk about the payment”, dedicated to financial technologies, the industry of global control, regulation and correspondence by 2020 can cost more than 118.7 billion of dollars.
The startup “of Convercent” from Denver, the state of Colorado, which helps to companies to prevent and to reveal poor behavior, noted a small increase in the interest and activity earlier in this year against the background of a drop in the reputation “of Ubera”.
In “Convercent” of the almost 600 clients, including “of Airbnb”, “Microsoft” and “Tesla”.
Recently among the clients appeared “Uber”.
Like “Glint”, “Convercent” make possible for companies to send the executed on the individual order surveys of the opinion of personnel, to gather the confidential answers in the regime of real time and to examine the thermal maps of problematic zones.
It also allows the hot line for the anonymous text messages, which makes possible for colleagues to report about the poor behavior.
But if top manager is touched upon, complaints go on directly into the board.
“The court of public opinion intercepted authority in inspectors”, said Patrick Kvinlan, the founder and President of company “Convercent”.
If it is explained, that the company badly turns with the colleagues or behaves immorally, even if inspectors do not interfere, company can collide with the expensive consequences in the form of the boycotts from the side of clients, draining of colleagues and legal actions, reported Kvinlan.
“Ruby Tuesday”, the network of the restaurants, where in 500 institutions more than 25000 colleagues work, used “Convercent” more than a year in order to be convinced of the fact that colleagues in the course of rules and procedures, and to propose the simple method to turn into the head office of company.
It is earlier, if colleague wanted to report problem, to him or it was necessary to search for number of telephone or mail of head office, to give official complaint and to hope that they will relate seriously to it.
Frequently this was the frightening and awkward experience, reported James Vitrano, the chief of the juridical administration of company “Ruby Tuesday”, which said that there was no normal method to track the complaints of colleagues.
Now, when company uses service “Convercent”, the problems, which earlier were hidden from the managers, who sit in the offices in other cities or states – such, as discrimination, kharassment and the wrong remuneration for labor – it is possible more rapidly to reveal and to study by them.
“I can approach the integral, comprehensive understanding of the situation of colleagues”, said Vitrano, which leads the group of the risk management of network “Ruby Tuesday”.
“And we protect our shareholders from the legal proceedings with the colleagues”.
According to Kvinlanda, company they began more seriously to relate to the ethics, values and engagement of colleagues in 2002, after accounting firm “Arthur Andersen” suffered crash because of the ethical disturbances as a result of “the affairs of Enron”.
But only when “social networks received mass propagation”, companies they realized, that they cannot hold their dirty linen from the virus propagation in the network.
“Before beginning to use technologies for the control of the ethics people used hope as strategy”, he said.
And “Glint”, and “Convercent” propose their software as the service, vzymaya from the companies regular pay for the use of their products.
These are business-model and the opportunity, which received the approval of the venture investors, who supported both startups.
In February “Convercent” obtained financing in the size of 10 million dollars from such firms, as “Sapphire Ventures” and “Tola Capital”, as a result of which general capital of company reached 47 million dollars.
“Glint” obtained 10 million dollars in November from “Bessemer of Venture Partners”, as a result of which general capital of company it was 60 million dollars.
These investments are hardly surprising, if we consider interconnected nature of companies, culture and venture capital.
The growing volume of studies demonstrates, that today's colleagues expect from their jobs more than this was earlier.
On the markets with the rigid competition, such as Silicon Valley, high wages and interesting projects – this is the only necessary minimum.
Colleagues want to perceive that they assume and value them, and that they devote their time of company with the positive mission.
“When people are happy to work in the company, they feel, that them they hear, and that the work, which they carry out, brings result, they more greatly try to make this company of successful”, says Nina Makkuin, Vice President for the global privileges and satisfaction of colleagues in the company “LinkedIn”, where are used “Convercent”, and “Glint”.
Investors derive revenues, when the matters in companies from their briefcase go well; the matters in companies go well, when the colleagues of predanny are implicated.
If the analytical tools of the third side promise to increase devotion and engagement of colleagues, then it is not surprising that they find support.
As specialists in the culture at the jobs assert, it is important to possess the data about the engagement of colleagues.
But the data are useless, until the trustees of company take measure.
In reality, if company requests colleagues about the feedback, it can create impression, that approach the changes.
And if changes do not begin sufficiently rapidly, or they will not begin completely, can develop disappointment, and colleagues will lose interest.
“If you intend to request about 4000 proposals, you must be ready to conduct 4000 conversations”, says Russell Rat, the President for consultation in the administrative firm “Kotter International”, for which it was necessary to see, as companies they accomplish error, too relying on data collection.
“Because, if you do not go to the end, colleagues will guess: “You me truth did hear?
To you not nevertheless?
But if to you nevertheless, why to me there must not be nevertheless?”
According to Errett, the company “Madison of Reed”, which now carries out the monthly interrogations of colleagues, in the state to take measures during the same day, when someone reports about the problem with the aid of “Glint”.
And, after the collection of feedback from the colleagues, dissatisfied with the go no-go speed and by the quality of communication, it could reorganize several commands within the limits of company and introduce training on the communication in order to solve problems.
Company “Ruby Tuesday” obtains new knowledge about its colleagues and hopes that in the long-term outlook these knowledge will help it to more effectively retain colleagues in the branch, noted for the deep flow of personnel.
“If you do not try to create the culture of transparency, you will lose people”, said Vitrano.
If you lose people, you lose clients.
But if you lose clients, you lose companies.
In Barnaul they reveal new asphalt on the avenue Red Army
In Barnaul took cardinal measures for the elimination of the reason for failures of asphalt on the avenue Red Army.
The place, where twice appeared pits on the recently asphalted roadway (intersection with the street youth), is decided “to reveal”.
Let us recall, caving the small section of road near the tramroads occurred because the earth in the region of unowned unexploited network sagged.
According to the deputy chairman of urban committee on road economy, improvement, transport and connection of Ivan Garmat, for the detailed inspection and liquidation of prerequisites for the caving will be conducted detailed inspection.
Depending on its results, will be accepted the necessary measures.
It is assumed that the restoration of the planking of unowned communication and their concreting will be required.
About this it communicates on the official site of the boundary capital.
For the command of Bryuinz it is necessary to be occupied longer because the national student sport association cancelled trainings twice during the day
Time approaches eleven in the evening; the crowd of football players from the University of California to Los Angeles stays in order to chat on one side of new training pour on commands, located on the campus.
Some of them tightened its sports shirts, after baring the spins, which shine from the perspiration after the stressed first day of sport camp.
For many players of command these minutes of idleness compose interruption in the middle of day.
Players, recorded to the summer lessons, after three-hour training will leave conversely on the hostels in order to be prepared for the final examinations, and to the following morning they will return to the football center of Wasserman to the meetings in 6:30.
Not long before that how Monday it was converted on Tuesday, the trainer of the command of Jim Moore's Bryuinz said: “During the following three days of these children waits meat grinder”.
That that the national student sport association cancelled trainings twice during the day, which was devised in order to decrease the load for the players, in reality lengthened their workday – at least to the end of examinations on Friday.
Therefore the beginning of the first three trainings of the command of the University of California in Los Angeles was assigned to 7:15 the evenings so that they would be placed in even without that the dense timetable of players.
The larger number of days with one training became side effect from the absence of two trainings during the day, and Bryuinz moves the beginning of camp almost to the week in comparison with last year and are conducted trainings during the summer school for the first time in six seasons Moores in Vestvude.
According to timetable, for them one must conducting 18 trainings until August 20 inclusively before beginning official preparation for the first game in the season against the command of the University of Texas A&M in September.
Moore he said that is supported a change in the rules from the side of national student sport association, in spite of the fact that one additional point appeared because of it in the dense timetable of players.
“During three or four days we give to them this enormous load, this serious testing”, it said Moore.
“And they simply it overcame, they work, they remarkable children.
I think that when we will live until Saturday and we will have more than time, this will be actually healthily”.
When camp ends, the University of California in Los Angeles will make by those closed; this is difficult task, since its fields are found in the straight visibility from adjacent parking and from the adjacent “Laskin-center”, expensive hotel, which already underwent the bombing with the football balls, which overcame suppressor grid after the gates.
Players from “Bryuinz” must occupy hotel beginning from these output, but Moore it assumes that when the rooms will be free during the season, can arise problem.
“We will have protection”, it reported Moore.
“This is serious problem, and I do not exaggerate danger, assuming that someone can remove room, sit there and write training on video.
If you have a video recording of training, this is very serious.
But protection will be there and there will be protection on parking number 8.
We will do everything that we can with the fact that we have.
I will not too because of this survive.
We have a plan”.

Facebook strengthens fact-cheking in the fight against the feykovykh news
Facebook will more frequently send the texts, suspicious on the mystification, to the independent experts, and show their conclusions under the original posts, stated on Thursday the largest social network of peace, which attempts to fight with the so-called feykovymi news.
In the statement on its Web site the company stated that it begins to use the improved algorithms of machine instruction in order to recognize possible mystification, to send them to the checking and to, possibly, show results fact-chekinga under the initial post.
Facebook underwent criticism as one of the main ways of the propagation of the so-called feykovykh news, which, in the opinion of many, had an effect on the presidential elections of 2016 in the USA.
This a question also actively debates in Europe after French voters were misled by deceitful communications before the presidential elections in May, and in Germany before September elections they stated about the support of plan to fine social networks, if those will not operationally move away the posts, which kindle hatred.
On Thursday in the separate statement in the German language of Facebook reported testing of new algorithm the fact-chekinga, which was neglected in the USA, France, Netherlands and Germany.
“Furthermore in order to see, what communications are disputed independent by those checking, people want to have wider context in order to carry the substantiated judgments about the fact that they read and how they share”, it wrote in its block Sara Sue, the manager of the tape of the news of Facebook.
It added that Facebook will continue to test the function “connected articles” and to work at other changes in the tape of the news in order to solve the problem of the feykovykh news.
To create the novel-comics: One soaked in the English history
Tiny recently soaked Skotni was taken in musical video “of Squeeze”, and in the 70th and 80's it served as refuge for Margaret Thatcher.
But 700 years from its comfortable place in the valley of the river of Beulah in the county Kent it controlled stormy history all around, and now inspired by Dzheymi Rodsa, yorkshirtsa with the shock of hair and with the tendency toward the historical sources, to the novel-comics.
“Me it seems, this so is beautiful - to look at the handwriting of man, who died 300 years ago”, with enthusiasm he speaks.
“You feel this so personally, when you hold this letter in the hand”.
“Lock in England” covers period from the Middle Ages to the evardianskoy epoch and says about family, which lived in Skotni; each history illustrated one of the young British artists - Isaac of Lenkevich, Brayoni Mey Smith, William Ex-whether, Becky Palmer and Izabel Greenberg.
This is not first book of Rodsa, which is based on archive data: in 2014 it wrote “the teeth of dead person and another stories” - the collection based on materials of the documents of British library; this project unexpectedly touched it very deeply.
“Me it could move simply the imprint of finger on the edge of the letter, written in 1700-e years by the dual agent, which worked on Jacobin”, he says.
“This is the imprint of its finger”
And letters always smell of smoke, because in those times for the illumination they ignited fire.
And in 300 years, in the future, it seems you that you also there.
Ah, as I love archives!”
For the person, enveloped by this passion to old paper, to obtain support from the national fund and English art criticism council and to live in the lock four months (“honestly speaking, I it a little stayed too long there”) it seems too well in order to be truth.
Rods by entire days studied “new” Victorian lock, it walked on the archives and were examined the numerous treasures of estate and ancient things - for example, head of hyenas on the walls or bottle, century lain in to ditch.
It walked on the park and along the ruins of old lock, he talked with the foresters, gardeners and sometimes with the artists, who worked at illustrations to its book.
Then at night it “drank whisky and sat down to write”.
The history of the lock of Skotni is not very studied, because national fund obtained complete access to it only in 2006, when died last successor, Elizabeth Hussey.
When in ten years there arrived Rods, colleagues only began to be investigated with the archive, which it describes as “that the aristocrats by centuries fell down to the garret”.
Diaries, the letter of the times of the Britain empire, the maps, which show, who how managed: “You think that the land disputes are dull, says Rods, but here for this birch struggled two families.
It occurs and so, children!”
In some histories of collector it soaked it becomes starting point for the wider searches in the English history: for example, in “the worker”, hero departs from the recently constructed lock in order to be joined to peasant revolution of 1381.
“There is information about the riot, which occurred in the lock in 1380, in the book, named “the knightly families of Kent and Sasseksa”, says Rods.
“Peasant uprising began in these places, and I thought that riot - this is the suitable beginning.
It can be, they were connected?”
Other subjects are strongly connected with the history of lock - for example, “priest”, in whom it is told about the priest-Jesuit, whom the family of Darrelov of seven years hid in itself during the English reformation.
Or “smuggler”, about the smuggler of XVIII Arthur Darrel's century, who, as assumed, staged its own burials, after crowding coffin by the stones (this was discovered through several years, when coffin they dug up).
Darrely - the dear family of Rodsa of all, that populated Skotni: “Gentlemen, it seems, they were perfect zhulem, eternally they got in into the debts and spent money on the fact that they could not afford.
In the different generations of man-Darrely their problems with the debts decided, being married the rich elderly women - I present them to themselves as the company of likable fellows, who know how to handle the successors of large states”.
After the end of work in the lock of Rods it searches for other opportunities to obtain unique writer experience.
It lived two weeks in the Finnish wilderness, where it wrote graphic short story about Elyamyanmyaki - the place, where at the beginning of XX century there was sanatorium, and then it was again overgrown with forest.
But Skotni it remains for it special place.
“To me sad it was to leave”, he says.
“I felt itself approximately thus: the features of poberi, I again should return to the real life”.
Fifteen largest banks select “Russia”
Conflict in the association of Russian banks (ARB) is developed: following Sberbank [Savings Bank], VTB [VTB Bank], VTB 24 [VTB Bank], Alpha--bank, Gazprombankom, Rosselkhozbankom, Binbankom and FC [Financial Corporation] “discovery”, seven additional credit organizations are collected to leave this public organization.
Thus in the share left organizations of left of ARB it will be not less than 80 percent of market.
But this not is not simple output - all banks, which stated about the break with ARB, Veduta negotiations with another public organization, which unites credit establishments, by the association of regional banks “Russia”, which heads the well-known politician Anatoly Aksakov, the chairman of the committee of the State Duma on the financial market, acknowledged, by the way, on the sums of last session and by the most effective leader of Duma committee and by deputy on a quantity of prepared bills.
The beginning of conflict inside ARB was established in the course of discussion in the Federation Council, when on the interregional bank council were examined the new bills, in particular, which assume the new classification of banks depending on the dimensions of regulation capital.
Then Garegin Tosunyan, the President ARB, stated that, in the opinion of the association, this bill starts in the interests of the largest banks, which thus attempt to limit the opportunities of small and average banks in the regions, intercepting their clientele.
Among other claims sounded the criticism in the address of the central bank, which, on Tosunyana thought, does not always justified carry out the opinion of licenses in some banks, on that the objection from the side of the representative of TsB, true, followed: many leaders of the proshtrafivshikhsya banks, in particular, Vneshprombanka, entered into the leading organs ARB.
Apparently, this exchange of the conflicting opinions in bank medium the very sensitive to the relations with the main regulator became the visible occasion so that fifteen largest banks, after stating disagreement with the policy ARB, would begin to be prepared for the entry into the association “Russia”, after noting that “the effectiveness of work ARB nakhoidtsya at the low level, but constructive dialogue inside the bank association actually is not conducted”.
To depositors it will be better
How the matter it will end?
Let us answer immediately the chief problem, which appears with the least failure or conflict in the bank sphere or next to it: to depositors nothing it threatens, faster, on the contrary, the reliability of banking system will increase.
Heads “Russia” Anatoly Aksakov, noted for his punctiliousness in everything the volume concerning the interests of banks and their clients, the professional of the high level, which they highly value in the central bank: practically entire management TsB is present on the yearly measures of association, and all significant legislation initiatives of regulator penetrate the expert estimations “of Regionals”.
In the personnel-organizational plan, obviously, also of special shakings it will not foresee.
It is indisputable, ARB falls into complex financial-administrative situation after it will be deprived of such powerful and influential participants with their payments and lobbying opportunities.
However, in this oldest - it is founded in 1991 - the organizations, which defends the interests of bank association, exist big enough potential in order to continue to improve bank legislation and sphere of money and credit rotation as a whole.
It cannot be said that also in the association “Russia” with the stretched out embraces they are prepared to accept for any conditions of new members, judging by the reaction of its leader, Anatoly Aksakova (“it can, too much they will want”), who already on July 21 at the briefing in the press center of parliamentary newspaper, stated that “literally next day the representatives of the left ARB banks requested me to examine the opportunity to increase the potential of our association “Russia "".
Their proposal - to strengthen the voice of bankers in the council of association, and to also more pay attention to new bank technologies.
Telephone-box process now continues, proposals of both sides are studied, the agenda of the extraordinary congress of the associations, which it will pass to Sochi in the middle of September within the framework of the international bank forum, is prepared.
There and let us be determined.
Also Anatoly Aksakov, after emphasizing that “for the armchair he is not held”, named the possible new leader of the updated association “Russia” Georgiy Luntovskogo, who leaves in September the post of the deputy chairman Tsentrobanka, having highly described his business and human qualities.
On August 18 Anatoly Aksakov, who now rests in the Crimea, plans on one day to interrupt vacation and to arrive in Moscow, to the emergency meeting of the council of association “Russia”, where it is planned to examine a question about the agenda of the extraordinary congress “of Russia”.
The entrance of machines with the gasoline engine into the large cities of Russia will not be limited
The deputy of the head of the Ministry of Transportation Nikolai Asaul stated that, in spite of the communications media outlets, the entrance of machines with the gasoline engine into the large cities of Russia will not be thus far limited.
This is more radically form of our concept.
Our concept, that it is necessary to gradually increase ecological class.
But there concept immediately to pass to the zero ejections.
I consider that technically we for this are not ready.
Question indeed still: from what year?
The same this at the level of slogans phrase - give let us forbid.
Where and when?
Tomorrow?
Entire city let us shut?
“In 20 years - I do not know perhaps this and it will occur”, it gives “Prime” of the word of minister.
The previously newspaper “Izvestiya” reported that by August 17 to Vice-Premier Arkady Dvorkovich it is charged to study the proposals about the possible versions of gospodderzhki of electrical transport, presented into the government by director general PAO KamAZ (Kama Automobile Plant) by Sergey Kogoginym.
Among the proposals, according to the information of newspaper, the use of machines with DVS in the large cities and at the health resorts.

The appearance of sex-robots is actual, and this must us disturb
We did not have time to think that 2017 no longer can become worse, left new report about the technological successes in the production of sex-robots.
Mda.
Sex-robots now in the center stage.
The fund for critical robot technology (FRR) released recently the report, dedicated to the development of sex-robots into the next 5-10 years.
In the opinion of Noel Sharkey, Honored Professor of robot technology and artificial intelligence of the university of Sheffield and co-founder of FRR, we must relate to their appearance seriously.
Users can select the color of the eyes of robots, form of nipples and type of nails.
“People giggle in regard to this, but firms already in large quantities are sent to their users, and soon we will see them much more”, said Sharkey at the presentation of new report.
Contemporary sex-dolls evolved from their pneumatic fellows in robots with the silicone skin, warm by feel the touch, and with the almost human remarks, which artificial intelligence governs.
Users can also “tune” their robots on their taste, selecting everything from the color of eyes and form of the nipples of robot to the form and colors of nails.
But that many robots have “the personality”, in comparison with whom Stepfordskaya wife would seem very progressive, he disturbs still stronger.
Contemporary sex-dolls became robots with the silicone skin.
For example, firm “RealBotix robot” they make possible for users to tune in the robots of the qualities, which they find attractive, for example, shyness.
Are other sex-robots of Roxxxy Gold, developed “True Companion”, which are supplied with the already programmed individuality - for example “cold of Farr” is produced the impression of shy, and “wild Wendy” possesses “daring” nature.
“Roxxxy Gold has the nature, which wonderfully approaches your”, enthusiastically reports site “True Companion”.
Therefore it loves that the fact that you love, does not love that, what you do not love, and so on.
In it changes the mood during the day as in real person!
It can want to sleep either to stir or it can “be in the mood”!”
In the appearance of sex-robots much cause concern - not lastly because they substitute real human interrelations, but most strongly it disturbs the subordinate means of woman, association with the rape, which cause ovladevanie of cold (read: being resisted) by headlight.
On the site “True Companion” of Roxxxy they compare with the vibrator, only for the men.
“If in woman (sic!) there can be vibrator, why in men there cannot be Roxxxy?” - it is said on the site.
But these sex-robots - not only fetishes or simply new sex-toys.
Their appearance and ever being increased complexity indicates something darker and deeper in our culture, the retreat from the ideal of gender equality to the side of the desire of sex with the subordination as optional additive.
The majorities of men, of course, will not buy sex-robots, and although FRR notes their growing popularity, they thus far remain on the periphery of consumer culture.
But that reaches to us from the periphery, can be very instructively with respect to the senses of the epoch, in which we live.
And many people are not bad and they are not aggressive until the free market opportunity for this gives to them.
This not agreement - that these complex sex-robots appeared precisely when the rights of women around the world proved to be under the threat, when in the White House is situated the President, who praises by the fact that it sticks to the women.
The most terrible in the television series “the story of servant” - not graphic means, the twisted bodies and the pressed eyes, namely the, how this a vision seems realistic.
The republic of Galaad - this exaggeration, but now it does not seem such already large.
The purpose of the industry of sex-robots - to attain this physical similarity to real women (only with the proportions of pornozvezd), what technology allows.
Their creators want so that they would seem by the people by feel the touch so that the motions of human body would copy.
But by precisely their “natures” robots are not similar to the real women.
They cannot break their partners or leave from them.
They do not have not its life, not biography - anything, which could the independence or something other, which could destroy the illusion of complete dependence.
In other words, these are beautiful slaves.
Or as they speak in 2017, servants.
The native of Los Angeles Eugene (it swelled) Dzheter, which since 2013 speaks in favor of the team of Ukraine, will not help our national team on the championship of Europe on the basketball, whose final part starts on August 31.
On this in the interview for the portal of BeBasket reported the general manager “of blue-yellow” Andrey Lebedev.
We attempted to agree with Dzheterom, but, unfortunately, it will not arrive for domestic reasons.
We will go on It evrobasket without the naturalized player, since we do not want to take someone, we do not know whom.
“This situation will make possible for the development of our young players”, he said.
I will remember: with the direct participation of Dzhetera the team of Ukraine occupied sixth place to Evrobaskete-2013 record for itself and for the first time it fell on world championship on the basketball, on which “yellow-dark-blue” could not overcome group stage, but the native of the USA collected on the average for the game of 15.4 points, made 3 selections and returned 5 transfers.
Dzheter ceased to speak in favor of the team of Ukraine from the moment of withdrawal from the post of the head coach of our national team of the American of Mike Fratello, which left this post in 2015.
Man of Evrobasket-2017 will pass simultaneously in four countries: Turkey, Rumania, Israel and Finland.
Ukrainian command its matches of group tournament will conduct on the Earth promised.
Yevgeny Murzin's under wardship in the group B will have five duels: with Germany (on August 31), Italy (on September 2), Georgia (the 3rd), Lithuania (the 5th) and Israel (the 6th).
Within the framework of the preparation for the tournament our men's team conducted two control duels, in which it yielded to the Dutch and Belorussians.
Great exploit of Tramp?
To depict from itself Romney's Mita seems very reasonable
In Tramp's epoch general place became the fact that the political disputes, which polarized American electorate, on the microlevel broke some families.
Between day of gratitude and Christmas American newspapers made gaudy by columns about how to manage the terrible relatives, who vote for Tramp.
It seems, we everything are stressed so that soon let us break.
Families less speak about Tramp's ability to connect.
I write about this because my cousin, left views the poetess from Chicago, who has long ago been on the knives with the Republicans in her family, it arrived in me to New York on this week.
It reminded me that the association in the fight against the general enemy can have strong effect.
During Tramp's lifetime in the White House, everything, whom she knows, including the brother-Republican, with whom she argued about the policy by decades, they proved to be sudden and strange means on one side.
This, undoubtedly, is good after supper; but I cannot but think about the fact that in the wider context this can be sufficiently dangerously.
Tramp inhaled forces into the left flank, but the deforming effect of his administration can us all move to the right.
When we speak about Tramp and “normalization”, we have the improbable opportunity of the fact that once us they will cease to strike his tricks.
There is, however, even the more doubtful scenario, in which Tramp " normalizes” the right-most Republicans, who against the background its standards will unexpectedly seem the model of the common sense.
I caught itself on what greatly I am bored today on the old-fashioned frenzy of Mitt Romney - with the dog on the roof of machine and 14-percent income tax (but we at least knew, as its tax declaration appears) - in comparison with Tramp and that and, etc seems by very small evil.
When Tramp leaves, to the following Republican candidate it will sufficient simply be in its mind so that in it they would see the enormous step forward.
When my cousin went to the center, we went with the children to the roundabout in the central park - largest roundabout in the economy of the department of the parks of New York and the best method in the city to spend three dollars, if caffeine was not necessary to you.
Horses are terrible and enormous, picture from the fiberglass on the central drum - making faces clowns and animals, that, after being bent, in the horror look to themselves at the back, it is extremely ominous, and the ringing music, however it is strange, it leads into the enthusiasm.
So many known things in this city disappoint: forms from the skyscrapers grow antiquated, the silhouettes of buildings too prielis in order to cause trembling, and reality of city does not manage after the dream.
Thirty five years passed, and I still survive that day, when I learned, that region Suiss-cottage - this in reality not Swiss Charles (subject pub “of Ye Olde Swiss Cottage” not on account), but large circular cross-road in North London.
But roundabout in the central park - this is, until now, uncommon, magic place, in which the child of two years, child of eleven years and two women for forty can excellently spend time.
If I could place roundabout estimation, I would place five, but no one about this, fortunately me requested.
But in the department store on this week me they requested before to conduct by card on the terminal, to estimate their “experience” of purchases according to the scale from one to five asterisks.
In the coffee house at the angle of my street entire the same is plus option to accompany estimation by tip into 15 percent - this for the order in counter.
Interaction neutral according to the idea as a result not only slows down, but still and it is necessary to introduce personal relation into the situation, which does not assume it.
Poor salesgirl in the department store skonfuzhenno smiled, until I gets tired was evaluated my experience of the presentation to it of credit card into five stars.

Grigori Leps: “I vomit in the battle, although 55 not 30”
One of the most successful artists of Russian stage Grigori Leps on near Sunday will finish celebrating his 55-anniversary.
Before the celebration the singer met with the reviewer “of Izvestia”.
I remember, as was noted your “fifty kopecks”.
Special tent in “the Luzhniki”, Gloria Geynor sang for the celebrant, the powerful salute above the Moscow River.
You for sure then estimated, seemingly he wanted to conduct his following five-year plan.
Concepts did happen?
If we speak about the profession, this was successful period.
I much worked, he three times passed with the tours entire country, gave on 120-130 concerts per year.
Two not bad albums released.
Certainly, now I no longer that, let us say, 20 years ago.
Biological clock not to deceive.
To sing in the manner that I sang into my 30, becomes everything grow heavy.
Nevertheless I vomit in the battle, I do not want to stop.
But I with the new people, me seems, I leave to another level.
With them you new album write, the first in three years.
Yes, the work on it now occurs.
Strictly, we already everything wrote down in my studio and now let us send it to information into Los Angeles.
Is called it “you what such serious?” on the similar song, which is written together with To timati.
It is not yet completely ready; therefore we did not thus far anywhere lay out it.
Let us make this later, when and clip to it we remove.
But album is represented in November - to a series of my anniversary concerts in the Moscow “Crocus City Hall”.
To your new plate applied hand class American drummer Chris Koulmen.
You, does seem, he did want him and into his theatrical composition to draw?
In my view, Koulmen today one of the most outstanding drummers of peace.
It arrived in me into the studio, were written its parties.
I proposed to it to become part of my group, and Jeremy Kolsonu (well-known drummer, who participates in the different projects. - “Izvestiya”) it proposed.
But for the long running in Russia they advanced, putting it mildly, excessive conditions.
The discussion dealt with the fees from €35.000 to €45.000 per month.
Then I thought that also on the post-Soviet state I will find worthy musicians.
And it found outstanding drummer Max Malysheva.
It is generally better to feed its (it smiles).
At times I want to someone of them to cavil, but don't mention it.
For example, guitarist Fedor Dosumov highly quotes at the international level.
Western musical periodicals write about it, it they invite to different gitarnye festivals.
Steve Vay, after listening to his game, said that “arrived the new generation of guitarists, with another performer technology”.
The album of your is reduced in Los Angeles, American musicians with you do collaborate, but itself you in the USA as before arrive cannot?
You do make the attempts to remove this prohibition?
Now, honestly speaking, nothing I make.
There is a number of the attorneys, who deal with this question.
As to musician to me it is actually sincerely it's a pity, that I cannot arrive in America.
I repeatedly said that there I learn.
The more you associate with the real professionals, the more useful.
We not their toupee, but we do not have this experience, school.
Before our executors of popular music for a period of 70 years those problems, which the American musicians always solved completely were not posed.
They were approached a maximally qualitative sounding.
And I attempt to follow the same principles.
Now for some reason and Great Britain refused to me in the entrance to ten years.
But I nevertheless each year will give documents to the visa into the British embassy so that me they would again permit there to drive and the main thing is there to work.
Remaining Europe to me relates favorably.
And already in August in you is planned concert in Monaco, not custom-made, but lithographic, it is correct?
Yes, in Monte Carlo there is a good hall “of Sporting”, I there already once appeared.
They now invited again, and, as far as to me it is known, all tickets to the concert are already sold off.
On “the rendezvous of Lima to Vaykule”, which will begin on July 20 in Yurmale, you will go?
It invited me, and I, of course, responded.
Lima - remarkable singer and splendid woman, who knows how to give itself by excellent vocals, and even in a whisper.
After tours and anniversary concerts, how I know, you in which once want to turn to Vladimir Visotsky's creation.
Two albums with its songs in your diskografii already exist.
When does leave the third?
Probably, in the following year.
But it will be completely differently made.
I want to write down 80-90 songs of Visotsky order approximately in the same supply, as he made itself.
Only voice and guitar.
No other arrangement.
Accompany to me there will be our well-known musician Timur Vedernikov.
I will try to urge to participate in the album and Alexander Yakovlevicha Rozenbauma.
I with it this theme let out a secret, good relations, but it man of that occupied, so that let us look how it will be formed.
You Boris Grebenshchikov's songs into your repertoire gradually introduced.
Maybe, then and the album of its things you will write down?
Boris Borisovich is excellent person and splendid musician.
I with it several times intersected and asked: it is possible to me to ripen one or another song of him?
It answered: “Grigori, I write songs so that they would be fulfilled”.
If you please, try, sing.
It is probably, interesting and this album to write down.
As yet I do not have a similar task, but in the future, in year-two, if Boris Borisovich will not begin to object, I will, possibly, make this project.
If you are not concentrated completely on the matters of your producer center.
I do assume, until you yet did realize its potential, he did not sign contracts with all artists, who to you were interesting?
There is a whole series of the executors, whom I would dream to have under my wing, but they the independent, taking place themselves people.
You do imply Sergey Lazarev?
Serezha - the bright singer, I him invited.
I can not agree in by something with its repertoire, but it - professional and it has its strategy of development.
But in my center now there is Alexander Panayotov, whom I conducted in “the voice”.
We with it concluded agreement and we work.
In our pop music such singers - rarity.
It will be sincerely it's a pity, if it does not reach those heights, which it is worthy.
I attempt to select to it repertoire, I remove clips.
I hope for a good result.
Also I attempt to move other artists of my center: I buy to them songs, to weeping to poets, sometimes their tracks fall in the rotation of the tele- and of radio channels.
If they will not reach high altitudes, I will nevertheless bring our collaboration to the logical completion.
At the output they will obtain the recorded album, several clips.
But it is further, if they want, they can go by their way, and I will not insist so that they would return money the inserted in them.
Although to me it will be pleasant, if someone of them achieves commercial success and will pay off to me the percentages, about which we negotiated in the contract.
But if this it does not occur, to overlap oxygen no one I am going.
Let all work, they break through, they prove, as once it proved i.
If they do tomorrow to you propose to make a theatrical tour through Ukraine and do guarantee entry into the country, you will go?
They there invite me, until now.
In essence the discussion deals with the closed measures.
But concerning large stage…
I man of my country, Russian, on his own persuasion flew to Syria on that aircraft itself, which then broke.
If they tomorrow say that it is necessary to fly into some other point in the interests of state, I will treat.
And to me to spit, that about me will think the bloggers and other critics.
I sincerely will regret, that this situation came out with Ukraine.
Since I count: we - one people must be together.
I will regret, which such will hardly come out, at least soon.
But earlier I indeed gave in the year in Ukraine on 40-50 concerts.
They met, as nowhere.
Very grateful public.
And he collaborated with several Ukrainian artists: Ani Lorac, by the Svetoy Lobodoy, by Artem Loik…
In the Ukraine the mass of the gifted people, and is sincerely it's a pity, that now they cannot entirely splash out their talent to the wide Russian audience.
Music must unite and entertain people.
I with the pleasure invited any class Ukrainian executor into Russia, for example the glory of Vakarchuka, and made with it joint concert.
But, I think, at the given moment this is highly improbable…
Andrey Okhlopkova they moved from the spaceport
As it became known “"”, the managing director of spaceport eastern Andrey Okhlopkov approached the work in the state space scientific and industrial center (State Research and Production Space Center) of the name of Khrunichev.
Earlier it was de facto occupied by the building of spaceport eastern, but because of the differences with the management of the center of the operation of ground-based and space infrastructure (TSENKI) it was transferred into the enterprise in Moscow Filyakh, where it will study the coordination of production.
Relief Mr. Okhlopkova will not have: the post of technical director, they will most likely, abolish, and they will scatter functional on the subdivisions of TSENKI.
About the fact that the managing director of east and deputy of the director general of TSENKI for technological development Andrey Okhlopkov turned to the work in the State Research and Production Space Center of the name of Khrunichev, “"” described the top managers of several enterprises of the space industry, and also colleague of the apparatus of government.
“It works at the new post already several weeks”, specified collocutors “"” in the branch.
On Thursday it was impossible to obtain the operational commentary of TSENKI, but Mr. himself Okhlopkov for the commentaries was inaccessible.
However, information “"” they officially confirmed in the State Research and Production Space Center.
It made a decision about the passage to the post of director for the coordination of production, they stated at the enterprise. - Andrey Okhlopkov the assigned to it task in the guarantee of the starting minimum for the first starting at the spaceport east completely carried out.
Mr. Okhlopkov passed to the work in TSENKI in 2013, having after the arms a service in the space troops, in particular in Baikonur, and in Plesetsk - at “northern” spaceport it occupied the post of the first deputy of commander in the title of Colonel.
In 2009 Andrey Okhlopkov became the pretender of criminal case.
Consequence accused it of the bribery: allegedly from its supply regional traders obtained for the recoils state orders, but did not carry out the undertaken obligations in the harvesting of the detachable parts of the launch vehicles in the Arkhangyelsk province and republic of the Komi.
In 2012 the judgment of jurors recognized as its innocent.
Responsibilities for technological development entrusted to it in TSENKI applied to different projects, but construction in the spaceport in the Far East became the main things of them.
Headed then federal Space Agency Oleg Ostapenko in the interview “"” directly said that the position of the matters on east “was critical already in October 2013”.
The fact is that during the planning the strategic error was committed: the completion of building and conducting the first start of launch vehicle “Soyuz-2.1” were planned to one and the same period - the end of 2015.
In order to accomplish launching before the end of the year, they decided to complete building to half a year earlier and periods displaced since December in July 2015.
For accelerating the process it was necessary to go to craftiness: the specialists of TSENKI began to conduct parallel assembly of technological equipment on the unfinished objects.
The chief supporter of this idea was Andrey Okhlopkov.
In spite of the existed risks and nevertheless happened transfer (instead of December 2015 " Soyuz " it flew away only on April 28, 2016), this idea justified itself, speaks source “"” at the spaceport: “Otherwise we, until now, carried out not one launching from east, but they would be occupied by building”.
Vice-Premier Dmitriy Rogozin, who treats the creation of spaceport, into the joke called Andrey Okhlopkova by his “space Susanin”, but in it almost always he precisely inquired information about the motion of building.
Was memorized Mr. Okhlopkov and by the straightness: for example, in the interview “"” he proposed to deprive Federal agency for the special building (special-build) of status of only executor on east and directly to work with the subcontractors: “Why we must all eggs add into one basket of special-system?”
This idea found support in the government.
Since 2017 TSENKI took upon itself the responsibilities of general contractor in order to launchings the planned in the fourth quarter to complete construction-assembly works on the launch and technical complex.
According to the data “"”, occasion for passing Mr. Okhlopkov in the new place of work became the differences with the leadership TSENKI relative to the methods of the completion of building construction and complexes of spaceport, and also methods of operation with the subcontractural organizations.
“It was solved, which so will be better for all”, says one of the top managers, of participating in the erection east.
The colleague of the apparatus of government, in turn, calls the solution strange: “He was one of the best specialists, to find to him equivalent replacement will be complex”.
According to the data “"”, this and it will not be required: the post of the technical director of spaceport will be abolished, and its functions will be scattered on the subdivisions of TSENKI.
In the musical schools the training program in two specialties will appear
In the future the students of children's musical schools can obtain two specialties simultaneously.
According to the deputy director of the department of science and formation of Svyatoslav Golubenko's Minkultury, for this it is possible to perezachityvat by student repetitive disciplines, and a question with the payment of remaining lessons for the second specialty to solve with the aid of the special grants, transfers “Russian International News Agency”.
“The ministry of culture took this question for the control, and we together with the expert association will develop the mechanism, which will make it possible to master two specialties, but it will not at the same time contradict the current legislation in the sphere of formation”, said Golubenko.
Last Friday in the course “Nedetskogo conversation” of Vladimir Putin with the pupils of children's center “Sirius” the student of Mary Andreev reported that it was forced to pay the repetitive objects in the second specialty in TSMSH with the Moscow conservatory.
Girl described that it learns according to the class of violin and fortepiano it has rewards of competitions in both directions.
The Head of State recognized his question as very urgent and promised to help.
In Mexico 17-year Russian the taken away on the wall to the skyscraper is detained
In Mexico is detained 17-year Russian Cyril n., who on the wall climbed up to the roof of high-rise building, the portal of El Universal reports.
Incident occurred in the capital of the country of Mexico City.
Youth with the aid of two unknown men climbed over the three-meter fence to the territory of the complex of the office buildings of the company of Nestle and independently he were taken away to one of his towers.
In this case he used no special equipment, insurance and rope.
They detained young person already on the roof.
The colleagues of the ministry of public safety went down it in the earth on the helicopter.
After this, they sent it into the national institute of migration.
There they do explain, lawfully youth is located on the territory of the country.
Meanwhile video with the young person, who climbs to the high-rise, became popular in the network.
Users named youth “man-spider”.
As he writes with media outlets, similar experiments are for it hobby.
Red meat, dairy products and chocolate can help to facilitate VZK.
Red meat and chocolate is customary to assume as nightmare for your digestive tract.
But recent studies speak about the reverse: the diet, rich in meat proteins and by dairy products, it can help to facilitate symptoms in those, who suffer the inflammatory diseases of bowels.
This incurable illness, from which suffer approximately 1.3 million people in the USA and 300000 in Great Britain, leads to colic and inflation of stomach, chronic or bloody diarrhea, decrease in weight and extreme fatigue.
Usually for the softening of symptoms by patient they advise to avoid meat and dairy products, but researchers from the Washington university established that the main amino acid of protein tryptophan contributes to the production of the immune cells, which increase the tolerance of bowels.
The chief researcher doctor Marco Kolonna explained that the immune cells in the bowels follow the fact so that the malicious microbes, which enter with the food, would not penetrate in the body.
The cells, capable of starting inflammatory process, are balanced by the cells, which increase tolerance, protecting body and in this case without damaging on sensitive cloths.
If equilibrium too strongly is disrupted to the side of inflammation, this can lead to the inflammatory diseases of bowels.
Experiments showed that in the mice, that have the specific bacterium in the bowels, cells the increasing tolerance appear.
But to this bacterium is necessary tryptophan - one of the construction elements of protein, in order to start the appearance of these cells.
Professor column said: “We established the connection between one type of bacteria - Lactobacillus reuteri, which is the part of normal mikrobioma of bowels, and by the development of the population of the cells, which increase tolerance.
The more tryptophan contained in the nourishment of mice, the greater these immune cells they had”.
It assumed that the same will work in the people: the combination L. to reuteri and rich in tryptophan diet can contribute more tolerant and less inclined to the inflammations medium in the bowels.
Postdok doctor Louise Cervantes-Barraganvas, studying the variety increasing immune cells of the increasing tolerance, revealed that in one group of experimental mice these cells were, and in another group, which belonged to the same line, but it was contained separately, it was not them.
It assumed that the difference can be caused by mikrobiomami of bowels of mice - associations of bacteria, viruses and caps, which usually live in the gastrointestinal tract.
DNA of the cells of bowels of mice they were sekvenirovany, and were discovered six types of bacteria, which are present in the mice, that have immune cells, but absentees in the mice, that do not have them.
The mice, grown in the sterile medium, that did not have good mikrobioma and that did not develop this type of immune cells, obtained L. reuteri, and immune cells in them appeared.
In order to understand, as bacteria they influence immune system, researchers grew L. reuteri in the liquid medium and they then transferred the small portions of liquid;without the bacteria, to the underdeveloped immune cells, isolated from the mice.
Immune cells became the cells, which increase tolerance.
When active component was isolated from the liquid, this proved to be the by-product of processing tryptophan, known as indole-3-milk acid.
When researchers doubled a quantity of tryptophan in the food of mice, a quantity of these cells increased approximately by 50 percent, but when the level of tryptophan was lowered doubly, a quantity of cells also fell two times.
Doctor Cervantes-Barragan explains, that the people have the same increasing tolerance cells as in mice, and majority of us has L. reuteri in its gastrointestinal circuit.
It is unknown, do contribute the by-products of tryptophan from L. to reuteri to the development of cells in people so, as in mice, but in people, which suffer the inflammatory diseases of bowels, were discovered defects in the genes, connected with tryptophan.
She speaks: “Possibly, the development of these cells to us must be strengthened, since on these cells it depends inflammatory processes on the internal surface of the guts.
The high levels of tryptophan in the presence L. reuteri potentially can lead to the expansion of their population”.

Properties for the White House managed to taxpayers into thousands of the dollars
According to the records of armed forces, given to the periodical “TIME”, the solution of the White House in the past month to drive home the helicopter of marines to the southern lawn to the measure, dedicated to American industrial production, cost the taxpayers of entire 24 000 dollars.
Bel-green Sikorsky VH-3D, known as “Marine One”, when and to board is located the President, became the central element of that carried out on July 17 in the White House of measure, on which were demonstrated the American programs of building.
President Donald Tramp, Vice President Mike Penny and highest officials of the White House looked around technological products of all fifty states.
The helicopter, produced in Connecticut, was put out next to the yacht of the state of Maine, fire truck from Wisconsin and forklift truck from Mississippi.
According to the records of the first squadron of the helicopters of marines (HMX-1), division, responsible for control of helicopter, Arms Forces Administration of the White House it was ordered about the presence of helicopter in the particular order, or “FRAGO”, in all 36 hours prior to helicopter it landed on the southern lawn on occasion “uncommon” measure.
“I simply wanted you to ascertain that you in the course, because this uncommon widely illuminated in the press measure”, wrote the commander of HMX-1 in the electronic letter to his chief, to the first deputy chief of the aviation of the corps of marines, on the eve of the measure.
In the letter it was indicated that helicopter will arrive to the southern lawn approximately at 7 A.M. on July 17 for the participation in the measure, assigned for 3 hours of day, and it will remain there before lawn it will be freed between 6 and 9 in the evening during the same day.
In the letter it is added, that if the sending from the White House is detained, will be required the second crew for the return flight in accordance with the limitations for the hours of work.
The first crew accompanied helicopter during the measure, and the colleagues of the protection of subdivision remained next to the air vessel, until it was located on the earth.
, It remained unclearly from the records, obtained by the periodical “TIME”, was required as a result of the second crew.
The law of Khetcha forbids to federal employees to use the government ownership for the political purposes.
According to records, HMX-1 refined, does not contradict measure this decision.
“In the number of other we did ask, not disturbance this the law of Khetcha, and us they answered, that no”, wrote commander.
“It is it seems that you to nowhere get to”, answered the deputy chief.
Measure “made in America” was declared the White House as official measure, and the law of Khetcha was not extended to it.
But even the official measures have political notes.
In the course of measure the President exerted efforts for the advance of the reform of public health, which was at that time in the development in the senate, and praised the attempts to regulate government decisions.
Use of airships, known as “Marine One” and “Air of Force One” for the political purposes – hardly new phenomenon.
To the Presidents it is prescribed to use them for the journeys.
But to inquire them is singular in the interests of fotovozmozhnosti uncommonly.
Tramp already became the object of considerations in February, when presidential aircraft passed in the background during his first pre-election meeting in Melbourne, in the state of Florida, and its account in Twitter was covered with communications with the complaints of the use of a presidential aircraft by its predecessor.
“The White House in the enthusiasm from the showing “it is made in America”, on which were represented the products of 50 states, made by American workers from the American materials”, said zamestitelnitsa of the press-secretary of the White House of Lindsi Uolters.
Crews HMX-1 frequently carry out training flights around the Washington agglomeration and on the southern lawn in order to train the transport of President of the United States into the White House with an accuracy to inch.
When Tramp at the beginning of July was on the summit G-20 in Germany, HMX-1 conducted 58 training landings in the White House.
According to one of the officials, the flight, executed for the measure “it is made in America”, there was zaschitan to the crew of on account necessary training flights in the month.
The helicopters of subdivision during that day also flew 11 additional hours within the framework of “neprezidentskikh tasks in the rendering of support”.
According to the White House, on the taxpayers lay the expenditures not for one of other exhibits, represented on the measure.
The representative of company “Sikorsky” reported that the company did not assume participation in the organization of the demonstration of helicopter on the southern lawn.
HMX-1 does not conduct the calculation of budget on the presidential flights, and to determine the precise sum, spent on the measure, is difficult.
But, according to the hour rates of Defense Ministry for 2017 fiscal year, the rate of the compensation of Defense Ministry for VH-3D is 24 380 US dollars per hour flight.
In the records of subdivision it is fixed that the time of flying means in air was 30 minutes to each side from its home airfield on the air base of marines Kuantiko in Virginia.
The White House asserts that the real cost of the use of a helicopter is much lower than this rate.
“To calculate cost for the taxpayers, being based on the exemplary rate of compensation, is completely erroneous”, says Uolters.
“These exemplary rates include personnel, maintenance and many other irreversible expenses, which are included in yearly assignirovaniya”.
According to the study, carried out in 2015 by the Rand Corporation, the rates of compensation do not include the cost of personnel, but really are considered the cost of fuel, maintenance and expenditures, indicated in the agreement.
At that time the former press-secretary the White House Sean Spicer spoke out in defense the use of a helicopter for the measure.
“Idea in demonstrating on this week of the things, made in America”, said Spicer.
“And I know that the company “of Sikorsky” and state of Connecticut greatly are proud of that fact that they make their contribution to the national security, and that there exist, I assume, hundred, if not thousands of people, whose job on this it depends.
And I think as the majority of Americans, that we all are proud of this helicopter and other military equipment, above the creation by which neustanno worked so many Americans.
Therefore, of course, it is completely appropriate to turn on this attention”.
It was incomprehensible, did interact Tramp with the helicopter, osmatrivaya southern lawn during the measure, but he accurately sat at the driver place in the fire truck.
Inside the White House Tramp turned to the representatives of company “Sikorsky”, after joking with the press on the theme of its own fleet of the products of company.
“I excellently know “Sikorsky”, said the President. – In me their three”.
