Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a law on the introduction of administrative liability for violation of the terms and order of payment for goods (works, services) in the procurement for state and municipal needs.
This law is intended to solve a very acute problem of non-fulfillment of its obligations by customers in the implementation of state and municipal procurement.
Two years ago, the situation when entrepreneurs could not get paid for already executed state and municipal contracts was widespread.
At the same time, the Russian President instructed the Prosecutor General's office to take the problem under special control.
Because the businessmen themselves could not cope with unscrupulous customers who concluded contracts not supported by financing, tried in every way to evade their payment obligations and included illegal conditions in the contracts.
The problem was systemic in the whole country.
In 2015 in the interest of protecting the rights of businesses to obtain payment for public order the Prosecutor's office made 9.7 thousand views, the results of their review to the disciplinary charges brought against 4,5 thousand officers, administrative - 533, to the investigating authorities for the organization of procedural checks presented 75 reports, 46 of them prosecuted.
As a result, the debt to entrepreneurs was repaid in the amount of more than 66 billion rubles.
And these huge sums were not accumulated as a result of non-payment of multi-billion contracts.
Numerous, systematic delays in payment of services to entrepreneurs for much more modest sums led to fabulous debts.
Here is a typical case.
The head of a small company won a competition for the provision of social transportation services for several million rubles.
The person invested all his working capital, fully fulfilled the obligations, but did not receive the money on time.
The result is a growing financial com of debts on wages, taxes, loans, which would have led to bankruptcy if the entrepreneur had not asked for help to the Prosecutor's office.
Now in a number of regions the problem was managed to be leveled as much as possible.
Nevertheless, as of the first half of 2017, the total amount of debt under state and municipal contracts, identified by prosecutors of the Russian Federation, amounted to about 27.4 billion rubles.
In regions where debt indicators continue to reach critical values, the Prosecutor's office works in the mode of manual anti-crisis management.
The Prosecutor General personally conducts field meetings with representatives of local authorities, where all violations revealed by prosecutors and measures for their immediate elimination are subject to examination.
Such operational meetings have already been held this year in Yaroslavl and Yekaterinburg.
The implementation of the Federal law No. 189-FZ "on amendments to the code of administrative offences of the Russian Federation regarding the establishment of administrative liability of the customer's officials for violation of the terms and order of payment for goods (works, services) in the implementation of procurement for state and municipal needs", which was signed by the President of Russia last week, will be able to improve the payment discipline of public customers.
The draft law was developed by the Ministry of economic development on the initiative of the Prosecutor General.
The new law will Supplement the code of the Russian Federation on administrative offences with an article that provides for a fine of 30 thousand to 50 thousand rubles for violation by the official of the customer of the term and the order of payment for goods, works and services in state and municipal procurement.
And if the official has already been subjected to administrative punishment for a similar offense, he will be disqualified for a period of one to two years.
All prosecutors of the constituent entities of the Russian Federation have already been instructed to ensure the application of these legislative innovations in practice.
The civil rights group has announced a warning on the movement in Missouri
The national Association for the advancement of colored people has issued a warning to colored people traveling to Missouri because of discriminatory state policies and racist attacks.
The group's statement reads as follows:"a warning For travelers of The national Association for the advancement of colored people, valid until August 28, 2017, calls on African-American travelers, guests, and citizens of Missouri to be particularly careful and exercise increased caution when traveling around the state in connection with a number of questionable racist incidents that have recently occurred throughout the state and are cited here."
According to the National Association for the advancement of colored people, to declare a warning on the movement of the group led to the recently adopted Missouri law, because of which people became more difficult to win claims for discrimination, and what law enforcement agencies of the state disproportionately often choose their objects of minorities.
"You have people who are subject to human rights violations.
They are stopped on the roads because of the color of the skin, they are beaten and killed," Rod chapel, President of the national Association for the advancement of the colored population of Missouri, told the Kansas city star newspaper.
"We hear complaints more often than ever."
This is the first warning of this kind announced by the organization in relation to the us state.
The panel referred to incidents such as the racial humiliation of black students At the University of Missouri and the death of 20-year-old Tory Sanders, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died under suspicious circumstances earlier this year after running out of gas while traveling around the state, and Missouri state police arrested him without charge of the crime.
The warning also mentions a recent report by the Missouri attorney General's office that black drivers are 75 percent more likely to be stopped on the road than white drivers.
"The purpose of the warning is for people to be aware of the situation and to warn their relatives and friends and colleagues about what might happen in Missouri," chapel said.
"People need to be prepared in one way or another, whether they take money with them for bail or tell relatives that they are traveling across the state."
According to the latest data from the FBI's hate crime reporting program, 100 hate crimes were reported in Missouri in 2015, making the state the sixteenth in the state for the number of such violations.
Also, the travel warning is a response to the new Missouri law, after which it will be more difficult to bring a case against a legal person for housing or employment discrimination.
Earlier, The American civil liberties Union (ACLU) announced warnings to travelers across Texas and Arizona after those States passed new immigration control laws that required local law enforcement to arrest people for violating immigration laws, which, according to the ACLU, was supposed to increase the number of checks on racial grounds.
Movement warnings are usually issued by the Department of State for other countries, but recently public organizations have resorted to this measure in response to certain laws and trends within the United States.
Two people were killed in a shooting at a police patrol in Egypt
Unknown fired police patrol in the Egyptian city of ISNA, Reuters reported, citing the Ministry of internal Affairs of Egypt.
During the shootout, two people, including one police officer, were killed and three people were injured.
All wounded are taken to hospital.
According to the Agency, the police stopped the car, after which two armed men in the car opened fire on law enforcement officers.
One of the attackers was detained, the second managed to escape.
Federal Agency for tourism supports the law on the abolition of free baggage for non-refundable tickets
The head of the Federal tourism Agency Oleg Safonov said in an interview with RBC that "positive" refers to the adoption of the law on the abolition of free baggage for non-refundable tickets.
"We need to create conditions in which a person who has no Luggage can buy a ticket cheaper than the one who has Luggage," he stressed (quote from TASS).
At the same time, Mr. Safonov noted that, despite the fears of citizens, it is not necessary to pay for the transportation of outerwear and mobile phone in hand Luggage.
"It would be right to reassure all our citizens and tourists and to say about it, to say that it is to outerwear, to an umbrella, to a mobile phone, to an iPad or even some computer will not have a relationship," the head of the Federal tourism Agency said.
Earlier, the President of Russia Vladimir Putin signed a law providing for the right of airlines to exclude the norm of free baggage with a non-refundable ticket.
The point is that airlines can determine the number of seats and the weight of baggage included in the non-refundable rate.
Vladimir Putin instructed to eliminate the pollution of lake Baikal
Russian President Vladimir Putin at a meeting on the protection of lake Baikal said that in recent years, large areas of the lake have been subjected to extreme pollution.
He instructed to determine the sources of funding, plans and implementers for the elimination of pollution.
Mr Putin also instructed to carry out a full remediation of the contaminated areas.
"It is necessary to deal with the objects that continue to work here, the treatment facilities of most of them are worn out," the President quotes RIA Novosti.
He also added that the General Prosecutor's office of Russia should conduct an inspection to identify environmentally harmful activities.
According to him, in the lake area there are problems associated with the emergence of natural dumps and a number of violations in the field of ecology by the organizers of the holiday.
"I want to emphasize this: not all in a row to check, there is also a measure you need to know, but it is - illegal and environmentally harmful activities and take appropriate measures," he stressed.
Earlier, the Prosecutor General's office reported a reduction in fish stocks in lake Baikal and proposed to increase the number of objects subject to environmental supervision.
We will remind, on June 15, Vladimir Putin during a straight line declared the need to change the legislation to ensure the rights of citizens living in natural areas of special protection regime.
About the problems with the conduct of economic activity he was told by the inhabitants of the island of Olkhon, which is part of the Baikal natural territory.
The head of the Ministry of natural resources Sergey Donskoy immediately proposed to solve the problem by clarifying the boundaries of the Baikal water protection zone, but the government of Buryatia reminded that such a change is not enough, since the restrictions are associated with a number of regulations.
Earlier, the Ministry of economy proposed to solve the problem by changing the Land code and the law on environmental protection.
A new temple will appear in Ugra
In the village of Sosva of the members of the community of the indigenous peoples of the North "Rahmania", together with the residents of Berezovsky district participate in the construction of an Orthodox temple in honour of Prelate Nikolay Chudotvortsa.
Its location-the river Bank, the temple will be well visible from afar, so it will serve as a beacon for fishermen.
According to representatives of the community, the construction work will be completed this year, now installed domes, there are available Church bells.
Igrimskaya operating fleet provided transportation support.
The temple is named after St. Nicholas the Wonderworker, because he is revered by the Orthodox Church as the patron Saint of travelers, including fishermen.
In Sosva, fishing gives the settlers work and feeds them.
The locals are waiting for the temple to open its doors, and the children even write in school writings about it as a local landmark.
Disneyland with the death penalty.
Why do Singapore comply with the laws?
I'm talking to a local businessman, Chang, sitting in an outdoor diner.
Commenting on the situation in Singapore, Chang smokes one cigarette after another, butts neatly stored in the iron box taken from the office.
After the end of the conversation, the businessman goes to the nearest urn - to her hundred meters - and throws bulls there.
The fine for public garbage is $ 500. Chang reports.
You know, I have a reflex from my childhood: you can not throw candy wrapper on the pavement, instantly fined.
And now at all everywhere video cameras.
Indeed, the pavements of Singapore to the city centre clean, as if in a Museum.
Chang says: three months ago, an 18-year-old son of his neighbor painted graffiti on the wall of an old colonial building.
The court found the guy guilty of vandalism and sentenced to flogging.
What?!
Imagine.
He received ten blows with a wooden stick to the buttocks and spent a week in prison.
In General, corporal punishment is not uncommon.
As in Singapore combines the highest standard of living and incredibly harsh laws, understood on the spot observer "AIF".
Here, no one thinks to abolish the death penalty, - explains the lawyer Victor Lee Hong.
And the government gives a shit about the opinion of the European Union and the United States for this reason.
If a person carries a large consignment of drugs or sells them - he put the gallows.
In 2002, a 22-year-old Australian citizen was detained at Changi airport: he was carrying 400 grams of cocaine.
In his defense were the Australian Prime Minister, threatening sanctions, international human rights activists and even the Pope.
However, the guy in the end still hung.
After that, the drug traffickers to our country diligently go round the side.
The fact is that in Singapore it is necessary that the laws are obliged to comply with everything, not only modest and poor people.
No matter who you are-a millionaire, Deputy Prime Minister, a famous artist or a resident of the European Union.
Option in this case one: if you find a pound of cocaine, you will be hanged.
When you walk around Singapore and everywhere you meet signs with a bunch of warnings, you simply wonder - how many prohibitions in this city-state!
For example, chewing gum is sold only in pharmacies, and you can buy it strictly according to the recipe (!) doctor's.
A tourist upon arrival, the gum will not take, but should put "gum" in the subway, punched a penalty to 1 thousand dollars.
In four days I met two people with white signs on their neck: "I was littering."
Thrown by an urn a cigarette butt in addition to a fine often sentenced to "exile in wipers": a week to clean up parks and beaches.
6 thousand rubles to pay "criminal", who forgot to flush water in a public toilet, but when you try to urinate in the Elevator of a residential building triggers a detector - locked door and sends a signal to the police.
Among the quite exotic laws - bans on feeding pigeons in the street, public performance of songs and even the over-watering houseplants (!): it is believed that the abundance of water attracts mosquitoes.
In order to avoid fires, smokers can not carry lighters in the subway, otherwise they will be fined 5 thousand Singapore dollars.
In General, there is a thought: no matter how hard you try, you will definitely break something.
This is not the case - trying to convince me Muhammed Kabir-Kajaria, owner of a local travel Agency.
Especially fantastic laws exist only on paper, and for the last twenty years I didn't see that for their violation someone involved.
Why do they persist?
So that the citizens do not relax.
Compliance with the basic rules is strictly monitored.
For example, if a minor will be sold in a kiosk cigarettes, will be punished all along the chain: the owner of the store will pay a huge amount, the offender will receive blows with sticks on the "back", and the seller will also be flogged and put in jail.
It was thanks to such harsh laws that offences were very rare in Singapore.
Is it justified?
Back in the seventies, we had chaos on the roads - motorists ignored traffic lights, went as they wanted, got drunk behind the wheel.
After the introduction of fines for the year, everything calmed down.
Now the driver, after drinking a portion of whiskey, knows: if you stop, the police will not let go for a bribe, impose a fine in the amount of the cost of the apartment and sent to jail for years.
Many foreigners city-state in Southeast Asia seems to be a kind of concentration camp.
In 1993, the American writer William Gibson called Singapore "Disneyland with the death penalty" - a guest from the United States horrified the General wealth of residents, "frighteningly clean airport" and "cultivated nature".
Say, such things are unnatural, look artificial, and so in principle should not be.
First days in Singapore and right afraid to throw a piece of paper on the sidewalk caught on, if we went on the subway with ice cream.
But then you come to the Little India, and suddenly, there's a pattern break: plastic cups are lying around the bus stop.
"What is it?"you wonder.
And here is so, - grin Singaporeans.
Things happen.
Not every such "crime" caught on the spot, but you should know if you figure out not otmazheshsya - because you broke the law.
Most often this is enough to make a person behave normally.
Of course, the power in Singapore is quite authoritarian.
But guess what?
In Vietnam's Ho Chi Minh city, I moved very carefully - motorcyclists often snatch out of the hands of tourists smartphones and cameras.
The center of Paris is full of dirty bums and beggars.
On our streets, too, not everyone tries to throw garbage in the urns.
Singapore, however, thanks to a set of draconian fines and ruthless (up to the death penalty) laws became the most peaceful, clean and safe city on Earth.
Thoughtfull.
It's human nature: remember, and in Russia, no one wore a seat belt while driving, yet were not fined.
Although the main thing in Singapore is not fines, but voluntary compliance with the laws.
And we should think that people in Russia would also be happy to have clean streets, the absence of garbage in the subway and would welcome the arrest of those who confuse the Elevator with a public toilet.
Here's corporal punishment-thank you, no need.
The rest of the laws of Singapore are at least worth to look at them.
Nothing sacred?
Now trump's White house is targeting the Statue of Liberty.
The most reliable sign of regime change is when he starts to fight with the statues.
Americans understand this as well as anyone else - hence the deliberate theatrical demolition of the statue of Saddam Hussein on Firdos square in Baghdad in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the trump government's key ideologists, no doubt knew what he was doing when he raised a symbolic axe over the Statue of Liberty during a fierce dispute with CNN journalist Jim Acosta about the President's proposals to drastically reduce legal migration.
Let's be honest, Miller didn't attempt on the statue itself.
Hordes of pleasure boat owners and artists depicting the Statue of Liberty would Lynch him if he tried to do so.
But he attempted on its meaning, and especially on the meaning, which was attributed to her in 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, when on a pedestal were added poems of Emma Lazarus.
As Miller grumbled at Acosta: "I don't want to go deep into history here, but the Statue of liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the world.
The poem you are talking about was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty."
Miller put the facts right, but as he himself said, it's not really about the story.
This is about the current sounding of the astounding words of Lazarus, the only ones in which the state invites not any immigrants but the poorest: "Your tired, your poor, / your crowds dreaming to breathe freely, / the Miserable dregs of your teeming shores."
Never before has "the unfortunate dregs" been so visible on our screens.
Miller was not engaged in literary studies - he made it clear that in America trump these people are not expected.
This debate about the meaning of the statue is part of a broader political and cultural war: it is really a dispute about the meaning of America.
Lazarus - and her friends, who fought to place her words on the statue's base after her death-were very well aware that they were committing a completely political act.
The sculpture was intended to mark the connection between the French and American republics with the help of a banal classical figure - the female image of Freedom.
Lazarus changed her meaning: in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract, she has a voice.
And she got a completely different name: the mother of the Exiled.
Combining the poem and the image was a brilliant feminist move and a crushing attack against American nativism.
And as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, the right though changed it back.
The loud rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist proclaiming the coming of the trump, in 2010, argued that Freedom no one invites, rather, it was an early neoconservative, carrying the flame of America lying in the darkness of the world: "Freedom is moving forward.
It carries the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
The torch is not to light the way to the United States."
Against the habit of limbo here really hit the spot.
The meaning of the statue depends solely on the angle of view.
Lazarus ' great creative achievement was to see her as she would be seen by the haggard, unhappy but hopeful people on the decks of ships after a long and often hard voyage.
This means literally looking at the world through the eyes of people who seek refuge and a chance for a better life.
Her statue answers them with words of hope and hospitality that they dream to hear.
And, of course, this is not the prospect that Miller and trump will ever want to recognize.
Their torch is needed not to illuminate the path, but to incite hatred, which is the only source of their power.
World Cup 2017: Neil Blake appreciates the Scottish members of the UK team.
Eylid Doyle recalls a time when the UK team had only two Scots
Neil Blake, Director of the game of the UK athletics Federation, said that the 16-man Scottish part of the team at the world Cup will make a "significant contribution to the team's game."
A record number of Scottish athletes were selected for the 2017 London championship starting on Friday.
Blake believes that something special is "being born" in Scotland and the UK athletics Federation should take this into account.
"We know this and are trying to understand and will support as long as they have potential," Blake said.
"I talked to people at the Scottish sports Institute and they think it's because of what they did.
The Scottish athletics Federation thinks that what they have done must be worked out.
British athletics Federation: what they have done, we must work.
And people on the street think so too.
I don't know why the circumstances were like this, but it's absolutely brilliant."
Some of the Scottish athletes claim medals, including Laura Muir and Andrew Bachert - which will compete with sir Mo Farah to race 5,000 m; and Alid Doyle team chose their captain.
"Aylid's being modest.
Her captain's speech was great," Blake says.
"Many athletes, regardless of whether they are Scottish or not, and from where they live or train, came out of this room feeling proud and determined to win.
The passion and sincere feelings that Eylid put into it were wonderful."
The winner of the silver medal of the Commonwealth championship, which in its fifth world Championship will run a distance of 400 m with obstacles, says that 16 Scots in the British team-it is"incredible".
The previous record for the number of Scots in the world Cup was seven, in 1983 and 2005.
Ahead is Laura Muir, specializing in middle distance running and beat last year's five British and two European records.
It will run at 1500 and at 5000 meters.
Chris O'hare, who will be participating in the race for 1500 m, is another Scotsman, who is worth paying attention to: he has a good season behind him, in which there were victories at the qualifying competitions of the British team and at the Annual competitions.
Doyle recalls his first world championship, when in addition to her only Scotsman in the team Was Lee McConnell.
The team captain says that she is "incredibly proud" that so many of her compatriots not only entered the national team, but in some cases will qualify for medals and fight for the final.
"The captain of the team is chosen by other team members, so it was a great honor in any case, but to know that your friends voted for you and you were chosen - for me it is a very special thing," she added.
"Of course, I am very proud of all the Scots who entered the team.
This shows how much we have achieved.
And they are all established athletes who will strive to get on the podium.
What about my captain's speech?
Yeah, I think she was pretty good.
I just noticed that we were very lucky to host the world Cup at home.
So it's just about how important it is to get support from the fans and take advantage of the fact that we will be back at the Olympic stadium.
I got another chance to enter its arena and take part in competitions, and the atmosphere there will be just wonderful."
Blocking critics on Facebook: don't run for public office if you're not ready to listen to criticism from voters
The founder of our country understood what the critical press is.
Americans loved George Washington, but it did not prevent them to criticize him for everything from domestic policy to its political principles.
Criticism his, of course, irritated.
But he didn't shut his mouth to his critics.
Because back in 1783, Washington said, "you can take away the freedom of speech and we, deaf and dumb, will be led like sheep to slaughter."
Now I will go to the Governor of Maryland Larry Hogan, who should try to be more like Washington.
Hogan's subordinates blocked and erased posts from at least 450 people who expressed their opinions on his official Facebook page.
And this week, the American civil liberties Union sued him for it.
Subordinates of the Governor called this claim insignificant, and the comment on the Internet was written in the spirit of "well and that".
"It's just Facebook," many will say.
But it's important.
And that's especially important when it comes to a guy like Hogan.
He's a surprisingly popular Republican Governor in a democratic, par excellence state.
He is in second place in the approval rating among the 50 governors of the country.
Hogan is not a stubborn reactionary.
He demonstrated a firm hand in the management of the state and commitment to his principles.
He also deftly uses Facebook as a primary way to connect with his constituents and with jokes showing his bald head on his page after chemotherapy.
Therefore, it is unnecessary and ultimately harmful to block people who come to the page of the Governor - which is declared as an official public forum and is conducted by the administration staff on taxpayers ' money.
In an interview with the Washington post, spokeswoman Amelia Ches defended the Governor's actions, arguing that blocking comments is just their moderation.
But it's too easy to use the image of trolls, spammers and haters spiteful on the Internet.
"Post" talked to some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.
And these are real people, not trolls - a teacher, a businessman, a pastor who address their elected leaders.
They all say their comments were respectful, informative and not rude.
The pastor quoted the Bible, appealing to the fact that Hogan is a Catholic.
Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Raman of Bowie, Maryland, did not Express hatred, but asked about hate crimes.
"I wrote a polite comment that I'm disappointed that he didn't respond to hate crimes and other recent news, "she wrote in the comments section of the article in the Post.
"I also don't like the idea that when a lot of people leave comments on the same topic, some immediately say it's a so-called cheat, instead of admitting that they're dealing with a large group of disgruntled citizens."
What the Governor's subordinates call a "concentrated spam attack," others would probably call an "active life position."
In the Facebook era, it's easy to tweak your image by simply blocking critics or erasing negative comments.
It's much less dusty, than before, when it was necessary to send the men to collect and burn the newspaper's critical editorials or arrest and gag the protesters.
But this is exactly what is happening now, only in numbers.
Hogen is not the first official to be criticized for not wanting to listen to Facebook and other social media.
President Trump was sued by Twitter users who were banned from his Twitter account.
One of the first landmark decisions on this topic was made this week in Virginia.
In the opinion of the district judge of the United States from Alexandria James K. Cacheris, Chairman of the Supervisory Council of the County of Loudon violated the First Amendment banned voter in your account in Facebook.
And in Kentucky, Republican Governor Matt Bain was presented with claims by the American Union for the protection of civil liberties for his behavior in Facebook and Twitter.
It shouldn't be that hard.
In Washington's time, the era of affordable postal expenses made about the same revolution as the Internet today.
From 1776 to 1800, the number of Newspapers quadrupled, and the authors of anonymous letters brought down his authority.
And even then, Washington was dealing with anonymous trolls.
People under the alias "Oricola", "Valerius", "Belisarius and Porcius" wrote letters in Newspapers deriding the decision of Washington.
According to historical documents collected by the online project "Documents of George Washington", his office was littered with petitions criticizing his position on the Treaty of friendship, trade and navigation.
But he didn't try to silence them.
Freedom of speech, dissent and speech is at the very Foundation of our state.
And true leadership means agreeing with it.
Ronan Rafferty hopes for household amenities in the club " Renaissance»
Former European champion Ronan Rafferty looks forward to home comforts for the next three days, when the Renaissance club in East Lothian will host the twenty-fifth open Scottish Golf tournament for older athletes.

It's magical to return to this corner of the world.
This is a great place to play Golf.
The memories of last year are coming back, and for me and my wife Sharon it was a very special experience to win last year.
It was a really special time and we will always remember it."
Returns to the fight in his native land Gary Orr, joined the European tournament for older athletes after earlier this year he was 50.
This event will be his first public appearance in Scotland since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
"When you play at home, it is always a little more important," - said a resident of Helensburgh, OPP.
"You want to perform well, but you feel that extra burden."
I played again with great pleasure and I showed good Golf.
I'm happy with how things are going so far."

British roads will learn to absorb harmful emissions
A kind of tunnels over the highways, capable of absorbing carbon monoxide emitted by cars, are already being tested on the roads of the UK.
The transport Agency of the country, according to the publication Autocar, reported on the positive results of the tests of the 100-meter tunnel installed on one of the highways in the North of the country.
The tunnel height of 6 meters built out of some of the newest polymeric materials, which are able to absorb the harmful substances contained in car exhaust fumes.
However, the creation of a network of such tunnels is only part of the large-scale measures that the UK authorities are going to take to improve the atmosphere.
In addition to the network of tunnels, the British are going to expand the network of charging stations for electric vehicles, to implement a number of measures to reduce the traffic flow on the roads, to expand the use of commercial vehicles on electric traction and to modernize the fleet of heavy trucks.
According to official statistics, a quarter of all air pollution falls on transport, and poor air quality causes up to 40,000 premature deaths per year.
The Moscow city court changed the punishment of disabled Mamayev to a fine
The Moscow city court changed the punishment for the disabled Anton Mamayev, sentenced to four and a half years in prison, a fine of 200 thousand rubles.
It is reported by TASS.
Earlier, the Prosecutor asked the court to replace term on conditional, explaining his request by the fact that the disease Mamaev "prevents it from being in prison".
28-year-old Anton Mamayev was sentenced to four and a half years of imprisonment with serving a sentence in a colony of the General regime for robbery, the victim of which was a former special forces soldier.
On July 19, the court released the man from custody at a visiting session in the pre-trial detention center.
Poverty and death in the Indonesian Golden land»
Cooking dinner, Bardin Degei not use the stove.
She doesn't even use the pot much.
In her wooden house in Enarotali, the capital of Paniai County in the rebellious Indonesian province of Papua, a housewife usually just puts sweet potatoes, which is called "note", directly into the hearth.
After half an hour, the charred tuber is taken out and eaten with impatient, unwashed hands.
Degei sits on an earthen floor-she has no furniture – and this is where she does her housework, such as washing clothes with muddy water from a nearby swamp.
The restroom is a bucket in a room without a roof.
She is the youngest of her husband's four wives, and so she was not assigned to work in the field.
Polygamy is common here.
Of course, working late can be dangerous: many men from this village are unemployed, many drink, and there are soldiers.
"Nobody dares to walk around the village after five in the evening," she says.
This is a rare opportunity to look at daily life in the Papua highlands, a former Dutch colony that was annexed to Indonesia in 1969 after a questionable referendum when only 1,026 elders were forced to vote, raising their hands in public in front of the occupying forces.
The current movement for independence from the Netherlands quickly turned its anger against the Jakarta government, which maintains tight control over the region, preventing foreign journalists and human rights defenders.
In 2003, the province was formally divided into Papua and Western Papua, and the independent state of Papua New Guinea occupies the Eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is as remote as an abandoned city; the journey here includes an hour and a half flight from Jayapura, the province's administrative center, to nabira, and then a five – hour shaking on a hired car.
Public transport is not here.
The city of about 19,000 people consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences; the roofs of corrugated steel are painted with rust in a variety of reddish shades.
Few Indonesian people got here, not to mention journalists, and almost none of the foreigners.
Before the arrival of the Christian missionaries, the Papuans Meya Pago worshipped a God named UGA Tamei.
There were other changes.
"We were not used to wearing these clothes," says Degei, pointing to his bright, hand - woven turban, dark skirt and bright shirt.
"We used to only wear leaves on our bodies."
Papua is Indonesia's poorest province, with 28% of its population living below the poverty line and child mortality and literacy rates among the worst in Asia.
But it's also Indonesian gold.
The world's largest and most profitable gold mine, Grasberg, owned by the Phoenix-based Freeport McMoran, is just sixty miles from Paniai, a mountainous province the size of new Jersey, where 153,000 people live.
Only in 2015, the company "Freeport" produced gold and copper here for about 3.1 billion dollars.
In addition, Papua boasts a forest reserve estimated at $ 78 billion.
These riches, however, entail one misfortune for the Papuans, ensuring that Indonesia's powerful armed forces remain here with a suffocating presence.
According to the investigation of the newspaper "new York times" in 2005 and between 1998 and 2004, the company "Freeport" paid to the military and local units nearly $ 20 million, including up to $ 150,000 to the same officer.
The demands of greater autonomy on the part of the Papuans threaten the existence of this gold mine and are ruthlessly suppressed.
According to human rights defenders, more than 500,000 Papuans have been killed by Indonesian military forces since 1969, and thousands more have been raped, tortured and imprisoned.
According to the Asian Commission on human rights, the massacres in the indigenous highlands of Papua in the seventies can be considered genocide.
Last year alone, Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful protesters in the region.
"We will lose everything", a report published in 2016 by The Brisbane diocese, contains evidence of atrocities committed in the previous year, such as summary executions, torture – particularly frequent, as claimed in another report, rape and electric shock – and the brutal suppression of peaceful demonstrations.
"It's hard to count the number of victims because incidents happen every week, "says Andreas Harsono, who is doing research in Indonesia for Human Rights Watch.
The nuts were tightened, as Papua's resources attracted an influx of migrants from other parts of Indonesia.
The 3.5 million population of the province is 83% Christian, but the demographics change as Muslim economic migrants from the densely populated Indonesian Islands of Java, Sumatra and Sulawesi arrive.
Javanese benches, "varungu", selling grilled chicken and mixed vegetable salad "Gado-Gado", served with peanut sauce.
Local residents try to withstand the competition.
"Migrants started selling chicken and vegetables in the traditional market at a lower price than the indigenous people of Papua," explains Abet yo, a twenty - three-year-old native of Paniai who moved to Jayapura, the provincial capital, because of the work.
"Because of this, the indigenous people of Papua mother – mother (women) of Papua-lost their market."
Indonesia's President Joko Widodo, popularly known as Jokowi, has vowed to deal with the inequalities and rights violations in Papua during his presidential campaign in 2014.
On his way to the President's Palace in Jakarta, a former carpenter enlisted the support of 27 of Papua's 29 districts, including Paniai.
But in Papua, almost nothing has changed, and the locals feel betrayed.
"Our hearts are broken, because in 2014 we voted for Jokowi, expecting that he will fulfill our hopes for justice," says yo.
In fact, just two months after the October inauguration, Jokowi Paniai survived the tragedy.
On 7 December 2014, a group of 11 children was outside singing Christmas carols by the fire in Enarotali when two Indonesian soldiers on a motorcycle broke out of the darkness.
Frightened children told them that they should turn on the lights.
As reported by the local pastor, Javed Tebrau; one of the soldiers took offense at their tone and after some time returned with four soldiers.
According to victims and witnesses, soldiers who were drunk were chasing children and beating them with rifle butts.
Then one of the soldiers fired at a group of children.
One child, sixteen-year-old Julianus Yeimo, was so badly beaten that he fell into a coma.
A couple of hours later, someone set fire to a nearby government election Commission building, and the next day, the situation escalated.
About a thousand Papuan men, women and children gathered on the football field in front of the local police station and military command center to demand justice.
They brought with them ritual hunting bows and performed the white, the dance of the Papuan tribe mee Pago: they ran in circles and depicted bird singing.
Some protesters started throwing stones at the police station and military base.
When the situation escalated, the soldiers were ordered by internal radio: "if the crowd resists more than three times, shoot them," he said, as stated in the official document, which was seen by the correspondents of the magazine "TIME", but which was not published in the local media.
Pyatidesyatishestiletny Eremias Him, the head of the district Kego Koto in Enarotali, felt the impending danger and called for calm, appealing to the crowd asking to go home.
No one wanted to listen to him.
"When I turned around, a bullet suddenly hit my left wrist," he told TIME magazine, standing on the porch of his brightly colored wooden house.
Kayame still doesn't know who shot, but says the bullet came from the ranks of the assembled soldiers.
"There was a crowd, there were a lot of shots," he adds.
A local resident of Alfius Iowa hit three times, as told by his cousin, who witnessed the shooting.
"I ran up to him and examined his body to make sure it was him, "Johannes told TIME magazine grimly, who, like many Indonesian people, uses only one name.
"I saw that he was dead... I kissed him."
General Jotje Mende, a senior inspector of the Papua police, told reporters that his officers were only "defending" their base because it was under attack.
"We have to defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us," said Commissioner Pujo Sulistiyo, a police spokesman for Papua, in 2015.
"It's a matter of life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and much more were injured.
The news of the murders didn't reach Jakarta until the next day.
Three weeks later, Jokowi said in Jayapura passionate speech in which he expressed condolences to the families of the victims and vowed to address the issue of historical abuse of power in Papua.
"I want this situation to be settled immediately, so that it will never happen again in the future," he said.
In October 2016, the Minister for security, Viranto, said he would establish a non-judicial organization to put an end to historical human rights violations.
But almost immediately came the excuses.
"Most of the violations occurred long ago.
Some of them took place in the nineties or early noughties.
The fact is that we certainly want to deal with these violations, but there are procedures that need to be passed," he said.
Then Viranto declined to speak to TIME magazine on 5 June in Jakarta and said that he had no plans to establish an organization to deal with complaints in Papua.
Instead, he said, "It will be decided through the courts."
Wiranto, which the United Nations was accused of "crimes against humanity" in connection with the deaths of more than 1,000 people during the bloody vote for independence of East Timor in 1999, said that 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua have already been settled, including the incident in Paniai.
The families of the Paniai victims met such statements with dismal mistrust.
"I've been asked four times in the last three years, but there has been absolutely no change," says Johannes.
I'm tired.
He says that years later he still lives in fear.
"I'm scared," he says.
"I'm afraid I'll be arrested by the military, I'm afraid I'll be shot."
His brother Jacobus also expressed the opinion that Panai residents are afraid to discuss the incident.
He said he was beaten by the military after he helped bury four victims.
"After we buried the bodies, the military came for me," he says.
The shooting didn't stop.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police shot villagers in the nearby Paniai district of Deiyai.
In a clash between villagers and a construction Manager who refused to help take an unconscious man to the hospital, one person was killed and 17 others were injured, including children.
Male, twenty-four Ravenous Dove, drowned while fishing in the river flowing nearby, died on the way to the hospital.
Angry villagers protested in front of the office of the company's construction site.
According to the police, the villagers threw stones at the officers, who fired warning shots in response.
But the locals say that the mobile brigade (Indonesian special forces) began to shoot at the crowd and killed one person.
"We were in such a panic, we are afraid of retaliation," - said the magazine "TIME" dvadtsatipyatiletnih Domingo Badia, who lives near the hospital and saw how hastily the wounded were delivered.
"I hid in my house for two days."
Parliament Daiei demanded to be involved in the incident officers were called to account, and the mobile police brigade withdrew from the region.
Paniai has always been a sore point for the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development is discontent of the mee, Moni, Dani and damal tribes scattered throughout the green Central highlands of Papua.
Many have joined the "free Papua Movement" (OPM), a rebel army that claims to defend the rights of Papuans by staging sporadic attacks and kidnappings against Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the top OPM leaders come from Paniai, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
As a response in recent years, thousands of people have been arrested and unreasonably detained by the military in Paniai on the pretext of"protecting national independence".
Some never came back.
Among the population of Papua, Paniai is considered a "sad, forgotten place".
Poverty increases discontent.
A small portion of rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive for the locals.
Bread is just as unavailable.
People here grow everything they eat: mostly notes, as well as some fruits and leafy vegetables.
Agriculture is the work of women, each of whom can take care of four to five fields of sweet potatoes.
They usually save most of the harvest for the family, and the rest is sold locally.
Ten note tubers cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Over time, economic disparities between indigenous Papuans and new migrants who arrived in large numbers after the introduction of new flights to Nabire airport have increased.
The few existing vacancies usually go to more educated and wealthy migrants.
Papuans rarely have enough money or the necessary skills to run their own competitive business.
"Young people do not want to stay in the village... because there is no work or money here," says John Gobai, Chairman of the Paniai tribal Council.
Isolation keeps Papua away from the views of the rest of the world.
In addition, restrictions on the work of international media remain strict.
Earlier this year the French journalists Frank Escude and Basile Longchamp were deported from Papua for "lack of consistency with relevant organizations" despite the fact that they were given rare permission to conduct video.
According to Felima Keene, Deputy Director for Asia of the organization "Human Rights Watch", the promises made during the election campaign, Jokowi, to lift restrictions on the media in order to promote transparency and development, was not completed.
"Now foreign journalists trying to report from the rebellious East Indonesian provinces, Papua and West Papua, face new dangers: visa refusals and blacklisting," he said in a statement.
The lack of media attention means that international pressure on the Indonesian government is mainly limited to Papua's immediate neighbours.
In March, six Pacific States-Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands – requested the UN human rights Council to investigate "diverse and widespread violations" in Papua, including the Panai shooting.
The same countries have supported OPM in the past.
The representative of the Indonesian foreign Ministry, Arramanata Nasir, dismissed the group's statement, telling reporters in Jakarta that"Indonesia still has a democratic system and a free press, so it would be difficult to hide evidence of human rights violations".
Local residents want more foreign governments to pay attention to the situation.
When an official delegation from the Netherlands, led by Dutch human rights Ambassador KIIS van Baar, visited Jayapura on 4 may, local residents broke the silence by praying, "we want freedom," according to a source who was also present at the meeting but wished to remain anonymous.
In Indonesia, in 2019 there will be a new presidential election, but the Papuans say that it is unlikely that they will vote for the Jokowi again.
"Jokowi is a man who has good intentions, but he is surrounded by people involved in the Paniai shooting," says Gobai, the Chairman of the tribal Council.
He wants Jokovi to know that the people of Paniai, besides living in the shadow of the threat from the greedy army, are mired in poverty, and their education and health are in a miserable state.
Gaby says that the residents Paniai, like other Papuans, they consider their vote for Jokowi, a debt that he must pay.
"They don't need money, they just want justice," he says.
Despite threats and intimidation, the families of the victims of the Paniai shooting carried out the last symbolic act of disobedience: the body of one of the victims was buried in a plot of land directly opposite the police and military station.
Knowing that justice will probably never prevail, they will at least not let the guilty forget their crimes.
"A member of our family was killed," says Jacobus, without raising his head.
"What else were we going to do?»
The fire for the second time covers the Dubai skyscraper "Torch»
The fire engulfed one of the world's highest residential skyscrapers in Dubai on Friday, forcing hundreds of residents to hastily leave the seventy-five-story structure at 337 meters high.
This is the second fire that swept through a high-rise building-which coincidentally is called "Torch" - for two years.
The building was evacuated, no casualties were reported, and there was no operational news about the cause of the fire.
"We slept and woke up from the fire alarm and people screaming.
We ran down the stairs, and it took us about ten minutes to get down from the fiftieth floor," a resident of the skyscraper, who called himself George, told Reuters.
According to the Dubai civil defense Department, the fire teams put out the fire at about 4:00 local time (00:00 GMT) and cooled the building.
The government reported that it was working to provide shelter to victims.
The incident may bring back to the agenda the safety of materials used in the exteriors of high-rise buildings around the world.
During the investigation by the administration of "Torch" after the fire there in 2015, it turned out that the most affected plating – external panels used for decoration and insulation.
In the United Kingdom, police said they believed that the insulation system and the cladding of the Grenfell tower in London could have accelerated the spread of the fire there in June, which killed about 80 people.
The growth of tourist flow in IDA-Virumaa in June was minimal
As follows from the data that the portal correspondent rus.err.ee received by the Department of statistics, in June 2017 the services of the hotel enterprises of the North-East benefited a total of 20,519 local and foreign tourists, which is 125 people or 0.6% more than the same period a year earlier.
At the same time, the number of local tourists decreased, and the number of foreign tourists increased.
Thus, foreign tourist flow increased in June by 7.3% (544 people) to 7994 tourists.
And the number of local tourists decreased by 3.2% from 12,944 to 12,525 people.
The number of Russian tourists in the region increased most significantly - by 8.9% or 318 people compared to June 2016.
In total, in June 2017, 3885 guests from Russia stayed in IDA-Virumaa hotels.

In Afghanistan, the explosion of the car killed five soldiers
At least five soldiers were killed in the explosion in the Afghan province of Helmand, RIA Novosti reported.
According to police, the night before next to the military checkpoint in the County of Girishk exploded a car bomb.
We know about 20 dead.
On Friday morning in Gericke there was a new emergency.
Armed criminals attacked the currency exchange.
The shooting between the attackers and the security forces continues.
The diver videotaped bitten his camera shark
Diver and Explorer Greg Skomal (Greg Skomal) captured on video the shark that bit his action camera GoPro.
The video posted on Facebook unit of the American Agency for marine fisheries in Massachusetts, an employee of which is Skomal.
The incident occurred on August 2 off the coast of the Cape Cod Peninsula in the North-East of the United States, said portal Necn.
The man during the dive tried to remove the shark on the camera, which was held on a special stick.
Noticing the human, the animal with a length of more than three metres swam up to him.
The shark began to bite the camera, but did not try to attack the scientist.
Skomal explained that the predator did so to determine whether the gadget is edible.
The researcher added that the shark could easily destroy the device.
He also noted that such behavior of a marine animal was a novelty for scientists.
Became known the reason for the mass brawl in the Ural military center
A working group of senior officers of the Central military district arrived at the Elan training center, where a mass fight took place to investigate the circumstances of the incident.
Some details of this massacre have already been known.
According to the public Mash, appeared on the page "Vkontakte", contract soldiers of the Ural military unit number 31612 brutally fought over an unshielded bed.
It all started with the fact that an ordinary man named Sayan defiantly ignored the order of the officer to fill the sheet sticking out.
On the side of the officer stood soldiers from the sixth company.
Sayana was supported by the first company.
Half an hour 140 young men smashed in the barracks beds and sinks, smashed glass.
In a mass fight, more than ten people were injured.
The CVO denied the information about the stabbing.
The study showed that at least one fifth of passengers in the United States carry prohibited items on the plane.
The study showed that more than 20 percent of air passengers knowingly or accidentally carried in Luggage on Board the aircraft through the inspection points of the us transport security Administration prohibited items, including a minimum of 6 percent got on the plane, inadvertently carrying prohibited knives or other sharp objects.
Almost 1 per cent reported that they later found that they had accidentally carried firearms, ammunition or explosives.
Research conducted by the Charter company Stratos Jet Charters, Inc. and covered more than 1,000 people, also showed that young passengers are more likely to break the rules.
Of the respondents who admitted that they consciously tried to fly with something that was banned by ATB, 19.7 percent were Millennials compared to less than 15 percent of Generation x members.
Consciously past the ATB often sneaked food and water.
More than 3 per cent admitted that they had deliberately carried sharp objects through the screening, while 2.2 per cent of female and 3.7 per cent of male respondents admitted that they had knowingly carried prohibited medicines into the aircraft.
The company said it was investigating passengers across the country to find out how many of them were accidentally smuggled through airport inspections, and how many were doing it knowingly.
It is expected that most often - consciously or unconsciously-dragged smuggling through inspection those who fly most.
According to the company, the rules of ATB is quite complicated and confusing.
People often do not know exactly what liquids they can carry and how much.
It is therefore not surprising that a large part of what takes away ATB - it is forbidden liquid.
Some time ago, people thought that ATB could be considered prohibited from carrying books.
Liquids are allowed on domestic flights, not international.
The head of the EPA Pruitt refuses the intention to postpone the implementation of Obama's rules to reduce emissions
The next day, after a lawsuit by 15 States, the head of the Agency for environmental protection reversed its decision to defer implementation under the Obama administration rules designed to reduce emissions that pollute the air and lead to smog formation.
Pruitt explained his decision by the fact that now his Agency is more than in previous administrations, listening to the needs of regulators of environmental protection of individual States.
He did not mention a claim against his previous position filed with the Federal court of appeal.
The dispute revolved around the deadline of 1 October, by which the States should meet the 2015 ground-level ozone standards.
In June, Pruitt announced that he would postpone compliance for one year to give his office more time to study the plan and avoid "inconsistencies with local decisions or obstacles to economic growth."
Pruitt, who before being appointed by President trump to his current position as Oklahoma state attorney General, has long been known as a consistent opponent of tougher environmental regulations.
After moving to Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly blocked or postponed the introduction of rules that opposed the chemical or gas-oil industry.
The unexpected change of course on Wednesday is another legal defeat of the course taken by Pewitt to return to the former norms.
Last month, a Federal appeals court in Washington ruled that the EPA head exceeded his authority in an attempt to delay the Obama administration's rule requiring oil and gas companies to track and reduce methane leaks.
In a statement released Wednesday night, Pruitt suggested that, by drastically changing course on ozone standards, he was simply fulfilling the EPA's duty to cooperate with the States in the comprehensive process of timely implementation of the new standards.
"Under previous administrations, the EPA was often unable to meet the deadline, then waited for lawsuits from activist groups and others and discussed the timeline during the settlement of the case," Pruitt said, who filed more than a dozen lawsuits against the EPA in his previous position.
"We do not believe in regulation through judicial processes, and we take the deadlines seriously.
We also take our Charter and the power it gives us seriously."
However, the EPA statement said that Pruitt may at some point re-use his" powers to delay and other powers given by law "to make sure that the"jcyjdfys" rules are on a clear course and on all available information."
Republicans in Congress are pushing for a broader revision of the ozone rules.
The bill, approved by the House of representatives last month, seeks to delay the implementation of the 2015 rules for at least eight years.
The Senate has not yet voted on this issue.
New York attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who led a coalition of States that filed a lawsuit against the EPA this week, said the group intends to continue legal pressure.
"The EPA's changes of course - after our lawsuits - are an important victory in the fight for the health and safety of 6.7 million new Yorkers and more than 115 million Americans, who are directly affected by smog covering their cities," Schneiderman said.
New York's suit was joined by California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, new Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode island, Vermont, and Washington, as well as the district of Columbia.
Ozone at ground level occurs when ordinary pollutants from machinery, power plants, refineries, chemical plants and other sources react with sunlight in the atmosphere.
The resulting smog can cause serious breathing problems in people who are sensitive to it, leading to thousands of premature deaths per year.
Health and environmental advocates welcomed Pruitt's sudden change of course.
"It's sad to think about how much pressure it took to get this perfectly logical step from the person tasked with protecting the air we breathe," said Laurie Ann Byrd of the center for biological diversity.
"We must continue to resist the trump administration's ideological campaign and protect those who pollute the air and their special interests."
IAAF Congress extended the suspension of the all-Russian athletics Federation
Congress of the International Association of athletics federations (IAAF) voted to extend the suspension of the all-Russian athletics Federation (vfla).
Thus, Congress supported the IAAF Council for the restoration of the wfla, which released a report on Monday, which recommended to leave the suspension in force.

According to published transcripts of telephone conversations, trump pressed Mexico about the payment of the wall at the border
The newspaper "Washington post" has published transcripts of telephone conversations between U.S. President Donald trump and the leaders of Mexico and Australia.

The study of the Russian influence on the American elections will be engaged in a Grand jury
Special Prosecutor for Russia Robert Mueller convened a Grand jury in Washington, which will study the influence of Russia on the us presidential elections in 2016, the Wall Street Journal and Reuters reported.
A Grand jury is a group of ordinary citizens who collect evidence of potential criminal offenses and have the right to question witnesses under oath.
The collected materials will be studied by the special Prosecutor and will decide whether they are enough to charge.
The convening of a Grand jury Muller gives additional powers to gather evidence.
One of the topics of the investigation of the jury, which began work a few weeks ago, will be the details of the meeting of the son of the then presidential candidate Donald trump with Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya.
Mueller had previously promised to verify the details of this meeting, held in June 2016.
They've been studied by the FBI.
At the end of July, it was reported that Donald trump Jr. expanded the staff of his lawyers.
Trump Jr. previously said that from the meeting with Veselnitskaya he waited for compromising on the headquarters of the candidate from the demparty Hillary Clinton, but no exposing documents were not presented, and it eventually was about adoption.
In early August, a number of media reported that trump Jr.'s statement about the meeting with Veselnitskaya was literally dictated by trump senior.
The White house said that the President did not dictate anything, but simply used his authority, which any father would do.

And the installation of the bust of Yuri Gagarin is a tribute to the first man who visited space.
In contrast to the monuments of the Soviet period, which are demolished in some countries, monuments to Gagarin, on the contrary, "walk on the planet."
In 2012, the monument was installed in the American Houston near the former headquarters of NASA.
In London, a monument on the territory of the Royal Observatory was installed in honor of the 50th anniversary of the first flight into space.
There is a monument to Gagarin in Germany in Erfut, where our cosmonaut visited in 1963.
The monument in Karlovy vary (Czech Republic) escaped demolition in 1992 due to public protests and was moved from the city center to the square in front of the local airport.
In the year of the 70th anniversary of Gagarin in Riga there was a monument To Yuri Gagarins.
This is the name of the first cosmonaut in Latvian, and it looks as if he was 70 years old.
Murder at Morse Ford: activists lose lynchings on the stage to call for justice
"Ford mercury" 1948 drove past the audience in the village of Monroe in Georgia and with a roar rushed to the small bridge of the Morse Ford.
When the car, which had four black passengers and a white driver, drove up to the bridge, a group of white men with guns blocked her way.
The main man, a middle-aged man in a pinstriped suit, sucked in a cigar and looked through the windscreen.
The ones inside were trembling with fear.
"We need that nigger, Roger! the man barked.
"Get him out of the car!"
Shrill screams broke the silence as a young black man was pulled from the front seat.
Fortunately, this terrible scene, which took place on July 22, is just a dramatization.
But when on the neck, "Roger" threw a loop, almost all the witnesses held their breath.
Since 2005, activists returned to the bridge Morse Ford to re-play that night in 1946, the ku Klux Klan lynched two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and Mae Murray Dorsey.
No one was convicted of these murders.
"It's amazing that no one has been arrested in all these years-although we see them next to us; though we know who they are," says Tyrone Brooks, who helped organize the production.
"It's a stain on our history and it's a stone on our souls."
71 - year-old Brooks is a former member of the Georgia Congress who has been fighting for human rights all his life.
For him, the play is a dramatic call to action and an annual reminder to the people of Monroe that the injustice has not been corrected.
"We want an investigation, we want closure, we want healing, we want reconciliation, but we have to get justice first," he says.
"We can't go to healing and reconciliation until we get justice."
The coroner covers the sheet with the body of one of the victims of lynching at Morse Ford July 27, 1946.
According to FBI material obtained by NBC news, more than 50 people in Monroe and neighboring counties were suspected of involvement in the lynching.
But no one was ever charged.
Although the suspects have remained at large for decades, human rights activists say that the city has always been well aware of two related motivations of vigilantes: politics and sex.
In April 1946, a Supreme court ruling for the first time allowed black citizens to vote in the primaries, which were to be held that summer.
Approximately during the same election, according to the FBI, a black share Cropper Roger Malcom stabbed in a fight with a knife, Barnett Hester, a white farmer which appears to be a woman.
Brooks says that, according to rumors spreading in the city, Hester slept with Malcolm's wife Dorothy, and that the child she was supposed to give birth to was not from her husband.
According to the FBI, on July 25, 1946, Loy Harrison, a large white landowner, paid $ 600 in bail to get Malcolm out of prison.
He went to prison with Dorothy and their cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey.
But when they went from the prison and drove to the bridge, Morse, Ford, Lynch mob surrounded the car.
"It turns out that he organized and commanded the murder of Harrison," - such a conclusion is made in one of the reports of the FBI.
"It is also clear that there was collusion between state and city law enforcement agencies, which not only took part in the murders, but also destroyed the evidence and concealed the identity of witnesses."
Brooks calls it shorter.
"It was an attempt on the right to vote," he says.
"They were all killed to send a signal to black people in the city: if you sign up and vote, you will be the same."
Almost ten years Cassandra Greene manages the annual performance reproducing the lynching of the bridge Morse Ford.
Her performance is vivid, it captures the viewer and tells the story of the deep racism, which, as many would like to believe, is no longer in America.
It's hard to watch and even harder to turn away, but green believes that this is the main thing.
"We don't want to talk about Lynch's courts because they show us our own ugliness," she says.
"But I can't build a relationship with you if you don't hear me or hear what I've been through."
Rehearsals of this year's performance began in June, and on the first day almost 30 actors - a dozen white, the rest black - gathered in the room and listened to the polished review of the play.
Wade, Marbo was a Director along with green.
For several years he was the main member of the clan, but said that the role did not become easier.
"I feel like I got dirty because it's not the person I am," says Marbo.
"But I think it's very important to remember this story because we don't want to go back to that time."
In the room, the actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Raskon, who play Roger Malcolm and Barnett Hester, repeat their roles.
The play begins with Malcolm, enraged by the fact that Hester is sleeping with his wife Dorothy, shouting and pushing him.
"I said, nigga, get out of my house!"
Raskon shouts back.
You hear a shot.
And at the same time, everyone (at least all black actors) burst out laughing.
Green laughs louder all.
"What is it?" asks Ascona.
He's worried and confused.
Am I overacting?
"No," green says through laughter.
"I just don't think white people said 'nigga'then."
"Yes, Yes," laughs one of the black performers.
"You have to hit the hard 'R'."
And also changing the energy in the room: the discomfort is replaced by a sense of camaraderie.
Everyone must do everything right, not only for the sake of the play, but also for the sake of the memory of the four people killed.
The scene starts again.
This time, when Raskon says the word for the letter "n", it turns out clear and sharp.
No one is laughing.
The play ends violently and quickly.
Screams, shots, and then silence.
A woman in black mourning clothes standing over the bodies of the actors and performs a sad song Billy holiday "Strange Fruit".
Her voice is interrupted by the word.
A hundred yards away, fifty spectators wipe their tears and sweat from her eyes.
Among the audience almost equal number of black and white.
One couple came from Ithaca, new York, to see the show; many live very close.
They all endured the heavy stuffiness of Georgia for almost eight hours while Brooks led them on a pilgrimage to the graves of Malcolms and Dorsey.
Up to this point, the murders were just a story, but now, when they are in the same place where people lynched, it seems that their ghosts are in the air.
When the last note of the song dies down, green invites people to come closer and inspect the bodies.
Children bend down to their heads, touch the paint depicting blood, and motionless bodies and whisper something to each other.
"They're not really dead," one little boy mutters, as if to remind himself.
A few minutes later, green thanks the audience, and suddenly it's over.
Actors throw ropes from the neck and wipe the tears.
Bradshaw hugs Marbo, the man in the suit who played the head puppet.
Nick Raskon hugs two other actors and suddenly, crying, falls into their arms: the emotional load of the play finally fell on him.
"It's all right," one of the women whispers.
"We know you have a good heart.
You had your reasons for that."
Later, the audience sit down to dinner with the actors.
At the same table, a white couple from Atlanta lively discusses the performance with a black couple, with whom they have just met.
Denise Duplinsky hard looking for the words to describe how she feels after the show.
"It's hard to listen to these horrible, creepy words, and actions... of people who look like you and who do it because they look like you," she says.
"After that, I think lynching is still happening, "she adds,"only now it's called police shooting."
In another corner of the room, the General attention was captured by Tyrone Brooks, who recalls his work as a human rights activist.
He says that he has already started to plan next year's performance.
"The production inspires us because it not only describes the horror of what we have experienced, but also teaches us," he says.
"Because if you don't learn from this lesson, it can happen again.
Those who do not study their history, who do not know their history, are doomed to repeat it."

The environmental protection Agency after lawsuits overturns the decision to postpone the adoption of the law on air pollution
Us Agency for environmental protection overturned the decision to postpone the adoption of the law of the era of Obama, according to which States must limit the emission of pollutants to the air, the day after 15 States have filed a lawsuit against the Agency due to this step.

"We believe in dialogue with and responsiveness to our partners in the States," said Scott Pruitt, head of the environmental protection Agency, in a statement.
In June, Pruitt announced the environmental protection Agency's intention to postpone ozone measurements, in which existing air pollution is measured in different parts of the country, to determine where it should be reduced to meet more stringent air purity standards, for one year, until October 2018.
On Tuesday, a group of 15 States, mostly democratic, along with the Federal district of Columbia filed a lawsuit alleging that the intention was illegal.

Mikey Garcia and Vasily Lomachenko meet for the first time, there is a conversation about the possibility of a decisive match
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who appear to be steadily moving towards having the most exciting Boxing match in the weight range of up to 147 pounds in the near future, first met on Thursday.
They occupied separate rooms in the ESPN channel offices in Los Angeles until Garcia, the undefeated lightweight champion of the world Boxing Council, walked down the corridor to welcome Lomachenko, world Boxing organization champion in the second Featherweight.
After Garcia's unanimous victory over the former world champion in four weight categories Erian Broner on Saturday on the channel "Showtime" both boxers are in the top five boxers, regardless of weight categories.
Garcia stretched out his right hand and said, "how are you, Champ?
Good luck."
Lomachenko defends his belt in a duel with Miguel Marriaga on Saturday at seven o'clock in the evening on ESPN channel.
When boxers posed for a photo, the Manager of Lomachenko Egis Klimas noticed that potential decisive fight between them would be just right.
"I used to be a Featherweight," Garcia recalled.
"I climbed the category for the sake of Broner [up to 140 pounds], but I'm not that big.
I'm too small for 140.
I want to go down to the light.
And he needs to go up to a semi-light [135 pounds], and then we'll have a fight.
This is what the fans want.
Let's give them that."
Lomachenko agreed.
"Boxing needs this fight."
Klimas asked if the fight should be broadcast via the PPV service as part of the strategy he's following to have Lomachenko conduct his 135 weight debut fight later this year to schedule a meeting with Garcia (37-0.30 knockouts) next summer, who is also interested in competing with the winner of the fight between Jorge Linares and Luke Campbell after their fight for the world light weight title at the Forum arena on September 23.
"The fight may be on PPV, because all the fans asked for it," Garcia said, expressing his readiness to fight on the channel that will offer better financial conditions.
"We are the main names.
No other names would arouse such interest.
As soon as they're ready...»
Garcia said that he considers Lomachenko "an amazing boxer" and maybe will visit his Saturday fight.
But Lomachenko didn't overwhelm Garcia with praise and said that, in his opinion, the champion in three scales from riverside looks "very slow, I'm sorry, Mikey... you were asking for a knockout."
Garcia said that he was focusing on showing the force of the blow, and then Boxing.
They both said that they felt the tension build up before their own fight.
"This fight has to take place.
No other fight evokes so much interest and conversation.
I'm more than happy to work on it, " Garcia said.
Lomachenko said: "I was waiting for someone from the top boxers, and here it is, Mikey.
It will be a great fight."

New results of tests to assess the age of asylum seekers in Sweden have been published
The latest results of the tests of asylum seekers in Sweden, who were subjected to a new method of medical age assessment, show that more than 80 percent of the tested were evaluated as persons over 18 years, but not all trust the accuracy of these results.
The Swedish national Agency for forensic medicine (Rättsmedicinalverket) started testing earlier this year.
They were designed to make the age assessment in the asylum process more accurate after the Swedish migration Agency (Migrationsverket) was criticized for not being able to determine the real age of some refugees claiming to be minors.
At the moment, Migrationsverket has sent 6,880 cases for testing, and the forensic medicine Agency has now published the results of 2,481 tests for the period between mid-March and 31 July 2017.
Eighty per cent (2002) of the test subjects were rated as 18 years of age or older, and in another 25 cases, the forensic medicine Agency assessed that the test subject was "likely to be 18 years of age or older".
In 432 cases, the conclusion was that the person was "probably less than 18".
The tests are conducted only in cases where the age of the person is in doubt.
According to Johan Goransson from the Agency of forensic medicine, the results are consistent with the previous months.
"We do not see much difference with the statistics for the past months, the numbers are quite appropriate, "he told the portal"The Local".
The high proportion of cases in which people were assessed as having reached the age of 18 did not necessarily indicate that asylum-seekers had lied about their age.
In may, the Agency published the results of 581 tests and reported that in 442 cases,"the test taker is likely 18 years or older."
However, having considered 581 published results, the newspaper "Svenska Dagbladet" found that in 243 cases, a person openly stated that 18 he is executed this year.
The method of performing a medical age assessment, which consists in making an x-ray of wisdom teeth and tomography of knee joints and giving them to dentists and radiologists for analysis, has also caused criticism in some instances.
One of the sceptics is endocrinologist Claude Marcus from the Karolinska Institute, part of whose work is to assess the biological maturity of people in order to determine whether they have passed through puberty before or later than usual.
"I had reasons to think about it, and I don't think that it is necessary to use the methods of measurement that are used now.
Biological age is thus determined very inaccurately.
If we are unable to determine with certainty, we should not pretend you can," he told the newspaper "Metro".
However, Geranssen from the Agency of forensic medicine spoke in favor of the accuracy of the tests: "in General, we can say that the risk of mistaking a child for an adult is small.
The biggest risk we face when a person is about to be 18, in this case it is about 10 percent."
I'll think about running for President.
During his working trip to Buryatia, Vladimir Putin said that he was ready to think whether he would run for President of Russia in the elections in 2018, Interfax reports.
This statement was a response to the request of the residents of the village Cheremushki Buryat region.
During a video conference on the elimination of fire in Buryatia and Irkutsk region, the interlocutor appealed to Putin with the words: "Vladimir Vladimirovich, we have a request to you: when the next presidential election, we all ask you to run again for this post."
"Well, I will think, thank you," the President said in response.
On July 28, press Secretary of the President of Russia Dmitry Peskov commented on the statements of some media that the election headquarters of Vladimir Putin will be headed by the head of the presidential administration Anton Vaino.
Peskov called these assumptions"based on nothing, hypothetical arguments".
"There are no headquarters yet, the creation of headquarters is far away, the election campaign is far away," Peskov said.
"While it is not on the agenda," said Peskov.
The Governor of West Virginia said that he moved to another party
The Governor of West Virginia, a representative of the Democratic party Jim justice announced on Thursday during a rally with President trump that goes to another party.
"Like it or not, the Democrats have drifted away from me," Governor justice said.

The rally exploded with applause.

"As a coach, I would tell you that the time to play is different."

Forbes notes that he owns coal mines in five States, as he inherited the coal business from his father.
His fortune is estimated at $ 1.59 billion.
Meanwhile, the Republican national Committee released a statement on Thursday night that " Governor justice's transition to another party is another blow to the Democratic party, which is more of a hindrance than working to make our country great again."
"Given the total of 15 governors and control over the least number of state legislatures in history, Governor justice's statement is just another rejection of a party that has no top – to - bottom leaders and is unable to find positive, unifying messages," Rona McDaniel, a Representative of the national Committee of the Republican party, told CBS News.

International track and field specialist Sebastian CoE on Thursday praised what he called a sincere apology from Russia in connection with the doping scandal, but reiterated that now is not the right time to allow the country to participate in sports competitions.
Russian representative of the athletics Federation Dmitry Shlyakhtin said at the Congress of The international Association of athletics federations, which was held on the eve of the world Championships in athletics that the removal of his country from sports competitions was fair and that he is determined to fight doping.
He apologized "to all athletes who had stolen gold and silver medals at competitions".
Despite his comments, the Congress of the International Association of athletics federations voted to maintain the suspension, imposed in November 2015 after the World anti-doping Agency (WADA) has released a report which found evidence of doping, funded by the state.
"It seemed to me that today's answer, today's report were very sincere," the President of the international Association of athletics federations told reporters.
"The whole Council and the whole Congress liked it... that the Russian Federation itself recognizes that it has experienced extremely hot times and is now doing everything possible to take care of the restructuring of the Federation."
CoE said he also "liked" that Russia agreed with the criteria for its recovery.
"I believe that it was a very constructive day and that we are moving forward, but Congress supports the recommendations of the special Commission, according to which now is not the time to restore Russia's rights," said CoE.
"Over the next few months, we must do everything to resolve this situation.
Our leading principle was the desire to separate the pure from the tainted athletes system," he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes, who meet the strict criteria of the international Association of athletics federations, will participate under a neutral flag in the world athletics championship, which will begin on Friday in London.
The head of the special Commission of the international Association of athletics federations rune Andersen said on Monday that for the restoration of Russia has yet to fulfill a number of requirements.
As he told reporters in London after a report made at the Council Of the international Association of athletics federations, drug testing is still not carried out in sufficient volume, and suspended coaches are still quietly doing their job.

As the financial rules of football will affect the transfer of Neymar to Paris
Rules aimed at preventing unlimited spending by European football clubs will not prevent Neymar's world-record transfer from Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris Saint-Germain.
Whatever the consequences may come further down the chain, for Paris Saint-Germain on the part of UEFA, the governing body that controls European football, in whose power to prohibit teams from participating in the prestigious tournament "Champions League".
From the rules of financial "fair play", introduced by UEFA in 2011, it follows that "PSG" in the end will have to show that the transfer of Neymar was financed without major losses.
Barcelona paid 222 million euros (262 million dollars) just to free the Brazilian from the contract, and Neymar will receive a salary that will reach tens of millions of dollars a year.
Here are some financial aspects of Neymar's move to France.
"PSG" can definitely fork out to hire Neymar and add him to the galaxy of other stars, given the team's funding from the energy-rich ruling family of Qatar.
Clubs have the right to spend large amounts on the acquisition of players, but they have to balance them with legitimate sources of income to reach the profitability threshold in their football business.
"FFP" introduced Michel Platini after his election as UEFA President in 2007.
A former French football player believed that clubs that were in huge debt in their quest for success were essentially cheating and risking ruin if banks or owners stopped funding.
In 2011, "PZPN" ceased to focus on the debts of the clubs, and instead switched to keeping track of their losses.
As a result of this change, the business model that Roman Abramovich initially used in Chelsea in 2003-to buy a club with good potential, and then to spend a lot of money to improve the team and create a global brand – has become a difficult plan.
During this three-year evaluation period, which is exciting 2018, clubs may suffer a loss of 30 million euros.
And, despite the fact that Platini disgrace was removed from the presidential post in 2015, his successor in the UEFA Aleksander Ceferin, founder still determined to keep a lid on excessive spending.
"Of course, "PZPN" alive, and we, moving forward, we will tighten the rules," said last week the Agency "associated Press" Andrea Traverso, controlling the "FFP" UEFA.
Although PSG will pay the buyout of neymar's contract at the same time, He can distribute this amount for reporting throughout the term of his contract.
Neymar signed a five-year contract, so the transfer value can be shown in the annual accounts as a cost of 44.4 million euros over the next five years.
During the first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014, severe sanctions were applied to PSG and to Manchester city, which belongs to Abu Dhabi.
PSG was fined 60 million euros (at the rate of 82 million dollars), which was later reduced to 20 million euros, and was ordered to limit the composition of his team in the "Champions League" during the season 2014-1015 years 21 players instead of the usual 25.
UEFA monitors clubs who might try to outsmart it financial inspection, inflating its income for the account of companies related to the owners of the club.
Although the Qatari company could have sponsored PSG, if the amount of funding had been found to exceed the standard market rates, UEFA would not have allowed it to be considered a legitimate income.
This is exactly what happened in 2014, when UEFA decided that the amount of funding for PSG from the Qatar tourism Authority was inflated.
It was reported that part of Neymar's earnings in PSG could come in the form of payments from the organizing Committee of the world Cup 2022 in Qatar.
But PSG and Qatar-2022 deny that Neymar will become the world Cup Ambassador, and such a maneuver could easily be found by the UEFA inspectors.
Past sanctions imposed on PSG mean that UEFA will be even more closely monitoring any attempts to circumvent the rules.
As reported on Thursday, persons familiar with the situation, UEFA did not conduct preliminary discussions with PSG about the transfer of Neymar.
They communicated with the associated Press on condition of anonymity, as they are not authorized to discuss the position of PSG.
According to the latest published reports, in 2015-1016 PSG received more than 10 million euros in profit with a turnover of 542.4 million euros.
The accounts for the last financial year have not yet been published.
PSG expects that Neymar's arrival will be a favorable ground for sponsorship deals, sales of attributes and t-shirts with the team's logo.
The club assumes that the turnover will grow by at least 30 percent due to the hiring of a new player.
Undoubtedly angry that one of the best players is leaving, the Spanish League tried to prevent Neymar's transfer, saying that PSG will violate the financial "fair play".
"This is an obvious case of" financial doping", with the club and the state, "President of La Liga Javier Tebas told the Spanish newspaper AS, bearing in mind that the ultimate owner of PSG is Qatar.
Coach "Arsenal" Arsene Wenger, whose club belongs to the American sports tycoon, shared the La League about the club's funding by the state.
"It's all the consequences of equity, and it's completely changed the landscape of football over the last fifteen years," Wenger said Thursday.
"When the club belongs to the country, everything is possible.
It becomes very difficult to comply with financial fair play because the country can have many ways and many reasons to be represented by such a serious player.
The order and places of the oath will be determined by the President
Where and how the new Russian citizens will swear allegiance to the Russian Federation will be determined by the President - such amendments to the second reading of the relevant law was developed by the state Duma Committee on legislation and state construction.
A week ago, the deputies planned to directly determine the order of the oath in the law.
From the solemn oath will be released children under 18 years, as well as incapacitated, follows from the revised text of amendments to the bill "on citizenship of the Russian Federation" (there is at the disposal of "News"), which the Committee will consider July 11 before the second reading at its meeting.
The idea of the introduction of the oath of citizenship of the Russian Federation is the formal signing of documents, President Vladimir Putin supported a June 6 meeting with the speaker of the state Duma Vyacheslav Volodin.
Deputies issued this idea in the form of amendments to the second reading in the bill providing for the abolition of the decision to grant citizenship to those who were subsequently convicted of a number of crimes of a terrorist or extremist nature: for example, for public calls for terrorism or its public justification in the media or on the Internet (part 2 of article 205.2 of the criminal code), as well as for the hijacking of an airplane, train or water transport, but only if this act is related to terrorism (part 4 of article 211 of the criminal code).
According to the draft law, the logic was as follows: when preparing documents for citizenship, a person signs a promise to comply with Russian legislation - getting on the path of extremism, he violates this promise.
The bill in April was submitted to the state Duma by the leaders of the Duma factions Vladimir Vasiliev ("United Russia"), Gennady Zyuganov (Communist party), Vladimir Zhirinovsky (LDPR), Sergei Mironov ("Fair Russia") and the speaker of the state Duma Vyacheslav Volodin.
On may 19, the deputies adopted it in the first reading.
Last week, the state construction and legislation Committee of the state Duma approved the text of the draft law for the second reading, but now it has been revised once again.
Now it says that the order of oath will be established by the President of the Russian Federation.
Previously, the parliamentarians were going to describe the procedure directly in the law "on citizenship of the Russian Federation", stating that the ceremony should be held in a solemn atmosphere in front of the state emblem and flag of Russia in the presence of the representative of the interior Ministry.
However, it was not clear from the text of the draft law where such an event should take place - the list of places where the placement of the emblem of the Russian Federation is possible is regulated by the relevant Federal constitutional law.
These include courts, offices of heads of state bodies of subjects, municipalities, judges, prosecutors, heads of Federal Executive bodies, etc.
Most likely, it could be registry Offices.
Those who wish to obtain Russian citizenship will take a solemn oath after officials check their documents.
But a person will receive a Russian passport only after he takes the oath, it follows from the revised text.
A week ago, the draft stated that the oath must precede the signing of the decree.
The updated text States that Russia will be sworn in from 18 years, not 14.
The rule remains that incapacitated or partially capable persons, as well as those who cannot pronounce, read or sign the oath text themselves, will be released from taking the oath.
In addition, the Russian President has the right to release from this procedure and "other persons",
Also in the updated bill the special order of reception in the Russian citizens of Ukraine who are considered native speakers of Russian is registered.
They will have to officially renounce their Ukrainian citizenship by submitting an appropriate application to the authorized body of Ukraine.
A notarized copy of the application will need to be handed over to Russian officials.
Renunciation of" foreign "citizenship, as now, is not required if it is provided by an international Treaty or if it is impossible"for reasons beyond the control of the person."
The corresponding amendment to the law was proposed by a group of deputies, including the first Vice-speaker of the state Duma Ivan Melnikov (Communist party), Natalia Poklonskaya, Pavel Krasheninnikov and Airat Farrakhov (all - "United Russia").
I think many of you know that it is impossible to get a certificate from Ukraine, it is simply impossible.
Accordingly, a lot of people are waiting for the decision of their fate about the citizenship of the Russian Federation, - explained the head of the Duma Committee on state construction and legislation Pavel Krasheninnikov (ER).
In addition, the text added a clarification that restrictions on the employment of certain positions for foreigners will not apply to those who refused in writing to "other" citizenship and handed over the former passport to the Ministry of internal Affairs of Russia, but "for reasons beyond its control" it has not ceased to be considered a citizen of another country.
Now foreigners are forbidden to hold positions in the municipal service, to be employed at facilities and organizations whose activities are related to the security of Russia.
Also, a person with dual citizenship or residence permit of another country can not become a member of the state Duma or the Federation Council.
It is planned that the law should enter into force on September 1, 2017, by the time the necessary by-laws should be ready.
Nostalgia becomes niche in "Hot American summer" and " Comrade detective"
The current iteration of the story nostalgically reminiscent of the glorious days of the characters in the ' 80s; the era of grunge in the 90s (around the time when outstanding masters David Wayne and Michael Showalter did Comedy sketches, "the State" for MTV); and of itself - that is, about 2001, before stars like Elizabeth banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd moved on to more serious things.
As a fact of culture, it is both the rise and the embodiment of our era with its constant reminders from Facebook.
But as a franchise, she seems an anachronistic.
The "first day of the camp" was surprisingly good, and not only because of the absurdist humor (including the original story about a talking jar of vegetables, which was voiced by H. John Benjamin).
The result doubles the main joke: middle-aged actors play sexually anxious children who have just reached adulthood; thanks to this, the inability to return to becomes part of the joke.
"Ten years later", where adults have played adults, has less deep emotional roots, and its parody is more haphazard and includes riffs from Stalker films of the 90-ies of the type"Hands rocking the cradle."
In one episode, the character takes out an Apple Powerbook, four-Wheeler skates, and "a bunch of other stuff from 1991."
Many plot moves are the same.
Good-natured Coop (Showalter), now a writer, still hasn't achieved reciprocity from Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) is still a virgin.
And then there is the mad and mean conspiracy, which involved Ronald Reagan (also Showalter), which is now inciting George Bush Sr. (tested parody in the performance of Michael Ian Blake).
As always, the best part of the franchise is to deviate from it.
It's especially fun to see an ever-young Rudd humming a Matt Dillon song from "Singles," whose character, Andy's ex-big-man now looks like an old man.
To bring this franchise success could be random madness in the spirit of the type of recursive TV series "Seven Up" until it comes to what, in my opinion, would be its logical conclusion: "Hot American summer: twenty years later," where in the last scene the whole company would go to the movie at the premiere of the film "Hot American summer".
"Comrade detective "on Amazon refers to another type of nostalgia: memories of the cold war from" Americans"," Explosive blonde "or even" Shine " with her images of the struggle of the East and West.
This Comedy, created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka with Director Reese Thomas, depicts a television movie: a Romanian police drama of the 80s about two police officers in Bucharest fighting for truth, atheism and the Marxist-Leninist way.
Main roles - see the life of Gregor and the idealist Joseph - perform Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu u Hali, and voiced their dialogues in English Channing Tatum (he's Executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
That's brilliant.
But just an idea.
There are a few visual jokes (police spend time watching a chess match, as Americans could watch football).
The team of famous voices behind the scenes - among them Jenny slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloe sevigny-allows you to play interesting in "guess the voice".
But "Comrade detective" is so holding on to the veracity of the clumsy propaganda drama - there's even a killer in a Ronald Reagan mask - that often looks like it.
Six long episodes are drawn out, and it's not funny very often.
If it were made shorter, "Comrade detective" could do better with his satire in the spirit of agitprop; for example, every time Gregor and Joseph come to the American Embassy, two fat people sit in the lobby, absorbing a bunch of hamburgers.
To an imaginary Communist spectator, this image says that Western culture is able to make an eater out of anything.
The fictional Romanian authors of the film are not so wrong: We do so even with our own recent history, and with them too.

The state Department commented on Medvedev's words about relations between Russia and the USA
The US and Russia must be able to work with each other.
This statement was made by the official representative of the state Department Heather Nauert in response to the words of Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev on the relations between the two States.

The Ministry of energy of the Russian Federation called the cause of blackouts in the Crimea.
The head of Department Alexander Novak made explanations concerning the incident.
According to him, the Peninsula was left without electricity due to a traffic accident in the Krasnodar territory.
The truck which got to road accident touched a power line, as a result there was a shutdown of the Kuban and the Crimean networks connected with them.
Power supply failures in large Crimean cities were recorded last week.
Experts have fixed the problem within a few hours.
Initially it was reported that the cause of blackouts could be abnormal heat.
The Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.25%
It is expected that the Bank of England will later announce that interest rates will not change after weak economic growth and weakening inflation forced to subside rumors about a possible increase.
The Bank of England warned that economic growth will remain slow, and left interest rates unchanged amid growing pressure on family incomes.
Experts of the Bank's monetary policy Committee (MPC) voted with a result of 6 against 2 for the preservation of rates at the level of 0.25%, while this month fewer members of the Committee voted for an increase in the rate, because weak economic growth weakened support for the increase.
In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank limited its forecasts to an increase of 1.7% percent in 2017 and 1.6% in 2018 and warned that pressure on family incomes will continue, while it is still expected that inflation will rise to about 3% in the fall.
However, the Bank warned that rate hikes in the next few years would be necessary to control brexit-induced inflation, and said borrowing costs would probably have to be raised more than expected in the financial markets.
Also, the Committee members voted to abandon part of the huge set of measures for the development of the economy, launched a year ago due to brexit.
Starting next February, the Bank will close the emergency financing plan, which it provides cheap loans to banks, although he said that now he will have to provide another 15 billion pounds-up to 115 billion pounds.
In the Pro-rate decision Protocol, the Bank said:"according to the MPC's key forecasts, gross domestic product (GDP) growth will soon remain slow, while pressure on real household incomes continues to affect consumption."
On the issue of rates, he reiterated that "some tightening of fiscal policy" at a "slightly larger" size than markets expect " would be needed to halt inflation.
At the moment, the markets predict the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another one – in 2020.
But the Bank stressed that all increases will be" gradual "and"limited".
The Bank's forecasts for an increase this year and next year are lower than the forecasts made in may, which were equal to 1.9% and 1.7%.
The Bank left unchanged its forecast for 1.8% in 2018.
After the news, sterling fell against the dollar and the Euro.
The pound fell 0.5% to 1.31 us dollars and 0.4% to 1.11 euros.
The decision not to change the rate was made after the recent disappointing growth indicators weakened the increased expectation of an increase; GDP then rose 0.3% in the second quarter against 0.2% in the previous three months.
According to the representative of the Bank, the growth is likely to remain at 0.3% in the third quarter, although it will begin to increase slightly at the end of the year.
The Bank's latest inflation report gave little cause for joy to households hit by high inflation and very small wage increases: the pressure will increase before it falls.
The Bank added that the financial policy "cannot prevent" the Udo from earning in the next few years, but expects wages to "significantly" recover by the end of its three-year forecast.
The economy is also set to grow as a result of the growing demand for British goods, which is due to the low rate of the pound, which compensates for part of the reduced consumer spending.
The decision was made a year after last August, the rates were reduced to 0.25% after the shocking results of the referendum on the exit from the European Union, which led to the fall of the pound.
The Bank estimates that it will likely take four years to fully impact prices and the economy.
Before the Bank made its last decision on rates, there was growing noise around the proposed rate hike, as inflation was increasingly pressing on already heavily pressured households: three Committee members asked for a rate hike of 0.5% in July.
Last month, inflation fell to 2.6 percent from 2.9 percent in July, although the Bank said the fall was expected and will be compensated again in the coming months.
According to the Bank, a higher rate compared to the planned 2% is completely due to the low rate of the pound.
Andrew Montlake, Director of Mortgage brokers Koreco, said: "given the recent drop in swap rates, the mortgage market is likely to become even more competitive again, as lenders are demanding business opportunities and looking forward to a good end of the year.
The market looks especially favorable for those who are approaching the end of their existing contracts, as refinancing loans, often with the possibility of no Commission, as well as a low rate, is becoming more popular than ever."
The state health service will prescribe a controversial drug for HIV 10,000 people
Starting in September, patients will have access to a" revolutionary " drug for HIV prevention after the battle in the High court on the financing of the drug from The public health service.
National health service England announced that pre-exposure prophylaxis of HIV (Prep), a pill taken before sex, which has been shown to reduce the risk of infection in individuals who are at risk, on average, 86 percent, will now be provided by the health service during the initial three-year probationary period of about 10,000 people.
She agreed to Fund the trial after the court of appeal upheld a High court ruling last year alleging that the National health service had the ability to pay for Prep despite her claims that it should be funded by local authorities.
The move, announced on Thursday, was called a "major innovation" by President Simon Stevens of the national health service of England, and the national AIDS control authority (NAT) called it a "turning point."
Before the full launch of the program across England by April 2018, venereal clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to register people, and even more dispensaries will join the program in October.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (Prep) is a course of HIV drugs taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
Studies have shown that Prep significantly reduces the risk of HIV infection among people at risk.
When taking Prep before sex in the human body, a sufficient number of certain drugs to prevent infection with HIV.
Such drugs can be taken daily or no later than two hours before sex.
Patients eligible for the drug include homosexual and bisexual men, transgender people and people whose partners are HIV-positive and do not receive successful treatment.
The dispensaries will select suitable participants who have agreed to participate in the study, including men, women, transgender people and those whose partners are unknown, whether their HIV status is being held back by antiretroviral therapy.
People living and assigned to a General practitioner in England will also be able to apply for potential participation in the nearest venereal clinic taking part in the program.
The program will cost 10 million pounds, and the national health service of England this week after the international tender for the purchase signed an agreement on the provision of the drug.
The study is designed to evaluate all the possibilities of Prep by collecting clinical data on who is the target audience of the drug, its digestibility and use on a large scale.
"This crucial innovation should complement and strengthen the large-scale and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV.
This is another milestone in more than three decades of success in the fight against one of the biggest health threats facing humanity.
Deborah gold, President of NAT (National AIDS control authority), said: "this is a turning point in the fight against HIV.
Prep, if competently targeted at people in need and at risk, provides an opportunity to change the situation with the HIV epidemic in England.
Starting in September, people at risk for HIV, thanks to this study, conducted in England at the expense of the National health service, will have access to a new opening up means, the use of which the person can control himself, without discussing it with a partner, which will lead to the improvement of many, many lives.
We warmly welcome this news."
Ian green, President of the Terrence Higgins Foundation, said: "the first thing we need to do Now is to make sure that the test is fast-paced across the country and that no one at risk for HIV is forgotten.
Now that we have been provided with an experimental prep drug, we are moving to protect more than 10,000 people at risk for HIV."
Shadow Minister of public health Sharon Hodgson said:"We very much welcome the start of the Prep test, it is very late because of months of delays and procrastination on the part of the government."
The data demonstrate how revolutionary this drug can be as part of our approach to preventing HIV and stopping transmission of this fatal infection.
This test will bring us a step closer to a full understanding of the benefits of Prep.
It is now important that the test be rolled out as soon as possible across the country to protect people at risk for HIV and to move us one step further towards ending the spread of HIV in society.

On July 11, the deputies of the state Council of Tatarstan appealed to the President of Russia to extend the agreement and keep the name of the head of the region.
Now Tatarstan is the only subject of the Federation that has an agreement with Russia.
The head of the region is the only one whose position is called "President".
In Russia, there were difficulties in obtaining international driver's license
Traffic police units are experiencing a shortage of international driving permits (IDUs).
To get such rights, you have to wait a few weeks in line, which was a real problem for vacationers who want to go on holiday abroad in your car or rent it there.
It should be noted that the situation with international driving permits remains controversial.
The IDP was introduced in order to make it easier for the foreign police to understand what is written in the national certificate, as the information is explained in five languages.
The requirements for international rights are set out in the Vienna Convention on road traffic of 1968, but in countries that have ratified the Vienna Convention, Russian rights are recognized as such.
However, in reality it all depends on the specific police or rental office: some require IDUs, and someone enough national rights.
To be safe, drivers still receive international rights, but it should be borne in mind that in countries that have not ratified the Convention (for example, the United States, Spain, Mexico, Indonesia), the authorities have the right not to recognize any national rights or IDUs.
Now there is a problem with the forms in almost all departments of the traffic police, according to "Kommersant", having conducted a study in a number of regions.
Thus, in Moscow in subdivisions of STSI, the ticket is simply not issued, forms lacking for four months.
You can make an appointment on the website of public services, but there the queue has stretched to mid-August.
In Krasnoyarsk, the IDP can not be obtained "for technical reasons", without going into details, in the Samara region honestly say that there are no forms, a similar situation develops in other cities.
Many Muscovites have already faced the problem, and such messages appear in social networks more and more often:
Irina Burmistrova: "Guess why you can't get international law in Moscow?"
Right, because in all departments of the traffic police ended forms.
Elena Podkolzina: "a Question for those in the know."
It is necessary to obtain international law very urgently.
In Moscow, all the time scored far ahead, on the spot coupons do not give (there is a button, but the ticket can not give).
It seems to be a portal of public services shows that in St. Petersburg free time to Fig.
Has anyone tried to get in another city?
Will it?
As explained in the interior Ministry, changed the requirements for the forms of international driving permits, so the Department of traffic police carried out the delivery of new forms.
With this, and may be related to the deficit, however, it is unclear what changes is discussed, previously, this was not reported.
Forms buys the Center of special purpose in the field of road safety (tssn BDD) of the Ministry of internal Affairs and then delivers them to the Department of traffic police.
In recent years, all contracts were concluded with Goznak: in 2014-2015, almost 200 thousand forms of IDP were produced, in 2016, 15 thousand forms were purchased, in 2017 - 90 thousand, but the last contract was concluded on July 18 with First printing yard LLC for the production of 70 thousand forms.
There is a version that the CSN simply did not have time to hold a tender in time, which caused a deficit.
However, there are other versions of the lack of forms: due to the crisis, many people began to go not to Europe, but to cheaper Asian countries-China, Thailand and so on.
What are the rights received, it is unclear, so people feel reassured, therefore, there is high demand for the international "brown".
Recently it became known that professional drivers will have to pass an exam to confirm their qualifications.
This proposal was made by the Ministry of transport.
International driving license (IDP) of the new model is valid from may 31, 2011.
The Minister of justice of Ukraine refused to believe in the construction of the Crimean bridge
The Minister of justice of Ukraine Pavel Petrenko said he did not believe in Russia's ability to build a bridge to the Crimea.
On Friday, August 4, he told about it in interview to the portal "Observer".
No self-respecting international company will even put a bolt or a nut there, because it risks losing its business in the EU, the US, Japan - in countries that have joined sanctions against Russia against Crimea.
"That is, in my deep conviction, the prospects for this project is actually not", - said Petrenko.
He added that he believes Russia is unable to implement a major infrastructure project on its own.
Russia can't build a smaller-scale objects.
I know that after the Olympics, entire stadiums have already begun to collapse in Sochi.
"Therefore, I think the best tool in this situation - sanctions against companies that were so short - sighted to join this project," - said the official.
31 Jul builders has completed construction of a arch automotive arch Crimean bridge.
On the Kerch Bank completed the Assembly of the road arch of the Crimean bridge: its arch is closed at a height of 45 meters from the base of the structure.
"At the same time bridge builders prepared to the installation on the Seine estuary supports the arch rail", - have informed in information centre of the project.
In April, the head of the Ministry of transport Maxim Sokolov informed Russian President Vladimir Putin that the construction of the facility is ahead of schedule.
Crimean bridge will connect the Crimean Peninsula and Krasnodar region.
In Spain, fired an official who 10 years did not go to work
What kind of angelic patience (or absolute indifference to the public service) should have been the head of the Spanish official Carles Recio?
Permanent absence dragged on for 10 long years.
However, Mr. Recio was still dismissed.
But not his immediate superior.
What only in the world of bureaucrats does not happen.
The inhabitants seem to have long been accustomed to all the antics of "servants of the people."
And, nevertheless, officials all the time manage to surprise those on whose taxes they live well.
This time" sensation " came from Spain.
There is an employee of the archive of Valencia Carles Recio managed for ten years not to go to work.
At the same time he regularly received a salary.
And all solid-50 thousand euros a year.
And now Mr. Recio's" wonderful times " are over.
He was fired by the decision of the legislative Assembly of Valencia.
The investigation revealed that the malicious truant every working morning came to the office at 07:00 to check in the electronic system.
And then he went home right away.
Once again, he appeared at the workplace at 16:00, to again check in the system that he had left.
And so 10 years.
Also it became known that all free time the truant devoted to drawing of comics at home.
Now the deputies of the legislative Assembly of Valencia are thinking how to punish and the immediate superior Mr. Recio, who could not but know how to "work actively" in his workplace his subordinate.
Judges were asked to defend from the chairmen
The presidential Council for human rights (HRC), on behalf of Vladimir Putin, has developed proposals to strengthen the independence of the judiciary.
The HRC proposes to limit the powers of court presidents and introduce their election.
For courts of appeal and cassation instances, the HRC wants to introduce special districts that will not be tied to the administrative-territorial division in the Russian Federation.
The Supreme court should also submit its proposals within the framework of the presidential instruction.
The HRC has completed the development of proposals that will strengthen the independence of the Russian justice.
This work was carried out by the HRC on behalf of Vladimir Putin on January 3, 2017, which the President gave after a meeting with members of the Council.
At a meeting with the Council members on December 8, 2016, they discussed, among other things, some cases of judicial arbitrariness, as well as problems of public control in places of detention of citizens (see "Kommersant" on December 9).
The outcome of the HRC work was 25 proposals, which relate to both issues of ensuring the independence of judges and identifying judicial errors, and the financing of courts and legal education.
One of the ideas of the Kremlin human rights activists is to limit the powers of the court presidents to increase the independence of the other judges.
If the candidate for the position of judge successfully passed the competition and received the support of the judicial community, the Chairman of the court, according to the HRC, should submit him to the appointment, not having the right to refuse, as it allows now the law.
It is also proposed to deprive the President of the right to distribute cases between the judges.
Experts admit that a specially written computer program can do this.
Also in the HRC, we believe that the Chairman shall not have the right "to predetermine the outcome of the qualification attestation of a judge, to initiate the institution of disciplinary proceedings, to make decisions on the establishment of additional material benefits".
At the same time, the presidential Council considers it necessary to move to "the election of court presidents by the judges themselves" and "to give them powers for a relatively short period with mandatory rotation".
Now all court presidents (from Republican to district) are appointed for six years by the President on the recommendation of the Chairman of the Supreme court.
In order to protect judges from the pressure of regional administrations, the HRC proposes to organize an appeal and cassation in courts of General jurisdiction in a new way.
Now their structure is tied to the administrative-territorial division in the Russian Federation.
The HRC says that"it is necessary to ensure the organization of individual courts of appeal and cassation instances not at the level of regional judicial bodies in the subjects of the Russian Federation, but in judicial districts."
Experts take as a basis the practice of arbitration courts.
They have " judicial districts "that do not coincide with the administrative division in the Russian Federation, but guarantee greater independence from regional officials, who find it difficult to use"telephone law".
The HRC proposes to strengthen the justices of the peace with the participation of people's assessors to consider some "categories of civil and administrative cases".
For example, the deprivation of parental rights, the restoration of the work, the protection of honor and dignity, the deprivation of driver's rights, etc.
"These are only our proposals, "explained" Kommersant " member of the HRC, the judge of the constitutional court in resignation Tamara wrinkle.
She also recalled that the President's instruction related not only to the HRC, but also to the Supreme court (SC), which has not yet disclosed its proposals.
Time for the execution of orders from the sun (among the co - prosecutors-the Prosecutor General and the Commissioner for human rights in Russia) is still there.
Chairman of the Supreme court Vyacheslav Lebedev should report to Vladimir Putin on how effectively the independence of justice is ensured in Russia by September 1.
Live a high life: the half-floor and cunning design techniques have turned this small apartment in Earls Court in a spacious home
Joan Lee, a former banker with a passion for property renovation, moved from a spacious house in Knightsbridge to an apartment in Earls Court in 2014.
The apartment is on the first floor of a pretty typical Queen Anne style house, and in favor of the new design says that Joan didn't pack up her things and move again.
"I used to live with my ex in Knightsbridge on a much larger area," says Joan.
"I was looking for something comparable for my money.
I was shown this apartment in Earls Court, and it had the same high ceilings.
I fell in love with her and offered the price the same day."
Since the first viewing, the 1000 square foot apartment has undergone a complete renovation.
Originally it was a one-bedroom apartment with a complex layout – to get into the bedroom, you had to go through the kitchen – and Joanna wanted to add storage space and a half-floor to get the most out of the generous height of the ceilings.
"I wanted high ceilings, large Windows, lots of light.
Those were my demands, " she says.
To this end, she hired Erfan Azadi from the Notting hill-based architectural design Studio Duck & Shed to use 12.5-foot-high ceilings to create a home that would not only be a successful project, but would be suitable for Joan to live.
The ceiling was not high enough to arrange two rooms one above the other, so the architectural task was to create a half-floor where you could stand in full growth.
Erfan had to think creatively to cope with the briefing.
"Working with steel structures is very difficult," he explains.
"We had to arrange the rooms so that they were one above the other, and did not have to bend.
It was necessary not only to build a simple platform, but also to bend the structures so that they were at the correct height and allowed to use the premises from above and below."
This solution allowed Erfan to arrange two full – size rooms one above the other in the allotted space-and many more interesting things.
From the mezzanine through vintage copper light window from "Retrouvius" overlooking chic living room downstairs.
Mirrored furniture with gold trim, silver accents and vintage lighting from Serge MUI set the style of the project.
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding entertainment, space and light.
The short corridor is framed by mirrors to make it seem longer.
In the kitchen, the mirror protective panel seems to be a window to another room.
At the entrance mirror cabinets are used to store all the dishes Joan.
To create a feeling of more luxurious space, the beauty of the living room can block the kitchen when it is not used.
In the folding kitchens there is nothing new.
The uniqueness of this kitchen is that it is sliding up the door, as in the garage.
"Here were involved in the engineering art," explores the is Irfan about steel reinforced wood fiber panel doors.
"It's equipped with a counterweight, so when you push the door up, it slides very easily."
Thanks to the reasonable use of space and storage space, Joan received an additional 16 square meters, an additional bedroom and improved layout.
"After all, floor space is exactly what you will be selling, that is, what your property is valued at," Erfan says.
"Roughly speaking, the agent for real estate will come in and make calculations based on the square of the sexes".
Here they were able to increase the floor area, using quality materials that give the space a touch of luxury.
"The materials are what we touch, so they help create an emotional connection with the house," Erfan says.
"No one falls in love with the wiring in the walls.
It is important, but it does not touch the strings of our hearts."
This is an indication that due to the good design and increased footage the apartment can turn from something ordinary into something amazing.
In fact, like Joan, you can decide to stay.

Foreign Ministry outraged by the blocking of the statements of the UN security Council about the attacks on the Embassy of the Russian Federation
The Russian foreign Ministry is outraged by the actions of certain Western diplomatic representatives who block the statements of the UN security Council in the press condemning the terrorist attacks on the Russian Embassy in Syria.
It is reported by the Russian foreign Ministry.
The Ministry recalled that the territory of the Russian Embassy in Damascus on August 2 for the third time in a month was subjected to mortar fire from terrorists of groups "Hayat Tahrir Al-sham" (the former "Jabhat al-Nusra", banned in Russia) and "Filak Al-Rahman".
Taking into account that the international community is unanimous in the qualification of "Nusra" as a terrorist organization, and the UN security Council resolution calls to oppose this structure, the Russian foreign Ministry noted that "it would seem, it goes without saying that the terrorist attacks of "Nusra" should meet universal unconditional and decisive condemnation, and in the assessments of attacks against diplomatic missions should not be any ambiguity."
However, as stressed in the diplomatic Ministry, "for the third time in a month diplomatic representatives of the United States, Britain, France and Ukraine in the UN Security Council, alternately, varying the tone of objections, hiding behind the arguments about the alleged lack of necessary information, blocked the proposal of the Russian Federation to adopt a standard short draft statement of the security Council for the press condemning terrorist attacks on the Russian diplomatic mission in the Syrian capital."
The reluctance to show diplomatic solidarity with us should remain on the conscience of those delegations.
"The most shocking thing is that the failure of the Security Council to condemn the acts of terrorists encourages them to new provocations and terrorist attacks, gives them a sense of impunity," - said the foreign Ministry and added that "I would not like these barbarians created the belief that someone in the Security Council with them at the same time."
Vladimir Putin spoke in favor of limiting the number of unscheduled inspections of business
During the meeting on investment projects in the far East, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that the number of unscheduled inspections of entrepreneurs should be reduced to 30% of the planned number, and also said that it is necessary to limit the period of inspections to ten days.
"Unscheduled inspections are carried out, as a rule, without appropriate coordination with the Prosecutor's office; only 2-3% is coordinated with the Prosecutor's office, everything else goes on its own," President TASS quoted.
Vladimir Putin also said that investigators should be banned from seizing servers and hard drives at enterprises.
In addition, according to the President, business associations should have the right to protect the interests of their members in court.
"I hope that this will bring some positive results in the consideration of cases related to business activities or related to the violation of the law in the field of entrepreneurship," the head of state said.
As reported by Kommersant, due to the moratorium on scheduled inspections, the number of other types of inspections of entrepreneurs is growing.
In may, by order of the business Ombudsman under the President of Russia Boris Titov, a survey was conducted, as a result of which it was found that there was actually a replacement of planned inspections by unscheduled (the share of those who faced them increased from 21.9% in 2015 to 30.8% in 2016), Prosecutor's (from 16.9% to 21.8%), RAID (from 7.9% to 13.3%), as well as inspections on applications of citizens (growth from 15% to 19.5%) and administrative investigations (10.8% to 15.5%).
More information about business inspections in the material "Kommersant "" to small businesses came from the other side."
The brothers are fighting for an Empire of real estate worth more than $ 500 million
Two brothers are fighting for one of the largest empires in Victoria in the property trade worth more than $ 500 million - forty years after their Italian ancestors founded the dynasty.
Former Director of football club Carlton and developer Colin de lutis lives in the Palace of Turak through three doors from his younger brother Paul, who filed against him in the Supreme court for the division of possessions and assets.
Paul wants to leave the family business in 2014, but the Supreme court is still drawn to a fierce dispute about the terms of the divorce.
Together with his mother, Anna brothers own 87 objects worth more than half a billion dollars, purchased since 1973, their family bought a shop on Smith street in Collingwood.
There, the family founded the company "Westco Jeans", which grew into a network of 160 outlets.
It was sold in 1999 for $ 85 million.
The money was invested in real estate, and the list of De lutis family possessions includes today office buildings, building plots in Brunswick and Sorrento, apartments on the Gold coast and in mount Buller and shopping centers in the suburbs.
In agreement with his late father, Colin - whom Paul describes as "the main driving force and dominant personality" of the De lutis family - owns about two - thirds of the company's assets, and the Floor-about one-third.
According to the court, that means Colin's property is 316 million and Paul's is 176 million.
The division of property and money became a stumbling block for the Floor.
"The section proposed by Colin gives him, in my opinion, the best parts of the property," he wrote in his first testimony in 2015.
Last Friday, after several unsuccessful attempts at reconciliation, the first hearings in the Supreme court were held.
The brothers are now arguing over who will control the existing business - of which, according to Paul, Colin excluded him.
Colin claims that it is not, however, blames the Floor in the mismanagement of certain objects.
In Colin's testimony at the beginning of the trial, he says he hopes to resolve the dispute.
"My Italian roots make me consider family a top priority," he wrote.
Court costs are rising like a snowball: hundreds of pages of testimony, emails, and reports from companies like Deloitte, Pitcher Partners, and Charter Keck Cramer are attached to the case; both sides have brought in the most prominent attorneys, including Royal lawyer Allan Myers, and the best solicitors.
Mrs. De lutis and her late husband Luigi were immigrants from Italy; since the late 1950s they ran dairy bars and grocery stores, and in the early 1970s bought a shop in Brunswick.
Under financial guarantees, they bought a store in Collingwood, where Colin opened the first family jeans store.
Colin says he launched Westco when he was "in the last grades of school and Paul was then a boy (about 10 years)."
Anna De lutis says that he and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to transfer their possession to their sons without conflict.
"Luigi often told me that he did not want the brothers to understand the court," she wrote.
The other two brothers, mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De lutis group of companies; Colina says that mark received 10 million when he went out of business, and Luke 26 million.
According to Paul, both Luke and mark were "unhappy with the financial conditions of their Department."
Colin was not a public figure, although he was a former member of the Board of Directors of the AFL club and, according to published in 2015 biography of Eddie McGuire, best friend of the TV star.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul and their lawyers on Friday.
Only Colin replied, with a text message saying that since the case had not yet been heard in court, "I really have nothing to say."
"I am very, very sorry that my brother Paul has decided to sue me and rattle our family's name in court," he wrote.
In the middle of 2016 Colin wrote in testimony that he tried to meet the requirements of the brother.
"Our father wouldn't want to see me and Paul arguing in court, "he said, adding that he"still hopes to resolve the conflict."
On Friday, this hope seems to have dissipated.
"The decision on our case will be made by the court soon," Colin wrote.
The new head of trump's office plans to limit the flow of information to the President.
Others tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly will really succeed.
In that case, he will be the first.
"Politico" reports that the new head of the White house office plans to limit the flow of information coming to President Trump, including news reports from the media - hoping to keep the chief in a more calm state.
That's what tells reporter Josh Dose.
"At a meeting held by the New white house chief of staff, John F. Kelly, with the leadership of the apparatus on his first working day, he outlined the main problem in the White house under President Donald trump, which he hopes to solve: bad channels of information to the President."
Kelly told the staff that the information should go through him - in paper form or through briefings - because the President will be better at making decisions if he gets the right information.
Kelly's diagnosis is perfectly correct, but others have already failed, trying to tame trump by tracking the flow of information to him.
President trump's relationship with television was established a few decades ago - and now that he's in the White house, his habit of watching TV is still strong.
"When trump, as a candidate, was outraged by the unfair coverage of the campaign, it was useful to demonstrate to him that he was getting fair coverage in publications that could be persuaded, "Sam Nanberg, a former adviser to the election headquarters, told Politico in February.
Tara Palmeri wrote then in "Politico"that" according to six former members of the electoral staff to keep under control the habit of trump to tweet, it was necessary to ensure that the incoming personally to him information was a constant stream of praise."
Good.
But the idea that trump's habit of tweeting has ever been "under control" is just ridiculous.
Maybe these members of the electoral staff know something we don't-for example, that if it weren't for them, trump's tweets would be even more provocative.
We may never know about tweets that trump hasn't posted.
If his staff saved him from trouble at least a few times, their efforts were not in vain.
But nobody has been able to always keep trump from podlivaya fuel to the fire.
Part of the problem is that in a White house divided into rival factions, people are constantly trying to advance their agenda by feeding Trump material - reliable or not - that confirms their views.
"Politico" - just to this story-wrote in may about the tendency of advisers to constantly slip to the President questionable information.
Here is one example described by reporter Shane Goldmacher:
"Trump's current and former employees say that trump can respond very sharply to negative press reports, especially those containing dangerous information leaks, and won't rest until he finds out who was behind them.
So it happened in late February, when someone slipped the President a printout of the article GotNews.com, the website of Internet provocateur Charles K. Johnson, in which Deputy chief of staff Katie Welsh was accused of being "behind a series of leaks" in the White house.
It doesn't matter that Johnson is forever banned from Twitter for aggressive behavior, that he didn't present specific facts, or that in the past he has launched false accusations and then abandoned them.
Trump read the article and began to ask employees about Welsh."
Goldmacher adds that then-chief of staff Raines Pribus and Secretary of staff Rob porter " tried to build a system to manage the flow of securities that trump receives, and document them."
How it worked?
Three months later, Kelly tries to do the same.
Maybe he will prove to be a more effective Manager than Pribus, but trump still has an impulsive nature, and his aides are still fighting each other for influence.
These constant factors make Kelly's task very difficult.
Tyumen Prosecutor's office is struggling with the HIV dissident
The Prosecutor's office challenged the decision of the Kalinin district court of Tyumen, which stopped the criminal case against a local resident, who died from HIV young daughter.
The child was allegedly killed because the mother was an HIV-dissident and refused treatment.
However, the court released her from responsibility in connection with reconciliation with the injured father.
The Prosecutor's office believes that the crime can not be left unpunished, so as not to create a precedent for other HIV-dissidents.
The case against a resident of Tyumen was initiated under part 1 of Art. 109 of the criminal code (causing death by negligence) in April - after the HIV infection 4B stage died of her three-year-old daughter.
According to the Prosecutor's office, the mother herself is HIV-infected.
"The woman was not treated herself and refused to treat her daughter, believing that HIV infection does not exist," explained the Prosecutor's office of the Tyumen region.
The criminal case was received by the Kalinin district court of Tyumen, which on July 25 decided to terminate it.
The petition for it was submitted by the father of the lost girl, having explained that"forgave the wife, claims to her has no, she has made amends and has apologized".
The Prosecutor's office did not agree with the decision of the court and filed an appeal, demanding to cancel the decision on the termination of the case and send it to a new trial.
The girl died, and it is impossible to make amends for the damage caused by the crime.
The HIV-infected mother, contrary to the recommendations of doctors, refused to examine the baby and treat her from a dangerous infection," the press service of the Prosecutor's office reported.
According to the Supervisory authority, she must be punished, otherwise her example will be followed by other HIV-dissidents.
As told in the Tyumen AIDS Center, now in the Tyumen region about 12 children with HIV, do not receive medical care because of the refusal of parents.
"And this situation has already improved - for the year of the special group half of parents who categorically refused to treat children with HIV, changed their opinion - allowed to diagnose, began to take drugs," - said the press Secretary of the AIDS Center Elena Loseva.
According to her, it is impossible to influence parents in a legislative way, and as a result not all HIV-infected children it is possible to find - mothers don't allow them to examine, disappear, run away with children from hospitals.
What are the dangers of HIV dissidents
At the end of last year, St. Petersburg sociologists presented the results of the first study of the so-called movement of HIV-dissidents in Russia.
HIV dissidents are people who deny the existence of HIV and refuse to take medication.
Doctors and activists of AIDS-service NGOs call such views anti-medical, and in their spread they see a serious threat.
A terrible photo shoot, which ended in a tragedy, took place on Thursday, August 3, at the railway station of Grechany in Khmelnitsky.
The cheerful company of the tipsy young people walked the bridge over railway tracks where just there was a freight train.
One of the friends had an idea to make a spectacular selfie on the roof of the car, told the "FACTS" in the sector of police communication in the Khmelnytsky region.
The guy began to go down from the bridge to the train, but because of his negligence, he caught on to the power line and instantly received an electric shock.
Fortunately, about this case it became known to the station Manager who immediately called "ambulance".
Before arrival of doctors of the victim moved to a safe place, and then hospitalized in burn Department of Khmelnytsky regional clinical hospital.
The man was diagnosed with burns of the trunk of 1-2 degrees.
Now his condition is assessed as stable by doctors.
Law enforcement officers remind that in recent years, becoming increasingly popular extreme selfies on the roofs of high-rise buildings, bridges, moving vehicles.
The police urge people to be vigilant and prevent such photo shoots, especially among children and adolescents.
Scientists allowed the existence of the oceans on ancient Venus
On the ancient Venus could exist in the oceans.
This assumption was made by French scientists.
Experts have created a computer model that demonstrated the formation of water on the surface of the planets, writes Science News.
It turned out that Venus at the beginning of its history formed oceans, which were 10% more water than now on Earth.
Earlier, "Arguments of the week" wrote that, according to the hypothesis of scientists, the ocean 4 billion years ago could exist on Mars.
Foreign experts in the course of their research came to the conclusion that the water object was located in the Northern hemisphere of the red planet.

The Gypsies crossed the moat and returned to the " street of millionaires»
Some of the wealthiest homeowners in the West Midland are once again in conflict with the determined Roma who have crossed a moat dug by the municipal authorities to re-occupy the field next to their homes.
Gypsies parked 20 caravans in a field bordering on rich street, Solihull, received the playful title of "street of millionaires".
Bringing with him horses, babies and a lot of houses on wheels, they came back after they were kicked out not later than in may, and they did not prevent the ditch, dug by the municipal authorities to prevent their invasion.
This tactful company found a gap in the fortifications and pushed their vehicles through a section that was left unprotected to leave room for the trail.
Enraged residents attacked the municipality of Solihull, saying he was "unable to solve the problem."
An anonymous local resident reported:"They came here on Monday evening, after being driven out of Bentley Heath, where they threw stones at passers-by."
The municipality should be shamed and forced to act because they are completely unable to solve the problem.
The Gypsies were here in may, they were driven away, and here they are again.
Last night, more Gypsies arrived, and today, perhaps even more.
"Birmingham municipality knows how to solve this problem, they get long - term court orders to protect their parks," she added.
I live on Streetsbrook road, and I don't like that I continue to pay Council tax, and the municipality can't even end it".
A local resident who wished to remain anonymous said: "it's funny, we just saw these Gypsies leave the previous time, and here, please, this attack continues."
This time there were more of them, and we even saw a horse grazing in the meadow."
The representative of the municipality of Solihull said: "We know about illegal camp on land near Streetsbrook road and cooperate with the police Solihull; we have taken the necessary legal steps in order as soon as possible to get rid of them".
To help us collect evidence, it is important that as many local residents as possible report any anti-social or criminal behavior to the police on the phone 101.
This gives us an idea of the situation that the court will consider when we present our case to them.

The Ministry of agriculture of the Crimea stated that if within the next three years there are no funds for the modernization of the enterprise, there will be a threat of plant shutdown.
Depreciation of fixed assets in the company is about 60-70%.
The company's modernization needs of 1.2 billion RUB due To the peculiarities of the organizational-legal form it is obliged to give 50% of profits to the budget.
What remains is not enough to implement the modernization plan.
"Get the money from the owner, it is problematic to speak about the borrowing of large credit institutions is difficult," - said the Deputy head of the Ministry of agriculture of the Crimea Sergey Petelin in April of this year.
The Parliament of Crimea included the company in the forecast privatization plan for 2017.
It was proposed to hold its corporatization and put up for auction.
The source of Interfax in the Crimean authorities estimated the possible cost of the sale of the enterprise at $40 million, the investor's investments in modernization at another $30 million.

Nizhny Novgorod third-graders defeated more than 40 tombstones
Employees of the Ministry of internal Affairs of the Nizhny Novgorod region identified citizens who destroyed 46 tombstones in the cemetery of Lyskovo.
Third-grade students turned out to be criminals.
The first statement that the gravestones are damaged by unknown, arrived in OMVD of Russia on Lyskovsky area on June 27.
Just for this reason, the police asked 24 people.
As a result, a criminal case was opened under article 244 of the criminal code "Destruction, damage or desecration of burial places".
As a result of the investigation, the police found the suspects, they were two students aged 8 and 9 years.
Juvenile delinquents told the police that they were interested to see how the monuments are falling, this prompted them to hooligan actions.
Preventive measures have been taken with children and their parents.
Italy toughens tone towards the ships of NGOs rescuing migrants.
Italy warned NGOs that owned rescue vessels in the Mediterranean sea that they would not be able to continue unless they were subject to the new rules governing their activities.
"If NGOs don't obey the new code of conduct, it is difficult to say whether they will be able to continue their activities," - said the Minister of internal Affairs Mario Minniti in an interview with the Turin daily newspaper "Stampa".
Warning Minniti has sounded next day after Italian authorities seized the ship, owned by German humanitarian organization "Jugend Rettet", the suspicion that his crew are actually cooperating with the traffickers and facilitates illegal immigration.
Humanitarian organization, worked all year, refused to comment on the merits of the detailed charges against her, an Italian Prosecutor Ambrogio, Cartosio.
"For us, the salvation of human life is and will remain the highest priority, so we are very sorry that we can not now continue to work in the search and rescue zone," the organization said in social networks.
"We will be able to assess all the charges made now, only after we gather all the information and will be able to assess the situation."
The Italian authorities monitor the ship "Juventa", owned by "Jugend Rettet", Oct.
His crew is suspected that all lifeboats were taken aboard the migrants, which traffickers sent directly to them, and allowed the smugglers to go along with the boats that they could use again.
At least one such meeting is believed to have taken place just 1.3 miles from the Libyan coast - as stated in the prosecution's materials, the content of which was published in the Italian media.
The crew is suspected of violating the orders of the Italian coastal authorities, who control rescue operations in this area, rather out of humanitarian zeal than for any other reason.
The code of conduct presupposes, mainly, that "Juvenile" type vessels will have an Italian police officer on Board who will monitor their activities.
So far, only three out of nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have agreed to comply with the code: "Save the Children", the Maltese MOAS and "Pro-Activa open arms" from Spain.
The latter said on Thursday that it considers the new rules unnecessary, but acceptable, provided that they do not entail any "significant changes or hindrances" to its rescue operations.
Among those who refused to sign are the Nobel prize-winning organization Médecins sans frontières (MSF).
Meanwhile, Minniti said a sharp decline in recent weeks, the number of migrants arriving in Italy as the result of rescue operations, indicates that efforts to support the Libyan coast guard and cooperation with local mayors to fruition.
"In recent days we have started to see light at the end of the tunnel," the Minister said.
He reported on plans for further negotiations with the Libyan mayors on economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving those countries in the hope of reaching Europe.
"In Libya, we do not want to be associated with any of the parties to the conflict"
The government recently stepped up its policy in the Libyan context, and visits to Moscow were frequent delegations of the warring Libyan parties.
The Russian head of the contact group for the inter-Libyan settlement with the Ministry of foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation and the state Duma, the assistant to the head of the Chechen Republic Lev Money told "Kommersant", what is the objective of Moscow in the region and who is betting.
The contact group on Libya, which you head, is almost unknown.
Here, say, the contact group for Ukraine-everyone knows about it.
And here is the veil of mystery.
What exactly do you do, what are your goals?
The contact group was established on the initiative of the Russian foreign Ministry and the state Duma.
Its activities are supervised by Deputy foreign Minister Mikhail Bogdanov and Adam Delimkhanov (Duma Deputy from Chechnya. - "B").
The latter is authorized to work in the Libyan direction by the speaker of the state Duma Vyacheslav Volodin.
The impetus for the creation of the group was the detention in Libya of the Russian tanker "Mechanic Chebotarev" (in September 2015, there were 11 people on Board. - "B").
We thought about how to help the crew.
Then a contact group of military experts, representatives of the state Duma was created, our work was supported by the head of Chechnya Ramzan Kadyrov.
And how did it happen that you headed it?
Since I have been working in Libya since 2008, I have been approached with a proposal to lead the group.
Our activities were not limited to the release of sailors from the "Mechanic Chebotarev".
We managed to establish contacts with representatives of all major groups opposing each other in the Libyan conflict - and from Tripoli (where the UN-recognized government headed by Faiz Saraj is based. - "Kommersant"), and with Tobruk (the residence of the Parliament, which opposes the government and supports Marshal Khalifa Haftar, who controls the Eastern regions of Libya. - "B").
Thanks to the active participation of Ahmed Metig (Deputy Prime Minister of Libya-Kommersant), we were able to quickly agree on the release of Russian sailors.
Then it was decided to use these contacts more effectively, to create a contact group.
Its task is to analyze the situation, identify key factors and players, and dialogue with all parties to the conflict.
I want to emphasize that in Libya we do not want to be associated with any of the parties to the conflict, we are engaged in a dialogue with all.
How many people are in the contact group and how many of them are permanently in Libya?
Now the contact group consists of five people.
Among them there are people with experience in law enforcement agencies, including the Ministry of defense.
We also want to introduce representatives of the middle East Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences to the regional team.
None of our employees are constantly in Libya, and this is not necessary.
Is there now in Libya, Russian military advisers and instructors.
And if so, on whose side?
There are no Russian military specialists in Libya.
All conversations and publications about this are not true.
But your contact group includes ex-military...
Yes, and their presence is necessary.
For example, when we visit hot spots.
Or such cities closed to a certain point for us, as Misrata (where militia groups are based, which played a role in the overthrow of the Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi in 2011 and significantly intensified in subsequent years. - "B").
We arrived in Misrata in January of this year.
We were scared, saying that they're all Islamists are terrorists.
But it was important for us to assess the situation there, to analyze the real military potential, who is responsible for what, why there are such rumors, what is the role of Islamists there.
In Misrata, we met with all the representatives of the groups that were engaged in the destruction of the is in Sirte (in December 2016, this city on the Mediterranean coast was repulsed from the militants of the banned in Russia "Islamic state" - "Kommersant").
We wanted to look at them, to get to know these people, to check the information that they played a crucial role in the destruction of the is in Libya, and not the Khalifa Haftar, who attributed himself to these merits.
And what did you conclude?
Is it not Haftar who won the Islamic state in Libya?
He didn't.
Haftar conducted operations on another front, in Benghazi.
And the structures subordinated to the government in Tripoli fought against ISIS in Sirte.
By the way, we invited people who conducted this anti-terrorist operation to Russia.
And they came-the visit lasted from 19 to 23 April this year, the Libyan delegation was received by the Federation Council, the Duma, the foreign Ministry and Regardie.
You, as we understand, visit all Libyan regions and probably imagine the mood of local elites and field commanders.
What do you think, will it be possible to implement the ceasefire agreements, the elections that were reached in late July in Paris by Khalifa Haftar and Faiz Saraj?
Or again, as it has repeatedly happened in the past, the agreements will be broken, the fighting will resume, the parties will try to seize power alone?
For us, a good signal was the fact that Saraj and Haftar agreed to the next meeting, not so long ago it was impossible.
In the recent past, both leaders have spoken very negatively about each other.
As for the position of Russia...
Often write and say that Moscow actively supports Haftar, many believe in it.
We faced this situation when we were in Misrata, and it was on this day that Haftar was on Board the Russian aircraft carrier Admiral Kuznetsov.
It was coincidence.
But in Misrata in the match is not believed.
We were told: "You must be very brave people that came to us today".
But our task is precisely to show that we do not only support Haftar, we are engaged in a dialogue with all the key parties to the conflict in Libya.
You and Haftar talked.
Does mutual understanding with Russian partners at a human, emotional level facilitate the fact that he studied in the USSR twice?
And, by the way, does Haftar know Russian?
Russian if he knows it is very concerning.
But the fact that he studied with us, of course, facilitates dialogue with him.
And by the way not only with him.
When we communicate with the military in Tripoli and Misrata, we meet generals who studied either in Russia or in the Soviet Union.
And here they are perfectly speak Russian.
And they are drawn to Russia, to some extent feel nostalgia for it.
Do you think the weapons embargo imposed on Libya will be lifted soon?
Are your Libyan interlocutors interested in the supply of Russian weapons?
Of course, they are interested, but, as I said, we do not take sides in this conflict and do not want to arm some to the detriment of others.
We would like to see everyone in roughly equal positions.
With regard to the arms embargo, from the Libyans constant calls to Russia somehow has contributed to its removal.
Now Libya is actively moving the process of drafting a Constitution.
We hope that the parties will reach compromise solutions and achieve internal consensus.
Then, elections should be held, what was discussed at the meeting Saraga and the Haftarot.
If the elections are held and the legitimate government is finally elected (and now none of the parties has such status), then it is possible to raise the question of lifting the arms embargo in the UN security Council.
To raise this issue now is meaningless and dangerous, it will only lead to an escalation of the conflict.
Recently, the media reported that Italy, faced with the problem of floating from Libya African refugees, feels left to their fate by the EU allies.
Can Moscow help its Italian partners in this situation, using its ties with the Libyans?
How realistic, for example, is the option that Haftar troops will establish control over the coast and put an end to the business of smugglers who smuggle immigrants to Europe?
Very timely question.
We are actively working on this.
The Italians need Russia's support, because Moscow is engaged in a dialogue with Haftar, Saraj, Misrata and the South of the country.
And in this matter the tribes in the South of Libya play a big role, and they are ready to cooperate with Russia.
We are talking about the southerners to stop the flow of migrants on the distant approaches?
That is, relatively speaking, turned back the buses, which go Nigerian migrants?
We achieve this.
But it's not easy.
Some clans and groups are interested in these flows to continue.
We hope to contribute to the unification of the South in the negotiation process between Saraj, Haftar and the tribes in the South.
But first, we would like to see a unity of opinion on this issue between Haftar and Saraj.
The head of government in Tripoli, Faiz Saraj, is considered an Islamist, a supporter of the introduction of Sharia in the country.
How radical do you think he is?
Will this not be an obstacle in building relations with Russia or the West?
I will Express my personal opinion about him.
In my opinion, on the contrary, he is an opponent of radical Islam.
But the Islamists are in his coalition.
Yes, but he himself holds the position that Libya should be an absolutely normal country - moderately Islamic, open to the world.
And he is also actively fighting terrorists.
Where did he get such a reputation?
It was created by those countries that are not interested in Russia communicating with Tripoli.
Tripoli is the capital, there is the legislative, Executive and judicial power.
There is the national oil Corporation, the national Bank and other government agencies.
Of course, some countries were interested in us not to go there.
And we mixed them all the cards and began to actively communicate with both Tripoli and Tobruk.
And we are already reaping the fruits of this work: Rosneft has signed a cooperation agreement with the state oil company of Libya - NOC.
NOC Director Mustafa Sanalla, with whom the head of Rosneft Igor Sechin made a deal, himself directly from Tripoli.
And two weeks ago, the first shipment of Libyan oil to Rosneft took place.
What will Russia do with it?
I suppose it's reselling.
And what are Russia's economic interests in Libya?
The plans are to re-sign the contracts signed under Muammar Gaddafi.
In particular, we are talking about previous agreements in the transport sector (construction of Railways), energy (electrification) and a number of others.
And the Libyans have something to pay?
Well, they've got oil.
That is, as in the case of Iran, we are talking about the scheme "oil in exchange for services"?
I do not know what will be the scheme, I do not deal with these issues directly.
In fact, the economy for Russia in Libya and not the main thing.
In fact, we are engaged in peacekeeping work there.
The main thing for us is to stop the bloodshed and help the Libyans to agree among themselves so that they can establish order and Libya will no longer be a favorable environment for the development of terrorism.
For Russia, this is the main task - to help the Libyan people and squeeze out terrorists.
Do you have any information about the presence in Libya (now or before) of radical militants from Russia or other countries of the former USSR?
One of the tasks of our contact group was to find out.
I met with a representative of the Libyan state security Committee, who said that to date, no one comes from Russia and other countries of the former Soviet Union there.
He said that he has about 50 thousand records of telephone conversations of representatives of Islamist and radical groups (in Libya. - "Kommersant") and the Russian language, there is no sound.
And from what States then these fighters?
I would not like to go into these details.
Then let's formulate the question differently.
How many among the Islamist militants in Libya Libyans themselves?
Libyans among them almost no, they are not more than 5%.
The others are strangers.
Whether Moscow can hold the inter-Libyan talks, following the example of Paris?
Such plans exist.
We are in active negotiations with Libyans, several delegations from Libya have already visited Moscow, and have declared their readiness to come to Moscow or Grozny.
And when can such negotiations take place?
It's hard to tell right now.
There should be several more visits, and then, I hope, there will be clarity about the time and place of negotiations.

Michelle Carter's sentence for reports of Conrad Roy's suicide
A resident of Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years in prison for using text messages and phone calls to incite the suicide of her boyfriend Conrad Roy.
Michelle Carter, now 20 years old, will have to serve 15 months of her time behind bars and another 5 years of probation.
Carter was found guilty in June of manslaughter of Conrad Roy, who committed suicide on July 13, 2014.
Roy's father said at a hearing on Thursday, " My family is heartbroken.
My son was my best friend."
Carter was allowed to remain free until the appeal.
She was facing a maximum sentence of 20 years, but her lawyers said she and Roy were both mentally ill.
Carter, dressed in red trousers and a cream blouse, listened to the sentence standing with her hands and eyes down.
"Her actions killed Conrad Roy," the Prosecutor told the court.
"She interrupted his life to improve her.
She did not accept responsibility, " she said.
"She showed no remorse."
But Carter's lawyer said that it was "a tragic case that she deeply regrets."
However, judge Lawrence Monis said that, in his opinion, her "age, maturity level, or even mental illness did not significantly affect her actions."
The Prosecutor read out the statement of the mother of Roy, Lynn, Roy, which says: "there is not a day when I would not have mourned the loss of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and how I'm doing - I try to support his sisters, despite all the pain that will remain with us forever," it says.
Roy's sister Camdin Roy said that she was relentlessly haunted by the idea that she would never be able to attend his wedding or become an aunt to his children.
"To lose the person who has been with me always since my birth is a pain that will remain with me until the end of life," she said.
This case is likely to become a legal precedent, as Massachusetts does not have a law that would provide for responsibility for advising a person to commit suicide.
In 2014, when Roy was found dead in a car with symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning, Carter was 17 years old.
The case attracted the attention of the whole country when it became known that he was pushed to suicide by Carter's message.
"You can hang yourself, jump off the roof, stab yourself with a knife I do not know there are many ways," she wrote in several messages sent two weeks before his death, when he was resting with his family.
A few minutes before the suicide, she wrote, "you have to do this, Conrad," and "you just have to turn on the ignition, and you'll be free and happy."
Judge Monis said that Carter wanted to get attention with Roy's death, and he told her not to talk to the press to keep her from getting what she wanted.
The opinions of lawyers on this matter are divided.
One of the few who defended Carter was Amanda Knox, who was convicted in 2007 for the murder in Italy of her British roommate and acquitted two years later.
30-year-old Knox published in the Los Angeles times his dissenting opinion, which stated: "Michelle Carter deserves sympathy and help, not prison."
Evgeny Bogachev: "I let Langford go like a high-flying bird"
One of the best basketball players of VTB United League 33-year-old Keith Langford left UNICS.
The departure of the American defender to "Izvestia" was commented by the President of UNICS Evgeny Bogachev.
Keith made this decision for family reasons, - said Eugene Bogachev.
He has a small child, a wife who did not want to move to Kazan.
Keith wants to be closer to home.
I decided to meet him halfway.
Of course, I could say no and extend his contract, but he deserved a different attitude.
He played in the UNICS three seasons and in each match showed a high level, gave all 100%.
So I let him go like a high-flying bird.
We thanked him.
We wish him success in his family life and playing career.
Keith Langford played in Kazan club for three years, winning the silver of the United League-2015/16.
In the 2016/17 season he received the award to the most productive player of the Euroleague season.
He averaged 21.75 points per game.
This result is the second since 2004, when this award was established.
Langford, who also won the award in 2014, became the second player in the history of the Euroleague, receiving this prize more than once.
In the near future, Langford will sign a contract with the Chinese "Shenzhen", informs Eurohoops.
It is expected that the American will sign a 2-year contract worth $ 5 million.
Langford will be the second Euroleague star in July to enter the Chinese championship.
Earlier in the Chinese CBA moved the ex-center "Panathinaikos" Yannis Burusis.

The man rested in the shelter "Fisht", located at an altitude of 1.6 thousand meters.

"Audi" will have to modify up to 850 000 diesel cars
The day before the announcement, "Audi" BMW "announced that it will offer to update the software in more than 350 000 cars.
The Chairman of" BMW "said that the company believes that" there are more intelligent ways than restrictions on driving", referring to European cities – including Munich, where the" BMW " - which considered the possibility to prohibit or limit the use of diesel cars.
Daimler said on Thursday that it will modify three million Mercedes cars in Europe to reduce their diesel exhaust.
None of the companies called their step a recall.
European automakers have actively promoted the use of diesel cars in Europe and the United States to promote compliance with carbon dioxide emission regulations.
But the nitrogen oxides that diesel engines emit are considered carcinogens and can cause asthma.
The cost for automakers of installing equipment that neutralizes diesel car exhaust gases is also rising, and it becomes difficult to maintain a competitive price for cars.
At that time, as the German automakers are under scrutiny, the government of Chancellor Angela Merkel was also accused that it indulges influential brands and ignores signs of trouble.
Companies are trying not to repeat the mistakes of "Volkswagen", which concealed the use of so-called "defeat devices", which during testing could correct the amount of harmful gases emitted, so that it complies with the rules, and in normal driving conditions were turned off.
In the United States, several Volkswagen leaders have been convicted and the rest are under investigation on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, a former head of the thermodynamics Department in the Audi engine development group was arrested in Germany.
Former Manager, Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio, Italian, and therefore not protected from extradition and could stand trial in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi was subjected to a German criminal investigation involving Volkswagen after authorities accused Audi of installing a system to circumvent European emission rules and expanded the investigation, which had previously focused on the United States.
The inclusion of Audi in the investigation could create serious problems for Volkswagen: the luxury car manufacturer is a source of a disproportionately large share of Volkswagen's income.

It should be noted that the cash Desk was not equipped with a device for determining the authenticity of banknotes.
Currently, the police established the persons involved in the manufacture and sale of knowingly fake ticket of the Central Bank of Russia.
Such crimes are punishable by imprisonment for up to 8 years with a fine of up to 1 million rubles.
The regional Department of the interior Ministry calls on residents of the Astrakhan region to be careful when making financial transactions; employees of trade objects are recommended to install devices to verify the authenticity of the funds received.
Astronomers have found a "hellish" planet where even iron can melt
Having first studied the properties of the stratosphere of a giant exoplanet called WASP-121b, astrophysicists were surprised by its temperature, which is able to evaporate iron and other metals.
Experts have noticed that the water molecules are so heated by the light of the star that emit infrared radiation.
The Hubble telescope has captured the glow of water molecules on this gas giant: this high temperature causes water in the planet's atmosphere to glow in the infrared.
WASP-121b refers to the so - called "hot Jupiter" - gas giants, in size and mass comparable to the largest planet in the Solar system, but located ten times closer to the parent star.
Because of this year on the exoplanet lasts only 1.3 "earth" days", and its gas shell is heated to almost 2 500 degrees Celsius.
Climate change threatens lavender in Provence.
It has become a symbol of Provence and southern France, but now there are fears that it is threatened by climate change.
Lavender has grown worse due to dry weather and disease-carrying insects; this has caused a constant headache for scientists and farmers who are trying to find a solution.
Erik Shes, an expert from the CRIEPPAM agricultural research Institute in Provence, says: "lavender In Provence is indeed under threat, because in recent years this plant has experienced the effects of climate change: in spring and especially in autumn, the rains have become much less.
This affects the life of lavender.
And there are little cicadas jumping on the leaves of insects carrying micro-bacteria; in very dry weather, they become very much."
There is a lot at stake.
Lavender not only attracts holidaymakers; lavender oil is very popular in perfumery and cosmetology.
Eric Shes says: "Instead of very long ears with a large number of large flowers, we have small, underdeveloped, weakened or even absent.
Therefore, we have fewer parts containing essential oil."
The solutions currently under consideration include improving water distribution and slowing evaporation from the soil, as well as spraying plants with a protective mixture of clay and water, and developing more drought-resistant varieties.
Ambassador of the Winter Universiade-2019 in Krasnoyarsk, met with students
Two-time world ice hockey champion, Ambassador of the winter Universiade 2019 Alexander Semin met with novice hockey players and gave autographs to fans.
The meeting was held in the tent Of the winter Universiade 2019 within the thematic week devoted to ice hockey.
Any visitor to the tent could skate on the site with artificial ice.
In addition, relay races, quizzes and games with the drawing of Souvenirs of student games, a warm-up from the aerobics Federation were organized.
The event was attended by 50 students.
Alexander Semin advised the children to do as much as possible on the sports grounds and stressed that the most important thing at the initial stage of training - hard work and a great desire to engage in hockey.
"It's great that there is such a platform in Krasnoyarsk as the tent of the winter Universiade 2019, where novice athletes can directly ask questions to the coaches of the teams," the champion said.
It should be noted that ambassadors of The winter Universiade 2019 help to promote student sports and a healthy lifestyle among Krasnoyarsk residents.
Tent of the Universiade will run throughout the summer season until 25 September, the press service of the Directorate of the Winter Universiade-2019.
The state Department commented on the words of Medvedev
The official representative of the US state Department Heather Nauert, commenting on the words of Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev at the briefing, said it was necessary to find "areas for cooperation" with Russia.
According to her, such areas should be found to "improve bilateral cooperation".
An example of such a successful cooperation is the Agreement on Syria on a truce.
We are two nuclear superpowers.
"And people around the world agree that the US and Russia should be able to work with each other," the diplomat said.
At the same time, Nauert refused to comment on Medvedev's statement about a full-fledged trade war between Russia and the United States.
"If Russia has said this, then it certainly has the right to speak, but more on this topic I can not say anything," - said the representative of the state Department.
Earlier, U.S. President Donald trump has signed a bill to toughen sanctions against the Russian Federation.
Commenting on the new package of sanctions, the Russian Prime Minister Medvedev said that Washington had declared a full-fledged trade war on Moscow, putting an end to the hope of improving bilateral relations.
Medvedev also said that the us sanctions will operate for decades.
In addition, according to the Prime Minister, the American establishment "outright beat" trump.
Missing in the suburbs bodybuilder found in someone else's cottage lost memory
Bodybuilder Shamil Ahmetov lost on the road in Noginsk on 25 July with a very piquant circumstances: he came out of the cabin of the car to go to the toilet.
Seven days later he unsuccessfully sought the familiar and the locals.
And there was Shamil in a foreign country in Ramenskoye.
His utterly naked found in his toilet is a master.
The Dagestan athlete could not explain what was here and what happened to him.
He couldn't even remember his name and his passport was missing.
To establish the identity helped the ads about his disappearance.
Arrived on call the doctors fixed Hametova partial memory loss and a traumatic brain injury, according to public Mash.
Probably, other surprises are waiting for the athlete.
The attackers who kidnapped Shamil probably already visited his apartment, the keys to which he also stole.
Oil and gas revenues in July exceeded the forecast by 7.4 billion rubles
In fact, the oil and gas revenues received by the end of July 2017 exceeded the estimate by 7.4 billion rubles, according to the Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation.
The excess, as explained by the Agency, was mainly due to the higher exchange rate of the us dollar to the ruble compared to the average monthly value of June, used for the assessment, as well as due to the excess of the actual volume of gas production and exports of petroleum products projected levels.
"The deviation of oil and gas revenues of the Federal budget from the monthly assessment corresponding to the Federal law on the Federal budget for 2017-2019 is projected to be +40.2 billion rubles in August 2017," the Ministry of Finance reported.
Thus, the total amount of funds allocated for the purchase of foreign currency in the domestic currency market in the period from August 7 to September 6, 2017, is 47.6 billion rubles.
Accordingly, the daily volume of purchase of foreign currency will be equivalent to 2.07 billion rubles.
The Russian Finance Ministry will involve the Bank of Russia in transactions of foreign currency purchase.
Every working day during the specified period, the Central Bank will enter into foreign currency purchase transactions on the Moscow exchange's organized trades on a regular basis during the trading day.
The purchased foreign currency will be credited to the accounts of the Federal Treasury in the Central Bank.
The murder of the journalist highlights that in Mexico it is becoming more dangerous.
The staff of the weekly newspaper "Riodoce" usually meet on Wednesdays to discuss plans for coverage of the latest violent crimes in the state of Sinaloa, associated with organized crime, corrupt officials or the ongoing war with the drug dealers.
But today, overwhelmed by their own tragedy, they met to talk about security.
They were told that they should change their habits.
Two senior journalists were discussing that it seems safer to take the kids with me to the office, which in 2009 had thrown a grenade, or leave them at home.
Security experts wrote three words on the Board hanging in the room: enemies, neutral people, allies.
They asked journalists to give names for each column - evidence is not needed, suspicions and internal feelings will be enough.
These are drug dealers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected of being kept by the government or cartels, a list of scoundrels, because of which the work to cover the chaos in Mexico becomes dangerous.
Violence is not giving a break, and there are more and more journalists among the corpses that are multiplying in the country: according to the Committee for the protection of journalists, at least 25 since President Enrico Pena Nieto took office in December 2012; 589 people after attacks and threats are under Federal protection; and this year at least seven people have died in seven States.
Among the latter - their publisher and inspirer, co-founder of "Riodoce" Javier Valdez Cardenas.
"The biggest mistake is living in Mexico and being a journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his many books on drug - related violent crimes.
His absence is felt very keenly, though his presence is everywhere - a large picture of valdés, giving the finger, with the inscription "Justice" hangs on the facade of the "Biodose"; two reporters for 30 years, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wearing a t-shirt depicting his smile, the face with glasses or his trademark Panama.
The seminar takes place less than two months after his death; journalists discuss their General trauma, their nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.
Although the office of the special Federal Prosecutor was established in 2010 to investigate journalistic cases, only two cases have been investigated so far, according to the Committee for the protection of journalists.
As with most of the thousands of drug-related and organized crime-related murders each year, journalists ' murderers are rarely brought to justice.
Journalists "Riodoce" insist that they will write about the violence in Sinaloa, although you're grieving, although there is now much more dangerous.
Without information about the killers, without justice, talking about security in meetings is of little use, " says Ibarra.
"It's very stupid to waste time at this seminar," he says.
"Until we know the reason, we suspect everyone."
On the morning of may 15, Valdez left the office "Riodoce" in the state capital Culiacan.
He only managed to drive a couple blocks before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men; he was pulled out of the car and shot at 12 times, probably because of the name of the newspaper-which means "twelfth river".
The shooter drove his car and smashed it nearby.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He left behind a wife and two grown children.
Rumors usually fast in Culiacan.
But about Valdez almost all silent.
Since Guzman was arrested and extradited to the United States last January, Sinaloa has become one of the bloodiest battlefields in the country as rival factions fight to fill the vacuum.
Let's not say that every day on the streets of Sinaloa kill one or more people, or that the cemetery is filled with painted two-storey mausoleums of drug roads, which are more than the homes of many living people.
Let's forget for a moment that the state of "calm" is simply when one of the cartels takes control of the coastal state with important ports and drug routes leading to the US.
Despite this and the fact that Valdez knew the dangers of his work, Ismail Bohorkes, 60-year-old co-founder and Director of Riodos, is crushed by a sense of guilt for not being able to protect a friend.
He thinks two mistakes helped the murder.
First, an interview was published in February with Damaso Lopez, the leader of one of the rival factions of the cartel, who is at war with Guzman's sons.
The publication could have angered the sons; the people who were supposed to be gang members bought all the copies of the publication as soon as they were delivered to the kiosks.
The second mistake was that he did not force Valdez to leave the country for his own safety after another newspaper was seized, which wrote about the same story.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his murder was regarded as another milestone in the development of violence against journalists in Mexico.
He had been out of danger for so long, his friends and colleagues thought he would always be.
He was an experienced reporter in "Noroeste" and in 2003, together with five colleagues, founded "Riodoce", selling its 50-dollar stock.
In Sinaloa," it was impossible to do journalism without addressing the topic of drugs, " Bohorkes said.
Over time, the newspaper has earned a reputation as a bold and honest publication, sales and advertising revenues grew.
Journalists liked that they could publish bold reports without fear of censorship, and readers were attracted that in this edition they could read about what no one else dared to write.
Eight years after its founding, "Riodoce" was awarded the prestigious Maria Moors Cabo for journalistic work in Latin America.
In the same year, Valdez won The international press freedom award for his courage in investigating the drug trade in Mexico, wherever it leads.
He frankly admitted that he was scared.
"I want to move on," he said at the CPJ award.
Drug trafficking in Sinaloa - "it's a lifestyle," he said in October last year in an interview Rompimento TV.
"You have to accept the tasks that fall on you as a journalist - either that or you're just fooling around."
I don't want to be asked, "What did you do when there were so many deaths around... why didn't you tell me what was going on?"
The staff of "Riodos" miss Valdez, a Joker who swore like a loader in the port, a friend, generous in the arms and advice, a teacher who knew how to hundred alive.
They relied on the order they had put in place.
He had to always wear his hat.
He had to go to "El Guayabo", a bar near the office and to always sit there at the same table.
Now they ask: his ruined love to once the usual order?
His death forced them to doubt their calculations of how to do their job better and stay alive.
"They don't like it when you understand their wives, children, their legal business and underground airports for the transportation of drugs.
"These things were outside," said Bojorquez.
The result, even in the best of times, was a high level of self-censorship and self-preservation.
You have to trust your instincts.
Stay away from what smells bad.
The problem, says the editor of "Riodoce" Andres Villareal, that "the sense of smell can be deceiving... and then there is what happened with Javier".
Old rules, he says, and others, no longer apply in Sinaloa - as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero, and other States where there is a poisonous mix of lucrative smuggling routes, weak state institutions, and corrupt officials.
The landscape is constantly changing.
In the room where the staff of "Riodoce" gathered for training in security, were suddenly forbidden to make cell phones: a few days before it became known that spyware sold exclusively to governments, and are used in Mexico to spy on journalists and public activists.
Outside, two police officers are hiding in the shade of a tree from the 104-degree heat (40 degrees Celsius).
They instructed the state government to protect the office "Riodoce", which is a four-storey building in a bourgeois quarter of Culiacan.
Some journalists asked half-jokingly whether these police officers were among the 50 per cent of law enforcement officers whom the Governor himself said they could not be trusted.
A few months ago, journalists went to the mountainous area, which is de facto under the control of gangs of drug dealers.
In the next issue of "Riodoce" relied on three main themes.
This is the murder in Sinaloa of the brother of former Boxing champion Julio Cesar Chavez.
They also had an exposé of government spending concentrated in the Governor's hometown.
It was a group abduction in one of the most expensive restaurants of Culiacan, in the quarter from the U.S. attorney's office.
It wasn't officially announced who was kidnapped or how it happened, so one had to be careful when it came time to write about what everyone in the city knew: that it was a favorite restaurant of both drug dealers and authorities.
One of the journalists learned from open databases that the restaurant was registered in the name of a politician belonging to the ruling Institutional revolutionary party (PRI), which dominated at all levels of government for almost the entire past century.
Recently, against several governors from PRI, high-profile charges of corruption were put forward.
Villarreal asked journalists to write about previous incidents in the restaurant, including when the son of "El Chapo" Guzman escaped from the round-up of the military.
A few months ago, readers would have been looking for a column from Valdez with the most reliable information about the kidnapping.
"We would have known what had happened before, "says 46-year-old Villarreal, for his slim physique nicknamed"El Flaco".
"Today all communication channels with our sources are broken."
Valdez's office is now used as a warehouse for posters and stickers protesting the murders of journalists, because employees have become what they never thought they would become: activists speaking on behalf of the press.
Journalist Miriam Ramirez took a few posters and went the next morning to a demonstration at the local Prosecutor's office, dedicated to another journalist.
El Salvador Adam disappeared in michoacán state in the West of the country three days after valdés was killed.
They found a burned body, and the authorities said it was him, based on DNA tests.
Throughout the country, journalists began to speak louder, organize protests and write "SOS Press" on the sidewalks and walls of houses.
On this day, the Director went on to perform was in Washington, trying to enlist international support in demanding justice in the case of Valdez.
At a meeting with the Governor of Sinaloa the day after the murder, Valdez Ramirez accused the authorities of spying on journalists and ordering their murders for telling the truth.
After that, she asked not to be given more assignments to cover the government's activities, fearing that anger would harm her objectivity.
Valdez has said many times that journalists in Mexico are "surrounded" by organized crime, its accomplices in the government and indifferent society.
In his latest book, Drug journalism, he wrote that reporters are not just killed by gangs of drug traffickers; they do so on the orders of politicians and security forces in collusion with organized crime.
The press protection Committee of Articulo 19 believes that half of the attacks on journalists last year were carried out by order of the police and government officials.
"In Mexico, you die because they want to shut you up," Ramirez says.
Of course, killing scares people.
Everyone remembers the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth masias six years ago in the Northern border state of Tamaulipas.
A note was found on her body, allegedly written on behalf of The Zetas cartel: "I'm here because of my articles."
The computer keyboard and headphones were lying next to her head cut off.
Some publications preferred to close down as the newspaper "El Norte" in the Northern border state of Chihuahua after its correspondent Miroslava Brich was killed in March.
Others continue to hold on as" El Manana " from Nuevo Laredo after the murder of its leader in 2004.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad juárez publicly addressed drug cartels through an editorial on the first page entitled " What do you want from us?"
Some journalists have left their home States or even the country.
It's a painful decision.
In exile, it is difficult to find a job and they are still looking for danger in the streets.
And sometimes they get killed, as it obviously happened to photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was killed in 2015 along with four women in an apartment in Mexico three months after fleeing Veracruz.
Those who remain and continue to work, daily balance between risky decisions.
Ibarra-who once dreamed of being a poet - admits that he is afraid to write about drug trafficking.
"Mexico is going to hell, and that's why I became a journalist," he says.
Last Friday, at midnight, when the last issue was ready for printing, the publishers of Riodos were sitting on the sidewalk next to the office and drinking beer, when suddenly their phones rang at the same time.
A series of shootings between rival gangs and security forces near the resort town of Mazatlan left behind, according to confirmed reports, 19 bodies.
The war continued to flare up, as promised in a series of messages from cartels found in the area.
Sitting on the sidewalk, they are through the mobile phone posted the news on website "Redose".
The next day we had to re-do the first page.
Nearby howled sirens - another shooting incident in the area.
Bohorkes looked whether the police guarding them were ready to defend.
If they were scared, they didn't show it.
Sitting under a huge portrait of the deceased founder of their Newspapers, whose middle finger was put on display around Sinaloa, Employees "Riodoce" continued his work.
"How can you think about closing," Bohorkes said, " if on the very day Javier was killed, the Intern asked me to send her outside to do a report?"
Dinosaur used camouflage to avoid enemies
At first glance, he seems to be a statue, though terrifying.
The researchers said that the first remains of an incredible creature the size of a rhinoceros discovered by a canadian miner, preserved so well that experts called it "Mona Lisa among dinosaurs."
It was so well preserved that they were even able to determine that the color of its scaly skin was reddish-brown – and say that it had, in some way, a "dark past."
In a report published in the journal of modern biology, It was described as "the best-preserved of the thyroid Gland in the history of finds and one of the best dinosaur specimens in the world."
This fossil is a recently found specimen of the nodosaurus, which lived in the middle of the Cretaceous period, between 110 million and 112 million years ago.
His incredible good condition has stunned researchers who call him"truly remarkable."
This herbivorous therefor is the most well-preserved fossil of this type in the history of discoveries according to articles in the National Geographic magazine.
He was found by Sean Funk while he was working at the Sunkor Millennium mine near Fort McMurray in Northern Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011.
He came across something that seemed different from the surrounding breed and decided to look closer.
The fossil he discovered was sent to the Royal Tirrell Museum of paleontology.
For the next six years, work was carried out to detect an animal inside a block of earth weighing 2500 feet (1100 kilograms).
Now that all this hard work is done, the finished result can be demonstrated.
"One has only to squint slightly, and you can almost believe that he is asleep," - said the lead author Caleb brown, a researcher at the Royal Tirrell Museum of paleontology, which demonstrates the creation.
"It will go down in the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaur specimens – the Mona Lisa among the dinosaurs."
Studying its skin, the researchers found that it was a herbivore, despite the fact that it was covered with a shell and resembled a walking tank, apparently exposed to considerable danger from carnivorous dinosaurs.
This powerful armored dinosaur used a red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and used a protective technique known as protective coloring, which is also used by many animals of our days.
This would allow him to quickly merge with the surrounding environment and avoid meeting enemies, experts say, assuming that it was hunted by larger dinosaurs.
This 110 million-year-old creature, belonging to the nodosaur family, was widely published in may, and is now on display at the Royal Tirrell Museum of paleontology.
Scientists have already studied the animal and gave it the name Borealopelta markmitchelli in honor of the Museum laboratory assistant Mark Mitchell, one of the members of the group, who spent more than 7,000 hours for his painstaking excavations.
The amazing preservation of the specimen allowed Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and shape of the scales and the shell plates on his body.
They found a protective color, a common method of protection in the animal Kingdom, which means that the top of the creature was darker than its underside.
Although protective coloration and well-distributed, the discovery came as a surprise because the size Of the borealopelta dinosaur is much larger than the size of living animals with protective coloration.
It can be assumed that this dinosaur was so actively hunted by carnivorous dinosaurs that evolution chose to disguise confrontation as a way of survival.
But most modern animals with protective coloration – for example, deer, zebras, or armadillos – much smaller and are more available prey, indicating that nodosaur had to seriously fight for survival.
"The serious threat from predators to a massive, heavily armored dinosaur shows how dangerous the predatory dinosaurs of the Cretaceous period were," brown said.
Chemical analysis of organic compounds in the dinosaur scales also suggests that his skin should have been reddish-brown.
Scientists continue to study the animal, looking for information about his life, including the preserved contents of his digestive tract, to find out what he ate during his last meal.
They believe that when the dinosaur died, it fell into the river and was taken to the sea, where it sank and lay back down to the bottom of the ocean.
It was as warm as it is now in southern Florida in those days in Alberta, and the rivers and oceans were likely to extend much further inland than they are now.
"This nodosaurus is truly remarkable for being completely covered with preserved scaly skin, and at the same time fully preserved in three dimensions, while maintaining the original shape of the animal," brown said.
"As a result, now the animal looks almost the same as it did then, in the Early Cretaceous.
You don't have to use your imagination to recreate it, you only have to squint a little, and you can almost believe that he is asleep."
The Cretaceous period is an era when giant theropods, carnivorous dinosaurs standing on two legs, roamed the Earth.
Although the most remarkable of them, Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions of years later than Borealopelta, one of its formidable ancestors could hunt for the thyroid.
These include acrocanthosaurus, a monster in length, 38 feet (11.5 meters), weighing six tons.
Scientists, whose latest discoveries are published in the journal "Modern biology", believe that Borealopelta was carried away after death in the sea and mummified in silt.
The creature was found by Sean funk when He was working at the Millennium mine near Fort McMurray in Northern Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011.
According to the Museum staff, it is the best-preserved thyroid in the world, along with the skin and shell, and it is intact, from the muzzle to the thighs.
On average, these creatures were approximately 18 feet (five meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kilograms).
Their characteristic feature was two twenty-inch spikes protruding from the shoulders.
Researchers believe that this herbivore therefor hard to set foot on what is now Canada, while the swollen river carried him out to sea.
But the underwater burial of the dinosaur preserved its shell to the smallest detail.
The fossilized remains of this particular specimen are so well preserved that the remains of the skin still cover the lumpy shell plates along the dinosaur's skull.
As Michael greshko wrote in an article for national Geographic magazine, such a degree of preservation is "rare as winning the lottery."
The longer I look at it, the more striking it seems.
The fossilized remains of the skin still cover the hilly plate shells, dotting the skull of the animal.
His right front leg is extended along the side, five fingers turned up on it.
I can count the scales on his sole."
Mikheil Saakashvili managed to get to Poland without documents
Mikheil Saakashvili, who previously headed Georgia and then Odessa region in Ukraine, flew to Poland.
At the same time he did it without having documents confirming his identity and citizenship.
On the arrival of Saakashvili reports the Polish newspaper Telewizja Republika, which posted on its channel in YouTube video with his performance.
Saakashvili spoke at an event in honor of the anniversary of the Warsaw uprising against Nazi troops in 1944.
Because the politician does not know Polish, although he tried to start speaking in that language, he had to speak English through a Polish interpreter.
During his speech, the politician touched upon the topic of cooperation between Georgia and Poland, and spoke about Ukraine.
The fact that the migration service of Ukraine deprived him of his citizenship, the disgraced politician learned while in the United States.
How he managed to make a transatlantic flight without documents is still unknown.
Earlier, the former Governor of Odessa region Mikhail Saakashvili said that his signature on the application form for citizenship of Ukraine was forged.
The politician stressed that he did not fill in any forms.
The period of investigation wainzinher and Olkhovyk extended to January
The period of preliminary investigation in the case of the co-owner of the group of companies "Renova" Evgeny Olkhovik and the head of the energy holding "T Plus" Boris Vainzikher was extended until January 2, 2018.
On Thursday, August 3, the Basman court is considering the extension of the accused's house arrest.
The representative of the UK at the meeting announced the decision to extend the term of the preliminary investigation for the last time.
"The special complexity and duration of the investigation is due to the need to withdraw and conduct an examination of a large number of documents, as well as investigative actions on the territory of several subjects of the Russian Federation", - said the investigator.
He added that the suspects regularly gave bribes to the leadership of the Komi Republic.
Their total amount is estimated at not less than a billion rubles.
According to the investigation, Vainzikher, olkhovik, as well as the former head of JSC "Complex energy systems" Mikhail Slobodin, who until September 5 headed the company "VimpelCom", transferred to the highest officials of the Republic of Komi bribes for the establishment of the most favorable tariffs for heat and electricity, as well as for the creation of favorable conditions for business.
Vainzikher and olkhovyk was arrested, transported to Syktyvkar and arrested for two months, Slobodin has absconded and was declared the Federal wanted list.
How did one activist know the answer to the question "Whose streets?»
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrel was shocked to the core.
Just one day after arriving in new York on a tourist trip, a native of St. Louis was sitting on a bed in an apartment rented through Airbnb, looking through Facebook on the phone.
She came across the post of someone from high school.
It said, " the police Just killed an 18-year-old child, and he's still lying in the middle of the street."
Drawing attention to the fact that no one else from her tape posted this information, puzzled, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
In her film there was a lot of census user with the nickname @TheePharoah.
A real-time rapper from Big St. Louis tweeted the death of Michael brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old boy killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri.
He posted a photo of brown's lifeless body lying in the street for four hours.
"It's wild," thought Ferrel.
But death was nothing new to her and her circle.
She put down the phone, and later that evening returned to tweets that on Canfield drive, going to people.
There were photos of the signal tape and screaming people and a man claiming to be brown's father holding a poster saying, "the Ferguson police Officer just killed my unarmed son!»
She watched a live broadcast as a police officer stands in front of a group of protesters with a barking dog.
In another video, another COP, "she said," pulled the trigger of the rifle and shouted, " I'll kill you all... animals!»
"This is an unusual situation," according to the memories, said Ferrell.
"It's not such a murder as those to which we are accustomed and which can be called typical.
At that moment I felt a chill.
I was angry and crying."
She took a return flight and flew home the next day.
After landing at 11 PM, she took her six-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided that they would both go to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened to Ferrel and Ferguson in the next almost three years was the theme of a new documentary " Whose streets?", which will be released on August 11.
It's a story about survival and protest, about love and loss, strength and resilience in terms of people living in the community and filling the streets demanding answers.
While Ferrel was driving to Ferguson with her daughter, dressed in a flower dress and a wreath of color, they remembered the conversation, which was conducted until this morning countless times, "about the experience of blacks and their situation."
She remembers saying, " Remember when I told you about how black people had to fight for what they believed in?
We're going to Ferguson now, because a policeman killed an eighteen-year-old boy, and that was wrong."
"I couldn't not take it," Ferrel said later.
"What is happening today is the culmination of that ... what happened before.
She needs to know about it, see it, and be raised on it.
Not only must she be well versed in activism and organization, but she must also understand the different levels of black experience and position, and what we must do to become free to be free.
Even if I can provide her with an environment in which she herself will not face obvious racism, she is no different from any other black girl.
I feel like I would do her a bad favor if I could keep her out of it."
When they arrived in Ferguson, the first stop they made was on South Florissant road, a site across the street from the police station, which had become something of a tent camp, while activists were waiting for reports of the final non-conviction of officer Darren Wilson
There Ferrel and his daughter joined a local entrepreneur who was preparing lunch packages.
They collected the bags and helped hand them out to protesters.
Gradually in the mind Ferrel took the form of a new type of activism.
"My activism changed completely after August 9," she said, noting that as a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, she was President of the Association of sanitation students, members of national minorities, and engaged in food justice and health inequality among black communities.
"I had no experience of the organizer.
It came itself."
Few weeks at the evening demonstration Ferrell met Sabaa Folan, one of his sorezhisserom.
Folayan said that she and her chief cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Fairer "just wanted to document" the events.
Ferrel came up with a question: "do you want to document, or are you trying to find a story to play on?»
This skepticism was inspired by the many people, often white, who came to the community to benefit from its pain and fortitude.
As Folayan explained in a recent interview,"we heard that the voices of people who were born and raised in Ferguson, do not fall into the spotlight, and wanted to do it differently."
Folayan had already teamed up with her co-Director Damon Davis, a local artist known for his activism on death row issues.
His participation aroused sympathy for the project from Ferrel and six other local residents, with whom the project team " Whose streets?"kept in touch for years after brown's murder.
"In this documentary, it's not someone who speaks for us or with us, it's us talking," Davis said.
"This was the most important thing for me, how these people will be represented, because this is how I will be presented."
And although the goal of the project was not to focus at all on Ferrel's experience – in an effort to show that the movement "is not about the leader-Savior, but how the community is uniting", as Folayan said - it was the most open of the participants of the film.
As a result in "Whose streets?"showing the unexpectedly personal aspects of Ferrel's life, such as how she fell in love and married her wife.
"I felt naked," Ferrel said, laughing as she talked about the first time she saw the finished product.
"But I understood that when you do this kind of work and you humanize black people, there has to be some level of vulnerability."
In addition, Ferrel's story once again discusses and highlights the role of a black homosexual woman in the broader context of the black Lives matter movement.
Two of the movement's three founders-those who created the #BlackLivesMatter tag on social media after killing black teen Trayvon Martin in 2012-consider themselves homosexuals.
"Black homosexual women in leadership positions support this whole movement," Ferrel says. – And all because we are constantly fighting on several fronts.
Black homosexual women have to bear all this burden."
Folayan agreed with this statement, noting that "the movement is, in fact, supported by black women and many homosexual black women."
However, she insists that "this is not a case of positive discrimination," and that Ferrel was not chosen as the Central character of the film because of its distinctive features.
"She was the person who awakened this energy," she said.
"On the other hand, it is not a coincidence that she was in the foreground, because when »
You can feel its energy through the screen."
Meanwhile, there are no cameras in Ferguson for a long time, but there are still complex racial ties between the community and the police.
Ferrel will be on probation for a two-and-a-half-year roadblock during the demonstration.
She describes the socio-political atmosphere of the place, which she calls home, simply: "Mess".
She's still holding on to the speech she learned when she took the streets of Ferguson three full years ago.
We must fight for our freedom.
We must win.
We must love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose but our chains."

The appearance of similarities: the artist creates portraits using DNA Chelsea manning
In the center of the hall in the Friedman Gallery in new York from the ceiling on the wire hanging faces of people-white, black and brown, all something elusive similar to each other.
These 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey Harborg from the cheek swabs and scraps of hair sent to her by Chelsea manning.
Manning sent over the clippings from Fort Levenworth prison, where a former intelligence analyst is serving a 35-year sentence for the famous transmission of confidential diplomatic telegrams on WikiLeaks.
A new exhibition, ukryvshiesya August 2, called "the Emergence of similarity".
This is the result of two years of correspondence between Dewey Harborg, whose art combines technology, computer science and art, and manning, a transsexual woman and a famous dissident, whom Barack Obama commuted his sentence just three days before the end of his presidency.
After analyzing the DNA obtained from manning with the help of a computer program and using it to create three-dimensional portraits of faces that could be found in people with such a genome, Dewey - Harborg created a deep, though not easy to perceive Manifesto devoted not only to the plasticity of DNA data - the various ways of their interpretation and the in-patient determinism of these interpretations-but also to the concept of identity.
Manning, who was born with the name Bradley Edward, but since her Teens has openly said she considers herself a woman, was sentenced to 20 episodes in 2013, including six violations of the espionage Act, computer fraud, and theft.
Her photos in prison were not available, so only one photo of her was known: a grainy black and white selfie, on which manning in a platinum-toned wig, obviously feeling awkward, sitting behind the wheel of the car; with this photo it and began to associate.
In 2015, Dewey Harborg completed her 2012 project "Visions of strangers"with great success.
In it, the artist created portraits of unknown people with the help of forensic evidence such as cigarette butts and chewing gum, highlighting the DNA of this garbage and creating images of how these people could look.
And then she received an email from Paper Magazine.
"They interviewed Chelsea manning in prison and wanted some portrait to illustrate the article," Dewey-Hagborg explained at a pre - screening of the new exhibition for the press.
At the time, Chelsea was not allowed to visit and take pictures, so they contacted her and asked if she wanted a portrait created from her DNA.
In such an unusual way, the artist and her imprisoned Muse became pen pals and exchanged several letters over the course of two years.
They even wrote a comic book "Suppressed images," illustrated by Daily, Kanungo that depicted how the future President will commute a penalty to Chelsea and she will be able to visit the exhibition in person.
The fact that Obama actually decided to release manning just a few days after the book was published was a pleasant surprise after seven hard years in a military prison in Kansas.
There is something profound and powerful about the exhibition opening right now, when Donald trump is declaring war on people revealing classified information in the government and inventing new ways to incite hatred on Twitter, which he is designed to mitigate.
When Dewey Harborg was asked about the coincidence of this all on time, she said that "nothing happens by accident."
In the artist's statement, written on the wall of Galeria, manning's huge signature at the bottom (with a heart instead of a dot over the "i" in her last name) calls for an end to "automatic separation based on gender, race, sexual orientation and culture."
On the opposite side are her mitochondrial DNA, a long caterpillar written in pencil C, G, and A.
With 200 letters (or nucleotides, as the artist has scientifically described), Dewey Harborg hoped to show how remarkably similar we all are, at least in our biological structure.
"I hope to explain to people that our genome doesn't determine what we are, how open genetic data is to interpretation, and how subjective it is," said Dewey Harborg; her 2007 video work False memories is also on display here.
"DNA data can tell us a lot of different stories, and 30 of those stories are here."
The last part of the exhibition, which fit in one room, is the above - mentioned novel in comics.
It manning in the style of king Kong appears over the building of the us Correctional Barracks with a loudspeaker in his hand.
"If they kill your speech, they will win," it says there.
"So never shut up."
"It's a direct quote from a letter she wrote me," says the artist, greeting us from Philadelphia.
"I still get goosebumps when I talk about it."
Manning had not yet seen the exhibition in person - as was visionary in the comics-but when she arrived, she would be greeted by masks in the center of the room, her own genomic simulacra gathered like a crowd of protesters.
This is also done deliberately, as everything in the exhibition up to the height (5"2, height manning), which was drawn in pencil genetic haplogroups.
"I used to hang them on the walls, but now I want them to look like a crowd of people," says Dewey Harborg about the portraits.
"I wanted them to be like the mass movement that formed around Chelsea, like the movement that stood behind her liberation."
A Professor at northwestern University and an Oxford University officer is wanted by the police on charges of murder
According to police, there is a nationwide RAID on a Professor at northwestern University and a staff member of the University of Oxford, who are wanted as suspects due to the fact that a luxurious room in Chicago was found stabbed to death.
According to the cook County court records, warrants were issued on Monday for the arrest of premeditated murder without the right to release on bail of forty-two-year-old Vindam Latham and fifty-year-old Andrew Warren in connection with their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton G.

Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mutko :" we will meet the requirements of the WADA road map in the near future"
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said that the conditions of the world anti-doping Agency (WADA), set for the resumption of the Russian anti-doping Agency (RUSADA), will be met in the near future.
"A certain stage in the implementation of the requirements was passed, RUSADA received the right to plan and conduct tests in conjunction with the UKAD (UK anti-doping Agency).
The WADA road map has been updated accordingly," Mutko said on Thursday.
The Prime Minister commented on the second part of the WADA road map for the restoration of the status of compliance with the Code, which lists the conditions for the resumption of the work of RUSADA and was recently published on the website of this organization.
According to Mutko, it does not contain anything that could present difficulties for Russia.
"Everything was announced, everything will be done.
And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA in the near future," he added.
However, one of the requirements included in the list implies that Russian andidoping structures should publicly recognize the results of the WADA-commissioned investigation by canadian lawyer Richard McLaren, which claimed that doping in Russian sports is controlled by the state.
Regarding this issue, Mutko said: "We are investigating because our anti-doping system has failed.
All measures have been taken.
But there were no state programs, and we will not recognize what did not happen."
Mutko repeated the words of Vitaly Smirnov, head of the Russian independent public anti-doping Commission.
On the morning of the same day in an interview with the Russian edition of "Rsport" Smirnov recognized the problems that had previously occurred in the Russian anti-doping structures, but added: "we have repeatedly said that the report contains certain controversial positions and provisions.
No one is going to accept this report unconditionally, " Smirnov added.
WADA has suspended the journalist from conducting doping control in November 2015 after a doping scandal.
However, in June this year, he was allowed to plan and coordinate testing under the supervision of international experts and the British anti-doping Agency (UKAD).
After a visit to the organization's Moscow office in July, WADA Director General Olivier Niggli stated that RUSADA was "moving in the right direction" towards the restoration of its work.

Yekaterinburg metro is developing a new payment method

Startups that will help your company not to become another " Uber»
Aimee Errett wanted to assess the level of satisfaction among the employees of her startup in the field of e-Commerce, but the surveys did not work.
The answers were often vague, useless, or, worse, insincere.
And even though she promised anonymity, some employees didn't trust the process.
"He was never consistent and objective, "said Errett, the Manager of the San Francisco - based company of 75 people," Madison Reed " engaged in e-Commerce in the field of hair care.
Therefore, she turned to third parties for help.
Now there is a new kind of start-UPS in the field of human resources, which help companies to find out how their employees feel.
Developing and licensing software, the purpose of which is to measure employee engagement, they enable companies to do quick polls, to access certain commands and demographic groups, to offer employees anonymity and a hot line for complaints, and in some cases allow whistleblowers to bypass top management and go directly to the Directorate.
"Now we have tools like Strava and Fitbit for health monitoring, and where is Fitbit for your company?"says Jim Barnett, co-founder and President of the Redwood city startup, whose analytical programs are used by companies to measure employee engagement.
Errett said that she has reached a greater understanding of what her employees think and feel for three years of using "Glint".
In addition to the Express surveys and questionnaires of certain teams, the product offers a heat map of the company and shows in a visual form which departments have more complaints and which managers have a low approval rating, which allows it to understand why.
Companies gradually realize that they need to control the situation in the workplace, otherwise they will become another "Uber", which was involved in a scandal when a former employee published a blog post in which he described the aggressive environment in which those who expressed dissatisfaction were punished.
For such startups as" Glint", this desire to control the situation is an opportunity for profitable business.
According to the Internet portal "Let's talk about payment", dedicated to financial technologies, the industry of global management, regulation and compliance by 2020 can cost more than 118.7 billion dollars.
Convercent startup from Denver, Colorado, helping companies prevent and detect bad behavior, noted a slight increase in interest and activity earlier this year amid uber's declining reputation.
Convercent has almost 600 customers, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Recently clients came to "Uber".
Like the" Glint"," Convercent " allows companies to send custom-made surveys of staff opinions, collect confidential responses in real time and view heat maps of problem areas.
It also provides a hotline for anonymous text messages that allows employees to report bad behavior.
And if the top Manager is affected, the complaints go directly to the Directorate.
"The court of public opinion seized power from the inspectors, "said Patrick Quinlan, founder and President of Convercent.
If it turns out that the company is mistreating employees or behaving unethically, even if the inspectors do not intervene, the company may face costly consequences in the form of boycotts by customers, employee outflows and lawsuits, Quinlan said.
Ruby Tuesday, a restaurant chain with over 25,000 employees in 500 establishments, has used Convercent for over a year to ensure that employees are up to date with the rules and procedures, and to offer an easy way to contact the company's head office.
Previously, if an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to search for a head office phone number or email, file a formal complaint, and hope that she would be taken seriously.
It was often a frightening and awkward experience, said James Vitrano, head of the legal Department at Ruby Tuesday, who said that there was no normal way to track employee complaints.
Now that the company is using Convercent, problems that were previously hidden from managers sitting in offices in other cities or States – such as discrimination, harassment, and unfair pay – can be found and addressed more quickly.
"I can get closer to a holistic, comprehensive understanding of the employees' situation, "said Vitrano, who leads the risk management group of the Ruby Tuesday network.
"And we protect our shareholders from litigation with employees."
According to Quinland, companies began to take ethics, values, and employee engagement more seriously in 2002, after Arthur Andersen's accounting firm collapsed due to ethical violations as a result of the Enron Case.
But it was only when "social media got widespread," that companies realized they couldn't keep their dirty Laundry from spreading viral on the web.
"Before using technology to control ethics, people used hope as a strategy," he said.
Both "Glint" and "Convercent" offer their software as a service, charging companies a regular fee for the use of their products.
This business model and opportunity, which received the approval of venture investors who have supported both start-up.
In February, "Convercent" received funding in the amount of $ 10 million from such firms as "Sapphire Ventures" and "Tola Capital", resulting in the total capital of the company reached $ 47 million.
Glint received $ 10 million in November from Bessemer Venture Partners, bringing the company's total capital to $ 60 million.
These investments are hardly surprising given the interconnected nature of companies, culture and venture capital.
A growing body of research shows that today's employees expect more of their jobs than they did before.
In highly competitive markets such as Silicon valley, high wages and interesting projects are just the bare minimum.
Employees want to feel accepted and valued, and that they dedicate their time to a company with a positive mission.
"When people are happy to work for a company, feel that they are being heard and that the work they are doing is producing results, they are more willing to make such a company a success, "says Nina McQueen, Vice President of global benefits and employee satisfaction at LinkedIn, where both Convercent and Glint are used.
Investors receive the income when the business of the companies from their portfolio are going well, companies are going well when people are committed and involved.
If third-party Analytics tools promise to increase employee loyalty and engagement, it's no wonder they find support.
According to cultural specialists in the workplace, it is important to have data on employee involvement.
But the data is useless until the company's Trustees take action.
In fact, if a company asks employees for feedback, it may give the impression that change is coming.
And if change does not occur quickly enough, or not come at all, can develop frustration, and employees will lose interest.
"If you're going to ask for 4,000 offers, you should be prepared to have 4,000 conversations, "says Russell Rat, President of consulting at the management firm Kotter International, who has seen companies make a mistake by relying too much on data collection.
"Because if you don't go all the way, the staff will be wondering,' Did you really hear me?
You care?
And if you don't care, why should I care?»
According to Errett, Madison Reed, which now conducts monthly employee surveys, is able to take action the same day someone reports a problem with the help of "Glint."
And, after collecting feedback from employees unhappy with the speed of decision-making and the quality of communication, she was able to reorganize several teams within the company and introduce communication training to solve problems.
Ruby Tuesday is gaining new knowledge about its employees and hopes that in the long term this knowledge will help it to retain employees in an industry known for high staff turnover more effectively.
"If you don't try to create a culture of transparency, you will lose people," Vitrano said.
If you lose people, you lose customers.
And if you lose customers, you lose companies.
In Barnaul open new asphalt on the Avenue Krasnoarmeysky
In Barnaul took drastic measures to eliminate the causes of asphalt failures on the Avenue Krasnoarmeysky.
The place where there were holes on the newly asphalted roadway (crossing with Molodezhnaya street) twice, decided to "open".
We will remind, the collapse of a small section of the road near the tram tracks was due to the fact that the land sank in the area of the ownerless unused network.
According to the Deputy Chairman of the city Committee for road management, improvement, transport and communication Ivan Garmat, for a detailed survey and elimination of prerequisites for the collapse will conduct a detailed survey.
Depending on its results, the necessary measures will be taken.
Anticipated restoration of abandoned communications formwork and concreting.
This was reported on the official website of the regional capital.
The team the Bruins have to deal longer due to the fact that the national collegiate athletic Association has cancelled training twice a day
The time is approaching eleven in the evening; a crowd of football players from the University of California in Los Angeles are delayed to chat on one side of the team's new training fields located on campus.
Some of them pulled down their t-shirts, revealing backs glistening with sweat after a busy first day of sports camp.
For many team players, these moments of idleness make up a mid-day break.
After a three-hour training session, the players enrolled in the summer classes will travel back to the dorms to prepare for the final exams, and the next morning they will return to the Wasserman football center for meetings at 6:30.
Shortly before Monday turned into Tuesday, Bruins coach Jim Mora said, "in the next three days, these guys are waiting for a meat grinder."
The fact that the national collegiate athletic Association has cancelled training twice a day, which was invented to reduce the burden for players who actually extended their working day – at least until the end of exams on Friday.
Therefore, the beginning of the first three practices of the team of the University of California in Los Angeles was scheduled for 7:15 p.m., so they fit in the already tight schedule of the players.
The side effect of not having two workouts a day is more days with one workout, and Bruins is moving the start of the camp for almost a week compared to last year and doing workouts during the summer school for the first time in six seasons of Mora in Westwood.
According to the schedule, they will have to conduct 18 training sessions until August 20 inclusive, before they start official preparation for the first game of the season against the team of Texas a&m University in September.
Maura said that he supported the change of rules by the National student sports Association, despite the fact that because of him in the tight schedule of players there was another point.
"For three or four days we give them this huge load, this is a serious test," said Maura.
"And they just overcame it, they work, they are great guys.
I think that when we live up to Saturday and we have more time, it will be really great."
When the camp is over, the University of California at Los Angeles will make the training sessions closed; it's not an easy task, as its fields are in direct view from the adjacent Parking lot and from the nearby Laskin center, an expensive hotel that has already been bombarded with soccer balls that have overcome the defensive net behind the gates.
The Bruins players should be staying at the hotel starting this weekend, but Maura admits that when the rooms are available during the season, there may be a problem.
"We will have security," said Maura.
"This is a serious problem, and I'm not exaggerating the danger, assuming that anyone can rent a room, sit there and record a workout on video.
If you have a video of the training, it's very serious.
But we'll have security there and security in Parking lot 8.
We'll do everything we can with what we have.
I won't worry too much about it.
We have plan."
All victims of the terrorist attack in St. Petersburg discharged from hospitals
All the victims of the terrorist attack in the metro of St. Petersburg in April were discharged from hospitals.
This was reported in the press service of the Vice-Governor Anna Mityanina.
According to the end of July, three people remained in hospitals, TV Center reports.
Recall, the explosion in the subway of St. Petersburg thundered on April 3 this year.
The bomb was detonated by suicide bomber Akbarjon Jalilov.
As a result of the terrorist attack, 15 people were killed, as well as the performer himself.
In the criminal case, 11 people, including the alleged organizer of Abror Azimov, were arrested.
We will remind, on the eve of Rospotrebnadzor recommended the metro of St. Petersburg to revise the plan of measures to ensure transport security, in particular, increasing the number of metal detectors.
Facebook reinforces fact-checking in the fight against fake news
Facebook will more often send texts suspicious of hoaxes to independent experts, and show their findings under the original posts, said Thursday the world's largest social network, which is trying to fight the so-called fake news.
In a statement on its website, the company said it was beginning to use improved machine learning algorithms to recognize possible hoaxes, send them for verification, and possibly show fact-checking results under the original post.
Facebook has been criticized as one of the main ways to spread so-called fake news, which, according to many, had an impact on the 2016 us presidential election.
This issue is also being actively debated in Europe after French voters were misled by false reports before the presidential election in may, and in Germany, before the September election, announced support for the plan to fine social networks if they do not promptly remove posts that incite hatred.
On Thursday, in a separate statement in German, Facebook announced the testing of a new fact-checking algorithm, which was launched in the US, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
"In addition to seeing what messages are challenged by independent reviewers, people want to have a broader context to make informed judgments about what they read and what they share," Sarah sue, a Facebook news feed Manager, wrote in her block.
She added that Facebook will continue to test the "related articles" feature and work on other changes in the news feed to solve the fake news problem.
Create a comic novel: one castle in English history
In the recent past, Scotney's tiny castle was filmed in the music video "Squeeze", and in the 70's and 80's served as a haven for Margaret Thatcher.
But 700 years from his cozy place in the valley of the Beul river in Kent, he watched the stormy history around, and now inspired Jamie Rhodes, a Yorkshire with a MOP of hair and a penchant for historical documents, on the novel-comic.
"I think it's so beautiful to look at the handwriting of a man who died 300 years ago," he says enthusiastically.
"You feel it so personally when you hold this letter in your hand."
"The castle in England" covers the period from the middle ages to the evardian era and tells about the families who lived in Scotney; each story is illustrated by one of the young British artists - Isaac Lenkevich, Briony may Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
This isn't the first Rhodes book to be based on archival data: in 2014, he wrote "dead man's Teeth and other stories", a collection of British library documents; this project suddenly touched him to the core.
"I could be moved by just a fingerprint on the edge of a letter written in the 1700s by a double agent working for the Jacobites," he says.
"This is his fingerprint"
And letters always smell of smoke, because in those days for lighting lit the fire.
And in 300 years, in the future, you feel like you're there too.
Ah, as I love archives!"
For a man gripped by such a passion for old papers, getting support from the National Foundation and the English art Council and living in a castle for four months ("Honestly, I'm a bit stale there") seems too good to be true.
Rhodes spent days studying the" new " Victorian castle, went through the archives and examined the numerous treasures of the estate and Antiques - for example, the heads of hyenas on the walls or bottles, centuries lying in the moat.
He walked through the Park and the ruins of the old castle, talking to foresters, gardeners and sometimes with artists who worked on illustrations for his book.
Then at night he"drank whiskey and sat down to write."
The history of Scotney castle is not well studied, because the national trust only gained full access to It in 2006, when the last heiress, Elizabeth Hassi, died.
When Rhodes arrived ten years later, the staff were just beginning to deal with the archive, which he describes as "what aristocrats for centuries dumped in the attic."
Diaries, letters from the times of the British Empire, maps showing who owned what: "you think that land disputes are boring - says Rhodes - but this birch was fought by two families.
It happens sometimes, guys!"
In some stories, the collection castle becomes the starting point for more research in English history: for example, in the "Worker", the hero leaves the newly built castle to join the Peasant revolution of 1381.
"There is information about the revolt that occurred in the castle in 1380, in a book called" the Knights 'families of Kent and Sussex," says Rhodes.
"The peasant revolt began in these places, and I thought that the revolt is a good beginning.
Maybe they were connected?"
Other subjects are strongly connected with the history of the castle - for example, "the Priest", which tells about the Jesuit priest, whom the Darrel family hid for seven years during the English reformation.
Or "Smuggler", about the smuggler of the XVIII century Arthur Darrel, who is believed to have staged his own funeral, stuffing the coffin with stones (it was discovered a few years later when the coffin was dug).
Darrel - favorite family of Rhodes, of all that was inhabited by Scotney: "Gentlemen, it seems, was the perfect crooks, forever in debt and spending money that could not afford it.
In different generations, male Darrells solved their problems with debt by marrying rich older women - I imagine them as a company of nice guys who know how to care for the heirs of large States."
After finishing work at the castle Rhodes is looking for other opportunities to get a unique writing experience.
He spent two weeks in the Finnish wilderness, where he wrote a graphic novel about Samanmali - the place where in the beginning of XX century there was a sanatorium, and then it is again overgrown with forest.
But Scotney remains a special place for him.
"I was sad to leave," he says.
"I felt like this: damn it, I have to go back to real life again."
Fifteen largest banks choose " Russia"
The conflict in the Association of Russian banks (ARB) develops: after Sberbank, VTB, VTB-24, Alfa-Bank, Gazprombank, Rosselkhozbank, Binbank and FC "Otkrytie", seven credit organizations are going to leave this public organization.
Thus, the share of organizations that came out of ARB will account for at least 80 percent of the market.
But this is not just a way out - all the banks that announced the break with the ARB are negotiating with another public organization that unites credit institutions - the Association of regional banks "Russia", which is headed by a well-known politician Anatoly Aksakov, Chairman of the state Duma Committee on the financial market, recognized, by the way, by the results of the last session and the most effective head of the Duma Committee and the Deputy on the number of draft laws.
The beginning of the conflict within the ARB was put during the discussion in the Federation Council, when the Interregional banking Council considered new bills, in particular, involving a new classification of banks depending on the size of the authorized capital.
Then Garegin Tosunyan, the President of ARB, said that, according to the Association, this bill is adopted in the interests of the largest banks, which thus try to limit the opportunities of small and medium-sized banks in the regions, intercepting their clientele.
Among other complaints were voiced criticism of the Central Bank, which, in the opinion of the Tosunyan, not always justified conducting the withdrawal of licenses from some banks, which, however, followed an objection from the representative of the Central Bank that many managers at the fault of the banks, in particular, Vneshprombank was included in the governing bodies of the ARB.
Apparently, this exchange of mutually exclusive views in a very sensitive to relations with the main regulator of the banking environment and became a visible reason for the fifteen largest banks, declaring disagreement with the policy of the ARB, began to prepare for joining the Association "Russia", noting that "the effectiveness of the ARB nahoidtsya at a low level, and a constructive dialogue within the banking community is not actually held."
Investors will be better
How it ends?
We will answer the main question that arises at the slightest failure or conflict in the banking sector or next to it: depositors are not in danger, rather, on the contrary, the reliability of the banking system will increase.
Anatoly Aksakov, known for his scrupulousness in everything that concerns the interests of banks and their customers, is the head of "Russia". he is a high-level professional, who is highly appreciated in the Central Bank: almost all the Central Bank management is present at the annual events of the Association, and all significant legislative initiatives of the regulator go through expert assessments of "regionals".
In terms of personnel and organization, obviously, no special shocks are expected.
Undoubtedly, the ARB gets into a difficult financial and management situation after it loses such powerful and influential participants with their contributions and lobbying capabilities.
However, this oldest organization, established in 1991, which defends the interests of the banking community, has considerable potential to continue to improve banking legislation and the sphere of monetary circulation in General.
It is impossible to say that the Association "Russia" with open arms ready to accept on any terms new members, judging by the reaction of its head, Anatoly Aksakov ("maybe too much will want"), which is still 21 July at a briefing at the press center of the parliamentary newspaper, said that "the next day, representatives of banks came out of the ARB asked me to consider the possibility to increase the potential of our Association "Russia".
Their proposals are to strengthen the voice of bankers in the Council of the Association, as well as to pay more attention to new banking technologies.
Now there is a negotiation process, the proposals of both parties are being studied, the agenda of the extraordinary Congress of the Association is being prepared, which will be held in Sochi in mid-September as part of the international banking forum.
There and decide.
Also Anatoly Aksakov, stressing that" the chair does not hold", called the possible new head of the updated Association" Russia " George Luntovsky, who leaves in September as Deputy Chairman of the Central Bank, highly describing his business and human qualities.
On August 18, Anatoly Aksakov, who is currently resting in the Crimea, plans to interrupt his vacation for one day and arrive in Moscow for an extraordinary meeting of the Council of the Association "Russia", where it is planned to consider the agenda of the extraordinary Congress "Russia".
The entry of cars with a gasoline engine in the major cities of Russia will not be limited
Deputy head of the Ministry of transport Nikolai Asaul said that, contrary to media reports, the entry of cars with a gasoline engine in major cities of Russia will not be limited.
This is a more radical form of our concept.
Our concept is that we need to gradually improve the environmental class.
And there is the concept to go directly to zero emissions.
I believe that we are not technically ready for this.
The question is still: what year?
This is such a phrase at the level of slogans-let's ban.
Where and when?
Tomorrow?
Close the town?
"In 20 years - I do not know, maybe it will happen, "Prime quotes the Minister.
Earlier, the Izvestia newspaper reported that by August 17, Deputy Prime Minister Arkady Dvorkovich was instructed to study proposals on possible options for state support of electric transport, presented to the government by the General Director of PJSC KAMAZ Sergey Kogogin.
Among the proposals, according to the newspaper, - the use of cars with ice in large cities and resorts.
Washington is changing the rules for obtaining green card.
As reported by the media, the President, Donald trump declared that it adopted a new immigration plan of the United States, according to which will change the rules for obtaining your green card.
The plan aims to reduce the number of legal immigrants to 50,000 per year, stricter rules for temporary work visas and restrictions on family visas.
The new rules are proposed by the Republican party and supported by the President.
The bill will be discussed in two chambers of Congress.
"This law will reduce poverty, increase wages and save taxpayers billions of dollars, and will do it by changing the way the US issues green cards to citizens of other countries.
The law will reduce chain migration and replace the existing scheme.
The new application process will provide benefits to candidates who speak English, have the cash resources that allow them to support themselves, and have the skills that will benefit our economy," trump said, according to American media.
The appearance of sex robots is real, and that should worry us
Before we thought that 2017 could not get worse, a new report on technological advances in the production of sex robots was released.
Cbms.
Sex robots are the center of attention now.
The responsible robotics Foundation (FRR) recently released a report on the development of sex robots in the next 5-10 years.
According to Noel Sharkey, honored Professor of robotics and artificial intelligence At the University of Sheffield and FRR co-founder, we must take their appearance seriously.
Users will be able to choose the color of the robot eyes, the shape of the nipples and the type of nails.
"People are giggling about it, but firms are already sending it to consumers in large numbers, and we will see a lot more of them soon," Sharkey said at the presentation of the new report.
Modern sex dolls have evolved from their inflatable counterparts into robots with silicone skin, warm to the touch, and with almost human replicas, which are controlled by artificial intelligence.
Users can also customize their robots to your liking, choosing everything from eye color and shape of the nipples of the robot to the shape and color of the nails.
But the fact that many robots have a "personality", in comparison with which Stepford Wife would seem very progressive, worries even more.
Modern sex dolls have turned into robots with silicone skin.
For example, RealBotix robot allows users to customize the quality of robots that they find attractive - for example, shyness.
There are still sex robots Roxxxy Gold developed by "True Companion", which come with already programmed personality - for example, "Cold Farrah" gives the impression of shy, and "wild Wendy" has a "bold" character.
"Roxxxy Gold has a character that perfectly suits your" - enthusiastically reports the site "True Companion".
So she likes what you like, dislikes what you dislike, and so on.
She changes her mood during the day, like a real person!
She may want to sleep or chat, or she may "be in the mood"!"
The advent of sex robots, much cause for concern - not least because they replace real human relationships, but that bothers only the subordinate image of women, the Association with rape, which is handling the Cold (read: resisting) Headlight.
On the website "True Companion" Roxxxy is compared to a vibrator, only for men.
"If a woman (sic!) maybe a vibrator, why can't men have a Roxxxy?"- it is said on the website.
But these sex robots are not just fetishes or just new sex toys.
Their appearance and increasing complexity points to something darker and deeper in our culture, a departure from the ideal of gender equality towards the desire for sex with submission as an optional Supplement.
Most men, of course, will not buy sex robots, and although FRR notes their growing popularity, they remain at the periphery of consumer culture.
But what comes to us from the periphery can be very instructive about the meanings of the era in which we live.
And many people are not bad or aggressive until the free market gives them the opportunity to do so.
It's not a coincidence that these sophisticated sex robots came about just when women's rights around the world were at stake, when there is a President in the White house who brags about harassing women.
The most terrible thing in the TV series "the story of the maid" - not graphic images, twisted body and squeezed eyes, namely how this vision seems realistic.
The Republic of Gilead is an exaggeration, but now it doesn't seem that big.
The purpose of the sex robots to achieve such a physical similarity to the real women (only with the proportions of porn stars), what allows technology.
Their creators want them to seem human to touch, to copy the movements of the human body.
But it is their "characters" robots are not like real women.
They can't break up with their partners or leave them.
They have no life, no biography-nothing that could indicate independence or anything else that could destroy the illusion of full dependence.
In other words, they are beautiful slaves.
Or, as they say in 2017, - maids.
A native of Los Angeles Eugene (Fluff) Jeter, who has been playing for the Ukrainian national team since 2013, will not help our national team at the European basketball championship, the final part of which starts on August 31.
About it in interview to portal BeBasket said General Manager of "blue-yellow" Andrey Lebedev.
We tried to make a deal with Jeter, but unfortunately, he won't come for family reasons.
We will go to the Eurobasket without a naturalized player, because we do not want to take someone we do not know.
"This situation will provide opportunities for the development of our young players," he said.
Let me remind you: with the direct participation of the national team of Ukraine Jeter took a record for a sixth place in Eurobasket-2013 and first came to the world basketball championship, where the "yellow-blue" could not overcome the group stage, and a native of the United States scored an average of 15.4 points per game, made 3 rebounds and gave 5 assists.
Jeter stopped playing for the national team of Ukraine since the departure from the post of head coach of our national team American Mike Fratello, who left the post in 2015.
Men's Eurobasket 2017 will be held simultaneously in four countries: Turkey, Romania, Israel and Finland.
The Ukrainian team will hold its matches of the group tournament on the promised Land.
Wards Evgeny Murzin in group B will have five matches: with Germany (August 31), Italy (September 2), Georgia (3rd), Lithuania (5th) and Israel (6th).
In preparation for the tournament, our men's team held two control matches, in which they lost to the Dutch and Belarusians.
Trump's great feat?
Playing MITT Romney seems reasonable.
In the trump era, a common place was the fact that the political disputes that polarized the American electorate broke up some families at the micro level.
Between thanksgiving and Christmas, American Newspapers were full of columns about how to deal with the terrible relatives voting for trump.
I think we're all so tense, we're about to burst.
Less talk about trump's ability to connect families.
I write about it because my cousin, a leftist poet from Chicago who has long been on the knife with Republicans in his family, came to me in new York this week.
She reminded me that uniting against a common enemy can have a strong effect.
Under trump, in the White house, everyone she knows, including the Republican brother she's been arguing with about politics for decades, suddenly and strangely found themselves on the same side.
At dinner, it's undoubtedly good; but I can't help but think that in a wider context, it can be quite dangerous.
Trump has breathed strength into the left flank, but the deforming effect of his rule can move us all to the right.
When we talk about trump and" normalization, " we mean the unlikely possibility that one day we will be no longer struck by his antics.
There is, however, an even more dubious scenario in which trump "normalizes" the rightmost Republicans, who against the background of his standards will suddenly seem a model of common sense.
I caught myself missing the old - fashioned MITT Romney madness-with a dog on the roof of the car and a 14 percent income tax today (but we at least knew what his tax return looked like) - compared to trump, both seem like a very small evil.
When trump leaves, the next Republican candidate will simply be in his mind to be seen as a huge step forward.
When my cousin went to the center, we went with the kids to the carousel in Central Park - the largest carousel in the economy of the parks Department of new York and the best way in town to spend three dollars, if you don't need the caffeine.
Horses menacing and huge, pictures of fiberglass on a Central drum - smiling clowns and animals that are bent, terrified look on his back, is extremely ominous, and sounding music, ironically, is underwhelming.
So many famous things in this city are frustrating: the views from skyscrapers become outdated, the silhouettes of buildings become too boring to cause awe, and the reality of the city does not have time for a dream.
Thirty-five years have passed, and I'm still experiencing the day when I learned that the Swiss cottage area is not really a Swiss Chalet (the themed pub Ye oldde Swiss Cottage does not count), but a large roundabout in North London.
A carousel in Central Park-it is still an unusual, magical place in which a child of two years, a child of eleven years and two women in forty can have a great time.
If I could put a carousel score, I would put an a, but fortunately, no one asked me about it.
And in the Department store this week, I was asked to evaluate my "shopping experience" on a scale of one to five stars before holding a card through the terminal.
In the coffee shop on the corner of my street all the same plus the option to accompany the assessment of the tip of 15 percent - it's for the order at the counter.
As a result, not only is the idea of neutral interaction slowed down, but also it is necessary to make a personal attitude in a situation that does not involve it.
The poor saleswoman at the Department store sheepishly smiled as I wearily evaluated their experience of handing her credit card to five stars.
Oscar Pistorius transferred from prison to hospital due to chest pain
Pistorius is leaving the prison for a second visit to the doctor.
Last year, he was transferred to a hospital for the treatment of wrist cuts, which the prison administration claimed he received as a result of a fall in a cell.
Pistorius was convicted of premeditated murder after an appeal by the Prosecutor's office for an initial sentence for manslaughter.
He killed Steenkamp in the early morning of Valentine's day in 2013 by shooting her several times through the door of the toilet room in his home in Pretoria.
Pistorius said that he took his girlfriend for a night thief, hiding in his toilet.
The Prosecutor's office announced its intention to file another protest, this time against the six-year term of Pretorius, which, she said, is too soft.
The attorney General's office has stated that it will appeal to the Supreme court of South Africa and the appeal will be considered this year.
The Pretorius ' term may be extended by 15 years if the Prosecutor's office succeeds.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.

The Russian foreign Ministry accused the Vice President of the United States in the rhetoric of the "cold war"
The statements made during the European tour by us Vice President Michael Pence, were criticized by the Russian foreign Ministry.
"We regret to state that Washington is slipping deeper and deeper to the primitive ideologized clichés of the cold war, which are completely divorced from reality, "the Russian foreign Ministry said in a statement.
So the Foreign Ministry reacted to the words of Pence about the "Russian threat" and attempts to forcibly redraw the borders, he said in Podgorica.
The Russian foreign Ministry pointed to the destructiveness of the choice "either with the West or with Russia" and the non-obvious thesis about the alleged non-alternative entry of all South-Eastern Europe into NATO.
Russian diplomats also recalled that the United States violated international law by using force to alienate Kosovo from Serbia and thus created another hotbed of tension.
"We call on our American colleagues to stop the shelming of Russia and its foreign policy line, which is always based on respect for partners and readiness for joint constructive work, on mutual consideration of interests," the Russian foreign Ministry said in a statement.

Grigory Leps: "I'm torn into battle, although 55-not 30"
One of the most successful artists of the Russian stage Grigory Leps next Sunday will celebrate its 55th anniversary.
Before the ceremony the singer spoke with the columnist of "Izvestia".
I remember your "fifty".
A special tent in the "Luzhniki", Gloria Gaynor sang for the birthday, a powerful salute over the Moscow river.
You were probably just figuring out how you wanted to spend your next five years.
Plans come true?
If we talk about the profession, it was a good period.
I worked a lot, toured the country three times, gave 120-130 concerts a year.
Released two quite good album of.
Of course, now I'm not the same as, say, 20 years ago.
The biological clock is not deceived.
Singing the way I sang at 30 is getting harder.
However, I'm eager to fight, I don't want to stop.
And I with new people, it seems to me, I come to other level.
With them you and a new album recording, the first for three years.
Yes, we are working on it now.
Actually, we've already recorded everything in my Studio and now we're sending it to Los Angeles for mixing.
It's called "why so serious?"on the song of the same name, which was written together with Timothy.
It's not quite ready yet, so we haven't put it out yet.
We'll do it later, when we shoot the video.
And the album will be presented in November-for a series of my anniversary concerts in the Moscow "Crocus city Hall".
A great American drummer Chris Coleman had a hand in your new record.
You seem to want it in your touring band to attract?
In my opinion, Coleman is one of the most outstanding drummers in the world today.
He came to my Studio, recorded his parts.
I offered him to be a part of my band and Jeremy Coulson (a well-known drummer involved in various projects. - "News") offered.
But for long-term work in Russia they put forward, to put it mildly, excessive conditions.
It was a question of fees from €35 million to €45 thousand.
Then I thought that I would find worthy musicians in the post-Soviet space.
And I found a great drummer max Malyshev.
Generally it is better to feed her (smiles).
Sometimes I want to find fault with one of them, not for that.
For example, guitarist Fedor Dosumov is highly regarded at the international level.
About him write Western music magazines, he was invited to various guitar festivals.
Steve Vai, after listening to his game, said that"a new generation of guitarists, with a different performing technique."
Your album comes down in Los Angeles, American musicians cooperate with you, but you still can not come to the United States?
Are you trying to lift that ban?
Now, frankly, I do nothing.
There are a number of lawyers who deal with this issue.
As a musician, I'm really sorry that I can't go to America.
I've said that I study there.
The more you communicate with real professionals, the more useful.
We are not dumber than them, but we have no such experience, school.
For 70 years, our popular music performers have not been faced with the tasks that American musicians have always solved.
They sought to maximize the quality of sound.
And I'm trying to follow the same principles.
Now, for some reason, the UK refused me entry for ten years.
But I still every year will apply for a visa to the British Embassy, so I was again allowed to go there and most importantly - to work there.
The rest of Europe treats me favourably.
And in August, you have a concert in Monaco, not a custom, and Billboard, right?
Yes, there is a good sporting hall in Monte Carlo, I have performed there once.
Now invited again, and, as far as I know, all tickets to the concert are already sold out.
"Rendezvous Laima Vaikule", which starts on 20 July in Jurmala will go?
She invited me, and I, of course, responded.
Lyme is a great singer and a great woman who knows how to present herself and beautiful vocals, and even whisper.
After the tour and anniversary concerts, as far as I know, you once again want to turn to the work of Vladimir Vysotsky.
You already have two albums with his songs in your discography.
When will the third?
Probably next year.
But it will be completely different made.
I want to record about 80-90 songs Vysotsky about the same filing, as he did himself.
Only voice and guitar.
No other arrangement.
Our famous musician Timur Vedernikov will accompany me.
I will try to involve Alexander Rosenbaum in the album as well.
I talked to him about it, we have a good relationship, but he's a busy man, so we'll see how it goes.
You and the songs of Boris Grebenshchikov gradually to your repertoire introduced.
Maybe then you can make an album of his stuff?
Boris Borisovich is a wonderful person and a great musician.
I crossed paths with him several times and asked: can I sing this or that song?
He said, " Grigory, I write songs for them to be performed."
Please try, sing.
Probably, it is interesting to record such an album.
I do not have such a task yet, but in the future, in a year or two, if Boris Borisovich does not object, I may make such a project.
If you don't focus entirely on your production center.
I guess you haven't realized his potential yet, signed contracts with all the artists you're interested in?
There are a number of performers that I would like to have under my wing, but they are independent, established people.
You Mean Sergey Lazarev?
Serezha is a brilliant singer, I invited him.
I can not agree with something with his repertoire, but he is a professional and he has his own development strategy.
And in my center now there is Alexander Panayotov, whom I led in the "Voice".
We have signed a contract with him and are working.
In our pop music such singers are rare.
It would be a sincere pity if he did not reach the heights he deserved.
I'm trying to find him a repertoire, shoot videos.
I hope for a good result.
I also try to promote other artists of my center: I buy them songs, pay poets, sometimes their tracks get into rotation of TV and radio channels.
If they do not reach great heights, I will still bring our cooperation to its logical conclusion.
At the output they will receive a recorded album, a few clips.
And then, if they want, they can go their own way, and I will not insist that they return the money invested in them.
Although I will be pleased if one of them will achieve commercial success and pay me interest, which we agreed in the contract.
But if this does not happen, I am not going to block the oxygen to anyone.
Let all work, make their way, prove, as I once proved.
If tomorrow you will be offered a tour of Ukraine and guarantee entry into the country, will you go?
I'm still invited.
Basically, we are talking about closed events.
As for the big tour...
I am a man of my country, a Russian, on my own conviction, I flew to Syria on the very plane that then crashed.
If tomorrow they say that you need to fly to some other point in the interests of the state - fly.
And I don't care what bloggers and other critics think about me.
I sincerely regret that this situation has turned out with Ukraine.
Because I think we are one people and we should be together.
I regret that this is unlikely to happen, at least in the near future.
And before I after all gave for year in Ukraine on 40-50'.
Met, as nowhere.
Very grateful audience.
And he collaborated with several Ukrainian artists: Ani Lorak, Sveta Loboda, Artem Loik...
In Ukraine, a lot of talented people, and sincerely sorry that now they can not fully throw out their talent to a wide Russian audience.
Music should unite and entertain people.
I would love to invite some cool Ukrainian singer to Russia, such as the Glory of Vakarchuk, and made a joint concert with him.
But I think it's unlikely at this point...
Andrei Okhlopkov was transferred from the cosmodrome
As it became known to Kommersant, the technical Director of the Vostochny cosmodrome Andrey Okhlopkov began work at the state space research and production center (scspc) named after Khrunichev.
Previously, he was de facto engaged in the construction of the Vostochny cosmodrome, but due to disagreements with the management of the ground and space infrastructure operation Center (TsENKI), he was transferred to an enterprise in Moscow fily, where he will coordinate production.
Mate mister ohlopkova will not: post as technical Director, is likely to abolish, and the functionality will spread to departments TsENKI.
The fact that the technical Director of the Eastern and Deputy General Director of the TsENKI for technological development Andrey Okhlopkov has moved to work in the SCNP named after Khrunichev, "Kommersant" told the top managers of several enterprises of the space industry, as well as an employee of the government.
"He has been working in a new post for several weeks, "the interlocutors of Kommersant in the industry said.
To obtain prompt review TsENKI Thursday failed, and mister Ohlopkov for review were unavailable.
However, the information of "Kommersant" was officially confirmed by the scopc.
He made the decision on transition to a position of the Director on coordination of production, - declared at the enterprise. - Andrey Okhlopkov fully fulfilled the task set before him to ensure the launch minimum for the first launch at the Vostochny cosmodrome.
Mr. Okhlopkov moved to work in TsENKI in 2013, having a service in the space forces, in particular at Baikonur, and in Plesetsk - at the "Northern" cosmodrome he held the post of first Deputy commander with the rank of Colonel.
In 2009 Andrey Okhlopkov became a defendant in the criminal case.
The investigation accused him of bribery: allegedly with his filing of regional merchants received for kickbacks of state orders, but did not fulfill their obligations to clean the separated parts of the launch vehicles in the Arkhangelsk region and the Republic of Komi.
In 2012, the jury found him innocent.
The technological development duties assigned to him at TsENKI extended to various projects, but the main one was the construction of a cosmodrome in the far East.
Oleg Ostapenko, who headed the Federal space Agency at the time, in an interview with Kommersant, said directly that the situation in the East "was critical in October 2013."
The fact that the planning was made a strategic mistake: the completion of construction and the first launch of the launch vehicle "Soyuz-2.1" were scheduled for the same time-the end of 2015.
To carry out the launch before the end of the year, it was decided to complete the construction six months earlier and the terms were shifted from December to July 2015.
To speed up the process had to go to the trick: experts TsENKI began to conduct parallel installation of technological equipment on unfinished objects.
The main supporter of this idea was Andrey Okhlopkov.
Despite the existing risks and still happened transfer (instead of December 2015-th "Union" flew only 28 April 2016), this idea has justified itself, says the source of "Kommersant" at the cosmodrome: "Otherwise we would still not have carried out any launch from the East, and would be engaged in construction."
Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin, in charge of the creation of the cosmodrome, jokingly called Andrei Okhlopkov his "space Susanin", but it was he who almost always requested information about the progress of construction.
I remember Mr. Okhlopkov and straightforwardness: for example, in an interview with Kommersant, he proposed to deprive the Federal Agency for special construction (Spetsstroy) of the status of the only performer in the East and directly work with subcontractors: "Why should we put all our eggs in one basket of Spetsstroy?"
This idea found support in the government.
Since 2017, TsENKI has assumed the duties of a General contractor to complete construction and installation works at the launch and technical complex by the scheduled launches in the fourth quarter.
According to Kommersant, the reason for the transition of Mr. Okhlopkov to a new place of work was disagreements with the leadership of TsENKI regarding ways to complete the construction of facilities and complexes of the cosmodrome, as well as methods of working with subcontractors.
"It was decided that it would be better for everyone," says one of the top managers involved in the construction of the East.
The official of the government staff, in turn, calls the decision strange:"He was one of the best specialists, it will be difficult to find an equivalent replacement for him."
According to Kommersant, this will not be required: the post of technical Director of the cosmodrome will be abolished, and its functions will be scattered among the units of the CSC.
In music schools there will be a program of training in two specialties
In the future, students of children's music schools will be able to receive two specialties at the same time.
According to the Deputy Director of the Department of science and education of the Ministry of culture Svyatoslav Golubenko, it is possible to transfer to students repetitive subjects, and the issue of payment of the remaining classes in the second specialty to solve with the help of special grants, reports "RIA Novosti".
"The Ministry of culture has taken this issue under control, and together with the expert community we will develop a mechanism that will allow to master two specialties, but at the same time will not contradict the current legislation in the field of education," Golubenko said.
Last Friday, during Vladimir Putin's" Unchildish conversation "with pupils of the Sirius children's center, Maria Andreeva, a student, said that she was forced to pay for repetitive subjects in the second specialty at the Moscow Conservatory.
The girl said that she studies violin and piano and has awards in both directions.
The President acknowledged it is a very important issue and promised to help.
In Mexico, detained climbed the wall on a skyscraper 17-year-old Russian
In Mexico detained 17-year-old Russian Kirill N., who climbed the wall on the roof of a high-rise building, according to the portal El Universal.
The incident occurred in the capital of Mexico city.
The young man with the help of two unknown men climbed over a three-meter fence on the territory of the complex of office buildings of Nestle and independently climbed one of its towers.
However, he did not use any special equipment, insurance and ropes.
Detained the young man already on a roof.
Employees of the Ministry of public security lowered him to the ground by helicopter.
After that, he was sent to the national Institute of migration.
They find out whether the young man is legally in the country.
Meanwhile, a video with a young man climbing a high-rise has become popular on the Web.
Users called the young man "spider-man".
According to the media, such experiments are a hobby for him.
Red meat, dairy and chocolate can help ease the GCS.
Red meat and chocolate are considered a nightmare for your digestive tract.
But recent studies suggest the opposite: a diet rich in meat proteins and dairy products can help relieve symptoms in those suffering from inflammatory bowel diseases.
This incurable disease, which affects approximately 1.3 million people in the US and 300,000 in the UK, leads to colic and bloating, chronic or bloody diarrhea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
Usually, to alleviate the symptoms, patients are advised to avoid meat and dairy products, but researchers from the University of Washington have found that the main amino acid protein tryptophan promotes the production of immune cells that increase intestinal tolerance.
Lead researcher Dr. Marco Colonna explained that immune cells in the gut make sure that harmful microbes coming from food do not penetrate the body.
Cells that can trigger inflammation are balanced by cells that increase tolerance while protecting the body without damaging sensitive tissues.
If the balance is too much disturbed in the direction of inflammation, it can lead to inflammatory bowel diseases.
Experiments have shown that mice that have a certain bacteria in the intestine, there are cells that increase tolerance.
And this bacterium needs tryptophan, one of the building blocks of protein, to trigger these cells.
Professor Colonna said: "we have established a link between one type of bacteria, Lactobacillus reuteri, which is part of a normal gut microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that increase tolerance.
The more tryptophan they had in their mouse diet, the more immune cells they had."
He suggested that the same would work in humans: a combination of L. reuteri and a tryptophan-rich diet could promote a more tolerant and less inflammatory environment in the gut.
Postdoc Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Paraganas, studying the variation of increasing the tolerance of the immune cells, found that one group of experimental mice, these cells were, and the other group, which belonged to the same line, but separated, they were not.
She suggested that the difference could be caused by mouse gut microbiomes - communities of bacteria, viruses, and fungi that normally live in the gastrointestinal tract.
The DNA of mouse gut cells was sequenced and six species of bacteria were found to be present in mice that have immune cells but are absent in mice that do not have them.
Mice grown in a sterile environment that did not have a good microbiome and did not develop this type of immune cells received L. reuteri, and immune cells appeared in them.
To understand how bacteria affect the immune system, the researchers raised L. reuteri in a liquid medium and then transferred small portions of the liquid - without bacteria - to underdeveloped immune cells isolated from mice.
Immune cells have turned into cells that increase tolerance.
When the active component was separated from the liquid, it turned out to be a by-product of tryptophan processing, known as indole-3-lactic acid.
When researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in mouse food, the number of these cells increased by about 50 percent, but when the level of tryptophan was halved, the number of cells also fell by half.
Dr. Cervantes-barragán explains that humans have the same tolerance-enhancing cells as mice, and most of us have L. reuteri in our gastrointestinal tract.
It is not known whether tryptophan by-products from L. reuteri contribute to the development of cells in humans as well as in mice, but defects in genes associated with tryptophan have been found in people suffering from inflammatory bowel diseases.
She says: "Perhaps the development of these cells and we need to strengthen, because these cells depends on the inflammatory processes on the inner surface of the intestines.
High levels of tryptophan in the presence of L. reuteri can potentially lead to an expansion of their population."
According to Jose Mourinho, Manchester United hired a genius in the face of Neman MATIC
Manchester United have hired a genius in the face of Neman MATIC, says Jose Mourinho after the midfielder made his debut in the match against Sampdoria on Wednesday evening.
The player acquired for £ 40 million from Chelsea, started with a victory 2-1 in Dublin in the last preseason match Manchester United before the UEFA super Cup match against "real Madrid" on Thursday and was impressed in a midfield role, while players like Fields Pogba and Andreas Pereira broke forward when they please.
However, as MATIC did not take part in Chelsea's pre-season tour of Asia, he seriously lacked the preparation for the game, and he stood only 45 minutes, which, according to Mourinho, needs to be improved before the start of the Premier League season.
"He needs time, but his experience, intelligence, genius in the way he thinks – he thinks football," said Mourinho.
"We will help him prepare sooner rather than later."
Just like MATIC, his new players, Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku, began playing at the Aviva stadium when Mourinho began to form his main team by the beginning of the next season.
The independent newspaper reported this week that Mourinho wanted to hire three more players, but stressed that the club has already achieved fantastic results, hiring three of the four players he would like to hire in the first place.
"I am grateful to the club for the fact that he got three out of four," he added.
"I'll be even more happy if they get me four out of four, but they've already tried very hard for me."
Former social Democrat leaders of Lithuania are persuading them to stay in the ruling coalition
Former chairmen of the social democratic party of Lithuania, former Prime Ministers Algirdas butkevičius and Gediminas Kirkilas, as well as former speaker of the Seimas from the social Democrats cheslovas jurshenas appealed to the party members to remain in the ruling coalition.
As reported by the "parliamentary newspaper", due to friction with partners - the Union of peasants and" green " - in the Social democratic party initiated a discussion whether to remain in the ruling coalition.
And three senior experienced fellow turned to the party members with an open letter which reads in part: "Clearly the disappointment of the comrades in the party elections, but the coalition with the "peasants" have created for us, though not very light, but still the conditions for further implementation of the goals of social justice, which on our initiative envisaged in the government program, and to maintaining the political dominance of the center-left over right-wing parties".
According to the former party leaders, the discussion so far "has prevailed emotional expression of opinion without concrete arguments."
The authors of the letter fear that their party may lead Lithuania to political, economic and social instability by rash actions.
Disabled Anton Mamaev was given a fine
The Moscow city court commuted the sentence to wheelchair-disabled Anton Mamayev from four and a half years in prison to a fine of 200 thousand rubles.
Informed decision Timiryazevsky court convicted were released from prison.
At the same time the Moscow city court confirmed that the accused is a criminal as organized robbery and kidnapping of the motor scooter at the former fighter of special troops.
The Moscow city court in its decision reduced the sentence to Anton Mamaev up to 200 thousand rbl. of the penalty.
"Mamayev is the organizer of the robbery, which also forms part of the crime, and, accordingly, such a person should be brought to criminal responsibility," Ulyana Solopova, press Secretary of the Moscow city court, explained to Kommersant.
In this case, the court took into account the state of health of Mamayev, the actual circumstances of the case, the absence of aggravating circumstances.
In addition, the court applied Art. 64 of the criminal code, according to which it is possible to impose a punishment below the lower limit.
As for the assistant Mamayev Vasily Serostanov, the court didn't establish circumstances which would become the basis for change of category of gravity of deeds and change of a sentence.
Anton Mamayev declared that he was dissatisfied with the decision of the Moscow city court.
I'm disappointed with the court decision.
The only legitimate solution would be to justify, to continue fighting for justice.
His lawyer Andrei Orlov did not rule out an appeal against the verdict in the cassation instance of the Moscow city court and the Supreme court.
"We will use all the levers up to the European court of human rights, "he told RIA Novosti.
We will remind, 28-year-old Muscovite Anton Mamayev, suffering from spinal muscular atrophy, became a defendant in the criminal case last autumn.
The disabled person claims that he bought a scooter from friends for 160 thousand rubles., then to sell.
However, the owners of the scooter, among them-a former special forces soldier, said that the disabled person and his assistant Vasily Serostanov took away their property, threatening to use violence.
June 30 Timiryazevsky district court of Moscow sentenced Vasily Serostanov to three years in prison, and Anton Mamayev - to four and a half years in prison to serve a sentence in a colony (part 2 of article 162 of the criminal code).
After the immobilized disabled person was placed in a pre-trial detention center, the Public chamber, the Prosecutor General's office, the Commissioner for human rights under the President Tatyana Moskalkova joined the case.
As a result, in mid-July Anton Mamayev was released from jail by the decision of the same Timiryazev court.
The defense, in turn, appealed the decision of the first instance to the Moscow city court.
Onf will prepare a report to the President on the environment
The final " action Forum "of the All-Russian people's front (onf) in 2017 will be devoted to environmental issues, a source in the onf told Izvestiya and confirmed the head of the Executive Committee of the movement Alexei Anisimov.
According to him, according to the results of the forum, "veterans" plan to prepare a report to the President on the problems of the domestic environment, as well as to propose a strategy for their solution.
The interlocutors of" Izvestiya "in the onf note that the report to the head of state will contain" deep Analytics " on the situation in all Federal districts of the country.
According to "Izvestiya", the final forum of the onf will be held in the autumn.
The exact date of its holding has not yet been determined - as a rule, it adapts to the schedule of the President, who is the leader of the movement and is traditionally present at key events of the onf.
The front held several interregional environmental conferences, one for two Federal districts-in Rostov-on-don, Kaliningrad and Kirov.
The final conference will be held in the capital of the Republic of Buryatia Ulan-Ude.
On the basis of the proposals that have been expressed and will be expressed at these events, we will form a system of proposals to address environmental problems, - told "Izvestiya" interlocutor in the onf.
Co-Chairman of the Central staff of the movement Olga Timofeeva, head of the state Duma Committee on ecology and environmental protection, said that the "veterans" will report to the head of state on the work carried out within the Year of ecology in Russia.
The final environmental forum and the" Forum for action " of the onf are likely to be combined.
During the year, we have grown a powerful team of experts in the field of environmental problems, saw gaps in the legislation, stopped dozens of violations of the law.
All this will be included in the report that we are preparing to the President as the leader of our movement.
In addition to this document, "veterans" will report on the work on priority projects of the onf, - told "Izvestia" Olga Timofeeva.
According to her, the special representative of the head of state on environmental protection, ecology and transport Sergey Ivanov will be invited to the forum.
Previously, he has participated in the work of the media Forum of the popular front, which in April was held in St. Petersburg.
In a few months, the year of ecology will go down in history, and the most important thing that needs to be done today is to launch environmental protection mechanisms so that they work for many years.
These issues are not dropped from the agenda, - said Olga Timofeeva.
The head of the laboratory of regional policy of the Expert Institute of social research (EIS) Andrey Kolyadin noted: raising environmental issues, the onf acts in line with the presidential agenda.
Many things they as experts offered at various forums, and these initiatives received support of the President, - Andrey Kolyadin told "to news".
He stressed that today it is impossible to exclude the economic potential of the environmental agenda, which can give the regions an additional impetus for development.
In the future, with the help of the onf, the regions will be able to lobby not only the solution of their environmental problems, but also the development of ecotourism, the expert added.
The relevance of the environmental theme was demonstrated by the "straight line" with Vladimir Putin in June.
In particular, the President was asked questions about the garbage dump in Balashikha (already closed) and about coal dust in the port of Nakhodka (a bill has already been developed to ban open transshipment of coal in settlements, one of the authors - Olga Timofeeva).
Experts in the field of ecology believe that the legal framework for solving environmental problems in Russia as a whole is created, the question is further law enforcement, as well as the position of civil society.
We need a clear implementation of the decisions taken by the state, - said the head of the charity Fund "Ecology for all" Leonid Bochin.
Member of the HRC, the head of the NGO "Greenpeace Russia" Sergey Tsyplenkov in a conversation with" Izvestia " stressed that for the successful solution of environmental problems requires a responsible approach of society and business, some legislative efforts are not enough.
As soon as society and business realize that the solution of environmental problems is a much more profitable step in the strategic perspective, the situation will change, - said Sergey Tsyplenkov.
The expert stressed that it is necessary to reverse the trend that the violation of environmental legislation is a cost-effective solution for business.
The British inventor implanted a microchip to get into the house and the car with a wave of his hand
The British inventor was the first person in the country to have a microchip installed so that he could open the door of his house, enter the office and even start the car with a simple wave of his hand.
Thirty-three-year-old Stephen Northam implanted a tiny chip between the thumb and index finger and now through his company "biotech" offers this service to firms and individuals who want to simplify their lives through technology.
He teamed up with Dr. Jeff Watson, an anesthesiologist consultant at the Royal in Winchester, taking care that the implantation procedure was carried out in accordance with medical standards.
The technology is similar to a microchip implanted in cats and dogs, and the procedure takes only 30 seconds.
Northam's company is also replacing the locks in homes and cars with chip-compatible ones at a price of £ 300 per lock.
A married father of one child has already installed the technology in his home and in his "BMW Z4" car, which starts when his hand lies on the steering wheel.
Props for the White house cost taxpayers thousands of dollars
According to the records of the armed forces, given the "TIME" magazine White house decision last month to drive the marine corps helicopter on the South lawn for the event, devoted to American industrial production, cost taxpayers as much as 24 000 dollars.
The white-green Sikorsky VH-3D, known as" Marine One " when the President is on Board, became the Central element of the July 17 event held at the White house, which demonstrated the American construction program.
President Donald trump, Vice President Mike Pence and top White house officials have inspected technology products from all fifty States.
The helicopter, produced in Connecticut, was exhibited next to a yacht from Maine, a fire truck from Wisconsin and a forklift from Mississippi.
According to the records of the First squadron of the helicopters of the marine corps (HMX-1), the Department responsible for the control of the helicopter, the Military office of the White house ordered the presence of the helicopter in a private order, or "FRAGO", just 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South lawn on the occasion of the "unusual" event.
"I just wanted you to make sure that you are aware, because this is an unusual widely reported event in the press," wrote the commander of HMX - 1 in an email to his boss, the first Deputy chief of the aviation corps of the marine corps, on the eve of the event.
The letter indicated that the helicopter would arrive on the South lawn at about 7 a.m. on 17 July to attend the 3 p.m. event and would remain there until the lawn was cleared between 6 and 9 p.m. the same day.
The letter adds that if the departure from the White house is delayed, a second crew will be required for the return flight in accordance with the working hours restrictions.
The first crew accompanied the helicopter during the event, and the security officers of the unit remained close to the aircraft while it was on the ground.
From the records received by the magazine "TIME", it remains unclear whether it took in the end the second crew.
Hatch's law prohibits Federal employees from using state property for political purposes.
According to the records, HMX-1 clarified whether the event does not contradict this decision.
"Among other things, we asked if it was a violation of Hatch's law, and we were told that it was not," the commander wrote.
"It looks like you have nowhere to go," the Deputy chief replied.
The Made in America event was declared an official event by the White house, and Hatch's law did not apply to it.
But even formal events have a political tone.
During the event, the President made efforts to advance the health care reform that was then under development in the Senate, and touted attempts to regulate government regulations.
The use of aircraft known as "Marine One" and "Air Force One" for political purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.
Presidents are required to use them for travel.
But it is unusual to request them only in the interests of photo opportunities.
Trump has already become the subject of debate in February, when a presidential plane rode in the background during his first campaign rally in Melbourne, Florida, and his Twitter account is littered with reports of complaints about the use of the presidential plane by his predecessor.
"The white house is delighted with the show "Made in America", which presented products from 50 States made by American workers from American materials," said Deputy press Secretary of the White house Lindsay Walters.
The HMX-1 crews often perform training flights around the Washington agglomeration and on the South lawn to practice transporting the President of the United States to the White house down to an inch.
When trump was at the g-20 summit in Germany in early July, the HMX-1 held 58 training landings at the White house.
According to one of the officials, the flight performed for the event "Made in America" was counted to the crew on the account of the necessary training flights for the month.
The unit's helicopters also flew 11 additional hours that day as part of"non-resident support tasks".
According to the White house, the taxpayers did not bear the costs of any of the other exhibits presented at the event.
The representative of the company "Sikorsky" reported that the company was not involved in organizing a demonstration of the helicopter on the South lawn.
HMX-1 does not keep a budget for presidential flights, and it is difficult to determine the exact amount spent on the event.
But, according to the hourly rates of the Ministry of defense for fiscal year 2017, the rate of compensation of the Ministry of defence for the VH-3D is 24 380 USD per hour of flight.
The records of the unit recorded that the time of the aircraft in the air was 30 minutes each way from its airfield based at the aviation base of the marine corps of Quantico in Virginia.
The white house claims that the real cost of using the helicopter is much lower than this rate.
"Calculating the cost to taxpayers based on the estimated rate of reimbursement is completely wrong," says Walters.
"These sample rates include personnel, maintenance and many other irreversible costs that are included in the annual allocations."
According to a study conducted in 2015 by RAND Corporation, the reimbursement rates do not include the cost of personnel, but, indeed, take into account the cost of fuel, maintenance and costs specified in the contract.
At the time, former white house press Secretary Sean Spicer spoke out in defense of the use of the helicopter for the event.
"The idea is to showcase this week things made in America," Spicer said.
"And I know that Sikorsky and Connecticut are very proud of the fact that they contribute to national security, and that there are, I guess, hundreds, if not thousands of people whose jobs depend on it.
And I think, like most Americans, we're all proud of this helicopter and other military equipment that so many Americans have worked tirelessly to build.
Therefore, of course, it is appropriate to pay attention to this."
It was unclear whether trump interacted with the helicopter while inspecting the South lawn during the event, but he definitely sat on the driver's seat in the fire truck.
Inside the White house, trump appealed to representatives of the company" Sikorsky", joking with the press about his own fleet of products.
"I know Sikorsky well," the President said.  I have three."
Moscow will allocate grants for intensive care units of city hospitals
Annually grants "Saving lives" will be allocated to resuscitation and intensive care units of the capital's medical clinics.
The funds will be used to encourage doctors and nurses.
Moscow mayor Sergei Sobyanin visited the City hospital name is a scar.
During the examination of the clinic, he handed a letter of thanks to the traumatologist-orthopedist Victor Protsko, under the leadership of which was carried out a complex operation to reconstruct the foot of a teenager.
Sergei Sobyanin also spoke about the decision to allocate grants to intensive care units and intensive care units of city clinics annually.
The funds will be used to encourage doctors and nurses.
According to the mayor of the capital, the Yudin clinical hospital today is one of the largest in Moscow.
In recent years, the clinic received new modern equipment that allows its doctors to carry out unique operations.
The clinic was opened in 1961 on the basis of Kolomenskoye rural hospital.
Currently, the medical institution's departments are designed to receive more than a thousand patients.
In addition to the intensive care unit and hospital here has a day office.
The staff of the hospital is 2800 people.
The total area of the medical clinic is 23.7 hectares.
In February of this year, the medical institution became a participant in the pilot project on the organization of short-term stay hospitals (UPC).
They are designed for relatively small operations.
In the process of surgical interventions, advanced medical equipment is used, which allows to significantly reduce the time of rehabilitation of patients.
They spend only a few hours after the surgery in the hospital.
Only in the first half of this year in the clinical hospital named after Yudin was provided inpatient medical care to 36 thousand patients.
The medical staff of the clinic performed 15,800 operations of varying complexity.

He remains a Senator from the Khabarovsk territory.
The statement with a request to release him from his post Ozerov wrote last week.
He explained his decision by the need for rotation and his desire to "change the rhythm of life."

Electricity is cheaper for residents and producers of Buryatia
The efforts of the Soviet and post-Soviet authorities of the Republic of Buryatia (Eastern Siberia) to establish fair tariffs for electricity consumers, which lasted for more than a decade, are beginning to bear fruit.
Since September 1, the cost of electricity in low voltage for industrial recipients has been reduced by 25%.
The Federal Antimonopoly service of the country in accordance with the RF Government Decree "On amendments to the Rules of the wholesale market of electric energy and capacity and a consolidated forecast balance of production and supply of electric energy (capacity) within the Unified energy system of Russia on subjects of the Russian Federation" (from down 17.07.2017, No. 842) set indicative prices for electricity and power for industrial consumers of the Republic of Buryatia.
As a result, the cost of electricity for Buryat producers is reduced by a quarter, which will greatly facilitate the life of small and medium-sized enterprises and individual entrepreneurs.

And only this year the progress began.
In March, electricity tariffs for the population of the Republic are reduced from 4.24 rubles/kWh to 3.93 rubles/kWh, or 7.3%.

According to analysts, this is only the beginning, since the population of the Irkutsk region pays 1.01 rubles per kilowatt-hour.
But no one dares to name at least an approximate date of new tariff moves downwards for Buryatia.

Putin said that the authorities will not give instructions to Rosneft and Gazprom
Vladimir Putin said that the Kremlin and the Cabinet of Ministers should be involved in the issue of gas supplies to the Eastern petrochemical company (VNKHK), but nobody will give instructions to Gazprom and Rosneft.
So Russian President Vladimir Putin responded to Igor Sechin's request to assist in resolving the contradictions.
The head of state noted that the relations between Rosneft and Gazprom should be resolved exclusively on the basis of market principles.
Earlier, the head of Rosneft Igor Sechin at a meeting on the implementation of large investment projects in the far Eastern Federal district said that the lack of agreement with Gazprom about gas for VNKHK jeopardizes the project's implementation period.
Sechin noted that the dialogue with Gazprom on this issue continues.
"Gazprom offers to find gas resources from the perimeter of Rosneft, but we do not have such resources," Sechin added.

Did PSG warn Barcelona of Neymar's transition three years ago?
La Liga member may regret his interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain will not stop chasing Neymar after the club offered £ 189 million for his ransom, but did they warn Barcelona about the world record RAID that took place three years ago?
The sensational offer revived the summer transfer window when League 1 was ready to beat the world record for the cost of the transition, more than double the previous mark associated with the return of Paul Pogba to Manchester United last season for 89 million pounds.
When the transition is over, Neymar will become the most expensive player in the world, as well as the highest paid professional athlete in the world, as PSG offers him a salary of more than 500,000 pounds a week net.
It is known that Barcelona are furious at how the offer was made and how Neymar broke the contract, despite the fact that, as a source close to the leadership of the Catalan club insists, the club has always done everything possible for the player since his transition from Santos in 2013.
But wasn't the football world warned about this possibility three years ago by the President of PSG?
When Manchester city expressed an interest in the hiring of Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser al-Khelaifi issued a tough warning to any club who would like to poach one of the best players in PSG.
"I'm not worried, because they know that if they touch one of our players, then we oppose them, we will make suggestions of their players," said al-Khelaifi.
"We respect all the clubs.
But if they try to recruit one of our players, there will be consequences."
Barcelona seem to have crossed this line when Spanish club expressed interest in PSG midfielder Marco Verratti earlier this summer.
PSG has made it clear that they will not release the Italian national team player on any terms, and now, probably, Barcelona feel the consequences of their offer in the form of the loss of one of their most valuable players, Neymar.
