Russian President Vladimir Putin has signed a law on the introduction of administrative liability for violation of the term and procedure for payment of goods (works, services) in procurement for state and municipal needs.
This law is intended to solve the very acute problem of non-compliance by customers in state and municipal procurement.
As recently as two years ago, the situation where entrepreneurs could not get paid on already executed state and municipal contracts was widespread.
At the same time, the president of Russia instructed the Prosecutor General's Office of the Russian Federation to take special control of the problem.
Because businessmen themselves could not cope with unscrupulous customers who entered into unfunded contracts, tried in every way to evade their obligations to pay and included illegal conditions in the contracts.
The problem was systemic in the country as a whole.
Since 2015, in order to protect the rights of entrepreneurs to receive payment on public orders, the Prosecutor's Office has made 9.7 thousand submissions, as a result of their consideration, 4.5 thousand officials have been disciplined, 533 administrative officials have been prosecuted, 75 materials have been submitted to the investigative bodies for the organization of procedural inspections, and 46 of them have been prosecuted.
As a result, the debt to entrepreneurs in the amount of more than 66 billion rubles was repaid.
And these huge sums were not accumulated as a result of non-payment of multibillion-dollar contracts.
Numerous, systematic delays in the payment of services to entrepreneurs for much more modest amounts have led to huge debts.
Here is a typical case.
The head of a small company won a competition for the provision of social transportation services for several million rubles.
The person invested all his working capital, fully fulfilled the obligations, but did not receive the money in time.
The result is an escalating financial pile of debts on salaries, taxes, loans, which would lead to bankruptcy if the entrepreneur did not seek help from the prosecutor's office.
The problem has now been reduced as much as possible in a number of regions.
Nevertheless, as of the first half of 2017, the total amount of debt under state and municipal contracts, revealed by prosecutors of the constituent entities of the Russian Federation, amounted to about 27.4 billion rubles.
In regions where debt indicators continue to reach critical values, the Prosecutor's Office operates in manual crisis management mode.
The Prosecutor General personally holds visiting meetings with representatives of the local authority, at which all violations uncovered by prosecutors and measures to eliminate them immediately are dealt with.
Such operational meetings this year have already been held in Yaroslavl and Yekaterinburg.
The implementation of Federal Law No. 189-FZ "on amendments to the Code of Administrative Offences of the Russian Federation in terms of establishing administrative liability of the officials of the customer for violation of the term and procedure for payment of goods (works, services) in procurement for state and municipal needs," which was signed last week by the President of Russia, will be able to improve the payment discipline of public customers.
The draft law was developed by the Ministry of Economic Development of Russia on the initiative of the Prosecutor General's Office.
The new law will supplement the Code of Administrative Offences of the Russian Federation with an article that provides for a fine of 30 thousand to 50 thousand rubles for violation by the official of the customer of the term and procedure for payment of goods, works and services in state and municipal procurement.
And if the official has already been subjected to administrative punishment for a similar offence, he will be disqualified for a period of one to two years.
All prosecutors of the constituent entities of the Russian Federation have already been instructed to ensure the application of these legislative innovations in practice.
Civil rights group announces travel warning in Missouri
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People issued a warning to people of color traveling to Missouri because of discriminatory state policies and racist attacks.
The group's statement reads: "The warning to the traveling National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, valid until August 28, 2017, calls on African-American travelers, visitors and Missouri citizens to be particularly attentive and to exercise increased caution when traveling around the state in connection with a number of questionable racist incidents that have recently occurred throughout the state and are cited here."
According to the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the announcement of a travel warning by the group prompted a recent Missouri law that made it harder for people to win discrimination claims, as well as the fact that state law enforcement agencies disproportionately chose minorities as their targets.
"You have people who are subjected to human rights violations.
They are stopped on the roads because of the color of their skin, they are beaten and killed, "Rod Chapel, President of the Missouri National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, told the Kansas City Star newspaper.
"We hear complaints often like never before."
This is the first warning of its kind announced by the organization in relation to the state of the United States.
The group referred to incidents such as the racial humiliation of black students at the University of Missouri and the death of twenty-seven-year-old Tory Sanders, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died in suspicious circumstances earlier this year after running out of gasoline while traveling around the state, and Missouri state police arrested him without charging him with a crime.
The warning also mentions a recent report by the Missouri Attorney General's office, according to which black drivers are 75 percent more likely to be stopped on the road than white drivers.
"The purpose of the warning is for people to be aware of the situation and alert their relatives and friends and colleagues about what could happen in Missouri," Chapel said.
"People should be prepared in one way or another, whether they will take money with them for bail or tell relatives that they are traveling in the state."
According to the latest data from the FBI's hate crime reporting program, there were 100 hate crimes reported in Missouri in 2015, making the state sixteenth in the state in terms of the number of such violations.
The travel warning is also a response to a new Missouri law that will make it more difficult to bring a case against a legal entity for housing or labor discrimination.
Earlier, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) announced warnings for travelers to Texas and Arizona after those states passed new immigration control laws ordering local law enforcement agencies to arrest people for violating immigration laws, which the ACLU said should have increased the number of racial checks.
Travel warnings are usually issued by the State Department for other countries, but recently public organizations have resorted to this measure in response to certain laws and trends within the United States.
Two people killed in shooting at police patrol in Egypt
Unidentified men fired at a police patrol in the Egyptian city of ISNA, Reuters reported, citing Egypt's Interior Ministry.
During the exchange of fire, two people, including one police officer, were killed and three people were injured.
All the wounded were taken to hospital.
According to the agency, the police stopped the car, after which two armed men in the car opened fire on law enforcement.
One of the attackers was detained, the other managed to escape.
Rosturism supports the law on the abolition of free baggage for non-refundable flights
Oleg Safonov, head of Rosturism, said in an interview with RBC TV that he was "positive" about the adoption of the Law on the abolition of free baggage allowance for non-refundable air tickets.
"It is necessary to create conditions under which a person who has no baggage can buy a ticket cheaper than the one who has luggage," - he stressed (quote on TASS).
At the same time, Mr. Safonov noted that, despite the fears of citizens, it will not be necessary to pay for carrying clothes and mobile phone in hand luggage.
"It would be right to reassure all our citizens and tourists and declare it, to say that it is to the upper clothes, to the umbrella, to the mobile phone, to AIPAD or even some computer will have no relationship," the head of Rosturism said.
Earlier, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a law providing for the right of airlines to exclude the rule on free baggage transportation on a non-refundable air ticket.
It is that airlines can determine the number of seats and the weight of baggage included in the non-refundable fare.
Vladimir Putin instructed to eliminate the pollution of Baikal
Russian President Vladimir Putin said at a meeting on the protection of Baikal that in recent years significant areas of the lake have been subjected to extreme pollution.
He instructed to identify sources of funding, plans and performers to eliminate pollution.
Mr Putin has also commissioned a full-fledged remediation of contaminated areas.
"It is necessary to deal with the objects that continue to work here, the treatment facilities of most of them are worn out," RIA Novosti quoted the president as saying.
He also added that the Prosecutor General's Office of Russia should conduct an inspection to identify environmentally harmful activities.
According to him, there are problems in the Lake area due to the emergence of natural landfills and a number of environmental violations by recreation organizers.
"I want to emphasize this: not all in a row to check, here too the measure needs to be known, but precisely - illegal and environmentally harmful activities and to take appropriate measures," he stressed.
Earlier, the Prosecutor General's Office reported a reduction in fish stocks in Lake Baikal and proposed to increase the number of facilities subject to environmental supervision.
Recall, on June 15, Vladimir Putin said in a direct line that it is necessary to change the legislation to ensure the rights of citizens living in the natural territories of the special protection regime.
He was informed of the problems with economic activity by residents of Olhon Island, which is part of the Baikal natural territory.
The head of the Ministry of Natural Resources Sergey Donskaya immediately proposed to solve the problem by clarifying the boundaries of the water protection zone of Baikal, but the government of Buryat reminded that such a change is not enough, because the restrictions are connected with a number of regulations.
Earlier, the Ministry of Economy proposed to solve the problem by changing the land code and the law on environmental protection.
In Yugra there will be a new temple
In the village of Sosva, members of the community from the indigenous minorities of the North "rakhtynia," together with residents of the Berezovsky District, take part in the construction of an orthodox church in honor of St. Nicholas the Wonderworker.
Its location is a river bank, the temple will be clearly visible from afar, so it will serve as a guide beacon for fishermen.
According to the representatives of the community, the construction work will be completed this year, now the dome has been installed, church bells are available.
The igrome RB of the fleet provided transport support.
The church is named after St. Nicholas the Wonderworker because it is revered by the Orthodox Church as the patron saint of travellers, including fishermen.
In Sosva, however, fishing gives settlers jobs and feeds them.
Locals are waiting for the temple to open its doors, and children even write in school writings about it as a local landmark.
Disneyland with the death penalty.
Why do Singapore abide by the laws?
I talk to a local businessman, Chang, sitting in an outdoor eatery.
Commenting on the situation in Singapore, Chang smokes one cigarette after another.
After the end of the conversation, the businessman heads to the nearest urn-up to it meters a hundred - and throws out Bulls there.
The fine for garbage in a public place - 500 local dollars, - reports Chang.
You know, I just had a reflex from my childhood: you can't throw fantik from candy on a bridge, instantly fined.
And now there are video cameras everywhere.
And indeed - the sidewalks of Singapore in the center of the city are clean, as if in a museum.
Chang says: three months ago, his neighbor's 18-year-old son painted graffiti on the wall of an old colonial building.
The court found the guy guilty of vandalism and sentenced him to flogging.
What?!
Imagine that.
He was hit ten times with a wooden stick on his buttocks and spent a week in prison.
In general, corporal punishment is not uncommon.
As Singapore combines the highest standard of living and incredibly harsh laws, the Observer "AIF" understood on the spot.
No one thinks of abolishing the death penalty here, "explains lawyer Victor Li Hong.
And the government has long been spat at the opinion of both the European Union and the United States on this matter.
If a person carries a large quantity of drugs or trades in them, he is given a gallows.
In 2002, a 22-year-old Australian citizen was detained at Changi Airport, carrying 400 grams of cocaine.
He was defended by the Australian prime minister, threatening sanctions, international human rights activists and even the Pope.
However, the guy was eventually hanged anyway.
After that, the drug couriers of our country diligently go around the side.
The point is this: in Singapore, it is supposed that laws are required to comply with everything in a row, not just modest and poor people.
It doesn't matter who you are-millionaire, Deputy Prime Minister, famous artist or resident of the European Union.
The option in this case is one: if you find half a kilo of cocaine, you will be hanged.
When you walk in Singapore and everywhere you meet signs with a bunch of warnings, you give - how many bans in this city-state!
For example, chewing gum is sold only in pharmacies, and you can buy it strictly on the prescription (!) of the doctor.
The tourist will not take away a cuddle on arrival, but it is worth sticking a "rubber" in the subway, a fine of 1,000 local dollars.
In four days, I met two people with white signs around their necks: "I was garbage."
For thrown past the urn perch in addition to the fine are often sentenced to "exile in the janitors": a week to clean up parks and beaches.
6 thousand rubles is paid by the "criminal," who has tried to wash the water behind him in the public toilet, and when trying to cope with a small need in the elevator of the apartment building a special detector is activated - doors are blocked and a signal is sent to the police.
Among the very exotic laws are bans on feeding pigeons on the street, public performance of songs and even excessive watering of a room plant (!): it is believed that an abundance of water attracts mosquitoes.
In order to avoid fires, smokers cannot carry lighters on the subway, otherwise they will be fined 5,000 Singapore bucks.
In general, there is a thought: no matter how hard you try, you are sure to open something.
This is not the case at all, "Mohammed Kabir-Kajaria, the owner of a local travel agency, tries to reassure me.
Especially fantastic laws exist only on paper, and over the past twenty years I have not seen anyone attracted for violating them.
Why do they persist?
So that citizens don't relax.
Compliance with the basic rules is strictly monitored.
Let's say, if a minor is sold in a cigarette booth, everyone along the chain will be punished: the owner of the store will pay a huge amount, the offender himself will get hit with sticks on the "back," and the seller will also be torn out and imprisoned.
It is thanks to such harsh laws that offences are very rare in Singapore.
Is this justified?
Back in the Seventies we had chaos on the roads - motorists ignored traffic lights, drove as they wanted, got drunk behind the wheel.
After the introduction of fines for the year, everything calmed down.
Now the driver, having drunk a portion of whisky, knows: if stopped, the police officer will not release for a bribe, will impose a fine in the amount of the cost of the apartment and for years will be sent behind bars.
To many foreigners, the city-state in Southeast Asia seems to be a kind of concentration camp.
In 1993, the American writer William Gibson called Singapore "Disneyland with the death penalty" - a guest from the United States horrified the universal wealth of residents, "frighteningly clean airport" and "cultured nature."
To say, such things are unnatural, look artificial, and so in principle shouldn't be.
The first days in Singapore and it is true to be afraid to throw a piece of paper on the sidewalk, you stumble if you went to the subway with ice cream.
But then you come to the area "Little India," and suddenly - "breaking the template": at the bus stop there are plastic cups.
"And how is it?" You wonder.
And that's it, "said the Singaporean.
Everyone happens.
Not for every such "crime" will be seized on the spot, but you must know: if you are calculated, you will not be beaten - after all, you broke the law.
More often than not, it is enough for a person to behave normally.
Of course, the government in Singapore is quite authoritarian.
But you know what?
In Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, I moved very carefully - motorcyclists often take smartphones and cameras out of the hands of tourists.
The center of Paris is full of dirty bombs and beggars.
On our streets, too, not everyone tries to throw garbage in the bins.
Singapore, on the other hand, thanks to a set of draconian fines and ruthless (up to the death penalty) laws, has become the most peaceful, clean and safe city on earth.
You think about it.
This is human nature: remember, and in Russia, no one was behind the wheel until they began to fine.
Although the main thing in Singapore is not fines, but voluntary compliance with the laws.
And it is necessary to think, we in Russia people would also be happy with clean streets, lack of garbage in the subway and would welcome the arrest of those who confuse the elevator with the public toilet.
Here's corporal punishment - thank you, you don't have to.
Otherwise, Singapore's laws are at least worth taking a closer look at.
There is nothing sacred?
Now the Trump White House has targeted the Statue of Liberty.
The most reliable sign of regime change is when it starts to fight the statues.
Americans understand this no worse than everyone else - hence the deliberately theatrical demolition of a statue of Saddam Hussein in Firdos Square in Baghdad in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the Trump government's key ideologues, no doubt knew what he was doing when he Zanes a symbolic axe over the Statue of Liberty during a bitter dispute with CNN journalist Jim Acosta about the president's proposals to drastically reduce legal migration.
Let's be honest, Miller did not attempt on the statue itself.
Hordes of pleasure ship owners and artists depicting the Statue of Liberty would have lynched him if he had tried to do so.
But he attempted her meaning, and especially the meaning that was attributed to her in 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, when Emma Lazarus's poems were added to the pedestal.
As Miller grumbled at Acosta: "I don't want to go deep into history here, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the world.
The poem you are talking about was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty. "
Miller correctly stated the facts, but as he himself said, this is not really about history.
This is about the current sound of the startling words of Lazarus, the only ones in which the State invites not any immigrants, but the poorest: "Your tired, your poor, / Your crowds dreaming of sighing freely, / the unfortunate throwbacks of your abundant shores."
Never before have "unfortunate ejections" been so visible on our screens.
Miller did not engage in literary studies - he made it clear that in Trump's America, these people are not expected.
This dispute about the meaning of the statue is part of a wider political and cultural war: it really is a dispute about the meaning of America.
Lazarus - and her friends who fought to place her words on the basement of the statue after her death - understood very well that they were committing an entirely political act.
The sculpture was intended to mark the connection between the French and American republics with the help of a banal classical figure - the female image of freedom.
Lazarus changed her meaning: in her poem, the female figure is no longer abstract, she has a voice.
And she got a completely different name: the mother of the Exiles.
The combination of the poem and the image was a brilliant feminist move and a crushing attack against American nativism.
And as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, the right though change it back.
The vociferous Rush Limbaugh, the sort of John the Baptist who heralded the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that freedom invites no one, rather she is an early neoconservative carrying the flame of America to the world lying in darkness: "Freedom goes forward.
It carries the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
The torch is not needed to illuminate the path to the United States. "
Against the beat Limbaugh here really got to the point.
The meaning of the statue depends solely on the angle of view.
Lazarus's great creative achievement was to see her as she would have been seen by exhausted, unhappy but hopeful people on the decks of ships after a long and often heavy voyage.
It means literally looking at the world through the eyes of people who are seeking refuge and a chance for a better life.
Her statue answers them with the words of hope and hospitality they dream of hearing.
And, of course, that's not a prospect Miller and Trump will ever want to acknowledge.
Their torch is needed not to illuminate the way, but to incite hatred, which is the only source of their power.
2017 World Cup: Neil Blake commends the Scottish members of the UK National Team.
Eilidh Doyle recalls a time when there were only two Scots in the UK national team
Neil Blake, director of play at the UK Athletics Federation said the 16-man Scottish part of the national team at the World Cup would make a "significant contribution to the team's game."
A record number of Scottish track and field athletes have been selected for the 2017 London Championship starting on Friday.
Blake believes that something special is "born" in Scotland and the UK Athletics Federation should take this into account.
"We know this and are trying to understand and will support as long as they have the potential," Blake said.
"I've spoken to people at the Institute of Sport Scotland and they think it has to do with what they've done.
The Scottish Athletics Federation thinks that what they have done should be worked with.
British Athletics Federation: you have to work with what they have done.
And people on the street think the same way.
I don't know why this is the case, but it is absolutely brilliant. "
Some of the Scottish track and field athletes are bidding for medals, including Laura Muir and Andrew badevil - who will compete with Sir Mo Farah at a distance of 5,000m; and Eilidh Doyle's team has chosen as their captain.
"Eilidh is modest.
Her captain's speech was great, "Blake says.
"A lot of track and field athletes, whether they are Scottish or not, and from where they live or train, came out of this room feeling proud and determined to win.
The passion and sincere feelings that Eilidh put into her were remarkable. "
The winner of the Commonwealth championship silver medal, who will run a distance of 400m steeplechase at her fifth World Championships, says 16 Scots in the British national team is "incredible."
The previous record for the number of Scots in the World Cup was equal to seven, in 1983 and 2005.
Ahead comes Laura Muir, who specialises in middle-distance running and broke five British and two European records last year.
It will run for 1500 and 5000 meters.
Chris O 'Hair, who will compete in the 1500m race, is another Scot worth paying attention to: behind his back he has a successful season in which there have been victories at the British national team qualifying competitions and at the annual competition.
Doyle recalls his first World Cup when, apart from her, the only Scot in the team was Lee McConnell.
The team captain says she is "incredibly proud" that so many of her compatriots have not only entered the national team, but in some cases will claim medals and struggle to reach the final.
"The captain of the national team is chosen by other members of the team, so it was in any case a huge honor, but to know that your comrades voted for you and you were chosen - for me it is a very special thing," she added.
"Of course, I am very proud for all the Scots who entered the national team.
It shows how much we have achieved.
And they are all held track and field athletes who will strive to get on the podium.
And as for my captain's speech?
Yes, I think she was not bad.
I just drew attention to the fact that we were very lucky to host the World Cup at home.
So it's just about how important it is to get support from the fans and take advantage of the fact that we will be in the Olympic Stadium again.
I got another chance to go to his arena and take part in competitions, and the atmosphere there will be just wonderful. "
Blocking critics on Facebook: You don't have to be nominated for public office unless you're willing to listen to criticism from voters
The founder of our country understood what a critical press is.
Americans loved George Washington, but that didn't stop them from criticizing him for everything from domestic politics to his political principles.
The criticism of him, of course, irritated.
But he didn't shut his mouth to his critics.
Because back in 1483, Washington said, "You can take away the freedom of speech and we, the deaf and the dumb, will be led like sheep to slaughter."
I will now move on to Maryland Governor Larry Hogan, who should have tried to be more like Washington.
Hogan's subordinates blocked and erased the posts of a minimum of 450 people who expressed their views on his official Facebook page.
And this week, the American Civil Liberties Union sued him for it.
The governor's subordinates called the lawsuit null and void, and the comment on the Internet was written in the spirit of "well and what."
"It's just Facebook," many will say.
But it is also important.
And that's especially important when it comes to a Hogan-type guy.
He is a surprisingly popular Republican governor in a democratic-dominated state.
He is second in the approval rating among the country's 50 governors.
Hogan is not a stubborn reactionary.
He has shown a firm hand in the management of the state and a commitment to his principles.
He also cleverly uses Facebook as the primary way to connect with his constituents and, with jokes, shows his head on his page after chemotherapy.
Therefore, blocking people who come to the governor's page - which is claimed to be an official public forum and run by administration officials with taxpayer money - is unnecessary and ultimately harmful.
In an interview with the Washington Post, spokeswoman Amelia chez defended the governor's actions, arguing that blocking comments is simply their moderation.
But it's too easy - to use the image of trolls, spammers and heiters malevolent on the Internet.
"The Post" spoke to some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.
And these are real people, not trolls - a teacher, a businessman, a pastor, who turn to their elected leaders.
They all say their comments were respectful, meaningful and not rude.
The pastor quoted the Bible, appealing to the fact that Hogan is a Catholic.
Lakshmi's lawyer, Sarma Raman of Bowie, Maryland, did not express hatred, but asked about hate crimes.
"I wrote a polite comment that I am disappointed by his lack of response to hate crimes and other recent news," she wrote in the comments section of an article in the post.
"I also don't like the idea that when a lot of people leave comments on the same topic, some immediately say it's a so-called twist, instead of admitting that they are dealing with a large group of disaffected citizens."
What the governor's subordinates call a "concentrated spam attack," others would probably call an "active life position."
In the era of Facebook, it is easy to edit your image simply by blocking critics or stitching negative comments.
This is a much less dusty job than before, when it required sending people, collecting and burning newspapers with critical oversights, or arresting and mugging protesters.
But that is exactly what is happening now, only in the figure.
Hogen is not the first official to be criticized for not wanting to listen to Facebook and other social networks.
President Trump was sued by Twitter users who were bandied about in his Twitter account.
One of the first, pivotal decisions on the topic was made this week in Virginia.
According to U.S. District Judge James C. casheris of Alexandria, the chairman of the Laudon County supervisory board violated the First Amendment by hammering a voter in his Facecbook account.
And in Kentucky, Republican Governor Matt Bevin was sued by the American Civil Liberties Union for his behavior on Facebook and Twitter.
It must not be so difficult.
In the days of Washington, the era of affordable postal spending made about the same upheaval as the Internet today.
From 1776 to 1800, the number of newspapers grew four-fold, and the authors of anonymous letters severely destroyed his authority.
And even then, Washington was dealing with anonymous trolls.
People under the pseudonym "yuricola," "Valerius," "Belizarius" and "Porcius" wrote letters to newspapers mocking Washington's decision.
According to historical documents collected by the George Washington papers online project, his cabinet has been inundated with petitions criticizing his position on the Treaty of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation.
But he did not try to silence them.
Freedom of speech, dissent and speech lies at the very foundation of our state.
And true leadership means coming to terms with it.
Ronan Rafferty hopes for domestic amenities at Renaissance Club
Former European champion Ronan Rafferty is hoping for domestic amenities for the next three days when the Renaissance Club in East Lothian will host the twenty-fifth Scottish Open golf tournament for older athletes.
The Northern Ireland native, who led next door at the Archerfield Links club, and moved towards the final round last year until he lost to Paul Ilsa, is attached to a new venue and serves as a tournament representative on behalf of the club's founder and director, Jerry sarwadi.
"I have seen the Renaissance Club being built, and we are watching it come to success with this event," Rafferty said.
"The players will see this field at its best moment, it is in a great state.
Jerry did a great job of making this place.
He is a strong supporter of this game and is proud of his achievements here.
It's a great demonstration for this field. "
The Englishman is looking forward to defending the champion title for the first time, despite having won both the European tournament and the European Challenge Tour in his 32-year career.
"It's a really special feeling," said the Southport player.
"I didn't manage to try to re-win the" Extremadura Open "because it was removed from the schedule a year after I won it.
It is magical to go back to this corner of the world.
It's a great place to play golf.
The memories of last year come back, and for me and my wife Sharon was a very special impression to win last year.
It was a really special time and we will always remember it. "
Returns to fight on the native land of Gary Orr, who joined the European tournament for older athletes after earlier this year he turned 50.
The event will be his first public appearance in Scotland since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
"When you play at home, it's always a bit more important," said resident helensboro Orr.
"You want to perform well, but you feel this extra burden."
I played with great pleasure again, and I showed good golf.
I'm happy with the way things are going so far. "
On the field, this trio will be joined by former Masters tournament winner Ian wusneem and champions majors for older athletes Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNalty.
Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are two of the six Scots on the pitch; the others are Andrew oldkorn, Stephen McAlister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
Participation in the tournament is free, and parking costs 5 pounds per hour if there is one person in the car, and 10 pounds if the person is two or more.
All proceeds go to the British Prostate Cancer Foundation.
British roads to learn how to absorb harmful emissions
The kind of tunnels above highways that can absorb carbon monoxide emitted by cars are already being tested on UK roads.
The country's transport agency, according to Autocar, reported positive results of tests of a 100-meter tunnel installed on a highway in the north of the country.
The 6-metre-high tunnel is built from some of the latest polymer materials that can absorb harmful substances contained in car exhaust.
However, the creation of an entire network of such tunnels is only part of the large-scale measures that the UK authorities are going to take to improve the atmosphere.
In addition to the tunnel network, the British are going to expand the network of charging stations for electric vehicles, implement a number of measures to reduce road traffic, expand the use of commercial transport on electric traction and upgrade the fleet of heavy trucks.
According to official statistics, transport accounts for a quarter of all atmospheric pollution, and poor air quality causes up to 40,000 premature deaths per year.
Moscow City Court changed the punishment of the disabled Mamayev to a fine
The Moscow City Court changed the punishment of the disabled Anton Mamayev, sentenced to four and a half years of the colony, to a fine of 200 thousand rubles.
This is reported by TASS.
Earlier, the prosecutor's office asked the court to replace the sentence with a suspended sentence, explaining that Mamayev's disease "prevents him from finding him in prison conditions."
Anton Mamayev, 28, was sentenced to four and a half years in prison in a penal colony for robbery, the victim of which was a former Special Forces fighter.
On July 19, the court released the man from custody at an exit hearing in jail.
Poverty and death in Indonesia's Golden Land
When preparing lunch, Bardina Degey does not use the stove.
She even uses a pot rarely.
In her wooden house in Enarotali, the capital of Paniai County in the rebel Indonesian province of Papua, the housewife usually simply places the sweet potato, which here is called the "note," directly into the hotbed.
Half an hour later, the charred tuber is taken out and eaten with impatient, unwashed hands.
Degey sits on the ground floor - she has no furniture - and this is where she does her housework, such as washing clothes with muddy water from a nearby swamp.
The toilet serves as a bucket in a room without a roof.
She is the youngest of her husband's four wives, so she was not assigned to work in the field.
Polygamy is common here.
Of course, it can be dangerous to work late: many men from this village are unemployed, many drink, and there are soldiers.
"No one decides to walk around the village after 5pm," she says.
This is a rare opportunity to look at daily life in the highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony that was annexed to Indonesia in 1969 after a dubious referendum, when only 1,026 elders were forced to vote, raising their hands in front of occupying troops.
The existing pro-independence movement from the Netherlands quickly turned its anger against the government of Jakarta, which maintains tight control over the region, preventing foreign journalists and human rights activists.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua, and the Independent State of Papua New Guinea occupies the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is a city as remote as it is abandoned; the road here includes a one-and-a-half-hour flight from Jayapura, the administrative center of the Province, to Nabir, and then a five-hour rag on a car.
There is no public transport here.
The city, with a population of about 19,000, consists of wooden houses lined with bamboo fences; the roofs of corrugated steel are painted with rust in a variety of red-faced shades.
Few Indonesians, let alone journalists, and almost none of the foreigners, got here.
Prior to the arrival of the Christian missionaries, the Papuan Mee Pago worshiped a god named UGA tameye.
There have been other changes.
"It was unusual for us to wear these clothes," Degey says, gesturing at his bright, hand-woven turban, dark skirt and bright shirt.
"We used to wear only leaves on the body."
Papua is Indonesia's poorest province, with 28% of its population living below the poverty line, and infant mortality and literacy rates among the worst in Asia.
But it is also Indonesian gold land.
The world's largest and most profitable gold mine, Grasberg, owned by Phoenix-based Freeport McMoran, is just sixty miles from Paniai, a highland province about the size of New Jersey where 153,000 people live.
In 2015 alone, Freeport produced approximately $3.1 billion worth of gold and copper.
In addition, Papua boasts an estimated $78 billion worth of forest reserves.
These riches, however, entail one misfortune for Papuans, ensuring that Indonesia's powerful armed forces maintain their suffocating presence here.
According to an investigation by the New York Times in 2005, between 1998 and 2004, Freeport paid nearly $20 million to local troops and units, including up to $150,000 to one officer.
Demands for greater autonomy on the part of Papuans threaten the existence of this golden vest and are ruthlessly suppressed.
According to human rights defenders, more than 500,000 Papuans have been killed by Indonesian military forces since 1969, and thousands more have been raped, tortured and imprisoned.
According to the Asian Human Rights Commission, massacres in the indigenous highlands of Papua in the Seventies could be considered genocide.
Last year alone, Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful protesters in the region.
"We will lose everything," a report published in 2016 by the Brisbane diocese, contains evidence of atrocities committed in the previous year, such as summary executions, torture - particularly frequent, as claimed in another report, rape and electric shocks - and the brutal suppression of peaceful demonstrations.
"It's hard to count the number of victims because incidents take place every week," said Andreas Harsono, who is doing research in Indonesia for Human Rights Watch.
The nuts have been delayed as Papua's resources have attracted an influx of migrants from other parts of Indonesia.
The province's 3.5-milion population is 83% Christian, but demographic figures are changing as Muslim economic migrants from the densely populated Indonesian islands of Java, Sumatra and Sulawesi arrive.
Javan shopkeepers, "varungi," sell fried chicken and a mixture of "gado-gado" vegetables served with peanut sauce.
The locals are trying to withstand the competition.
"Migrants started selling chicken and vegetables cheaper in the traditional market than the indigenous people of Papua," explains abet Yow, a twenty-year-old Paniai native who moved to Jayapura, the province's administrative center, because of her work.
"Because of this, the indigenous people of Papua mom (women) Papua have lost their market."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, popularly known as Jokowi, vowed to address inequality and rights abuses in Papua during his presidential campaign in 2014.
On his way to the presidential palace in Jakarta, the former carpenter secured the support of 27 of Papua's 29 districts, including Paniai.
But almost nothing has changed in Papua, and locals feel betrayed.
"Our hearts are broken because in 2014 we voted for Jokowi, expecting him to fulfill our hopes for justice," says Yow.
In fact, just two months after the October inauguration, Jokowi Paniai survived the tragedy.
On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children were on the street singing Christmas anthems at a bonfire in Enarotali when two Indonesian soldiers on a motorcycle broke out of the darkness.
Terrified children told them they should turn on the headlights.
According to local pastor javedt Tebay, one of the soldiers was offended by their tone and returned with four soldiers a short time later.
According to the victims and eyewitnesses, the soldiers, who were drunk, chased the children and beat them with rifle butts.
Then one of the soldiers shot at a group of children.
One child, 16-year-old Julius eymo, was beaten so badly that he fell into a coma.
A couple of hours later, someone set fire to the nearby government building of the Electoral Commission, and the next day the situation worsened.
About 1,000 Papuan men, women and children gathered on a football field in front of a local police station and a military command center to demand justice.
They brought with them ritual hunting bows and performed waitha, a dance of the Papuan Mee Pago tribe: they ran circles and depicted bird singing.
Some protesters began throwing stones at the police station and the military base.
When the situation escalated, the soldiers were given an order by internal radio: "If the crowd resisted more than three times, shoot them," as he said in an official document seen by the correspondents of TIME magazine, but which was not published in the local media.
Fifty-six-year-old Eremias Kayame, head of the Keh Koto district in Enarotali, felt the danger approaching and called for calm, asking the crowd to disperse to their homes.
No one wanted to listen to him.
"When I turned, I was suddenly hit by a bullet in my left wrist," he told TIME magazine, standing on the porch of his brightly painted wooden house.
Kayame still doesn't know who fired, but says the bullet came from the shereng side of the assembled soldiers.
"There was a crowd, there were a lot of shots," he adds.
A local resident, Alfius Yowa, was hit three times, as his cousin, who witnessed the shooting, tells us.
"I ran up to him and examined his body to make sure it was him," Johanes, who like many Indonesians uses only one name, told TIME magazine.
"I saw that he was dead... I kissed him."
General Yotje Mende, a senior inspector of Papua Police, told reporters that his officers were merely "protecting" their base because it was under attack.
"We have to defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us," Papua police spokesman Commissioner Pujo sulitiyo said in 2015.
"It's a matter of life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and many more were injured.
News of the killings only reached Jakarta the next day.
Three weeks later, Jokowi delivered a ferocious speech in Jayapur in which he expressed condolences to the families of the victims and vowed to address the issue of historic abuses of power in Papua.
"I want this situation to be resolved immediately so that it never happens again in the future," he said.
In October 2016, security minister Wiranto said he would establish a non-judicial organization to put an end to historic human rights abuses.
But almost immediately there were excuses.
"Most of the violations occurred a long time ago.
Some of them took place in the Nineties or at the beginning of the zero.
The fact is that we certainly want to address these violations, but there are procedures to go through, "he said.
Wiranto then retracted his words, speaking to TIME magazine on June 5 in Jakarta, and said he had no plans to set up an organization to deal with complaints in Papua.
Instead, he said, "everything will be decided through the courts."
Viranto, who was accused by the United Nations of "crimes against humanity" in connection with the deaths of more than 1,000 people during the bloody vote for East Timor's independence in 1999, said 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua had already been resolved, including the Paniai incident.
The families of the victims from Paniai met with such statements with grim distrust.
"I've been questioned four times in the last three years, but there's been absolutely no change," says Johanes.
"I'm tired."
He says that years later he still lives in fear.
"I'm scared," he says.
"I am afraid that I will be arrested by the military, I am afraid that I will be shot."
His brother Jacobus also expressed the opinion that the residents of Paniai are afraid to discuss the incident.
He said he was beaten by the military after helping to bury four victims.
"After we buried the bodies, the military came after me," he says.
The shooting did not stop.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police fired at villagers in the nearby Paniai district of deiyai.
In a clash between villagers and a construction company manager who refused to help take an unconscious man to hospital, one person was killed and 17 others were injured, including children.
A man, 20-year-old Ravianus Dove, who drowned while fishing in a nearby river, died on his way to hospital.
Angry villagers protested in front of the office of a construction site owned by the company.
According to police, the villagers threw stones at the officers, who responded by firing warning shots.
But locals claim that the mobile brigade (Indonesian Special Forces) began shooting at the crowd and killed one person.
"We were in such panic, we are afraid of retaliation," domingu Badia, a twenty-nine-year-old who lives near the hospital and saw the wounded being hastily delivered, told TIME magazine.
"I hid at home for two days."
The deiyai Parliament demanded that the officers involved in the incident be called to account, and that the mobile police brigade be withdrawn from the region.
Paniyai has always been a sick place for the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development is causing resentment among the Meye, Monie, Dani and Damal Tribes scattered throughout the green-covered central highlands of Papua.
Many have joined the Free Papua Movement (OPM), a rebel army that claims to protect the rights of Papuans by launching sporadic attacks and kidnapping raids on Indonesian soldiers.
Some of OPM's top leaders come from Paniai, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel yudas Kogoya.
In response, thousands of people have been arrested in Paniai in recent years and arbitrarily detained by the military under the pretext of "defending national independence."
Some never returned.
Among the population of Papua, Paniai is considered a "sad, forgotten place."
Poverty increases discontent.
A small portion of rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive for locals.
Bread is not available to the same extent.
People here grow everything they eat: Mostly a note, as well as some fruits and leafy vegetables.
Agriculture is the work of women, each of whom can look after four or five fields of sweet potatoes.
They usually retain most of the harvest for the family, and the rest is sold on the local market.
Ten tubers of note cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Over time, there has been an increase in the economic disparity between indigenous Papuans and new migrants, who have arrived in large numbers since the introduction of new flights to Nabire Airport.
Few existing vacancies usually go to better-educated and well-off migrants.
Papuans rarely have enough money or the necessary skills to run their own competitive business.
"Young people don't want to stay in the village... because there's no work or money here," says John gobaei, chairman of the Paniai Tribal Council.
Isolation keeps Papua away from the views of the rest of the world.
Moreover, restrictions on the work of the international media remain tight.
Earlier this year, French journalists Frank escudi and Basil lonshan were deported from Papua for "lack of coordination with the relevant organizations" despite being given rare video permits.
According to Phelim Kine, deputy Asia director at Human Rights Watch, promises made during Jokowi's election campaign to lift restrictions on the media in order to promote transparency and development have not been fulfilled.
"Foreign journalists trying to report from the rebel eastern Indonesian provinces, Papua and West Papua are now facing new dangers: visa denials and blacklisting," he said in a statement.
The lack of press attention means that international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely confined to Papua's immediate neighbours.
In March, six Pacific States - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands - asked the UN Human Rights Council to investigate "various and widespread violations" in Papua, including the Paniai shooting.
The same countries have supported OPM in the past.
A spokesman for Indonesia's Foreign Ministry, arramanata Nasir, brushed off the group's statement, telling reporters in Jakarta that "Indonesia still has a democratic system and a free press, so it would be difficult to hide evidence of human rights violations."
Locals want more foreign governments to pay attention to the situation.
When an official delegation from the Netherlands, led by the Dutch ambassador for human rights, KIIS van Baar, visited Jayapura on May 4, the locals broke their silence, saying: "We want freedom," according to the source, who also attended the meeting, but wished to remain anonymous.
Indonesia will hold a new presidential election in 2019, but Papuans say they are unlikely to vote for Jokowi again.
"Jokowi is a man who has good intentions, but he is surrounded by people involved in the Paniai shooting," says ghobai, chairman of the tribe's Council.
He wants Jokowi to know that the residents of Paniai, apart from living in the shadow of the threat from the scarlet army, are mired in poverty, and their education and health care are in a miserable state.
Ghobai says that the residents of Paniai, like other Papuans, consider their vote, given for Jokowi, a debt that he has to pay.
"They don't need money, they just want justice," he says.
Despite threats and intimidation, the families of the victims of the Paniai shooting carried out the latest symbolic act of defiance: they buried the body of one of the victims on a plot of land directly opposite the police and military station.
Knowing that justice will probably never prevail, they will at least not allow the guilty to forget about their crimes.
"They killed a member of our family," Jacobus says, without raising his head.
"What else could we do?"
The fire covers the Dubai skyscraper "Torch" for the second time
The fire engulfed one of the world's highest residential skyscrapers in Dubai on Friday, forcing hundreds of residents to leave the seventy-nine-story, 337-metre-high structure in a hurry.
This is the second fire to run through the detached building - which by coincidence is called the "Torch" - in two years.
The building was evacuated, no casualties were reported, and there was no operational news about the cause of the fire.
"We slept and woke up to fire alarms and people screaming.
We ran down the stairs and it took us about ten minutes to get down from the fiftieth floor, "a skyscraper resident named George told Reuters.
According to the Dubai City civil defense authority, fire crews extinguished the fire at about 4: 00 local time (00: 00 GMT) and cooled the building.
The government said it was working to provide shelter for the victims.
The incident could put the safety of materials used in the exterior of high-rise buildings around the world back on the agenda.
An investigation by the torch administration after the fire there in 2015 revealed that the most affected were the placings - external panels used for decoration and insulation.
In the United Kingdom, police said they believed the insulation system and flame panels of the Grenfell Tower building in London could have accelerated the spread of the fire there in June, which killed about 80 people.
The growth of tourist flow to Ida-Viru in June turned out to be minimal
According to the data, which the correspondent of the portal us.err.ee received in the Department of Statistics, in June 2017 the services of hotel enterprises of the northeast used a total of 20,519 local and foreign tourists, which is 125 people or 0.6% more than in the same period a year earlier.
At the same time, the number of local tourists has decreased, while the number of foreign tourists has increased.
Thus, the foreign tourist flow increased in June by 7.3% (544 people) to 7994 tourists.
And the number of local tourists fell by 3.2% from 12,944 to 12,525.
The most noticeable increase in the number of Russian tourists in the region - by 8.9% or 318 people compared to June 2016.
A total of 3,885 guests from the Russian Federation stayed overnight in Ida-Viru hotels in June 2017.
Andrei Malakhov made it clear to fans who was to blame for his departure
Andrei Malakhov hinted to his fans on Instagram who was to blame for his departure from Channel one.
So far, he has not commented on the rumors, but today posted a fragment of an article of the newspaper "Vedomosti" for August 1.
Photo Malakhov signed the tag "boss of molokosos."
Article on how to prevent "burnout" of an employee and pay attention to his condition.
If you recall numerous reports that the host could not find common ground with the newly arrived producer, who set out to reformat "let them speak," it becomes clear what he so transparently hinted at, writes "KP."
According to reports, TV presenter Andrei Malakhov is currently on leave and did not sign an application for dismissal from Channel one.
The situation with the dismissal may become clearer in the coming days.
Five soldiers killed in car bombing in Afghanistan
At least five soldiers were killed in the explosion in Afghanistan's Helmand province, RIA Novosti reported.
According to police, a car bomb exploded near a military checkpoint in Girishk County the night before.
Twenty people are known to have died.
There was a new emergency in girishka on Friday morning.
Armed criminals attacked a currency exchange point.
The exchange of fire between the attackers and the security forces continues.
A diver has filmed a shark biting his camera
Diver and researcher Greg Skomal captured on video a shark that bit his GoPro action camera.
The video was posted on Facebook by a unit of the U.S. Agency for Marine Fisheries in Massachusetts, of which Skomal is an employee.
The incident took place on August 2 off the coast of the Cape code peninsula in the northeast of the United States, the Necn portal said.
The man tried to shoot the shark on camera while diving, which was held on a special stick.
After noticing the man, the animal, more than three meters long, swam to him.
The shark began to bite the camera, while not trying to attack the scientist.
Scomal explained that the predator acted in a similar way to determine whether the gadget was eaten.
The researcher added that the shark could easily destroy the device.
He also noticed that similar behavior of a marine animal turned out to be a novelty for scientists.
The cause of the mass brawl in the Ural Military Center became known
A working group of senior officers of the Central Military District arrived at the Elan Training Center, where the mass brawl took place, to investigate the circumstances of the incident.
Some details of this slaughter have already come to light.
According to the Mash public, which appeared on the Facebook page, the contractors of the Ural Military Unit Number 31612 violently fought because of the uncorrected bed.
It all started with the fact that the private named Sayan pointedly ignored the order of the officer to fill the hanging sheet.
Soldiers from the sixth company stood on the side of the officer.
Sayana supported the first company.
In half an hour, 140 young boys were crushed in the barracks by beds and sinks, and glass was knocked out.
More than ten people were injured in the mass brawl.
The CVO denied information about the stabbing.
The study found that at least one-fifth of passengers in the United States carry prohibited items onto the plane.
The study found that more than 20 percent of air passengers knowingly or accidentally carried prohibited items in their luggage on board the plane through U.S. Transportation Security Administration screening points, including a minimum of 6 percent boarded the plane, inadvertently carrying prohibited knives or other sharp objects.
Almost 1 per cent reported that they later discovered that they had accidentally carried firearms, ammunition or explosives.
The study, conducted by Stratos Jet Charters, Inc. and covering more than 1,000 people, also found that younger passengers are more likely to break the rules.
Of the respondents who admitted that they deliberately tried to fly with something that is banned by the ATB, 19.7 percent were millennials compared to less than 15 percent of Generation X members.
Consciously past the employees of the ATB most often carry food and water.
More than 3 per cent admitted to specifically carrying sharp objects through the inspection, while 2.2 per cent of female respondents and 3.7 per cent of male respondents admitted knowingly carrying prohibited medicines on the plane.
The company said it studied passengers across the country to find out how many of them accidentally carried smuggling through airport searches, and how many did so knowingly.
It is quite expected that most often - consciously or unconsciously - they push smuggling through the inspection of those who fly the most.
As the company points out, the ATB rules are quite complex and confusing.
People often don't know exactly what liquids they can carry and in what quantity.
No wonder, then, that most of what the ATB takes away is banned liquids.
Some time ago, people thought that the ATB could be considered prohibited from carrying a book.
Liquids are allowed on domestic flights, but not on international flights.
EPA Chief Pruitt drops intention to delay implementation of Obama's emissions-reduction rules
The day after the 15-state lawsuit, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency reversed his decision to delay implementation of Obama's regulations to reduce air pollution and smog.
Pruitt attributed his decision to the fact that his agency now listens more than under previous administrations to the needs of individual state environmental regulators.
He made no mention of a lawsuit against his previous position filed in a federal appeals court.
The dispute revolved around the October 1 deadline for the States to ensure compliance with the 2015 Earth-level ozone standards.
Pruitt announced in June that he would delay their compliance by one year to give his office more time to study the plan and avoid "inconsistency with local decisions or obstacles to economic growth."
Pruitt, who before being appointed by President Trump to his current position was Oklahoma's attorney general, has long been known as a consistent opponent of stricter environmental regulations.
Since moving to Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly blocked or delayed the introduction of regulations opposed by the chemical or gas-oil industry.
The unexpected change of course on Wednesday is another legal defeat of puitt's policy of returning to previous norms.
Last month, a federal appeals court in Washington ruled that the head of the EPA had exceeded his authority in an effort to delay implementation of an Obama administration rule requiring oil and gas companies to track and reduce methane leaks.
In a statement released Wednesday night, Pruitt suggested that by dramatically changing course on ozone standards, he was simply fulfilling the EPA's duty to cooperate with the States in a comprehensive process of timely implementation of the new standards.
"Under previous administrations, the EPA was often unable to meet the deadline, then waited for lawsuits from activist groups and others and discussed deadlines during the settlement of the case," said Pruitt, who filed more than a dozen lawsuits against the EPA in his previous position.
"We don't believe in regulation through trials, and we take the deadlines seriously.
We also take seriously our Charter and the power it gives us. "
However, the EPA said in a statement that Pruitt may at some point again use his "powers to delay and other statutory powers" to make sure that the regulations are "jcyjdfys on a clear course and on all available information."
Republicans in Congress are pushing for a broader overhaul of the rules on ozone.
The bill, approved by the House of Representatives last month, seeks to delay implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years.
The Senate has yet to vote on the issue.
New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who led a coalition of states filing a lawsuit against the EPA this week, said the group intends to continue legal pressure.
"The EPA's course changes - after our lawsuits - are an important victory in the fight for the health and safety of 6.7 million New Yorkers and more than 115 million Americans who are directly affected by smog covering their cities," Schneiderman said.
New York's lawsuit was joined by California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington, as well as the District of Columbia.
Ozone at ground level occurs when conventional pollutants from machines, power plants, refineries and chemical plants and other sources react in the atmosphere with sunlight.
The resulting smog can cause serious breathing problems in sensitive people, leading to thousands of premature deaths a year.
Health advocates and environmental advocates welcomed Pruitt's unexpected change of course.
"It's sad to think about how much pressure it took to get this perfectly logical step from the person charged with protecting the air we breathe," said Laurie Anne bird of the Center for Biological Diversity.
"We must continue to resist the Trump administration's ideological campaign and protect those who pollute the air and their special interests."
IAAF Congress extends suspension of all-Russian Athletics Federation
The Congress of the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) voted to extend the suspension of the all-Russian Athletics Federation (VFL).
In this way, Congress supported the IAAF Council to restore the VFL, which issued a report on Monday recommending that the suspension be upheld.
166 people voted for the extension of the suspension, 21 against, TASS reports.
The IAAF Council report stated that the VFL had made substantial progress towards achieving the conditions set by the re-membership board, but those conditions had not yet been fully met.
Because of the VFL disqualification at the World Championships in London, Russian track and field athletes were forced to perform under a neutral flag.
The team included 19 people admitted to the IAAF championship.
The VFL was subjected to indefinite disqualification by the IAAF in 2015.
At the time, a report by Dick Pound, an independent expert at the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), was published, alleging numerous violations of WADA regulations committed by Russian officials and athletes.
Read more about the IAAF Council's latest report in "Kommersant," "the IAAF has extended sanctions on the VFL."
Offensive defeat
Within the 3 round of Fonbet-superiority of Russia among teams of PPL Novomoskovsky "Chemist" carried out an exit match against FC "Kaluga."
A little more than 10 days ago rivals played among themselves in the Cup of Russia, however this time the picture of the game was completely different.
"Chemist" didn't concede anything to the opponent, but a second relaxation at the end of the match led to an offensive goal and a fiasco.
After a recent 0-3 defeat by Kaluga, many predicted an easy victory for the hosts in advance.
However, since the beginning of the meeting the novomoskovs forced to reckon with themselves and acted from defense, but from a position of strength.
In 1 half Kaluga created more and had an advantage in possession of the ball.
The next very high-quality match was held by Alexey orphan, who several times reflected dangerous blows and by his actions gave the partners confidence.
Unfortunately, in the attack "Chemist" lacked the effort and luck to bring to a standstill the defense of "Kaluga" and to score the first goal on the road.
After the break, the game began to run on counter courses.
The newcomers played more actively in the attack.
Disturbing calls for our team were mistakes in defense, which allowed Kaluga to create a number of sharp moments.
10 minutes before the end of the meeting "Chemist" intercepted the territorial advantage and carried out several dangerous attacks.
But Kaluga's experience played a role - they had a more competent and cold-blooded ending, waiting for their moment to take the gate.
After a dangerous attack "Chemist" transferred the ball to the corner, the delivery of which the owners of the field without resistance transferred to the goal.
Yuri Dubin was the author of the goal.
In the reporting meeting "Chemist" showed a good game, but suffered an offensive defeat.
Ahead of our team there will be another departure - on August 11 at 7 p.m. in Moscow at the stadium "torpedo" named after Eduard Streltsov novomoskovets will fight with the favorite of the group "center" FC "Ararat," which includes Roman Pavlyuchenko, Marat Izmailov, Igor Lebedev, Alexey Rebko.
Come to support the "chemist!"
The place and time of the meeting of the novomoskovets - 6.30 p.m. near the shop "Magnolia" (Eastern, D.2, Korp.
Composition of "Chemist": orphan, manokhin (K), Romaschenko, shayunov, Khomutov, Gogiya (Oreshkin), dudaite, Ryzhov, Sviatoslav, belanin (adoevtsev), andrichenko (Lygin)

According to published decoding of phone conversations, Trump pressed Mexico about paying for the wall at the border
The Washington Post published deciphering phone conversations between US President Donald Trump and the leaders of Mexico and Australia.
On January 27, in a phone call with Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieta, Trump insisted that he stop publicly declaring that he would not pay for the planned wall on the border.
The US president scolded him for speaking out publicly against the wall and, according to leaked information, told him: "You can't say that to the press."
Trump began his election campaign with a promise to build a wall along the southern U.S. border and vowed he would make Mexico pay for the project.
The published deciphering of his first phone call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull also revealed a heated altercation.
Trump told Turnbull that the agreement that the US should accept refugees heading to Australia was "ridiculous," "disgusting" and "dumb," and insisted that because of the agreement negotiated by the Obama administration, he would look like an idiot as he intended to stop refugee resettlement in the US.
Trump concluded the conversation by telling Turnbull that "it was the most unpleasant conversation of the whole day."
The bodies of the dead in Abkhazia turistok sent by plane from Sochi to St. Petersburg
The plane, owned by Russia airlines, carrying the bodies of Russian women killed in Abkhazia, took off at 8: 15 p.m. Moscow time from Sochi to St. Petersburg, TASS reported.
At the site of the final destination, the board will be met by employees of the ritual agency, as well as representatives of the city's mayor's office, deputy minister for resorts and tourism of Abkhazia astamyr Akhba told reporters.
Earlier, representatives of the Ministry of Emergency Situations of the Republic said that all the costs associated with the delivery of the bodies back to Russia were borne by the government of Abkhazia.
In addition, the official Sukhum intends to pay compensation to the families of the victims in the amount of 500 thousand rubles.
According to Akhba, the leadership of Abkhazia expressed readiness to pay relatives of those killed as a result of the bombings to fly and live in the Republic, but relatives sent to the Republic only a power of attorney for the right of local authorities to act in accordance with the established procedure.
On August 2, at about 4: 20 PM Moscow time, two explosions took place in the village of Primorsky Gudauta District in the missile and artillery weapons depot of the Ministry of Defense of the Republic, after which they began detonating the large-calibre shells and other ammunition stored there.
As a result, the warehouse was set on fire, which triggered uncontrolled explosions of shells of various modifications.
As a result of the emergency, two Russian citizens were killed - Elena Polyakov, born in 1970, and Elena Timofeeva, born in 1962, who were on holiday near a hydrogen sulfide source.
64 people, including 35 citizens of the Russian Federation and 29 citizens of Abkhazia, with injuries of varying degrees of severity were taken to medical institutions of the Republic.
Currently, seven people remain in hospital and the rest have been discharged.
A grand jury will examine the Russian influence on the American election
Special Prosecutor for Russia Robert Mueller has convened a grand jury in Washington to examine Russia's influence in The 2016 U.S. presidential election, according to the Wall Street Journal and Reuters.
A grand jury is a group of ordinary citizens who collect evidence of potential criminal offences and have the right to question witnesses under oath.
The materials collected will be examined by the special prosecutor and will decide whether they are sufficient to bring charges.
The convening of a grand jury gives Mueller additional powers to collect testimony.
One of the topics of the jury investigation, which began work a few weeks ago, will be details of a meeting between the son of then-presidential candidate Donald Trump and Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya.
Mueller himself had previously promised to verify the details of the meeting, which took place in June 2016.
They have already been studied by the FBI.
In late July, it was reported that Donald Trump Jr. had expanded the staff of his lawyers.
Trump Jr. previously said that from meeting Veselnitskaya, he was waiting to compromise on the staff of Democratic Party candidate Hillary Clinton, but no unmasking documents were presented, and it was eventually about adoption.
In early August, a number of media outlets reported that Trump Jr. 's statement about the meeting with Veselnitskaya was literally dictated by Trump senior.
The White House clarified that the president did not dictate anything, but simply used his authority, which any father would do.
Deputy Mayor of Penza detained in the workplace
Deputy head of the administration of Penza Irina Shirshina was detained for 48 hours on behalf of the Investigative Committee at his workplace, RIA Novosti reported.
There have been no official reports from law enforcement agencies on the matter yet, but the press service of Su SK assured that they will soon follow.
At the mayor's office, Penza has not yet commented on what happened.
Irina Shirshina is one of five deputy heads of administration of Penza.
She oversaw urban planning issues and Land Relations, holding the position since April 2015.
Prior to that, she worked for a long time as head of the department of the state housing construction inspection in the Penza region.
Irina Shirshina brings up three minor children, it is noteworthy that once again becoming a mother a year ago, she refused maternity leave and returned to work.
Of course, there is no launch site or launch vehicle in Mexico.
But there is a space agency established in 2010 and a desire to develop its own space program.
And the installation of Yuri Gagarin's bust is a tribute to the first person to visit space.
Unlike the monuments of the Soviet period, which are demolished in some countries, the monuments of Gagarin, on the contrary, "walk on the planet."
In 2012, the monument was erected in Houston, USA, near the former NASA Headquarters.
In London, a monument on the grounds of the Royal Observatory was erected to mark the 50th anniversary of the first space flight.
There is a monument to Gagarin in Germany in the city of erfoot, where our cosmonaut visited in 1963.
The monument in Karlovy Vary (Czech Republic) escaped demolition in 1992 thanks to public protests and was moved from the city center to the square in front of the local airport.
In the year of the 70th anniversary of Gagarin, a monument to Yuri Gagarin appeared in Riga.
This is the name of the first cosmonaut in Latvian, and he looks as if he is 70 years old.
Killing at Moors Ford: activists to lose Lynch courts on stage to call for justice
The 1948 Ford Mercury drove past spectators in the village of Monroe in Georgia and, with a roar, washed up to the little Moors Ford Bridge.
As the car, which had four black passengers and a white driver, approached the bridge, a group of white men with guns blocked its path.
The main - a middle-aged man in a suit in a thin stripe - tightened with a cigar and looked through the windscreen.
Those sitting inside trembled with fear.
"We need this nigger, Roger!" the man roared.
"Get him out of the car!"
Piercing howls tore the silence as a young black man was pulled from the front seat.
Fortunately, this horrible scene, which played out on July 22, is just a mock.
But when a noose was piled around Roger's neck, almost all the audience held their breath.
Since 2005, activists have been returning to the Moors Ford Bridge to re-lose that night, when two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and May Murray Dorsey - were lynched by pupksklanders in 1946.
No one has been convicted of these murders.
"It's striking that not a single person has been arrested in all these years - although we see them beside ourselves; although we know who they are," says Tyrone Brooks, who helped organize the production.
"It is a stain on our history and it is a stone on our souls."
Brooks, 71, is a former member of the Georgia Congress who has been fighting for human rights all his life.
For him, the performance is a dramatic call to action and an annual reminder to the people of Monroe that injustice has never been corrected.
"We want investigation, we want completion, we want healing, we want reconciliation, but first we have to get justice," he says.
"We cannot move to healing and reconciliation until we achieve justice."
The coroner covers the body of one of the lynching victims at Moors Ford on July 27, 1946.
According to FBI records obtained by BBC News, more than 50 people in Monroe and neighbouring counties were suspected of being involved in lynching.
But no one was ever charged.
Although the suspects have remained at large for decades, human rights activists say the city has always been well aware of the two related motives of the vigilante: politics and sex.
In April 1946, a Supreme Court ruling allowed black citizens to vote for the first time in the primaries, which were supposed to take place that summer.
Around the time of the same election, according to FBI reports, black ispolist Roger Malcolm stabbed Barnett Hester, a white landowner - apparently because of a woman - in a fight.
Brooks says that Hester was rumored to have slept with Malcolm Dorothy's wife in the city, and that the child she was supposed to give birth to was not from her husband.
According to FBI reports, on July 25, 1946, Loy Harrison, a large white landowner, paid $600 bail to rescue Malcolm from prison.
He went to jail with Dorothy and their cousins may Murray and George Dorsey.
But as they drove from prison and approached the Moors Ford Bridge, a mob of lynchers surrounded the car.
"It turns out that he organized and commanded Harrison's murders," such a conclusion is made in an FBI report.
"It is also clear that there was collusion between state and city law enforcement, which not only took part in the killings, but also destroyed evidence and concealed the identity of witnesses."
Brooks calls it shorter.
"It was an attempt on voting rights," he says.
"They were all killed to send a message to blacks in the city: if you register and vote, it will be the same with you."
For nearly a decade, Cassandra Green has been directing an annual performance reproducing that lynching at the Moors Ford Bridge.
Her performance is clear, he captures the viewer and narrates the deep racism that many would like to believe there is no more in America.
It is hard to watch and even harder to turn away, but Green believes that is the main thing.
"We don't want to talk about Lynch courts because they show us our own ugliness," she says.
"But I can't build a relationship with you unless you hear me or hear what I've been through."
Rehearsals of this year's performance began in June, and on the first day, nearly 30 actors - a dozen whites, the rest black - gathered indoors and listened to a polished review of the play over the years.
Wade Marbo was the director, along with green.
He played the role of chief member of the clan for several years, but says the role never became easier.
"I feel like I'm pissed off because it's not the person I am," Marbo says.
"But I think it's very important to remember this story because we don't want to go back to that time."
Indoors, actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick rascona, who play Roger Malcolm and Barnett Hester, repeat their roles.
Spectal begins with Malcolm, furious that Hester is sleeping with his wife, Dorothy, screaming and pushing him.
"I said, nigga, get out of my house!."
Shouts rascona in response.
There is a blow.
And at the same moment, everyone (at least all black actors) gets a chuckle.
Green laughs the loudest.
"What is," Ascona asks.
He is concerned and embarrassed.
I'm re-playing?
"No," Green says through laughter.
"I just don't think the whites said 'nigga' at the time."
"Yes," one of the black performers laughs.
"You have to bear a firm 'R'."
And so does the energy in the room: discomfort is replaced by a sense of camaraderie.
Everyone has to do everything right, not just for the sake of the play, but also for the memory of the four people killed.
The scene begins at first.
This time, when rascona says the word in the letter "h," it turns out to be clear and sharp.
No man laughs.
The performance ends cruelly and quickly.
The screams, the shots, and then the silence.
A woman in mourning black clothing stands over the bodies of actors and performs Billy Holiday's sad song "Strange Fruit."
Her voice is interrupted through the word.
A hundred yards away, half a hundred spectators wipe tears and sweat from their eyes.
There are almost equal numbers of blacks and whites among the audience.
One couple came from Ithaca, N.C., to watch the performance; many live very close by.
They all endured Georgia's heavy dugout for nearly eight hours while Brooks led them on a pilgrimage to the graves of Malcolm and Dorsey.
Until then, the killings remained only history, but now that they are standing in the same place where people were lynched, it seems that their ghosts are swirling right in the air.
When the last note of the song calms down, green invites people to come closer and examine the bodies.
The children bend to their heads, touch the paint depicting blood and motionless bodies and whisper something to each other.
"They're not really dead," one little boy mutters, as if to remind himself of it.
A few minutes later, green thanks the audience, and suddenly everything ends.
Actors drop ropes from their necks and wipe away tears.
Bradshaw hugs Marbo, a man in a suit who played the main puppeteer.
Nick rascona hugs the other two actors and suddenly, crying, falls into their arms: the emotional burden of the performance finally fell on him.
"All right," whispers one of the women.
"We know that your heart is good.
You had reasons for that. "
Later, the audience sits down to dinner with the actors.
At one table, a white couple from Atlanta lively discusses the performance with a black couple they've just met.
Denise daplinski is struggling to find the words to describe what she feels after the performance.
"It's hard to listen to these horrible, creepy words, and actions... of people who look like you, and who do it because they look like you," she says.
"After that, I think the lynchings are still happening," she adds, "only now is it called that the police shoot."
In another corner of the room, Tyrone Brooks, who remembers his work as a human rights defender for food, received general attention.
He says he has already started planning for next year's presentation.
"The production inspires us because it not only describes the horror of what we've been through, but also teaches us," he says.
"Because if you don't learn from this lesson, it can happen again.
Those who do not study their history, who do not know their history, are doomed to repeat it. "
The court fined Navalny for violations on the "campaign sabbatical"
Simonovsky Court in Moscow fined Alexei Navalny 300 thousand rubles for violating the order of organizing the rally.
The opposition leader was found guilty of committing an administrative offence under part 8 of article 20.2 of the Administrative Code of the Russian Federation "repeated violation of the order of organizing the rally."
Earlier, the judge of the Simonovsky Court of Moscow khizyr mussakayev finished hearing the administrative case against Leonid Volkov - the chief of staff of the opposition leader Alexei Navalny, who was prosecuted under the same article as Navalny.
Volkov was found guilty and sentenced to a fine of 300 thousand rubles.
In this amount, Judge mussakayev estimated the distribution of leaflets on the "campaign sabbatical," which Navalny's supporters held in Moscow on July 8-9.
After seeing the campaign materials, following the participants of the sabbatical police considered that the organizers of the event deliberately concealed its true essence - a public action (for which it is necessary to request prior permission from the Metropolitan authorities).
Leonid Volkov and his lawyers Ivan Zhdanov and Alexander pomazuyev applied for the termination of administrative proceedings due to the absence of the composition of the offence and pointed out that the police made certain omissions in the drafting of the Protocol.
At the "campaign sabbatical" himself, Volkov was not detained, but he received a summons requiring him to appear at the police station for a story about the event, held with his active participation.
Navalny himself and another associate of the opposition leader, Nikolai Lyaskin, received the same summons.
Bride-to-be and three wedding guests arrested in Mordovia
A court in Mordovia has arrested a local man who shot four people, including a bride, at the wedding.
This was reported in the Republican office of the Investigative Committee.
The incident took place on the evening of July 29.
During the dispute, the 42-year-old resident of Saransk shot several times at the guests of the event, who came to the rural pond to swim.
Three women and one man were injured.
Criminal proceedings have been instituted under Article 213, paragraph 1 (a), of the Criminal Code ("hooliganism"), Article 30, paragraph 3, and Article 105, paragraph 2, of the Criminal Code ("attempted murder of two or more persons, committed in a generally dangerous manner, out of bully motives").
According to Interfax, local media reported that the man opened fire because the guests of the wedding, having decided to swim, passed through the territory of his plot to the body of water.
Ministry of Energy to tighten requirements for turbine suppliers for power plants
The Ministry of Energy of the Russian Federation will update the rules for the provision of information by suppliers of critical equipment, in particular turbines for power plants.
At the launch of gas turbines, hydroelectric turbines, oil pumping facilities and oil production, equipment suppliers will be obliged to share data on access to it with the Ministry of Energy and the Federal Service for Technical and Export Control.
The draft resolution of the government is already ready and submitted for public discussion.
The new requirements will affect only "critical energy equipment" supplied to Russia.
Potential threats are identified in the document as such phenomena as obtaining information and access to the management of the facility by foreign intelligence services, criminal elements and structures, unscrupulous partners and hackers.
The European Union has expanded anti-Russian sanctions because of Siemens
The press service of the European Union said on August 4 that anti-Russian sanctions were expanded due to the scandal over the supply of Siemens turbines to Crimea.
This was previously reported by "arguments of the week."
The press service of the EU Council said that the sanctions against the Russian Federation have been expanded due to the scandal with turbines produced by Siemens, which were allegedly brought to Crimea in defiance of the sanctions.
Today, the Council of Europe is considering all possible complaints and proposals from member states to expand anti-Russian sanctions.
Earlier it was reported that the final decision will be made before the end of the current day, and here the decision was made, sanctions on Russia expanded.
Pearson cuts 3,000 more jobs and reduces dividends to bring business back to life
On Friday, Pearson, a British education group, announced that it would cut 3,000 more jobs and reduce the amount of preliminary dividends by 72 percent as it launched another restructuring program aimed at dealing with the challenges facing their businesses.
These job cuts, which Chief Executive John Fallon says will mostly occur in late 2018 and early 2019, come in addition to the 4,000 jobs cut in the previous restructuring.
Pearson announced that it plans to cut costs by another 300 million pounds ($394 million) in May in a third cost-cutting program to try to bring back to life a business hit by the rapid transition to digital learning methods.
The company, which last month agreed to sell its stake in Penguin Random House to its partner, Bertelsman, said its forecasts for the year remained unchanged, after it announced a 1 percent increase in sales of the main product in the first half of the year to 2.05 billion pounds.
Kabul convoy attack: Nato soldier killed in suicide bombing
According to official sources, a suicide bomber attacked a military convoy in the Afghan capital, Kabul, killing one NATO soldier and injuring several others.
Five soldiers and an interpreter were wounded, NATO said in a statement.
According to unverified data from local sources, three civilians were also killed in the incident in the city's Karabakh region.
The blast is the latest of this month's bloodshed in Afghanistan, with more than 30 people killed in an explosion at a mosque in Herat on Tuesday.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
According to NATO, the explosion on Thursday evening happened when a joint convoy with the Afghan army was attacked with a "man-portable improvised explosive device."
According to the report, all the wounded are in stable condition and receive treatment at the American military hospital at Bagram airfield.
Correspondents report that the growing power of the Taliban and the group known as the Islamic State (ISIS) in Karabakh is a major source of concern for NATO forces stationed near Bagram.
According to UN reports, there were at least 1,662 civilian casualties in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, and about 20% of them in the capital.
In late July, a suicide car bomb killed at least 30 people in the Shiah district of Kabul.
The Taliban said they carried out the attack.
On May 31, a massive explosion in the center of the city killed more than 150 people, the most deadly terrorist attack in the country since United States-led troops removed the Taliban from power in 2001.
The violence is accentuating the precarious situation in Afghanistan, while US President Donald Trump is assessing whether the number of US military forces assisting troops and police in the country should be increased.
According to correspondents, the attacks in Kabul in recent weeks have also created a crisis of public trust in the government, its line of conduct, and especially in the reputation of President Ashraf Ghani.
Environmental Protection Agency cancels decision to delay passage of air pollution law after lawsuits
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency reversed a decision to delay an Obama-era law requiring states to limit air-polluting emissions a day after 15 states sued the agency over the move.
On Wednesday evening, the Environmental Protection Agency announced its decision to implement the so-called "ozone measurements 2015," stressing that the move shows the agency's willingness to cooperate with the states.
"We believe in dialogue with and responsiveness to our partners in the States," Environmental Protection Agency chief Scott Pruitt said in a statement.
In June, Pruitt announced the Environmental Protection Agency's intention to postpone ozone measurements, in which existing air pollution is measured in different parts of the country to determine where it needs to be reduced to meet stricter air purity standards, for one year, until October 2018.
On Tuesday, a group of 15 states, mostly Democratic, along with the Federal District of Columbia filed a lawsuit alleging that the intention was illegal.
President Donald Trump's administration is trying to roll back a wide range of environmental protection regulations introduced by previous President Barack Obama as part of a broader program aimed, Trump says, at brilliant economic growth.
But action in this direction has drawn resistance from Democrats and environmental organizations concerned about the possible impact of large emissions on public health.
The Environmental Protection Agency's website says that using ozone-containing air to breathe "can impair lung function and increase respiratory symptoms," such as asthma.
The Association of European Business opposed the new anti-Russian sanctions
The Association of European Business expressed opposition to U.S. economic sanctions against the Russian Federation.
According to AEB, such measures could lead to a serious reduction in production and the number of jobs.
AEB said in a statement that business is one of the important links between countries and people, so the principles of free trade cannot be restricted.
European business brings together more than 500 companies from the European Union and the European Free Trade Association.
The association calls on the heads of State and Government of the EU, the US and Russia to develop a new line of conduct that would separate business from politics and find a common, mutually acceptable solution in the spirit of peace and harmony.
MPs ask police to restrict traffic on the waterfront in Pskov
The Pskov people's deputies sent an appeal to the head of the UMVD on the city Sergey Surin about the problem of movement on the embankment of the River Great.
Deputies of the City Duma Konstantin Bolotin, Grigory vytenkov and Valery Lesnikov believe that motorists prevent people from walking and resting in this place.
In their view, the control of drivers will help to make the area safer and safer.
The problem is that the offenders ignore the "Footpath" signs and ride freely along the waterfront.
It turns out that the overhaul and improvement have been carried out for nothing.
Sports and playgrounds are becoming uncomfortable because of the machines.
According to the Pskov Information Agency, in the evenings, the central embankment is patrolled by employees of the motopatruhl PPP and druzhinniki.
Thanks to them, the number of passing cars becomes smaller, but the traffic does not stop completely.
Putin demanded that investigative authorities not seize hard drives
Russian President Vladimir Putin has proposed a ban on investigative authorities not to seize servers and hard drives from working computers at enterprises.
The head of state said at the meeting on investment programs for the Development of the Far East.
According to the president, it is necessary to "exclude the use of measures leading to the suspension of enterprises, including the removal of hard drives from working computers and servers, for the sake of investigation."
Putin noted that if investigators have such a need, "it is enough to remove copies, assure them and use them during the investigation."
The head of state added that it is impossible to "create conditions that prevent the continuation of the enterprise's activities until taxes cannot be paid."

Russian Foreign Ministry urges Washington to stop shelving Moscow
The Russian Foreign Ministry reacted to remarks by Mike Pence, who accused Moscow of trying to destabilize the Balkans.
The Foreign Office issued a statement some time ago.
In his comment, the Foreign Ministry pointed out that the United States is increasingly using Cold War stamps that are inadequate to modern reality.

Jerseys Garcia and Vasily Lomachenko meet for the first time, there is a conversation about the possibility of a decisive duel
Vasily Lomachenko and Maiki Garcia, who appear to be moving steadily to host the most exciting boxing match in weight to 147 pounds in the near future, met for the first time on Thursday.
They occupied separate rooms in the offices of the ESPN channel in Los Angeles until Garcia, the undefeated lightweight champion of the World Boxing Council, walked down the corridor to greet Lomachenko, the Champion of the World Boxing Organization in the second featherweight.
After Garcia's unanimous victory over the former world champion in four weight categories Eric Broner on Saturday on the channel "Showtime" both boxers enter the top five boxers regardless of weight categories.
Garcia stretched out his right hand and said, "How's it, champion?
Good luck to you. "
Lomachenko defends his belt in a duel with Miguel Marriaga on Saturday at seven o 'clock in the evening on the ESPN channel.
When boxers posed for a photo, manager Lomachenko Egis Klimas noticed that the potential decisive fight between them would be for the very time.
"I used to be at featherweight," Garcia recalled.
"I rose to the category for Broner's sake [to 140 pounds], but I'm not that big.
I'm small for 140.
I want to go down to the semi-easy.
And it needs to rise to semi-easy [to 135 pounds], and then we will arrange a duel.
This is what the fans want.
Let's arrange it for them. "
Lomachenko agreed.
"Boxing needs this duel."
Klimas asked whether the fight should be broadcast through the PPV service, as part of the strategy he is pursuing for Lomachenko to carry out his debut fight in weight 135 later this year, to schedule for next summer a meeting with Garcia (37-0, 30 knockouts), who is also interested in fighting the winner of the duel between Jorge Linares and Luke Campbell after their fight for the world lightweight title at the Forum Arena on September 23.
"The fight can be on PPV because all fans asked for it," Garcia said, expressing later readiness to fight on that channel, which will offer the best financial conditions.
"We are the main names.
No other names will generate such interest.
As soon as they are ready... "
Garcia said he thinks Lomachenko is a "terrific boxer" and maybe will visit his Saturday duel.
But Lomachenko didn't immediately shower Garcia with praise and said that, in his opinion, the champion in three scales from Riverside looks "very slow, forgive, jerseys... you asked for a knockout."
Garcia said he focused on showing the power of the strike, and already then boxing.
They both said that they feel as tension builds up before their own duel.
"This fight has to take place.
No other fight causes so much interest and talk.
I'm more than happy to work on it, "Garcia said.
Lomachenko said: "I was waiting for some of the top boxers, and here he is, jerseys.
It will be a great fight. "

New test results published to assess the age of asylum seekers in Sweden
The latest test results of asylum seekers in Sweden, who were subjected to a new method of medical age assessment, show that more than 80 per cent of those tested were assessed as over 18 years of age, but not all trust the accuracy of these results.
The Swedish national forensic medicine agency (Rättsmedicinalverket) began conducting tests earlier this year.
They were designed to make the age assessment in the asylum process more accurate, after the Swedish Migration Agency (Migrationsverket) was criticized for failing to determine the real age of some refugees who claimed to be minors.
So far, Migrationsverket has sent 6,880 cases for testing, and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now published the results of 2,481 tests between mid-March and July 31, 2017.
Eighty percent (2002) of those tested were assessed as 18 years of age or older, and in another 25 cases, the forensic medicine agency estimated that the person being tested was "probably 18 years of age or older."
In 432 cases, the conclusion was that the person was "probably less than 18."
Tests are carried out only in cases where a person's age is questionable.
According to Johan Göransson of the forensic medicine agency, the results are in line with those of the past months.
"We don't see much difference with The statistics over the past months, the numbers are quite appropriate," he told the Local portal.
The high proportion of cases in which people had been assessed as having reached the age of 18 did not necessarily indicate that asylum-seekers had lied about their age.
In May, the agency published the results of 581 tests and reported that in 442 cases, "it is likely that the age of testing is 18 years or more."
However, after reviewing 581 published results, the newspaper "Svenska Dagbladet" found that in 243 cases the person openly stated that 18 it is executed this year.
The method of conducting a medical age assessment, consisting of making X-rays of wisdom teeth and tomography of knee joints and giving them to dantists and radiologists for analysis, has also attracted criticism in some instances.
One of the skeptics is Claude Marcus, an endocrinologist at the Karolinska Institute, whose part of the work is to assess people's biological maturity in order to determine whether they have gone through puberty earlier or later than usual.
"I had reasons to think about it, and I don't think you need to use the measurement methods that are used now.
Biological age is thus determined very inaccurately.
If we can't define it with certainty, we shouldn't pretend we can, "he told Metro newspaper.
However, göranssen of the forensic medicine agency argued in favor of the accuracy of the tests: "In general, it can be said that the risk of a child being mistaken for an adult is small.
The biggest risk we face is when the person will soon be 18, in which case he is about 10 percent. "
I will consider whether to run for the presidency
During a working trip to Buryatia, Vladimir Putin said that he was ready to consider whether to run for the presidency of Russia in the elections in 2018, Interfax reported.
This statement was a reaction to the request of the residents of cheremushka village of Buryat region.
During a videoconference devoted to the elimination of the fire in Buryat and Irkutsk region, the interlocutor addressed Putin with the words: "Mr President, we have a request to you: when there will be the next presidential election, we all ask you to run again for this post."
"OK, I'll think, thank you," the president said in response.
On July 28, Russian presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov commented on remarks made by some media outlets that Vladimir Putin's campaign staff will be headed by Anton Vaino, head of the Russian presidential administration.
Peskov called these assumptions "not based on anything, hypothetical reasoning."
"While there are no headquarters, the establishment of headquarters is far away, the election campaign is far away," Peskov said.
"As long as it is not on the agenda," Peskov said.
West Virginia governor says he is moving to another party
The governor of West Virginia, Democratic Representative Jim Justice announced Thursday during a rally with President Trump that he was moving to another party.
"Whether you like it or not, the Democrats have given away from me," Governor Justice said.
"Today I tell you with many prayers and many reflections... today I tell you, the people of West Virginia: I can no longer be useful to you by remaining a Democratic governor."
The rally exploded with applause.
"That's why I'll change my registration to a Republican tomorrow," Justice added.
"As a coach, I would tell you that time to play differently."
Earlier, Trump promised that an important statement would be made at a rally in West Virginia.
Trump won in West Virginia with a 42 percent majority, and Justice did not support the Democratic nominee, Hillary Clinton.
Justice, who according to Forbes is the only billionaire in the state, was elected in 2016.
Forbes notes that he owns coal mines in five states, as he inherited the coal business from his father.
His fortune is estimated at $1.59 billion.
Meanwhile, the GOP National Committee issued a statement Thursday night that "Governor Justin's transition to another party is another blow to the Democratic Party, which is more of a hindrance than working to make our country great again."
"Given just 15 governors and control of the smallest number of state legislatures in history, Governor Justice's statement is just another rejection of a party that has no leaders from top to bottom and is unable to find positive, unifying messages," Republican National Committee spokeswoman Ronna McDaniel told CBS News in a statement.
The heavyweight cat named Mr. krasavchik found a home thanks to social networks
The nursery of the city of Pittsboro (North Carolina, USA) has built a cat named Mr. dye weighing more than 14 kilograms after it became famous thanks to the Internet.
This is reported by Mashable.
In late June, the kennel's Facebook account posted a photo of the cat asking him to find its owner because "he was obviously fed by someone before."
In the comments, users noted that the expression of the animal's muzzle could become a new meme.
The publication has garnered more than 3.2 thousand likes and 15 thousand comments.
In the comments, dozens of people expressed a desire to shelter Mr. krasavchik.
As a result, he was put in the hands of Angela Frazee, who promised to deal with his excess weight.
In an interview on WNCN radio, the American said she had already had a similar experience: she took home a cat weighing about 10 kilograms, and now it weighs just over five.
In July, Reddit users drew attention to a cat from Australia with unusually long paws.
A post with a photo of the animal collected more than 68,000 views.
Commentators noted that she could well have made a career in the modelling business.
Coe praised Russia's "sincere" apology over doping scandal
International Athletics specialist Sebastian Coe on Thursday praised what he called a sincere apology from Russia over the doping scandal, but reiterated that now is not the right moment to allow the country to participate in sports competitions again.
Russian representative of the Federation of athletics Dmitry Shlyakhtin told the Congress of the International Association of Athletics Federations, which took place on the eve of the World Championships in Athletics, that the removal of his country from sports competitions was fair and that he is determined to fight against doping.
He apologized "to all athletes from whom gold and silver medals were stolen at competitions."
Despite his comments, the Congress of the International Association of Athletics Federations voted to maintain the suspension imposed in November 2015 after the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) published a report on found evidence of state-funded doping.
"It seemed to me that today's response, today's report was very sincere," the president of the International Association of Athletics Federations of Coe told reporters.
"The whole Council and the whole Congress liked... that the Russian Federation itself recognizes that it has been through extremely hot times and is now doing everything possible to take care of the restructuring of the Federation."
Coe said he also "liked" that Russia had accepted the criteria for its recovery.
"I believe it was a very constructive day and that we are moving forward, but Congress supports the recommendations of the Special Commission that now is not the time to restore Russia's rights," Coe said.
"In the next few months, we have to do everything to resolve this situation.
Our leading principle was our desire to separate clean athletes from the tarnished system, "he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes who meet the strict criteria of the International Association of Athletics Federations will participate under a neutral flag in the World Athletics Championships, which will begin on Friday in London.
Rune Andersen, head of the Special Commission of the International Association of Athletics Federations, said on Monday that a number of requirements have yet to be met for Russia's recovery.
As he told reporters in London after a report made at the board of the International Association of Athletics Federations, drug testing is still not carried out in sufficient volume, and suspended trainers still quietly do their work.
Court arrests Ukrainian journalist suspected of treason
Detained by the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) journalist Vasily Muravitsky has been placed under arrest for two months, reports the SBU.
He is suspected of treason by posting his publications on Russian websites and violating the territorial integrity of Ukraine.
At the same time, Russia does not support the measures of the Ukrainian authorities against the journalist, considering it a "barbaric policy" against the media.
Two years after the peak of Europe's migration crisis, Italy has decided on a limited military operation in the Mediterranean.
The patrol ship, Comandante Borsini, entered Libya's territorial waters to then, along with that country's Navy, stop the influx of illegal migrants.
The decision to launch the operation was made by the Italian parliament on Wednesday.
Rome negotiated it with Libya's internationally recognized government, which, however, does not control most of the country's territory.
The opposing cabinet and the Tobruk-based Libyan parliament accused Italy of violating Libya's sovereignty.
And the commander of the Libyan National Army, Field Marshal Haftar, ordered his subordinates to counteract the Italian ships.
Rome, however, said it did not believe these threats and intended to send another military vessel to Libyan territorial waters.
The situation was discussed last week at talks between Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni and the head of Europe's recognized Libyan cabinet, Faiz Saraj.
Italian authorities went on to set up a maritime mission to combat illegal migration after statistics were released in July on the number of illegal immigrants coming into the country from Libya: 95,000 since the beginning of the year.
The government said that the resources to receive migrants had been exhausted.
Large-scale failure occurred on Skype
The global failure of Skype service was recorded today in several countries around the world.
Users on Thursday, August 3, began to send complaints to the developers of the program.
Microsoft stressed that experts are already actively working to fix the problems faced by the people of Europe and North America, RIA Novosti said.
Let's remind that in June of this year Skype also failed.
Users have been unable to receive and send messages for some time.
The two leaders of the Ukrainian athletics team were suspended from participation in the World Cup
Olga countryk and Olesya Povkh, who specialize in running for short distances, are excluded from the structure of the national team of Ukraine for the World Cup-2017 in London.
This is reported on the website of the athletics federation of the country (FLAU).
This decision was taken by the Executive Committee of the Organization in connection with the initiation of disciplinary proceedings against track and field athletes by the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF).
The coach of the fellow countryman Sergey basenko has also been excluded from the Ukrainian delegation.
According to Sportarena, the IAAF suspects female athletes in the use of doping.
Povkh - the Bronze Prize-winner of the Olympic Games-2012 and the World Cup-2011, the champion of Europe-2010 in the relay 4 on 100 meters, the countryman - the winner of the European Championship of 2012 in the relay 4 on 400 meters.
The world athletics championships in London will take place from August 4-13.
How football's financial rules will affect Neymar's move to Paris
Rules aimed at preventing unlimited spending by European football clubs will not prevent Neymar's world-record transfer from Spain's Barcelona to France's Paris Saint-Germain.
Whatever the consequences may come further down the chain, for Paris Saint-Germain by UEFA, the governing body that controls European football, in whose power to ban teams from the prestigious Champions League tournament.
It follows from the Financial Fair Play rules introduced by UEFA in 2011 that PSG will eventually have to show that Neymar's transfer was funded without major losses.
Barcelona were paid 222 million euros ($262 million) just to free the Brazilian from his contract, and Neymar will receive a salary that will reach tens of millions of dollars a year.
Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymar's move to France.
PSG can definitely sell out to hire Neymar and add him to the galaxy of other stars, given the team's funding from Qatar's Energy-rich ruling family.
Clubs have the right to spend large sums to acquire players, but they have to balance them at the expense of legitimate sources of income in order to reach the threshold of profitability in their football business.
"FFF" was introduced by Michel Platini after his election as UEFA president in 2007.
The former French footballer believed that clubs that were in huge debt in their quest for success were, in fact, swindling and risking ruin if banks or owners stopped financing.
In 2011, FFF stopped focusing on club debt and instead switched to tracking their losses.
As a result of this change, the business model originally used by Roman Abramovich in Chelsea in 2003 - to buy a club with good potential and then spend heavily to improve the team and create a global brand - has become a difficult plan.
During this three-year valuation period, which captures 2018, clubs can suffer losses of 30 million euros.
And, despite the fact that Platini was disgracefully removed from the presidency in 2015, his successor at UEFA, Alexander cheferin, is still determined to deter excessive spending.
"Of course, the FPF is alive, and we will tighten the rules moving forward," Andrea Traverso, who controls the FPF at UEFA, told the Associated Press last week.
Although PSG will pay for the buyout of Neymar's contract at a time, it can distribute this amount for reporting throughout the duration of his contract.
Neymar has signed a five-year contract, so the transfer value can be shown in the annual report as a cost of 44.4 million euros over the next five years.
During the first wave of FPF sanctions in 2014, heavy sanctions were imposed on PSG, as well as on Abu Dhabi-owned Manchester City.
PSG were fined 60 million euros (at that rate it is 82 million dollars), which was later reduced to 20 million euros, and were ordered to limit the composition of their team in the Champions League during the 2014-10 season to 21 players instead of the usual 25.
UEFA tracks clubs that may try to outdo its financial inspections by inflating their income at the expense of companies associated with the club's owners.
Although the Qatari company could have siphoned off PSG, if the amount of funding was deemed to exceed standard market prices, UEFA would not have allowed it to be considered a legitimate income.
This is exactly what happened in 2014, when UEFA ruled that the amount of funding for PSG from the Qatar Tourism Authority had been inflated.
It was reported that part of Neymar's earnings to PSG could come in the form of payments from the Organizing committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.
But PSG and Qatar 2022 deny that Neymar will become a World Cup ambassador, and a similar manner could easily be detected by UEFA inspectors.
Past sanctions imposed on PSG mean UEFA will be even more careful to monitor any attempts to circumvent the rules.
According to people familiar with the situation on Thursday, UEFA did not have preliminary discussions with PSG about Neymar's transfer.
They communicated with the Associated Press on condition of anonymity, as they are not authorized to discuss the situation of PSG.
According to the latest published report, in 2015-1016 "PSG" received more than 10 million euros in profit on turnover of 542.4 million euros.
The accounts for the last financial year have not yet been published.
PSG expects Neymar's arrival to be favorable ground for sponsorship deals, the sale of paraphernalia and T-shirts with the team's logo.
The club assumes that turnover will increase by at least 30 percent due to the hiring of a new player.
Undoubtedly angry that one of the best players is leaving, the Spanish league tried to prevent Neymar's transfer, saying that "PSG" will violate the financial "fair play."
"This is an obvious case of" financial doping, "with the club and the state," La Liga president Javier Tebas told Spanish newspaper AS, referring to Qatar as the ultimate owner of PSG.
Arsenal coach Arsene Wenger, whose club is owned by the American sports tycoon, shares La Liga's doubts about the club's funding by the state.
"These are all the consequences of equity participation, and it has completely changed the landscape of football over the past fifteen years," Wenger said on Thursday.
"When the club belongs to the country, everything is possible.
It becomes very difficult to observe financial fair play, because the country can have many ways and many reasons to be represented by such a serious player.
The order and places of taking the oath of office will be determined by the President
Where and how new Russian citizens will pledge allegiance to the Russian Federation will be determined by the president - such amendments to the second reading in the relevant law developed by the State Duma Committee on legislation and state construction.
A week ago, the deputies planned to directly determine the procedure for taking the oath of office in the law.
Children under the age of 18, as well as the incapacitated, will be exempt from taking the solemn oath, according to the revised text of amendments to the bill "on Citizenship of the Russian Federation" (there is at the disposal of "Izvestia"), which the committee will consider on July 11 before the second reading at its meeting.
President Vladimir Putin supported the idea of swearing in Russian citizenship instead of formally signing documents on June 6 during a meeting with Speaker of the State Duma Vyacheslav Volodin.
The deputies framed this idea in the form of an amendment to the second reading of the bill, providing for the abolition of the decision to issue citizenship to those who were subsequently convicted of a number of crimes of a terrorist or extremist nature: for example, for public incitement to terrorism or its public justification in the media or on the Internet (part 2 of Article 205.2 of the Criminal Code), as well as for the hijacking of an aircraft, train or water transport, but only if the act is connected with terrorism (part 4 of Article 211 of the Criminal Code).
According to the bill, the logic of it was: by issuing citizenship documents, a person signs up to a promise to comply with Russian law-by taking the path of extremism, he violates that promise.
The bill in April was introduced in the State Duma by leaders of Duma factions Vladimir Vasilyev ("United Russia"), Gennady Zyuganov (Communist Party), Vladimir Zhirinovsky (LDPR), Sergey Mironov ("Fair Russia") and the speaker of DG Vyacheslav Volodin.
On May 19, the deputies accepted it in the first reading.
Last week, the DG Committee on State Construction and legislation approved the text of the bill for the second reading, but now it has been revised again.
Now it says that the order of taking the oath will be established by the President of the Russian Federation.
Earlier, parliamentarians were going to describe the procedure directly in the law "on Citizenship of the Russian Federation," indicating that the ceremony should take place in a solemn setting in front of the state emblem and the flag of Russia in the presence of a representative of the Ministry of Internal Affairs.
However, it was not clear from the text of the bill where such an event should take place - the list of places where it is possible to place the coat of arms of the Russian Federation is regulated by the relevant federal constitutional law.
They include courts, offices of heads of state bodies of subjects, municipalities, judges, prosecutors, heads of federal executive bodies, etc.
Most likely, it could also be a registry office.
To say a solemn oath wishing to obtain citizenship of the Russian Federation will be after officials check their documents.
But the person will receive the Russian passport only after taking the oath of office, according to the revised text.
A week ago, the draft stated that the oath of office should precede the signing of the decree.
The updated text says that Russia will be sworn in from the age of 18, not from the age of 14.
There is still a rule under which those who are incapable or restricted will be exempt from taking the oath, as well as those who cannot pronounce, read or sign the text of the oath.
In addition, the President of the Russian Federation has the right to exempt from this procedure and "other persons,"
The updated bill also sets out a special procedure for admission to Russian citizens of Ukraine, who are considered native speakers of the Russian language.
They will have to formally renounce their Ukrainian citizenship by submitting an application to the authorized body of Ukraine for this purpose.
A certified copy of the application will need to be handed over to Russian officials.
Renunciation of "Alien" citizenship, as it is now, will not be necessary if it is provided for by an international treaty or if it is not possible "for reasons beyond the control of the person."
The corresponding amendment to the law was proposed by a group of deputies, among them the first deputy speaker of DG Ivan Melnikov (Communist Party), Natalia povetskaya, Pavel Krasheninnikov and Ayrat Farrahov (all - "United Russia").
I think many of you know that it is unrealistic to get a certificate from Ukraine, just impossible.
Accordingly, a lot of people are waiting for the decision of their fate on the citizenship of the Russian Federation, - explained the day before the head of the Duma Committee on State Construction and legislation Pavel Krasheninnikov (er).
In addition, the text made it clear that restrictions on certain positions for foreigners would not apply to those who had renounced their "other" citizenship in writing and had surrendered their former passport to the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia, but "for reasons beyond his control" he had not ceased to be considered a citizen of another country.
Now foreigners are forbidden to hold positions in the municipal service, to be hired to work for facilities and in organizations whose activities are connected with the security of Russia.
Also, a person with dual citizenship or residence permit of another country cannot become a member of the State Duma or a member of the Federation Council.
It is planned that the law should come into force on September 1, 2017, by which time the necessary by-laws should be ready.
Nostalgia becomes niche in "Hot American Summer" and "fellow detective"
The current iteration of the story is nostalgically reminiscent at the same time of the glorious days of the characters in the 80s; of the grunge era in the 90s (around the time that outstanding masters David Wayne and Michael Showalter made the comedy skits "the State" for MTV); and of themselves - that is, of 2001, before its stars like Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poler and Paul Rudd moved on to more serious things.
As a fact of culture, it is both the elevation and embodiment of our era with its constant reminders from Facebook.
But as a franchise, it seems anachronistic.
"The first day of the Camp" was surprisingly good, and not just because of absurdist humor (including the original story of a talking banana of vegetables, voiced by H. John Benjamin).
The result doubles the main joke: Middle-aged actors play sexually concerned children who have just reached adulthood; thanks to this, the inability to return to becomes part of the joke.
"Ten Years Later," where adults played already adults, has less deep emotional roots, and its parody is more haphazard and includes riffs from 90s stalker movies like "hands rocking the Cradle."
In one episode, the character takes out an Apple Powerbook, four-wheeled roller skates and "a bunch of other things from 1991."
Many of the story moves are the same.
Good-natured KUB (Showalter), now a writer, still hasn't achieved reciprocity from Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) still hasn't parted ways with virginity.
And there is still an insane and vile conspiracy, involving Ronald Reagan (also Showalter), who is now incited by George W. Bush (a tried-and-tested parody performed by Michael Jan Blake).
As always, the best part of the franchise is the retreat from it.
It's especially funny to see the ever-young Rudd, who sings Matt Dillon's song from "Singles," whose character, former big man Andy looks now an old woman.
To bring this franchise success could be random madness in the spirit of the type of recursive series "Seven Up," until it gets to what I think would be its logical conclusion: "Hot American Summer: Twenty years later," where in the last scene the whole company would go to the movies for the premiere of "Hot American Summer."
"Comrade Detective" on Amazon turns to another type of nostalgia: Memories of the Cold War from "Americans," "explosive blonde" or even "brilliance" with its images of the struggles of East and West.
This comedy, created by Brian geithwood and Alessandro Tanaka with director Riz Thomas, depicts a TV film: an 80s Romanian police drama about two police officers in Bucharest fighting for truth, atheism and the Marxist-Leninist way.
The main roles - who saw the life of Gregor and idealist Joseph - are performed by Florin piersik Jr. And Corneliu Ulich, and voiced their dialogues in English Channing Tatum (aka executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
It's a brilliant idea.
But only an idea.
There are a few visual jokes (police officers spend time watching a chess match as Americans could watch football).
The team of famous voices behind the scenes - among them Jenny Slater, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloe Sevigny - allows you to play "guess the voice."
But "Comrade Detective" so holds on to the plausible clumsy propaganda drama - there's even a killer in Ronald Reagan's mask - that often looks like it.
Six long episodes are long, and funny doesn't happen very often.
If he were to be made, "Comrade Detective" could better handle his satire in the spirit of agitprop; for example, every time Gregor and Josef come to the American Embassy, there are two fat people sitting in the lobby, absorbing a bunch of hamburgers.
To an imaginary Communist viewer, this image says that Western culture is capable of doing anything.
The fictional Romanian authors of the film are not so wrong: we do so even with our own recent history, and with theirs too.
The prize fund of the match for the Russian Super Cup in football between Spartak and Lokomotiv will be about 30 million rubles.
This was announced by the president of the Russian Football Premier League (RFPL) Sergey prydkin at a press conference.
According to the head of RFPL, the winner will receive 70% of this amount, RT reports.
He also added that by now there were almost no tickets left for the match.
Spartak - Lokomotiv match will take place on Friday, July 14, at 9: 30 pm.
As TASS notes, "Spartak" - the defending champion of the Russian Federation, and "Lokomotiv" is the owner of the Cup of the country.
Two young Ufa men cleaned a furniture shop for 200 thousand rubles
The other day, the 37-year-old Ufa, who has a furniture firm, contacted the police.
The man claimed the theft of expensive tools from the shop, which caused serious damage to its production.
Tools with a total value of almost 200 thousand rubles: two welding machines, a perforator, a hydraulics, a winch became the prey of vorishks.
The guards began to search for the criminals and soon went out to the residents of the annoveshchensky district of Bashkortostan, buddies of 23 and 24 years.
According to the press service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Republic, accomplices entered the territory of the enterprise, broke the front door and took out tools.
Right after that, the guys sold stolen equipment the first car service.
A theft case has already been brought against them, and law enforcement has managed to return only some of the stolen tools to the rightful owner.
The State Department commented on Medvedev's words about relations between the Russian Federation and the United States
The US and Russia should be able to work with each other.
The statement was made by State Department spokesman Heather Nauert in response to the words of Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev on relations between the two states.
Earlier, the head of the Russian government said that by adopting new anti-Russian sanctions, the United States put an end to the hope of improving bilateral relations and declared the Russian Federation a full-fledged trade war.
Commenting on these words, Nauert acknowledged that Russian-American relations are at a "low level," but noted that it is necessary to look for "areas for interaction."
"Look at the truce in southwest Syria, which has been observed for almost a month."
"And this is an example of good cooperation between the United States and Russia," the diplomat quoted RIA Novosti as saying.
At the same time, a Foreign Ministry spokeswoman declined to comment on the Russian prime minister's statement that the sanctions amounted to a trade war.
US President Donald Trump signed a bill on new sanctions against Russia, Iran and the DPRK last Wednesday.
At the same time, he acknowledged that the document was unsuccessful and contrary to the American Constitution.
Dior has "grown" roses from amethysts and quartz
The jewelry division of the French fashion house Dior - Dior Joaillerie - has completed the collections of Rose Dior Bagatelle and Bois de Rose.
They have five new rings and three ring-chokers on velvet ribbons.
The Rose Dior Pré Catelan line produced two new rings and a pendant of amethysts, rose quartz and diamonds made in glyptics technique (hand-carved stone) and pavage and dedicated to the 70th anniversary of the house.
The head of Dior Joaillerie victuar de castellan was inspired by the roses grown at his estate in Granville by fashion designer Christian Dior, and by the Paris gardens of bagel and prekatelan.
Trump found guilty of deteriorating relations with Russia
US President Donald Trump has been sharply critical of members of Congress.
According to the American leader, their actions have led to a deterioration of relations with Russia.
Our relations with Russia are at an all-time low and dangerous level.
"You can thank Congress, these same people can't even give us medicine," the president wrote on Twitter.
The day before, Donald Trump signed into law new sanctions against Russia, Iran and the DPRK.
In particular, they will affect Russian banks and energy companies.
The White House subsequently issued a statement by the president in which he indicated that the law would not allow the United States to make lucrative deals and would bring the Russian Federation, China and North Korea even closer.
Belarusian entrepreneur refuses to buy Ukrainian daughter Sberbank
Viktor Prokopenya, an entrepreneur from Belarus, withdrew an application from the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) to buy a subsidiary of Sberbank.
The businessman explained his decision to RBC with the intention to "concentrate on our other planned investments and projects that we are working on."
According to Mr. prokopeni, such a move would be "the best investment of time," despite the investment attractiveness of buying Sberbank's daughter.
Mr. Prokopenya became the main contender for the purchase of the Russian bank's division in Ukraine after the NBU rejected the application of the NorvikBank consortium Grigory Guselnikov and the Belarusian company Said Gutseriev in July.
Russian banks began to leave the Ukrainian market after President Petro Poroshenko imposed sanctions on their subsidiaries in March.
One of these financial organizations - in addition to VTB and Vnesheconombank - was Sberbank.
Novak named the cause of blackout in Crimea
The Ministry of Energy of the Russian Federation named the cause of blackout in Crimea.
Alexander Novak, the head of the department, made an explanation about the incident.
According to him, the peninsula was without electricity due to a traffic accident in the territory of Krasnodar Krai.
The truck involved in the accident hit power lines, as a result of which the Kuban and associated Crimean networks were shut down.
Power failures in major Crimean cities were recorded last week.
Experts fixed the problems within a few hours.
Initially, it was reported that the cause of blackout may have been abnormal heat.
Bank of England to keep interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will not change after weak economic growth and weakening inflation forced rumors of a possible hike to subside.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain unhurt, and has left interest rates unchanged amid growing pressure on family incomes.
Experts at the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted with a score of 6 to 2 in favor of keeping rates at 0.25%, with a smaller number of committee members in favor of a rate increase this month because weak economic growth has weakened support for the hike.
In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank limited its forecasts for an increase of 1.7% interest in 2017 and 1.6% in 2018 and warned that the pressure on family incomes will continue, while inflation is still expected to rise to about 3% in the autumn.
However, the Bank warned that rate hikes in the next few years would be necessary to control Brexit-induced inflation, and said borrowing costs would probably have to rise more strongly than expected in financial markets.
Members of the Committee also voted to abandon part of the huge set of economic development measures launched a year ago as a result of Brexit.
Starting next February, the Bank will close an urgent financing plan under which it provides cheap loans to banks, although it said it now has to provide another 15 billion pounds - up to 115 billion pounds - as part of the plan.
In the minutes of the rate decision, the Bank said: "According to the MPC's main forecasts, gross domestic product (GDP) growth remains slow in the near future, while pressure on real household incomes continues to affect consumption."
On the issue of rates, he repeated that to suspend inflation would require "some tightening of financial policy," in a "slightly larger" size than markets expect.
At the moment, markets are predicting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020.
But the bank stressed that all increases would be "gradual" and "limited."
The bank's forecasts for increases this year and next are lower than those made in May, which were equal to 1.9% and 1.7%.
The bank left unchanged its forecast of 1.8% in 2018.
After this news, sterling fell against the dollar and the euro.
The pound fell 0.5% to $1.31 and 0.4% to €1.11.
The decision not to change the rate came after recent disappointing growth figures weakened the increased expectation of a hike; GDP then rose 0.3% in the second quarter, compared to 0.2% in the previous three months.
According to the Bank's representative, growth is likely to remain at 0.3% in the third quarter, although it will start to increase slightly at the end of the year.
The bank's latest inflation report gave little cause for joy to households hit by high inflation and very minor wage increases: According to the bank, the pressure will increase before declining.
The bank added that the financial policy "cannot prevent" udao on earnings in the next few years, but expects wages to "significantly" recover by the end of its three-year forecast.
The economy is also set to grow as a result of growing demand for British goods, driven by the pound's low exchange rate, which makes up for some of the lower consumer spending.
The decision comes a year after rates were cut to 0.25% last August following the shocking results of a referendum on leaving the European Union that caused the pound to fall.
The bank estimates it is likely to take four years to have a full impact on prices and the economy.
Before the bank made its latest rate decision, there was an uproar over the proposed rate hike, as inflation put more pressure on already hard-pressed households: three Committee specialists asked to raise rates to 0.5% in July.
Last month, inflation fell to 2.6% from 2.9% in July, although according to the bank, this fall was expected and compensated again in the coming months.
According to the bank, the higher figure than the planned 2% is entirely a consequence of the low value of the pound.
Andrew Montlake, director of mortgage brokers koreko, said: "Given the recent fall in swap rates, it appears that the mortgage market will become even more competitive again, as lenders demand business opportunities and expect a good end to the year.
The market looks particularly favorable for those approaching the end of their existing contracts, as refinancing loans, often with the possibility of no Commission as well as a low rate, becomes more popular than ever. "
State health service to write controversial HIV drug 10,000 people
Starting in September, patients will have access to a "revolutionary" HIV prevention drug after a High Court battle over the funding of the drug from the Public Health Service.
The National Health Service of England has announced that pre-exposure HIV Prevention (PrEP), a pill taken before sex that has been shown to reduce the risk of infection in at-risk individuals by an average of 86 per cent, will now be provided by the health service during the initial three-year trial period of approximately 10,000 people.
She agreed to finance the trial after the Court of Appeal upheld a High Court ruling last year alleging that the National Health Service had the ability to pay for the prep, despite her claims that it should be funded by local authorities.
The move, announced on Thursday, was described as a "crucial innovation" by Simon Stevens, president of England's National Health Service, and the National AIDS Control Authority (NAT) called it a "turning point."
Before the full launch of the programme across England by April 2018, Venus dispensaries in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to start registering people, and more dispensaries will join the programme in October.
Pre-exposure Prevention (PrEP) is a course of HIV drugs taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
Studies have shown that PrEP significantly reduces the risk of HIV infection among people at risk.
When taking PrEP before sex in the human body, there are enough certain drugs to prevent HIV infection.
Such drugs can be taken daily or at least two hours before sex.
Eligible patients include homosexual and bisexual men, transgender people and people whose partners are HIV positive and do not receive successful treatment.
Dispensaries will select suitable participants who agree to participate in the study, including men, women, transgender people and individuals whose partners are not aware of whether their HIV status is being held back by antiretroviral therapy.
People living and assigned to a GP in England will also be able to apply for potential participation in the nearest Venus dispensary taking part in the programme.
The program will cost 10 million pounds, and England's National Health Service this week after an international procurement tender signed a contract to provide the drug.
The study is designed to assess all the possibilities of PrEP by collecting clinical data on who is the target audience of the drug, its digestibility and use on a large scale.
"This major innovation should complement and strengthen the large-scale and increasingly successful efforts aimed at preventing HIV.
This is another milestone in more than three decades of success in the fight against one of the biggest health threats facing humanity.
Deborah Gold, president of NAT (the National AIDS Control Authority), said: "This is a turning point in the fight against HIV.
If it is properly targeted at people in need and at risk, it makes it possible to change the status of the HIV epidemic in England.
Starting in September, people at risk for HIV, thanks to this study conducted in England at the expense of the National Health Service, will have access to a new enabling tool, the use of which a person can control himself without discussing it with a partner, which will lead to the improvement of many, many lives.
We warmly welcome this news. "
Ian Green, president of the Terrence Higgins Foundation, said: "Now first and foremost, care must be taken to ensure that the test is quickly rolled out across the country, and that no one at risk for HIV is forgotten.
Now that we are provided with the experimental drug PrEP we are going to protect more than 10,000 people at risk for HIV. "
Shadow people's health minister Sharon Hodgson said: "We very much welcome the start of the PrEP test, it is very late due to months of delays and delays by the government."
The data demonstrate how revolutionary this drug can become as part of our approach to preventing HIV and stopping transmission of this fatal infection.
This test will bring us one step closer to a full understanding of the benefits of PrEP.
It is now important that the test be rolled out as soon as possible across the country to protect people at risk for HIV and move us one step further towards stopping the spread of HIV in society.
The World Congress of Tatars adopted a resolution on the support of the Treaty of Tatarstan and Russia
The sixth congress of the World Congress of Tatars (VKT) adopted a resolution in which it noted the importance of maintaining the post of president in Tatarstan.
According to the document, the post is "a positively recommended form of organization of the highest state power in the Republic and expressing the national interests of the entire Tatar people."
In addition, the Congress stressed in the resolution the importance of the Treaty on the separation of powers between Russia and Tatarstan.
According to the document, he "played a positive role in the ethno-cultural, socio-economic and socio-political development of Tatarstan and the Russian Federation as a whole."
The agreement between Moscow and Kazan, which has been in force since July 24, 2007, was concluded for 10 years.
On July 11, the deputies of the State Council of Tatarstan asked the president of Russia to extend the agreement and keep the name of the post of the head of the region.
Now Tatarstan is the only entity of the federation that has a treaty with Russia.
The head of the region is the only one whose position is called "president."
In Russia, there were difficulties in obtaining an international driver's license
Traffic police units are experiencing a shortage of international driving permits (IDPs).
To get such rights, you have to wait a few weeks for the queue, which has become a real problem for holiday-makers who want to go on holiday abroad in their car or rent it there.
It is worth noting that the situation with international driving permits remains contradictory.
The IDP was introduced to make it easier for the foreign police to understand what is written in the National Certificate, as the information is explained in five languages.
The requirements for international rights are enshrined in the 1968 Vienna Convention on Road Traffic, but Russian rights are recognized in countries that have ratified the Vienna Convention.
In reality, however, everything depends on a particular police or rental office: some require an IDP, and some have enough national rights.
In order to be insured, drivers do receive international rights, but it is worth considering that in countries that have not ratified the Convention (e.g. USA, Spain, Mexico, Indonesia), the authorities have the right not to recognize national rights or IDPs.
Now there is a problem with forms in almost all divisions of traffic police, Kommersant reports, having conducted a study in a number of regions.
Thus, in Moscow, the traffic police units simply do not issue talons, the forms have been missing for four months.
You can make an appointment on the public services website, but there the queue has already stretched to mid-August.
In Krasnoyarsk, it is impossible to get an IDP "for technical reasons," without going into details, in Samara region honestly say that there are no forms, a similar situation occurs in other cities.
Many Muscovites have already encountered the problem, and there are more and more such messages in social networks:
Irina Burmistrova: "Guess why you can't get international rights in Moscow?"
Right, because all traffic police departments have run out of forms.
Elena Podkolzina: "Question to people who know!"
We need to get international rights very urgently.
In Moscow all the time is beaten far ahead, there are no vouchers in place at all (there is a button, but the ticket can not give).
It seems that the portal of public services shows that in SPB time free to Fig.
Has anyone tried to get in another city?
Will it work?
According to the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation, the requirements for forms of international driving permits have changed, so new forms are being delivered to the State auto inspection units.
The deficit may be related to this, however, it is not clear what changes are involved, it has not been previously reported.
Forms buys a special purpose Center in the field of road safety (CSN BDD) of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation and then supplies them to traffic police units.
In recent years, all contracts were signed with "Gozak" JSC: in 2014-2015 almost 200 thousand forms of IDP were produced, in 2016 15 thousand forms were purchased, in 2017-90 thousand, but the last contract was signed on July 18 with "first printing yard" LLC for the manufacture of 70 thousand forms.
There is a version that CSN simply did not manage to hold a tender in time, which caused the deficit.
However, there are other versions of the shortage of forms: because of the crisis, many people began to travel on their own not to Europe, but to cheaper Asian countries - China, Thailand and so on.
It is not clear what rights are being taken there, so people are being reinsured, so there has been an acrimonious demand for international "crusts."
It has recently become known that professional drivers will have to take an examination to confirm their qualifications.
This proposal was made by the Ministry of Transport.
The new International Driving Permit (IDP) has been in force since 31 May 2011.
The Minister of Justice of Ukraine refused to believe in the construction of the Crimean Bridge
Ukrainian Justice Minister Pavel Petrenko said he did not believe in Russia's ability to build a bridge to Crimea.
He said this in an interview with the Observer portal on Friday, August 4.
No self-respecting international company will even put a bolt or gag there because it risks losing its business on the territory of the EU, the US, Japan - in countries that have joined sanctions against Russia regarding Crimea.
"That is, in my deep conviction, the prospects of this project actually do not exist," Petrenko said.
He added that he believes Russia is unable to implement a major infrastructure project on its own.
Russia cannot normally build smaller-scale facilities as well.
I know that after the Olympic Games in Sochi already began to destroy entire stadiums.
"Therefore, I believe, the best tool in this situation is sanctions against companies that turned out to be so short-sighted to join this project," the official said.
On July 31, the builders completed the construction of the car arch of the Crimean Bridge.
On the Kerch Bank the consolidation Assembly of the road arch of the Crimean Bridge has been completed: its vault is closed at a height of 45 meters from the base of the structure.
"At the same time, the bridge builders prepared the railway arch for installation on the fairway poles," the information center of the Project reported.
In April, the head of the Transport Ministry, Maxim Sokolov, informed Russian President Vladimir Putin that the construction of the facility was ahead of schedule.
The Crimean Bridge will connect the Crimean Peninsula and Krasnodar Krai.
In Spain, fired an official who did not go to work for 10 years
What kind of angelic patience (or absolute indifference to public service) should the chief of the Spanish official, Carles Recio, have had?
The permanent walk stretched for 10 long years.
However, he was dismissed.
But not by his immediate boss.
That only in the world of bureaucrats doesn't happen.
The people seem to have long been used to all the "servants of the people."
And yet, officials manage to surprise those on whose taxes they live well all the time.
This time, the "sensation" complained from Spain.
There, Carles Resio, a member of the Valencia archives, managed to avoid going to work for a decade.
At the same time, he was regularly paid.
And the whole solid - 50 thousand euros a year.
And now Mr. Recio's "wonderful times" are over.
He was fired by a decision of the Legislative Assembly of Valencia.
During the investigation, it was revealed that the malicious truancy came to the office every working morning at 07: 00 to mark in the electronic system.
And then he went home.
Once again, he appeared in the workplace at 4pm to mark again in the system that he had left.
And so 10 years.
It was also reported that all his spare time was devoted to drawing comics at home.
Members of the Legislative Assembly of Valencia are now considering how to punish the immediate chief, Mr. Recio, who could not help but know how to "actively work" in his workplace.
Judges are offered protection from Presidents
The Presidential Council for Human Rights (HRC), on behalf of Vladimir Putin, has developed proposals to strengthen the independence of the judiciary.
HRC proposes to limit the powers of the presidents of the courts and to introduce their electability.
For the courts of appeal and cassation, HRC wants to introduce special districts that will not be tied to the administrative-territorial division in the Russian Federation.
The Supreme Court must also submit its proposals within the framework of the presidential mandate.
HRC has finalized proposals that will strengthen the independence of Russian justice.
This work was carried out by HRC on behalf of Vladimir Putin on January 3, 2017, which the president gave after meeting with members of the Council.
At the meeting with the members of the Council on December 8, 2016, some cases of judicial arbitrariness, as well as problems of public control in places of detention of citizens were discussed (see "Kommersant" of December 9).
The outcome of the HRC was 25 proposals that address both the independence of the judiciary and the detection of judicial errors, as well as the financing of the courts and legal education.
One of the ideas of Kremlin human rights defenders is to limit the powers of court presidents to increase the independence of the remaining judges.
If the candidate for the position of judge successfully passed the contest and received the support of the judicial community, the president of the court, according to HRC, should submit it for appointment, without the right to refuse, as the law now allows.
It is also proposed that the president be deprived of the right to allocate cases to judges.
A specially written computer program can do this, experts say.
The HRC also considers that the president is not entitled to "predetermine the results of the qualification certification of the judge, initiate his disciplinary action, make decisions on the establishment of additional material payments."
At the same time, the presidential council considers it necessary to move to "the election of the presidents of the courts by the judges themselves" and "to empower them for a relatively short period of time with mandatory rotation."
Now all the presidents of the courts (from Republican to District) are appointed for six years by the President on the proposal of the Chairman of the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation.
In order to protect judges from the pressure of regional administrations, HRC proposes to organize a new appeal and cassation in the courts of general jurisdiction.
Now their structure is tied to the administrative-territorial division in the Russian Federation.
The HRC says that "it is necessary to ensure the organization of separate courts of appeal and cassation not at the level of regional judicial bodies in the constituent entities of the Russian Federation, but in the judicial districts."
The experts are based on the practice of arbitration courts.
They have "judicial districts," which do not coincide with the administrative division in the Russian Federation, but guarantee greater independence from regional officials, who find it difficult to use "telephone law."
The justices of the peace of the HRC proposes to strengthen the people's judges to deal with certain "categories of civil and administrative cases" with their participation.
For example, deprivation of parental rights, reinstatement, protection of honor and dignity, deprivation of driver's license, etc.
"These are only our proposals," explained "Kommersant" member of the HRC, retired Constitutional Court judge Tamara morshakov.
She also recalled that the president's instruction applied not only to HRC, but also to the Supreme Court (SC), which has yet to disclose its proposals.
There is still time for the armed forces (among the co-perpetrators - the Prosecutor General's Office and the Commissioner for human rights in the Russian Federation) to carry out the order.
To report to Vladimir Putin on how effectively the independence of justice is ensured in the Russian Federation, the chairman of the Armed Forces Vyacheslav Lebedev has until September 1.
Live the high life: half-floor and cunning designer receptions have turned this small apartment into Earls Court into a spacious dwelling
Joan Lee, a former banker keen on real estate repairs, moved from a spacious house in Knightsbridge to an apartment in Earls Court in 2014.
The apartment is on the ground floor of a nice model house in the style of Queen Anne, and in favor of the new design says that Joan did not collect her belongings and did not move again.
"I used to live with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger area," Joan says.
"I was looking for something comparable for my money.
I was shown this apartment in Earls Court, and there were the same high ceilings.
I fell in love with her and offered a price on the same day. "
Since the first viewing, the 1,000-square-foot apartment has undergone a complete renovation.
Originally, it was a one-bedroom apartment with a complex layout - to get into the bedroom, you had to go through the kitchen - and Joanna wanted to add storage space and a half-floor to squeeze the most out of the generous height of the ceilings.
"I wanted high ceilings, big windows, a lot of light.
Those were my demands, "she says.
To that end, she hired Erfan Azadi from the Notting Hill architectural and design studio Duck & Shed to use the 12.5-foot-high ceilings and create a home that would not only be a successful project, but fit Joan for life.
The ceiling was not high enough to accommodate two rooms one above the other, so the architectural challenge was to create a half-floor where you could stand at full height.
Erfan had to think creatively to cope with the brif.
"Working with steel structures is very difficult," he explains.
"We needed to place the premises so that they were one over the other, and we didn't have to bend.
It was necessary not just to build a simple platform, but to bend the structures so that they were at the right height and allowed to use the rooms from above and below. "
This decision allowed Erfan to arrange two full-size rooms one over the other in the allotted space - and many more interesting.
From the half floor through the vintage copper light window from "Retrouvius" there is a view of the chic living room below.
Mirrored furniture with gold finish, silver accents and vintage lighting devices from Serge Muya set the style of the project.
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding staginess, space and light.
The short corridor is framed with mirrors to make it seem longer.
In the kitchen, the Mirror protection panel appears to be a window into another room.
At the entrance, mirror cabinets serve to store all Joan's dishes.
To create a sense of a more luxurious space, the beauty of the living room can country the kitchen when it is not used.
There is nothing new in the folding kitchens.
The uniqueness of this kitchen is that it's a moving up door, like in a garage.
"Engineering art was involved here," Erfan says of the steel-reinforced wood-fibre shield door.
"It is equipped with a counterweight, so when you push the door up, it slips very easily."
With a reasonable use of space and storage space, Joan got an extra 16 square metres, an extra bedroom and improved layout.
"At the end of the day, floor area is exactly what you're going to sell, that is, what your real estate is valued at," says Erfan.
"Roughly speaking, the real estate agent will come in and make calculations based on the floor area."
Here they were able to increase the floor area using quality materials that give the space a touch of luxury.
"Materials are something we touch, so they help create an emotional connection with the house," says Erfan.
"No one falls in love with the electrical wiring in the walls.
It is important, but it does not hit the strings of our hearts. "
This is a testament to the fact that, due to good design and a larger scale, the apartment can turn from something ordinary into something amazing.
In fact, like Joan, you can decide to stay.
The government approved the establishment of the Cultural Policy Commission
The Russian government has approved the establishment of a commission on state cultural policy.
The decision was published on the government's website.
According to the document, the main task of the Commission will be to develop and adjust strategic approaches to the implementation of cultural policy.
The Commission will also develop draft strategies for cultural policy, clarify objectives and prepare new programmes for its implementation.
Deputy Prime Minister of the Russian Federation has been appointed head of the Commission.
The composition of the Commission will be approved separately.
Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev in 2016 approved a plan to implement the strategy of the state cultural policy until 2030.
The plan includes 193 activities and includes measures to expand the influence of Russian culture in other countries, preserve the common cultural space and cultural heritage, and it will help create conditions for the development of culture in the country.
Inflation in G20 countries has fallen to an eight-year low
Consumer price growth in The G20 countries has fallen to the lowest in eight years, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing data from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).
The OECD estimates that inflation in June 2016 was 2% - lower in October 2009, when the price growth index reached 1.7%.
Earlier, Rosstat reported a 0.1% decline in the consumer price index in Russia.
In this way, the agency recorded the first weekly deflation in 2017.
According to the Ministry of Finance, the inflation rate in Russia is 4.1%.
The Ministry of Economy, however, believes that the target has already been reached - according to this agency, the figure is 4%.
Putin warns against illegal logging of Baikal Tyga
Russian leader Vladimir Putin warned against the illegal destruction of forests during a meeting on the environmental development of the natural Baikal territory.
During the event, Minister of Natural Resources Sergey Donskaya noted that a draft law had been prepared earlier.
It allows logging during fire suppression, and the government plans to adopt it as early as the fall.
In turn, the president said that this project should be monitored so that in the process of cutting "everything in a row is not cut down."
Donskaya noted that this bill involves control by the Ministry of Emergency Situations and oversight agencies.
Media: members of the armed forces in secret from the command agree with the Donbass militia
Regular telephone services have been established on the line of armed confrontation in Donbass.
Fighters of opposing sides constantly communicate with each other on mobile phones, and about this communication do not know in headquarters.
Members of the Armed Forces and the Donbass militia established cell phone communication in secret from their high command.
This is reported on August 4 by "country.ua" with reference to the participants of the military operation in Donbass.
According to the newspaper, the commanders of the units are well aware of the names of their colleagues from the opposite side of the front and communicate with them daily by telephone.
Communication is not at all domestic: commanders try to reach some "tactical agreements."
Often, as a result of such conversations, there is a truce on a certain section of the front.
Journalists became aware of cases in which an officer received birthday greetings from behind the front line, from his formal enemy.
FSU fighters and DNR and LPR militias have been sitting in the trenches on the demarcation line since the spring of 2014, when Ukraine launched a combat operation against Donbass.
Foreign Ministry angered by blocking statements of the UN Security Council about attacks on the Embassy of the Russian Federation
The Russian Foreign Ministry is outraged by the actions of some Western diplomatic representatives, who block statements by the UN Security Council in the press condemning the terrorist shelling of the Russian Embassy in Syria.
This is reported by the Russian Foreign Ministry.
The ministry recalled that the territory of the Russian Embassy in Damascus on August 2 came under mortar fire for the third time in a month from terrorists of the groups "Hayat Tahrir al-sham" (former Jabhat al-Nusra, banned in the Russian Federation) and "Faylak Al-Rahman."
Considering that the international community is unanimous in qualifying Nusra as a terrorist organization, and the UN Security Council resolutions call for countering this structure, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation noted that "it would seem, needless to say, that the Nusra attacks should meet with universal unconditional and strong condemnation, and there should be no ambiguity in the assessments of attacks against diplomatic missions."
However, as stressed in the diplomatic department, "for the third time in a month, diplomatic representatives of the United States, Britain, France and Ukraine on the UN Security Council, alternately, varying the tone of objections, hiding behind arguments about the alleged lack of necessary information, blocked the proposal of the Russian Federation to adopt a standard short draft statement of the Security Council to the press condemning terrorist attacks on the Russian diplomatic representation in the Syrian capital."
The reluctance to show diplomatic solidarity with us may remain on the conscience of those delegations.
"The most outrageous thing is that the failure of the Security Council to condemn the acts of terrorists encourages them to further provocations and terrorist attacks, gives them a sense of impunity," the Foreign Ministry said and added that "it would not be desirable for these barbarians to create a belief that someone in the Security Council is with them at the same time."
Vladimir Putin speaks in favor of limiting the number of unscheduled business inspections
Russian President Vladimir Putin said during a meeting on investment projects in the far east that the number of unscheduled inspections of entrepreneurs should be reduced to 30% of the planned number, and said it was necessary to limit the duration of inspections to ten days.
"Unscheduled inspections are carried out, as a rule, without appropriate coordination with the prosecutor's office; only 2-3% is coordinated with the prosecutor's office, everything else goes independently," the president was quoted as saying.
Vladimir Putin also said that investigators should be banned from seizing servers and hard drives at enterprises.
In addition, according to the President, business associations should be given the right to protect the interests of their members in court.
"This, I hope, will bring a certain positive to the consideration of business-related cases or related to the violation of the law in the sphere of entrepreneurship," the head of state said.
According to Kommersant, due to the moratorium on scheduled inspections, the number of other types of inspections of entrepreneurs is growing.
In May, at the request of the business ombudsman under the President of Russia Boris Titov, a survey was conducted, which revealed that in fact there was a substitution of scheduled inspections with unscheduled ones (the proportion of those facing them rose from 11.9% in 2015 to 30.8% in 2016), prosecutors (from 16.9% to 21.8%), raiding (from 7.9% to 13.3%), as well as checks on citizens' applications (an increase from 15% to 19.5%) and administrative investigations (10.8% to 15.5%).
More about business inspections in the "Kommersant" material "to small businesses came from the other side."
The brothers are fighting for a real estate empire worth more than $500 million
Two brothers are fighting for one of Victoria's largest empires in real estate trading worth more than $500 million - Forty years after their Italian ancestors founded the dynasty.
Former Carlton Football Club director and property developer Colin de Lutis lives in Turak Palace through three doors from his younger brother Paul, who filed a lawsuit against him in the Supreme Court to share possessions and assets.
Paul has wanted to get out of the family business since 2014, but there is still a bitter dispute in the Supreme Court over the terms of the divorce.
Along with their mother Anna, the brothers own 87 properties worth more than half a billion dollars bought since their family bought a shop on Smith Street in Collingwood in 1973.
There, the family founded the firm "Westco Jeans," which grew into a network of 160 outlets.
It was sold in 1999 for $85 million.
The money has been invested in real estate, and the De Lutis family's list of properties today includes office buildings, development sites in Brunswick and Sorrento, apartments on the Gold Coast and in Mount Buller and shopping malls in the suburbs.
Under an arrangement with his late father, Colin - whom Paul describes as the "main driving force and dominant personality" of the de Lutis family - owns about two-thirds of the company's assets, while Paul owns about one-third.
According to the court, this means that Colin's property is 316 million and Paul's is 176 million.
The division of property and money has become a stumbling block for the floor.
"The section proposed by Colin gives him, in my opinion, the best parts of the property," he wrote in his first testimony in 2015.
Last Friday, after several failed attempts at reconciliation, the first Supreme Court hearings were held.
The brothers are now arguing over who will control the existing business - from which, according to Paul, Colin excluded it.
Colin argues that this is not the case, but accuses Paul of incompetent management of certain objects.
In testimony given by Colin at the start of the trial, he says he hopes to resolve the dispute.
"My Italian roots make me consider the family the highest priority," he wrote.
Court costs are rising as a snowball: hundreds of pages of testimony, emails and reports from companies such as Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer have been attached to the case; both sides have attracted the most prominent lawyers, including Royal lawyer Allan Myers, and the best shake-ups.
Mrs. de Lutis and her late spouse, Luigi, were immigrants from Italy; since the late 1950s, they have run dairy bars and gastronomes, and in the early 1970s bought a store in Brunswick.
Under financial guarantees, they bought a shop in Collingwood in which Colin opened the first family jeans store.
Colin says he launched Westco when he was "in the last grades of school, and Paul was then a boy (about 10 years old)."
Anna de Lutis says they and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to hand over their possessions to their sons without conflict.
"Luigi often told me that he did not want the brothers to be dealt with in court," she wrote.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer in the de Lutis group of companies; Colin says Mark got 10 million when he went out of business, and Luke 26 million.
According to Paul, both Luke and Mark were "unhappy with the financial conditions of their secession."
Colin was not a public figure, although he was a former member of the AFL club's board of directors and, according to a 2015 biography of Eddie McGuire, TV's best friend.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul and their lawyers on Friday.
Only Colin replied, with a text message saying that since the case had not yet been heard in court, "I have nothing to say about the truth."
"I am very, very sorry that my brother Paul decided to file a lawsuit against me and tremble in court the name of our family," he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote in testimony that he had tried to satisfy his brother's demands.
"Our father would not like to see Paul and I argue in court," he said, adding that he "still hopes for a resolution of the conflict."
On Friday, that hope apparently dissipated.
"The judgment in our case will soon be rendered by the court," Colin wrote.
Trump's new chief of staff plans to limit the flow of information to the president.
Others tried to do so and were defeated.
Maybe John F. Kelly will actually succeed.
In that case, he will be the first.
Politico reports that the new White House chief of staff plans to limit the flow of information coming to President Trump, including news reports from the media - hoping to keep the boss in a calmer state.
That's what reporter Josh Dosie reports.
"At a meeting held by the new White House chief of staff, John F. Kelly, with the leadership of the staff on his first working day, he outlined a major problem in the White House under President Donald Trump that he hopes to address: poor channels of information coming to the president."
Kelly told staff that the information should go through him-in paper form or through briefings - because the president would be better off making decisions if he got the right information.
Kelly's diagnosis is perfectly correct, but others have already failed in trying to pacify Trump by tracking the flow of information to him.
President Trump's relationship with television developed decades ago-and now that he's in the White House, his habit of watching TV is still strong.
"When Trump, as a candidate, resented the unfair coverage of the campaign, it was helpful to demonstrate to him that he was getting fair coverage in publications that could be repersuaded," Sam Nanberg, a former adviser to the electoral staff, told Politico in February.
Tara Palmeri wrote in Politico at the time that "according to six former members of the electoral staff, in order to keep Trump's Twitter habit under control, it was necessary to ensure that there was a constant stream of praise in the information coming to him personally."
It's a good thing.
But the idea that Trump's Twitter habit was ever "under control" is simply ridiculous.
Maybe these members of the electoral staff know something we don't know - for example, that, if it weren't for them, Trump's tweets would be even more provocative.
We may never know about the tweets that Trump has not published.
If his staff kept him out of trouble at least a few times, their efforts were not in vain.
But no one has always been able to keep Trump from pouring oil into the fire.
Part of the problem is that in a White House divided into rival factions, people are constantly trying to advance their agenda by giving Trump material - reliable or not-that confirms their views.
"Politico" - just to this story - wrote in May about the tendency of advisers to constantly tweak the president with dubious information.
Here is one example described by reporter Shane Goldmacher:
"Current and former Trump staffers say Trump can react very sharply to negative press reports, especially those containing dangerous leaks of information, and won't rest until he finds who was behind them.
This happened in late February, when someone subpoenaed the president with a printout of an article with GotNews.com, the website of Internet provocateur Charles K. Johnson, in which deputy chief of staff Katie Welsh was accused of being "behind a number of leaks" at the White House.
Never mind that Johnson is forever bandied about on Twitter for aggressive behavior, that he did not present specific facts or that in the past he launched false accusations and then refused them.
Trump read the article and proceeded to question the staff about Welsh. "
Goldmacher adds that then-chief of staff Reince Priebus and Secretary of staff Rob Porter "tried to build a system to manage the flow of papers that Trump receives and document them."
How did it work?
Three months later, Kelly is trying to do the same.
Maybe he will prove to be a more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump still has an impulsive nature, and his aides are still fighting each other for influence.
These constant factors make Kelly's task very difficult.
Tyumen Prosecutor's Office fights HIV-dissident
The Prosecutor's Office challenged the ruling of the Kalininsky District Court of Tyumen, which dismissed the criminal case against a local woman who had a young daughter died of HIV.
According to the investigation, the child died because the mother was an HIV dissident and refused treatment.
However, the court relieved her of her responsibility in connection with her reconciliation with the injured father.
The prosecutor's office believes that the crime cannot go unpunished so as not to set a precedent for other HIV dissidents.
The case against the resident of Tyumen was initiated under part 1 of Article 109 of the Criminal Code (causing death by negligence) in April - after her three-year-old daughter died from HIV infection in stage 4.
According to the prosecutor's office, the mother herself is HIV-positive.
"The woman did not treat herself and refused to treat her daughter, believing that HIV infection does not exist," the prosecutor's office of Tyumen region explained.
The criminal case came to the Kalininsky District Court of Tyumen, which on July 25 decided to terminate it.
The petition was filed by the father of the dead girl, explaining that he "forgave his wife, has no claims against her, she repaired the harm and apologized."
The Prosecutor's Office disagreed with the Court's decision and appealed, demanding that the decision to dismiss the case be overturned and sent to a new hearing.
The girl died, and it is impossible to repair the harm caused by the crime.
The HIV-infected mother, contrary to the recommendations of doctors, refused to examine the baby and treat her from a dangerous infection, "the press service of the prosecutor's office reported.
According to the oversight body, she should be punished, otherwise other HIV dissidents will follow her example.
As told in the Tyumen AIDS Center, now in the Tyumen region about 12 children with HIV do not receive medical care because of the refusal of parents.
"And this situation has already improved - during the year of the work of the special group, half of parents who categorically refused to treat children for HIV, changed their opinion - allowed to carry out diagnostics, began to take drugs," - said the spokeswoman of the AIDS Center Elena Loseva.
According to her, it is impossible to influence parents by legislative means, and as a result not all HIV-infected children can be found - mothers do not allow them to examine, hide, run away with children from hospitals.
The dangers posed by HIV dissidents
At the end of last year, St. Petersburg social scientists presented the results of Russia's first study of the so-called HIV dissident movement.
HIV dissidents are referred to as people who deny the existence of HIV and refuse to take medication.
Doctors and activists of AIDS-service NGOs call such views anti-Medical, and in their dissemination see a serious threat.
The grisly photo shoot, which ended in tragedy, took place on Thursday, August 3, at grečany railway station in Khmelnitsky.
A cheerful company of drunk young people walked a bridge over the railway tracks, where a freight train was just standing.
One of the friends had the idea to take a spectacular selfie on the roof of the car, reported "facts" in the police communication sector in the Khmelnitskaya region.
The guy started coming down from the bridge to the train, but because of his indiscretion caught on to the power line and instantly got hit by the current.
Fortunately, this case became known to the station dispatcher, who immediately called an "emergency."
Prior to the arrival of the doctors, the victim was moved to a safe place, and then hospitalized in the burn department of the Khmelnitskaya Regional Clinical Hospital.
The man was diagnosed with burns to the torso of 1-2 degrees.
His condition is now being assessed by doctors as stable.
Law enforcement officials remind that recently, extreme selfies on the roofs of high-rise buildings, bridges, moving transport have become increasingly popular.
Police are urging people to be vigilant and not allow such photo shoots, especially among children and teenagers.
Scientists have admitted the existence of the oceans on ancient Venus
The oceans could exist on ancient Venus.
This assumption was made by French scientists.
Experts have created a computer model that demonstrated the process of water formation on the surface of planets, writes Science News.
It turned out that the oceans formed on Venus at the beginning of its history, which had 10% more water than now on Earth.
Earlier "arguments of the week" wrote that, according to the hypothesis of scientists, the Ocean 4 billion years ago could exist on Mars.
Foreign experts in the course of their research concluded that the water object was located on the northern hemisphere of the Red Planet.
Three people injured in San Francisco park shooting
In San Francisco, three people were wounded in the shooting, the Associated Press reported.
The incident took place in Dolores Park, where there were a significant number of visitors.
According to witnesses, several of the men on the bridge began shouting threats.
One of them took out his weapon and started shooting at people.
The appearance of the attackers could not be considered, as they had everything but eyes closed.
Another was treated and released.

Several other visitors were injured trying to leave the premises.
The rock band Luna will present a new album in Barnaul
The concert of the rock band Luna will take place in Barnaul on October 17.
The musicians will present their new album "wonderful new world," which has become one of the most anticipated releases of the year.
The team is preparing a concept show, which will be the brightest in the band's concert history.
"Wonderful new world" is the fourth album of the Russian rock band Luna.
Its name is associated with o.huxley's famous anti-Utopia novel "about a wonderful new world."
The new songs don't recite the book, but talk about a society that lives by the law of anti-Utopia, "Blind believing propaganda and imposed values."
The band was helped to raise money for the recording of the album: more than 1,200 people supported the project on the website "Planeta.ru."
Luna released her first album, "make it Louder!" in 2010.
Two years later, the musicians presented the record "Time X," and in 2013 they recorded the album "we are Louna" (2013).
In the fall of 2015, the Louna band performed with the Symphony Orchestra in "Crocus City Hall" with the program "songs about the world."
The band includes Lucine Gevorkian (vocals), Vitaly Demidenko (bass guitar), Ruben Kazaryan (guitar), Sergey ponkratiev (guitar), Leonid kinzbursky (drums).
The concert will be held at the club "Pharaoh" on October 17 at 7 p.m.
Ticket price: from 1200 to 2,600 rubles.
Luna is one of the most popular bands on the Russian rock scene.
The group was founded in 2008.
Their debut concert took place in 2009.
The group has won several times in different categories of the hit parade "damn dozen."
Roma overcame the moat and returned to "millionaires Street"
Some of the West Midlands' most wealthy homeowners are once again at odds with the determined Roma, who overcame the moat dug out by municipal authorities to retake the field next to their homes.
Gypsies parked 20 houses on wheels in a field bordering the wealthy Solihull Street, dubbed "millionaires Street."
Bringing with them horses, babies and many houses on wheels, they returned after being driven out no further than in May, and they were not prevented by the moat dug by the municipal authorities to prevent their incursions.
This tactical company found a gap in the defensive structures and pushed its vehicles through a section that was left unfenced to leave room for the path.
Angry residents attacked the municipality of Solihull, saying it had proved "incapable of solving this problem."
An anonymous local resident said: "They came here on Monday evening, after they were driven from Bentley Heath, where they shoved stones at passers-by."
The municipality should be shamed and forced to act because they are totally incapable of solving this problem.
The Gypsies were here in May, they were driven away, and here they returned again.
Last night, even more gypsies arrived, and today, perhaps even more.
"The municipality of Birmingham knows how to solve this problem, they get long-term court orders to protect their parks," she added.
I live on Streetsbrook Road, and I don't like that I continue to pay council tax, and the municipality can't even put an end to it. "
One resident, who wished to remain anonymous, said: "It is ridiculous, we have just seen these Gypsies leave the previous time, and here, please, this attack continues."
This time there were more of them, and we even saw a horse grazing in the meadow. "
A spokesman for Solihull municipality said: "We are aware of the illegal camp on the ground near Streetsbrook Road and are cooperating with Solihull Police; we are taking the necessary legal action to drive them away as soon as possible."
In order to help us collect evidence, it is very important that as many local residents as possible report any anti-social or criminal behaviour to the police on 101.
This makes it possible to get an idea of the situation that the court will consider when we present our case to them.
Crimea corporates Champagne wine factory "new light"
Gup of the Republic of Crimea "Champagne wine factory" new light "" decided to corporatise, having transformed into JSC "Champagne wine factory" new light, "" according to the order of the Minister of Property and Land Relations of Crimea Anna anyukhin.
100% of the company's shares will remain in state ownership of Crimea.
The authorized capital of the joint-stock company will amount to 595.5 million rubles and will consist of 5.955 million ordinary shares with a nominal value of 100 rubles each.
The Ministry of Agriculture of Crimea stated that if within the next three years there are no funds for the modernization of the enterprise, there will be a threat to stop the plant.
The wear and tear of fixed assets in the enterprise is about 60-70%.
For the modernization of the enterprise it is necessary 1.2 billion rubles due to the peculiarities of the organizational and legal form it is obliged to give 50% of the profit to the Budget income.
What remains is not enough to implement the modernization plan.
"Getting money from the owner is problematic, it is difficult to talk about attracting borrowed funds of large credit institutions," deputy head of the Ministry of Agriculture of Crimea Sergey Petelin said in April this year.
The Parliament of Crimea included the enterprise in the forecast privatization plan for 2017.
It was suggested that it should be corporatised and put up for tender.
The source of "Interfax" in the authorities of Crimea estimated the possible value of the sale of the enterprise at $40 million, the investor's investment in modernization - another $30 million.
"New Light" in 2016 increased production of sparkling wines by 2.8% compared to the level of 2015 - to 1.52 million bottles.
In 2017, "New Light" intended to release 1.6 million bottles.
The company was founded in 1878 by Prince Lev Golitsyn as a factory for the production of sparkling wine in the new light acquired by him.
The plant is located on 11 hectares of land.
Nizhny Novgorod third graders defeated more than 40 gravestones
Employees of the state Department of the Ministry of Internal Affairs in Nizhny Novgorod region identified the citizens who destroyed 46 tombstones in the cemetery of the city of lyshovo.
The attackers were third-grade students.
The first statement that the graves were damaged by unknown people came to the OMVD of Russia on lyshovsky district as early as June 27.
A total of 24 people contacted the police on this occasion.
As a result, a criminal case was initiated under Article 244 of the Criminal Code, "destruction, damage or desecration of burial sites."
As a result of the investigation, the police identified the suspects, and they were two schoolchildren aged 8 and 9.
The juvenile offenders told the police that they were interested to see how the monuments were falling, which prompted them to bully.
Preventive measures have been taken with children and their parents.
Italy is tightening its tone towards NGO ships rescuing migrants.
Italy has warned NGOs that own rescue vessels in the Mediterranean that they will not be able to continue to operate unless they comply with the new rules governing their operations.
"If NGOs do not comply with the new code of conduct, it is difficult to say whether they will be able to continue their activities," Interior Minister Mario minthread said in an interview with the Turin daily newspaper Stampa.
Minthread's warning came a day after Italian authorities confiscated a ship belonging to the German humanitarian organization Jugend Rettet on suspicion that its crew was actually cooperating with traffickers and facilitating illegal immigration.
The humanitarian organization, which has worked for only a year, declined to comment on the merits of the detailed charges brought against it by Italian prosecutor ambrojo Cartosio.
"For us, saving human life is and will remain the highest priority, so we very much regret that we cannot continue to operate in the search and rescue zone now," the organization said in a statement on social networks.
"We will be able to assess all the allegations made now only after we have gathered all the information and are able to assess the situation."
The Italian authorities have been monitoring the vessel "Yuventa," owned by "Jugend Rettet," since October.
His crew is suspected of taking on board migrants who were sent directly by traffickers and allowing smugglers to leave with boats they could re-use.
At least one such meeting is believed to have taken place just 1.3 miles from the Libyan coast, according to the prosecution, the contents of which were published in the Italian media.
The crew is suspected of violating the orders of the Italian coastal authorities, who control rescue operations in the zone, out of humanitarian zeal rather than for any other reason.
The code of conduct assumes mainly that Juventa-type vessels will have an Italian police officer on board to monitor their activities.
So far, only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have agreed to obey the code: Save the Children, Malta's MOAS and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain.
The latter said on Thursday that it considered the new rules unnecessary but acceptable provided they did not cause any "meaningful changes or interference" to its rescue operations.
Among those who refused to sign is the Nobel Prize-winning organization Doctors Without Borders (MSF).
Meanwhile, minthread said a sharp decline in recent weeks in the number of migrants arriving in Italy as a result of rescue operations indicated that efforts to support the Libyan Coast Guard and co-operate with local mayors were bearing fruit.
"In recent days we have started to see the light at the end of the tunnel," the minister said.
He announced plans for further talks with Libyan mayors on economic development initiatives and with Chad, the Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving those countries in the hope of reaching Europe.
"In Libya, we do not want to be associated with either side of the conflict"
The authorities of the Russian Federation have recently significantly intensified their policy on the Libyan direction, and with visits to Moscow delegations of the opposing Libyan sides have been involved.
The head of the Russian contact group on the intra-Libyan settlement under the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation and the State Duma, assistant to the head of the Chechen Republic Lev money told Kommersant what goals Moscow pursues in this region and on whom it relies.
Almost nothing is known about the contact group on Libya that you lead.
Here, say, the contact group on Ukraine - everyone knows about it.
And here is the veil of secrecy.
What exactly are you doing, what are your goals?
The contact group was established at the initiative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation and the State Duma.
Its activities are supervised by Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Bogdanov and Adam Delimkhanov (deputy of the Duma from Chechnya).
The latter is authorized to work in the Libyan direction by the speaker of the State Duma Vyacheslav Volodin.
The reason for the formation of the group was the detention in Libya of the Russian tanker "mechanic Chebotarev" (in September 2015, there were 11 people on board. - "Kommersant").
We thought about how to help the crew.
Then a contact group of military specialists, representatives of the State Duma was created, our work was supported by the head of Chechnya Ramzan Kadyrov.
And how did it turn out that it was you who led it?
Since I have been working on Libya since 2008, I have been asked to lead the group.
Our activities were not limited to the release of sailors from the "mechanics of Chebotarev."
We have been able to establish contacts with representatives of all the major factions opposing each other in the Libyan conflict - both from Tripoli (where the UN-recognized government, led by Faiz Saraj, is based) and Tobruk (the seat of Parliament, which opposes the government and supports Marshal Khalifa Haftar, who controls eastern Libya).
Thanks to the active participation of Ahmed Metiga (Deputy Prime Minister of Libya - "Kommersant"), we managed to quickly negotiate the release of Russian sailors.
Then it was decided to make better use of these contacts, to create a contact group.
Its task is to analyze the situation, identify key factors and players, and engage in dialogue with all parties to the conflict.
I would like to emphasize that in Libya we do not want to be associated with any of the parties to the conflict, we have a dialogue with everyone.
How many people are in the contact group and how many of them are permanently in Libya?
The contact group now has five members.
Among them are people with experience in the security forces, including the Ministry of Defense.
We also want to join the team of specialists on the region, representatives of the Institute of the middle east of the Russian Academy of Sciences.
No one is permanently in Libya from our staff, there is no need for it yet.
Are there any Russian military advisers, instructors in Libya now.
And if so, on whose side?
There are no Russian military specialists in Libya.
All the talk and publication about this is not true.
But your contact group includes the former military...
Yes, and their presence is necessary.
For example, when we visit hot spots.
Or cities closed to a certain point for us, such as Misurata (where the militias, which played a role in the overthrow of Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi in 2011 and increased markedly in the following years, are based).
We came to Misurata in January of this year.
We were frightened, they said that there were all Islamists, terrorists.
But it was important for us to assess the situation there, to analyze the real military potential, who is responsible for what, why there are such rumors, what is the real role of Islamists there.
In Misurata, we met with all the representatives of the units that were engaged in the destruction of Isis in Sirte (in December 2016, this city on the Mediterranean coast was recaptured from the militants of the banned Islamic State in Russia - Kommersant).
We wanted to look at them, to get to know these people, to check the information that they were the ones who played a crucial role in the destruction of ISIS in Libya, not Khalifa Haftar, who attributed these services to himself.
And what conclusion have you reached?
The Islamic State in Libya won not Haftar?
It wasn't him who was doing it.
Haftar conducted operations on another front, in Benghazi.
And Isis in Sirte was fought by structures subordinate to the government in Tripoli.
And, by the way, we invited the people who carried out this anti-terrorist operation to Russia.
And they arrived - the visit lasted from 19 to 23 April this year, the Libyan delegation received in the Federation Council, in the Duma, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Federal Guard.
You, as we have understood, are in all Libyan regions and probably imagine the sentiments of local elites and warlords.
Do you think it will be possible to implement the ceasefire agreements, the elections reached in late July in Paris by Khalifa Haftar and Faiz Saraj?
Or again, as has happened repeatedly in the past, the agreements will be broken, the fighting will resume, the parties will try to seize power alone?
For us a good signal was already the fact that Saraj and Haftar agreed to another meeting, not so long ago it was impossible.
In the recent past, the two leaders have been extremely negative about each other.
And as for Russia's position...
It is often written and said that Moscow actively supports Haftar, many believe in it.
We faced this situation when we were in Misurata, and Haftar was on board the Russian aircraft carrier Admiral Kuznetsov on that day.
It was a coincidence.
But in Misurata, they didn't believe in coincidence.
We were told, "You are probably very brave people, that you came to us today."
But our task is just to show: we do not support Haftar alone, we are engaged in dialogue with all the key actors in the conflict in Libya.
You and Haftar communicated.
Does mutual understanding with Russian partners at the human, emotional level facilitate the fact that he studied twice in the USSR?
And, by the way, does Haftar know Russian?
If he knows Russian, he is very relative.
But the fact that he studied with us, of course, facilitates dialogue with him.
And by the way not only with him.
When we communicate with the military in Tripoli and Misurata, we meet generals who studied either in Russia or back in the Soviet Union.
And here they speak fine Russian.
And they are drawn to Russia, to some extent they feel nostalgic for it.
Do we think that an early lifting of the arms embargo imposed on Libya is likely?
Are your Libyan interlocutors interested in the supply of Russian weapons?
We are interested, of course, but as I said, we do not take sides in this conflict and would not want to arm some to the detriment of others.
We would like everyone to be in roughly equal positions.
With regard to the arms embargo, there are constant calls from Libyans for Russia to help lift it.
The process of drafting a constitution is now well under way in Libya.
We hope that the parties will reach compromise solutions and achieve internal consensus.
Then there should be an election, which was also mentioned at the Saraj and Haftar meeting.
If elections take place and legitimate power is finally elected (and now neither side has such status), it is possible to raise the issue of lifting the arms embargo in the UN Security Council.
Raising this issue now is pointless and dangerous, it will only lead to an escalation of the conflict.
The other day, the media reported that Italy, faced with the problem of African refugees sailing from Libya, feels abandoned by EU allies.
Can Moscow, in this situation, help Italian partners by using its ties with the Libyans?
How realistic, for example, is the option that Haftar's units will establish control of the coast and put an end to the business of smugglers smuggling immigrants to Europe?
A very timely question.
We are actively working on it.
The Italians need Russia's support because Moscow is engaged in dialogue at the same time with Haftar, Saraj, Misurata and the south of the country.
And on this issue, tribes in southern Libya play a big role, and they are ready to cooperate with Russia.
Is it a question of Southerners stopping the flow of migrants on long-distance approaches?
That is, to put it mildly, the buses in which Nigerian migrants go back?
We are trying to achieve that.
But it's not easy.
Some clans and groups have a vested interest in keeping these flows going.
We hope to help unite Southerners in the negotiation process between Saraj, Haftar and tribes in the south.
But for a start, we would like to see a unity of opinion on this issue between Haftar and Saraj.
The head of the government in Tripoli, Faiz Saraj, is considered an Islamist, a supporter of the introduction of sharia law in the country.
To what extent does he hold radical views?
Wouldn't that be an obstacle in building relations with Russia or the West?
I will give my personal opinion of him.
In my opinion, he is, on the contrary, an opponent of radical Islam.
But the Islamists are in his coalition.
Yes, but he himself holds the position that Libya should be an absolutely normal country - moderately Islamic, open to the world.
And he is also actively fighting terrorists.
Where, then, does he have such a reputation?
It is created by those countries that have no interest in Russia communicating with Tripoli.
Tripoli is, after all, the capital, where the legislative, executive and judicial branches are located.
There's the National Petroleum Corporation, the national bank and other government entities.
Of course, some countries were interested in us not going there.
And we mixed all the cards with them and began to actively communicate with both Tripoli and Tobruk.
And we are already reaping the benefits of this work: Rosneft has concluded a cooperation agreement with Libya's state oil company, the NOC.
The director of the NOC, Mustafa Sanalla, with whom the head of Rosneft, Igor Sechin, made a deal, himself directly from Tripoli.
And two weeks ago there was the first shipment of Libyan oil to Rosneft.
What will Russia do with it?
I believe that to resell.
And what are Russia's economic interests in Libya?
There are plans to re-sign the contracts concluded under Muammar Gaddafi.
These include previous arrangements in the transport sector (railway construction), energy (electrification) and a number of others.
And the Libyans have something to pay?
Well, they have oil.
That is to say, as in the case of Iran, is the oil-for-services scheme?
I don't know what the scheme will be, I don't deal directly with these issues.
In fact, the economy is for Russia in Libya and not the main thing.
We are, in fact, engaged in peacekeeping work there.
For us, the main thing is to stop the bloodshed, to help the Libyans agree among themselves so that they can establish order and Libya will cease to be an enabling environment for the development of terrorism.
For Russia, this is the main task - to help the Libyan people and squeeze the terrorists out of there.
Do you have data on the presence in Libya (now or earlier) of radical fighters from Russia or other countries of the former USSR?
One of the tasks of our contact group was to clarify this.
I met with a representative of the Libyan state Security committee, who said that to date, not a single person from Russia and other countries of the former USSR is there.
He said he had about 50,000 telephone records of representatives of Islamist and radical groups (in Libya) and did not speak Russian there.
And from which states are these fighters then?
I would not want to go into these details.
Then let's formulate the question differently.
How many of the Islamist fighters in Libya are Libyans themselves?
There are virtually no Libyans among them, no more than 5% of them.
The rest are strangers.
Can Moscow hold intra-Libyan talks following the example of Paris?
There are such plans.
We are actively negotiating with the Libyans, several delegations from Libya have already visited Moscow, and have declared their readiness to come to Moscow or Grozny.
And when can such negotiations take place?
Now it is hard to say.
Several visits have yet to take place, and then, I hope, there will be clarity about the time and place of the negotiations.
At the Chekhov Museum, philanthropists raised money for an expensive gift to a sick boy
In the museum-reserve "Melihovo" near Moscow, nine-year-old boy Sasha Matzola, who has DTP, hydrocephaly of the brain and complete blindness, will receive a specialized treadmill as a gift on August 5.
The Minister of Culture of the Moscow region Oksana Kosareva and the director of the museum Konstantin Bobkov will present a useful pretender to Sasha.
The money for the trainer was collected during the charity marathon "don't be tired of doing good," which was held in Melihov on July 15 on the Memorial Day of Chekhov.
On the eve of the marathon, the museum received a letter from Sasha, who lives in the village of manushkino, Chekhov District: "I don't see eyes at all, so I asked my mother to write this letter."
"I would really like to get a treadmill as a gift to get my feet strong, and I would learn to walk a little bit."
And here's a dream come true!
After the presentation in the museum-reserve there will be a "concert-Postscript" - the famous pianist, Honored Artist of Russia Alexander ginden will perform a parrot from popular classical works.
During the charity marathon in Melihov the choir of the Ascension Davydov desert, Zvonari workshop Ilya drozdikhin, students of the Moscow Conservatory named after P.I. Tchaikovsky and the Russian Academy named after Gnesin, artists of the Melihov Theater "Chekhov Studio" performed.
There were auctions for visitors, a book fair and a charity sale of souvenir products with a marathon logo.
The museum-reserve "Melihovo" took the initiative to make the Day of Memory of Chekhov on July 15 a single day of charity in all the Museum of Moscow Region.
A 30-year-old resident of Olevsk, Zhitomir region, near the local football stadium, shot several times towards the teenagers who were there.
According to the suspect, he was angered by the noise, reported "facts" in the communications department of the police of Zhitomir region.
The man then went to a cafe nearby.
In the building, he had a conflict in which a man used a device to fire rubber bullets, injuring one of the visitors.
The 34-year-old victim received the necessary medical treatment, and there is no threat to his life.
Police and an ambulance arrived at the scene, but the shooter had fled by that time.
Law enforcement officers identified him and detained him on the same day, August 2.
The man could not explain his actions.
He seized a device for firing rubber bullets, which was sent for examination.
Criminal proceedings have been initiated under Article 296 (hooliganism) of the Criminal Code.
The detainee faces prison terms ranging from 3 to 7 years.
Recall, in Kiev on lukyanovka in the area of Tatar Street on the night of July 28 there was an attack with shooting.
Michelle Carter's conviction for reports that prompted Conrad Roy's suicide
A Massachusetts woman was sentenced to two-and-a-half years in prison for encouraging her boyfriend Conrad Roy to commit suicide through text messages and phone calls.
Michelle Carter, now 20, will have to serve 15 months of her sentence behind bars and another 5 years of probation.
Carter was found guilty in June of the manslaughter of Conrad Roy, who committed suicide on July 13, 2014.
Roy's father told the hearing on Thursday: "My family has been killed by grief.
My son was my best friend. "
Carter was allowed to remain free pending appeal.
She faced a maximum sentence of 20 years, but her lawyers said both she and Roy suffered from mental disorders.
Carter, dressed in red trousers and a cream blouse, listened to the verdict standing, holding her hands down and lowering her eyes.
"By her actions, she killed Conrad Roy," the prosecutor told the court.
"She interrupted his life to improve her own.
She did not acknowledge responsibility, "she said.
"She has shown no remorse."
But Carter's lawyer said it was a "tragic case that she deeply regrets."
However, Judge Lawrence Monis said he believed her "age, maturity level or even mental illness did not affect her actions in a noticeable way."
The prosecutor read statements from Roy's mother, Lynn Roy, saying: "Not a single day has passed when I would not mourn the loss of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and how I cope - I try to support his sisters despite all the pain that will remain with us forever, "it says.
Roy's sister, Kamdin Roy, said she was haunted by the idea that she would never be able to attend his wedding or become his children's aunt.
"To lose a person who has always been with me since my birth is a pain that will stay with me for the rest of my life," she said.
The case is likely to set a legal precedent because Massachusetts does not have a law that provides for the responsibility of advising a person to commit suicide.
In 2014, when Roy was found dead in a car with symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning, Carter was 17.
The case caught the attention of the entire country when it was reported that he had been prompted to commit suicide by Carter's message.
"You can hang yourself, jump from the roof, stab yourself don't know there are many ways," she wrote in several messages sent two weeks before his death as he rested with his family.
Moments before her suicide, she wrote, "you have to do this, Conrad" and "You only have to turn on the ignition, and you will become free and happy."
Judge Monis said Carter wanted to get attention through Roy's death, and banned her from communicating with the press to prevent her from getting what she wanted.
The opinions of the lawyers on this matter are divided.
One of the few who defended Carter was Amanda Knox, who was convicted in 2007 of murdering her British apartment neighbor in Italy and acquitted two years later.
Knox, 30, published her dissenting opinion in the Los Angeles Times, which claimed: "Michelle Carter deserves sympathy and help, not prison."
Evgeny Bogachev: "I let Langford go like a high-flying bird"
One of VTB United League's top basketball players, Keith Langford, 33, left the Unix.
The departure of the American defender "Izvestia" was commented by the President of the Unix Evgeny Bogachev.
Keith made this decision for family reasons, - Evgeny Bogachev told.
He has a small child, a wife, who did not want to move to Kazan.
Keith wants to be closer to home.
I decided to meet him.
Of course, I could say no and extend his contract, but he deserved a different attitude.
He played three seasons in the Unix and in each match showed a high level, laid out for all 100%.
So I let him go like a high-flying bird.
We thanked him.
We wish him success in his family life and playing career.
Keith Langford played three years at the Kazan club, winning the silver of the United League-2015 / 16.
In the 2016 / 17 season he received the Award of the most productive player of the Euroleague season.
He scored 21.75 points on average per match.
This result is the second since 2004, when the award was established.
Langford, who won the award also in 2014, became the second player in Euroleague history to receive the prize more than once.
In the near future Langford will sign a contract with China's Shenzhen, informs Eurohoops.
The American is expected to enter into a 2-year, $5 million contract.
Langford will become the second Euroleague star in July to move into the Chinese Championship.
Earlier, the ex-Center "Panatinaikos" Yannis burusis moved to China's CBA.
Sunburned tourist from Moscow region evacuated by helicopter in Adygeya
Adygei rescuers today by helicopter evacuated from the mountainous region of the Republic of Moscow a tourist who received the worst sunburn.
The man was resting at the Fisht shelter, located at an altitude of 1.6 thousand meters.
The 27-year-old tourist had increased pressure as well as difficulty breathing.
The preliminary diagnosis is a serious allergic reaction.
The rescuers were approached by the head of the tour group, who said that the man suffered burns in the hike.
"Audi" to modify up to 850,000 diesel cars
A day before the announcement by Audi, BMW said it would offer to upgrade the software in more than 350,000 vehicles.
The chairman of BMW said the company believes "there are more intelligent ways than driving restrictions," referring to European cities - including Munich, where BMW is located - that have considered banning or restricting the use of diesel cars.
Daimler said on Thursday it was modifying three million Mercedes cars in Europe to reduce their diesel exhaust.
None of the companies called their move a recall.
European automakers have actively promoted the use of diesel cars in Europe and the United States to promote compliance with regulations on carbon dioxide emissions.
But nitrogen oxides, which emit diesel engines, are considered carcinogens and can cause asthma.
The cost to automakers of installing equipment that neutralizes the exhaust gases of diesel cars is also rising, and it is becoming difficult to maintain a competitive price for cars.
With German automakers under scrutiny, Chancellor Angela Merkel's government has also been accused of pandering to powerful automakers and ignoring signs of a problem.
Companies try not to repeat the mistakes of Volkswagen, which concealed the use of so-called "defeat devices," which during testing could tweak the amount of harmful gases emitted to comply with the rules, and in the conditions of normal driving shut down.
Several Volkswagen executives have been convicted in the United States, while the rest are under investigation on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, a former head of thermodynamics as part of the Audi engine development group was arrested in Germany.
The former manager, zakkeo Giovanni Pamio, an Italian, is therefore not protected from extradition and could face trial in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi came under a German criminal investigation involving Volkswagen after authorities accused Audi of installing a system to circumvent European ejection rules and expanded an investigation that had previously focused on the United States.
The inclusion of "audi" in the investigation could create serious problems for Volkswagen: the manufacturer of luxury cars is the source of a disproportionate share of Volkswagen's income.
In Astrakhan, a visitor to the cafe paid with fake money
The police received a report from the employee of the branch of the bank about the discovery of a suspicious bill with a value of 5 thousand rubles when the money received from the point of catering was converted.
A study conducted at the Forensic Centre found that it was false.
According to the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia in Astrakhan region, the note was paid by one of the visitors of the cafe, who bought shaurma.
It is worth noting that the box office was not equipped with a device to determine the authenticity of bills.
Currently, police officers are installing persons involved in the manufacture and sale of a known fake ticket of the Central Bank of the Russian Federation.
Such crimes are punishable by imprisonment for up to 8 years with a fine of up to 1 million rubles.
The Regional Directorate of the Ministry of Internal Affairs encourages residents of Astrakhan region to be attentive in financial transactions; employees of trading facilities are advised to install devices to verify the authenticity of the money received.
Astronomers have found a "hellish" planet on which even iron can melt
For the first time, having studied the stratosphere properties of a giant exoplanet called WASP-121b, astrophysicists were quite surprised by its temperature, which is able to evaporate iron and other metals.
Experts noted that water molecules are so heated by the light of the star that they emit infrared radiation.
The Hubble Telescope captured the glow of water molecules on this gas giant: this high temperature causes water in the planet's atmosphere to shine in the infrared range.
WASP-121b refers to the so-called "hot Jupiter" - gas giants, in size and mass comparable to the largest planet of the solar system, but located dozens of times closer to the parent star.
Because of this, a year on the exoplanet lasts only 1.3 "Earth" days, "and its gas shell is heated to almost 2,500 degrees Celsius.
Climate change threatens Lavender in Provence.
It has become a symbol of Provence and southern France, but there are now fears that it is threatened by climate change.
Lavender has grown worse due to arid weather and disease-carrying insects; this has caused constant headaches for scientists and farmers who are struggling to find a solution.
Eric shes, an expert at the Provence-based CRIEPPAM Agricultural Research Institute, says: "Lavender in Provence is indeed under threat because in recent years this plant has been feeling the effects of climate change: there has been much less rain in the spring and especially in the autumn.
This affects lavender's lifespan.
And there are still small cicades jumping on the leaves of insects carrying micro-bacteria; in very dry weather, there are a lot of them. "
There is a lot at stake.
Lavender not only attracts holiday makers; lavender oil is very much in demand in perfume and cosmetics.
Eric shes says: "Instead of very long ears with a large number of large flowers, we have small, underdeveloped, weakened or absent at all.
That's why we have fewer parts containing essential oil. "
Solutions currently under consideration include improving water distribution and slowing evaporation from the soil, as well as spraying plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and developing more drought-resistant varieties.
The Ambassador of the Winter Universiade-2019 met with Krasnoyarsk schoolchildren
The two-time world champion in hockey, the ambassador of the winter University Games-2019 Alexander Semin met the day before with the beginning hockey players and handed out autographs to fans.
The meeting took place in the tent of the Winter Universiade-2019 within the thematic week devoted to ice hockey.
Any visitor to the tent could ride skates on the site with artificial ice.
In addition, relay races, quizzes and games with the drawing of souvenir products of student games, warm-up from the Aerobics Federation were organized.
The event was attended by 50 schoolchildren.
Alexander Semin advised children to be engaged as much as possible on sports grounds and stressed that the most important in the initial stage of training - hard work and huge desire to be engaged in hockey.
"It is great that in Krasnoyarsk there is such a platform as a tent of the winter University Games-2019 where beginning athletes can directly ask questions to trainers of teams," - the champion said.
It should be noted that the ambassadors of the Winter Universiade-2019 help to promote student sports and healthy lifestyle among Krasnoyarsk citizens.
The tent of the University Games will work throughout the summer season until September 25, the press service of the Directorate of the Winter Universiade-2019 reports.
The State Department commented on Medvedev's words
U.S. State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert, commenting on Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev at the briefing, said it was necessary to find "areas for interaction" with Russia.
She said such areas should be found to "improve bilateral engagement."
Nauert cited the armistice agreement on Syria as an example of such successful cooperation.
We are two nuclear superpowers.
"And people around the world agree that the United States and Russia should be able to work with each other," the diplomat said.
Nauert, however, declined to comment on Medvedev's claim of a full-fledged trade war between Russia and the United States.
"If Russia said such a thing, it certainly has the right to speak, but I can't say anything more on this subject," a State Department spokeswoman said.
Earlier, US President Donald Trump signed a bill to tighten sanctions against the Russian Federation.
Commenting on the new package of sanctions, Russian Prime Minister Medvedev said that Washington has declared Moscow a full-fledged trade war, putting an end to the hope of improving bilateral relations.
Medvedev also said U.S. sanctions would be in place for decades.
In addition, according to the Prime Minister, the American establishment "clean beat" Trump.
Bodybuilder who disappeared in Moscow region found in someone else's cottage lost memory
Bodybuilder Shamil khanmetov disappeared on the road to Noginsk on July 25 under very picky circumstances: he left the Salon of the car to go to the toilet.
For seven days, he was searched unsuccessfully by acquaintances and locals.
And Shamil was found in a foreign cottage in Ramensky.
He was found completely naked in his toilet by the owner.
The Dagestan athlete couldn't explain how appeared here and what happened to it.
He couldn't even remember what his name was and his passport was gone.
The announcement of his disappearance helped to identify him.
The doctors who arrived on the call recorded hanmetov's partial memory loss and brain injury, according to public Mash.
Probably, the athlete is waiting for other surprises.
The attackers who abducted Shamil probably had already visited his apartment, the keys to which were also stolen from him.
Oil and gas revenues of July exceeded forecast by 7.4 billion rubles
In fact, the oil and gas revenues received at the end of July 2017 exceeded the estimate by 7.4 billion rubles, according to the Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation.
The excess, as explained by the agency, was mainly due to the higher exchange rate of the United States dollar to the ruble compared to the monthly average of June used for the valuation, as well as to the excess of actual gas production and exports of petroleum products projected levels.
"The deviation of oil and gas revenues of the federal budget from the monthly estimate, consistent with the federal law on the federal budget for 2017-2019, in August 2017 is projected at + 40.2 billion rubles," the Ministry of Finance said.
Thus, the total amount of funds allocated for the purchase of foreign currency on the domestic currency market in the period from August 7 to September 6, 2017 is 47.6 billion rubles.
Accordingly, the daily volume of foreign currency purchases will amount to the equivalent of 2.07 billion rubles.
The Bank of Russia will be involved in the purchase of foreign currency by the Ministry of Finance of Russia.
Every working day during the specified period, the central bank will conclude foreign currency purchase deals at the organized trades of the Moscow Exchange evenly during the trading day.
The acquired foreign currency will be credited to the Federal Treasury accounts at the central bank.
The murder of a journalist underscores that it is becoming increasingly dangerous in Mexico.
Employees of the weekly newspaper riodos usually meet Wednesday to discuss plans to cover the latest violent crimes in Sinaloa state involving organized crime, corrupt officials or the ongoing war of drug traffickers.
But today, depressed by their own tragedy, they met to talk about security.
They were told they had to change their habits.
Two senior journalists discussed what seemed safer: taking children with them to an office where a grenade had already been thrown in 2009, or leaving them at home.
Security experts wrote three words on the board hanging in the room: enemies, neutral people, allies.
They asked journalists to give names for each column - the evidence is unnecessary, suspicions and internal feelings will be enough.
They are drug traffickers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected of being held by the government or cartels, a whole list of underlings that makes the work of covering the chaos in Mexico dangerous.
There is no respite from the violence, and there are more and more journalists among the corpses that are multiplying in the country: according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists, at least 25 since President Enrico Pena Nieto took office in December 2012; 589 people are under federal protection after attacks and threats; and this year, at least seven people have died in seven states.
Among the latter are their publisher and mastermind, the co-founder of riodos, Javier Valdés Cardenas.
"The biggest mistake is living in Mexico and being a journalist," Valdes wrote in one of his many books on violent drug-related crimes.
His absence is felt very acutely, though his presence is ubiquitous - a large photograph of Valdes showing his middle finger, with the inscription "justice" hanging on the facade of the riodos building; two reporters in 30 years, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear T-shirts showing his smile, face in glasses or his trademark Panama.
The seminar takes place less than two months after his death; journalists discuss their common trauma, their nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.
Although the office of the special federal prosecutor was set up in 2010 to investigate journalistic cases, only two cases have been investigated so far, according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists.
As with most of the thousands of murders each year involving drug trafficking and organized crime, the killers of journalists are rarely brought to justice.
Riodos journalists insist that they will write about the violence in Sinaloa, although they are killed by grief, although it is now much more dangerous around.
Without information about the killers, without justice, there is little benefit from talking about security in meetings, "says Ibarra.
"It's very stupid to waste time at this seminar," he says.
"Until we know the cause, we suspect everyone."
On the morning of May 15, Valdes left the riodos office in the state capital of kouliacán.
He managed to drive only a couple of blocks before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men; he was pulled from the car and shot 12 times, probably because of the name of the newspaper - which means "Twelfth River."
The gunman drove away in his car and smashed it nearby.
Valdes was 50 years old.
He has a wife and two adult children.
The rumors usually diverge quickly on kouliakan.
But almost everyone is silent about Valdes.
Since Guzman was arrested and extradited to the United States last January, Sinaloa has become one of the country's bloodiest battlegrounds as rival factions struggle to fill the resulting vacuum.
Let's not say that one or more people are killed every day on the streets of Sinaloa, or that the cemetery is filled with the decorated two-story Mausoleum of drug kings, which are larger than the homes of many living people.
Let's forget for a minute that the state of "calm" is simply when one of the cartels takes control of a seaside state with important ports and drug trafficking routes leading to the United States.
Despite this and the fact that Valdes was well aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail bohorkes, the 60-year-old Co-founder and director of riodos, is crushed by a sense of guilt for failing to protect a friend.
He thinks that the murder was helped by two mistakes.
First, an interview was published in February with Damascus Lopez, the leader of one of the rival factions of the cartel, which is fighting Guzman's sons.
The publication could have angered the sons; people believed to be gang members bought all copies of the publication as soon as they were taken to the kiosks.
The second mistake was that he did not force Valdes, for his own safety, to leave the country after another newspaper that wrote about the same story was captured.
Valdes was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his murder was seen as another milestone in the development of violence against journalists in Mexico.
He had been walking away from danger for so long, his friends and colleagues thought he would always be.
He was an experienced reporter at Noroeste and, in 2003, co-founded riodos with five colleagues, selling his $50 stock.
In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to do journalism without touching on the subject of drugs," bohorkes said.
Over time, the newspaper has earned a reputation as a bold and honest publication, with sales and advertising revenues rising.
Journalists liked that they could publish bold reports without fear of censorship, and readers were attracted that in this edition they could read about what no one else dared to write about.
Eight years after its founding, riodos won the prestigious Maria Moors Cabo award for her work as a reporter in Latin America.
That same year, Valdes won the International Press Freedom Award for his courage in investigating drug trafficking in Mexico, wherever it leads.
He openly admitted that he was scared.
"I want to live on," he said at the CPJ award.
Drug trafficking in Sinaloa is "a way of life," he said last October in an interview with Rompeviento TV.
"You have to accept the tasks that fall on you as a journalist - either so, or you just roll a fool."
I don't want to be asked, "what did you do when there were so many deaths around... why didn't you say what was going on?"
The staff of "riodos" Miss Valdes, a prankster who swore like a trucker in a port, to a friend generous on hugs and tips, to a teacher who knew how to keep alive.
They relied on his order.
He had to always wear his hat.
He had to go to "El Guayabo," a bar opposite the office, and always sit there at the same table.
Now they ask: has he been destroyed by the love of the once-established order?
His death also led them to question their calculations of how best to do their jobs and stay alive.
"They don't like it when you understand their wives, children, their legal business and clandestine airfields to transport drugs.
"These things were behind the line," bohorkes said.
The result, even in the best of times, was a high level of self-censorship and a desire for self-preservation.
You have to believe your instincts.
Stay away from what smells bad.
The problem, says the editor of riodos, Andres Villareal, is that "the smell can be fooled... and then what happened to Javier happens."
The old rules, he and others say, no longer apply in Sinaloa - as they do in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero, and other states where there is a poisonous mix of lucrative smuggling routes, weak state institutions, and corrupt officials.
The landscape is constantly changing.
In the room where employees of "riodos" gathered for security training, suddenly it was forbidden to enter cell phones: a few days before it became known that spy programs, which are sold exclusively to governments, are used in Mexico for surveillance of journalists and social activists.
Outside, two police officers shelter in the shade of a tree from 104-degree heat (40 degrees Celsius).
They were tasked by the state government to guard the riodos Office, which is located in a four-storey building in the bourgeois quarter of kouliakana.
Some journalists asked half-heartedly whether these police officers were part of the 50 per cent of the police officers about whom the governor himself had said they could not be trusted.
A few months ago, journalists went to a mountainous area that is de facto under the control of gangs of drug traffickers.
In the next issue "riodos" counted on three main themes.
This is the murder in Sinaloa of the brother of former boxing champion Julio Cesar Chavez.
They also had the exposure of government spending concentrated in the governor's hometown.
And there was a group kidnapping at one of the most expensive restaurants in kouliakana, a block from the prosecutor's office.
It was not officially announced who was kidnapped or how it happened, so one had to be careful when it came time to write about what everyone in the city knew: that it was a favorite restaurant at the same time drug dealers and authorities.
One of their journalists learned from open databases that the restaurant was registered in the name of a politician belonging to the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), which has dominated all levels of government for almost the past century.
Recently, there have been high-profile corruption charges against several PRI governors.
Villareal asked journalists to write about previous incidents at this restaurant, including when Guzman's son "El Chapo" eluded the military's raid.
Until a few months ago, readers would have been looking for Valdes's column with the most reliable information about the kidnapping.
"We would have known what happened before," says Villareal, 46, for his thin physique, nicknamed "El Flaco."
"Today, all channels of communication with our sources have been severed."
Valdes's office is now used as a warehouse for posters and stickers protesting against the killings of journalists, because employees have become what they never thought they would become: activists speaking on behalf of the press.
Journalist Miriam Ramirez took several posters and went to a demonstration at the local prosecutor's office the next morning, dedicated to another journalist.
Salvador Adame disappeared in Michoacán state in the west of the country three days after Valdés was killed.
They found the burned body, and the authorities said it was him, based on DNA tests.
Across the country, journalists began to speak out louder, organize protests and write "SOS Press" on sidewalks and house walls.
On that day, the director of bohorkes was in Washington seeking international support for justice in the Valdes case.
In a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa the day after Valdez's murder, Ramirez accused the authorities of spying on journalists and ordering their killings for telling the truth.
She then asked that she not be given more tasks to cover the Government's activities, fearing that anger would damage her objectivity.
Valdés has said many times that journalists in Mexico are "surrounded" by organized crime, its accomplices in the government and indifferent society.
In his latest book, narco-journalism, he wrote that reporters are not just killed by gangs of drug traffickers; they do so under orders from politicians and security services in collusion with organized crime.
The press Protection Committee, Article 19, believes that half of the attacks on journalists last year were carried out at the behest of police and government officials.
"In Mexico, you die because they want to shut you up," Ramirez says.
Of course, murders terrify people.
Everyone remembers the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Masias six years ago in the northern border state of Tamaulipas.
A note was found on her body, presumably written on behalf of the Zetas cartel: "I'm here because of my articles."
A computer keyboard and headphones lay next to her severed head.
Some publications chose to close like the El Norte newspaper in the northern border state of Chihuahua after its correspondent, Miroslav Brice, was killed in March.
Others continue to hang on like "El Manjana" from Nuevo Laredo after the murder of its leader in 2004.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juárez publicly addressed the drug cartels through an editorial on the front page entitled "what do you want from us?"
Some journalists have left their home states or the country in general.
This is a painful decision.
In exile, it is difficult to find work, and they continue to look out for danger in the streets.
And sometimes they are killed, as apparently happened with photographer Ruben Espinoza, who was killed in 2015 along with four women in an apartment in Mexico three months after fleeing Veracruz.
Those who remain and continue to work balance between risky decisions on a daily basis.
Ibarra - who once dreamed of being a poet - admits he is scared to write about the drug trade.
"Mexico is rolling to hell, and that's why I became a journalist," he says.
Last Friday, at midnight, when the last issue was already ready for print, the publishers of "riodos" sat on the sidewalk next to the office and drank beer when suddenly their phones rang at the same time.
A series of shootings between rival gangs and security forces near the resort town of masatlan left behind 19 dead bodies, according to confirmed reports.
The war continued to unravel, as promised in a series of messages from cartels discovered in the area.
Sitting on the sidewalk, they posted the news via a mobile phone to the riodos website.
The next day it was necessary to remake the first page.
Sirens were raised nearby, another exchange of fire in the vicinity.
Bohorquez looked at whether the police guarding them were ready for defense.
If they were frightened, they didn't show it in any way.
Sitting under a huge portrait of the deceased founder of their newspaper, whose middle finger was on display for the whole of Sinaloa, the employees of "riodos" continued his business.
"How can you think about closing down," bohorkes said, "if on the very day Javier was killed, the intern asked me to send her outside to do a report?"
The dinosaur used camouflage to avoid enemies
At first glance, it seems like a statue, albeit one of horror.
The researchers said that the first found remains of an incredible rhino-sized creature discovered by a Canadian miner survived so well that experts called it "Mona Lisa among dinosaurs."
It was so well preserved that they were even able to determine that the color of his scaly skin was reddish brown - and to say that he had, in some ways, a "dark past."
The report, published in the journal modern biology, described it as "the most well-preserved of tyretraffic in the history of finds and one of the best copies of a dinosaur in the world."
This fossil is a newly found instance of Nodosaurus, which lived in the middle of the Cretaceous period, between 110 million and 112 million years ago.
His incredible good condition stunned researchers, who call him "really wonderful."
This herbivorous tyretraffic is the most well-preserved fossil of its kind in the history of the finds, according to articles in the journal National Geographic.
He was found by Sean funk while he was working at the SanCor Millennium Mine near Fort Mac Murray in northern Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011.
He came across something that seemed to be different from the surrounding rock, and decided to look more closely.
The fossil he discovered was sent to the Royal tyrrellov Paleontological Museum.
For the next six years, work was carried out to detect the animal inside the earthen clay with a mass of 2,500 feet (1,100 kilograms).
Now that all this hard work has been done, the finished result can be demonstrated.
"It's only worth a little squeak, and you can practically believe that he's sleeping," said lead author Caleb Brown, a researcher at the Royal tyrrellov Paleontological Museum, where the creation is being demonstrated.
"He will enter the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved copies of dinosaurs - Mona Lisa among dinosaurs."
Studying his skin, the researchers found that it was herbivorous, despite the fact that it was covered with pancyre and resembled a walking tank, apparently exposed to significant danger from carnivorous dinosaurs.
This powerful Panzer-covered dinosaur used red-and-white camouflage to hide from predators, and used a protective technique known as protective colouring, which is also used by many animals of our day.
This would allow him to merge more quickly with the environment and avoid meeting enemies, experts say, suggesting that he was hunted by larger dinosaurs.
This 110 million-year-old creature, which belongs to the Nodosaurus family, was widely covered in print in May, and is now on display at the Royal tyrrellov Paleontological Museum.
Scientists have already studied the animal and given it the name Borealopelta markmitchelli in honor of museum laboratory technician Mark Mitchell, one of the members of the group who spent more than 7,000 hours behind its painstaking excavation.
The amazing preservation of the copy allowed Dr. Mitchell and an international group of scientists to document the drawing and shape of scales and Panhandle plates on his body.
They found a protective color, a common method of protection in the animal kingdom, which means that the top of the creature was darker than its underside.
Although protective colouring is well spread, the discovery came as a surprise because the size of the Borealopelta dinosaur far exceeds the size of the currently living animals with protective colouring.
It can be assumed that this dinosaur was so actively hunted by carnivorous dinosaurs that evolution preferred the disguise of confrontation as a way of survival.
But most modern animals with protective colours - such as deer, zebras or battleships - are much smaller and more accessible prey, indicating that Nodosaurus had to fight hard for survival.
"The serious threat from predators to a massive, powerful dinosaur pancyrem shows how dangerous the predatory dinosaurs of the Cretaceous period were," Brown said.
Chemical analysis of organic compounds in the dinosaur scales also suggests that its skin should have been reddish brown.
Scientists continue to study the animal, seeking information about its life, including the preserved contents of its digestive tract, to find out what it ate during its last meal.
They believe that when the dinosaur died, it fell into the river and was taken to the sea, where it sank and its back down to the bottom of the ocean.
In those days, Alberta was as warm as it is now in southern Florida, and rivers and oceans were likely to spread much further inland than they are now.
"This Nodosaurus is truly remarkable because it is completely covered with preserved scaly skin, and at the same time completely preserved in three dimensions, preserving the original shape of the animal," Brown said.
"As a result, the animal now looks almost the same as it looked then, in the early Cretaceous period.
It is not necessary especially to resort to imagination in order to recreate it, it is worth only a slight pinch, and you can practically believe that it sleeps. "
The Cretaceous period is the era when giant theropods, carnivorous dinosaurs standing on two feet, roamed the earth.
Although the most remarkable of them, Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions of years later than Borealopelta, tiretraffic could be hunted by some of his formidable ancestors.
They include the acronym, a 38-foot-long (11.5-meter) monster weighing six tons.
Scientists, whose latest discoveries are published in the journal modern biology, believe that Borealopelta was taken to sea after his death and mummified in Ile.
The creature was found by Sean funk while he was working at the Millennium Mine near Fort Mac Murray in northern Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011.
According to the museum staff, it is the most well-preserved tyretraffic in the world, together with skin and pancyrem, and it is a target, from the muzzle to the thigh bones.
On average, these creatures reached about 18 feet (five meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kilograms).
Their characteristic feature was two twenty-inch studs protruding from the shoulders.
The researchers believe that this herbivorous tiretraffic stepped hard on what is now Canada until the spilled River took it to the high seas.
But the underwater burial of the dinosaur preserved its Panhandle with precision to the smallest detail.
The fossilised remains of this particular instance are so well preserved that the remains of the skin still cover the bogey Panhandle plates along the dinosaur skull.
As Michael Sinko wrote in an article for National Geographic magazine, this degree of preservation is "rare as a lottery win."
The longer I look at him, the more startling he seems.
The fossilised remains of the skin still cover the bogey Panhandle plates that dotted the animal's skull.
His right front leg is stretched along the side, five fingers on it are hung up.
I can count the scales on his sole. "
Mikhail Saakashvili managed to get to Poland without documents
Mikhail Saakashvili, formerly head of Georgia, and then Odessa region in Ukraine, flew to Poland.
At the same time, he did so without proof of his identity and citizenship.
Saakashvili's arrival is reported by the Polish edition of Telewizja republicka, which posted a video of his performance on his YouTube channel.
Saakashvili spoke at an event to mark the anniversary of the Warsaw Uprising against Hitler's troops in 1944.
Since the politician did not know Polish, although he tried to start a speech in that language, he had to speak English through a Polish translator.
During his speech, the politician touched upon the topic of Georgia's cooperation with Poland, and also spoke about Ukraine.
The fact that the Migration Service of Ukraine deprived him of citizenship, the disgraced politician learned while in the United States.
Exactly how he managed to make the Trans-Atlantic flight undocumented remains to be seen.
Earlier, former governor of the Odessa Region Mikhail Saakashvili said that his signature on the questionnaire for obtaining citizenship of Ukraine was forged.
The politician stressed that he did not fill out any questionnaires.
The investigation in the case of vainziher and Olkhovik has been extended until January
The period of preliminary investigation in the case of the co-owner of the group of companies "Renova" Evgeny Olkhovik and the head of the energy holding "T Plus" Boris vainziher has been extended until January 2, 2018.
On Thursday, August 3, Basmanny Court is considering the extension of the accused's house arrest.
The representative of the UK at the meeting reported on the decision last time to extend the period of preliminary investigation.
"The special complexity and duration of the investigation is due to the need to seize and carry out an examination of a large number of documents, as well as to carry out investigative actions on the territory of several subjects of the Russian Federation," the investigator said.
He added that the suspects regularly paid bribes to Comey's leadership.
Their total size is estimated to be at least one billion rubles.
According to investigators, vainziher, Olkhovik, as well as the former head of JSC "complex energy systems" Mikhail Slobin, who until September 5 headed the company "VimpelCom," handed over bribes to the top officials of the Republic of Komi for setting the most favorable tariffs for heat and electricity, as well as for creating favorable conditions for business.
Vainziher and Olkhovik were detained, transferred to Syktyvkar and arrested for two months, Slobodan fled the investigation and was placed on the federal wanted list.
How did one activist learn the answer to the question "Whose Streets?"
On August 9, 2014, Brittani Ferrel was shaken to the core.
Just a day after arriving in New York City as part of a tourist trip, the St. Louis native was sitting on a bed in an apartment rented through Airbnb, browsing a Facebook feed on her phone.
She ran into the post of someone from high school.
It said: "The police have just killed an 18-year-old child, and he is still lying in the middle of the street."
Drawing attention to the fact that no one else from her tape posted this information, puzzled, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
There were a lot of user reposts with Nick @ TheePharoah in her tape.
The rapper, from Greater St. Louis, was covering in real time on Twitter the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black eighteen-year-old undergrowth killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri.
He posted a picture of Brown's lifeless body spread out in the middle of the street, where it will stay for four hours.
"It's wild," Ferrel thought.
But death was nothing new to her and her circle.
She put the phone on hold, and later in the evening returned to tweets that people were gathering on Canfield Drive.
There were pictures of a signal tape and screaming people and a man claiming to be Brown's father holding a poster saying, "a police officer from Ferguson just killed my unarmed son!"
She watched the live broadcast as a police officer stands in front of a group of protesters with a barking dog.
In another video, another police officer, "she said," went up the rifle and said, "I'll kill you all... animals!"
"This is not a standard situation," Ferrel said at the time, according to her own memories.
"This is not a murder like the ones we are used to and can call typical.
At that moment, I felt chills.
I was angry and crying. "
She took a return flight ticket and flew home the next day.
After landing at 11pm, she took her six-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided they would both go to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened to Ferrel and to Ferguson in the next nearly three years was the subject of a new documentary, "Whose Streets?," which will be released on August 11.
It is a story about survival and protest, about love and loss, strength and resilience from the point of view of people living in the community and filling the streets, demanding answers.
While Ferrel was travelling to Ferguson with her daughter, dressed in a dress in flowers and a wreath under color, they recalled a conversation that had been held countless times before this morning, "about the experience of black men and their position."
She recalls saying, "remember how I told you about how black people had to fight for what they believed?
We are now going to Ferguson because a police officer killed an eighteen-year-old boy and it was wrong. "
"I couldn't help but take it," Ferrel said later.
"What is happening today is the culmination of what has happened before.
She should know about it, see it and be brought up on it.
It must not only have a good understanding of activism and organization, but also understand the different levels of black experience and position, and what we must do to become free to free ourselves.
Even if I manage to provide her with an environment in which she herself will not face obvious racism, she is no different from any other black girl.
I feel like I would have done her a bad service if I had upset her from it. "
When they arrived in Ferguson, they made their first stop on South Florissant Road, a site across the street from a police station that had become something of a tent camp, while activists waited for reports of Officer Darren Wilson's final lack of blame
There, Ferrel and his daughter joined a local entrepreneur who was preparing lunch packages.
They collected packages and helped distribute them to the protesters.
Little by little, Ferrel's consciousness has taken the form of a new type of activism.
"My activism changed completely after August 9," she said, noting that as a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, she was president of the Association of nursing students, members of national minorities, and engaged in food justice and health inequality among black communities.
"I had no experience of the organizer.
It came by itself. "
A few weeks later, at an evening demonstration, Ferrel met Sabaa Folayan, one of her co-workers.
Folayan said she and her chief operator Lucas Alvarado-fairair "just wanted to document" the events.
Ferrel came up with the question: "Do you want to document, or are you trying to find a story on which to play?"
This skepticism was inspired by numerous people, often white, who came to the community to benefit from his pain and resilience.
As Folayan explained in a recent interview, "we heard that the voices of people who were born and raised in Ferguson don't come into the spotlight, and wanted to do it differently."
Folayan had already joined forces with his co-worker Damon Davis, a local artist known for his activism on death row issues.
His participation aroused sympathy for the project from Ferrel and six other local residents, with whom the project team "Whose Streets?" kept in touch during the years since Brown's assassination.
"In this documentary, it's not someone who speaks for us or with us, it's us who speak for ourselves," Davis said.
"It was the most important thing for me, how these people will be represented, because this is how I will be represented myself."
And while the goal of the project was not to focus on Ferrel's experience at all-in an effort to show that the movement "is not about the Savior leader, but about how the community unites," as Folayan said - it turned out to be the most open of the film's participants.
As a result, "Whose Streets?" shows unexpectedly personal aspects of Ferrel's life, such as how she fell in love and married her wife.
"I felt naked," Ferrel said, talking with laughter about seeing the finished product for the first time.
"But I understood that when you do such work and humanize blacks, there has to be some level of vulnerability."
In addition, Ferrel's story again discusses and emphasizes the role of black homosexual women in the broader context of the "Black Lives Matter" movement.
Two of the movement's three founders - those who created the # BlackLivesMatter tag on social media after the 2012 murder of black teenager Trayvon Martin - identify themselves as homosexual.
"Black homosexual women in leadership positions support all this movement," says Ferrel. "and all because we are constantly fighting on several fronts.
Black homosexual women have to bear all this burden. "
Folayan agreed with this statement, noting that "the movement is, in fact, supported by black women and a lot of homosexual black women."
However, she insists that "this is not a case of positive discrimination," and that Ferrel was not elected as the film's central character because of her distinctive features.
"She was the person who awakened that energy," she said.
"On the other hand, it is not a coincidence that she was at the forefront because when"
You can feel her energy through the screen. "
Meanwhile, Ferguson has long had no film cameras, but there remain complex racial links between the community and the police.
Ferrel will be on probation for two and a half more years for blocking the highway during the demonstration.
She describes the social and political atmosphere of the place, which she calls home, simply: "Bardak."
She still holds on to the speech she learned when she took to the streets of Ferguson full three years ago.
We must fight for our freedom.
We have to win.
We have to love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose but our chains. "
Two Salvadoran players disqualified for biting U.S. players
Players of the national team of Salvador Henry Romero and Darwin Seren received long disqualification for unsportsmanlike behavior.
During the quarter-final match of the football confederations Gold Cup of North and Central America and the Caribbean (CONCACAF), the Salvadoran bitten American players.
Defender Henry Romero was the first to make a difference.
The Salvadoran bit the attacker, Josie Altidor, then grabbed him by the chest.
Midfielder Seren then bitten US defender Omar Gonzalez when serving a corner in the penalty area of his area.
As a result, Romero was disqualified for three matches and Seren for six.
The meeting itself ended with a 2-0 victory for the Americans, reports Goal.com.
Emergence of similarities: artist creates portraits using Chelsea Manning's DNA
In the center of the hall at the Friedman Gallery in New York City, the faces of people - white, black and brown - are hanging from the ceiling on the wire, all in something elusive similar to each other.
These 30 portraits were created by artist Heather Dewey-harborg of cheek strokes and hair cuts sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent cuts from Fort Levenworth prison, where a former intelligence analyst is serving a 35-year sentence for famously handing over confidential diplomatic telegrams on the WikiLeaks website.
The new exhibition, which opened on August 2, is called "the emergence of similarities."
This is the result of two years of correspondence between Dewey-harborg, whose art combines technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a transgender woman and famous dissident whom Barack Obama commuted his sentence just three days before the end of his presidency.
After analyzing the DNA obtained from Manning with the help of a computer program, and using it to create three-dimensional portraits of individuals that could be in people with such a genome, Dewey-harborg created a deep, though hard-to-perceive manifesto devoted not only to the plasticity of DNA data - the different ways in which they were interpreted and the ingerent determinism of those interpretations - but also to the notion of identity.
Manning, who was born with the name Bradley Edward but has openly said since she was a teenager that she considers herself a woman, was sentenced to 20 episodes in 2013, including six violations of the Espionage Act, computer fraud and theft.
Her photos in prison were unavailable, so only one of her photos was known: a grainy black-and-white selfie, in which Manning, in a platinum-tinged wig, clearly feeling uncomfortable, sits behind the wheel of a car; with this photo, she became associated.
In 2015, Dewey-harborg completed her 2012 project, "Visions of strangers," with great success.
In it, the artist created portraits of unknown people using forensic evidence like frills and chewing gum, highlighting DNA from this garbage and creating images of what these people might look like.
And then she received an E-mail from Paper Magazine.
"They interviewed Chelsea Manning in prison and wanted some portrait to illustrate the article," Dewey-Hagborg explained at a preliminary screening of the new press exhibition.
At the time, Chelsea could not be visited and photographed, so they contacted her and asked if she wanted to get a portrait created from her DNA.
In this unusual way, the artist and her imprisoned Muza became correspondence friends and exchanged several letters over the course of two years.
They even wrote a comic book, "Suppressed Images," illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, which depicted how, in the future, the President would soften Chelsea's punishment and she would be able to attend the exhibition in person.
That Obama really decided to release Manning just days after the book's release turned out to be a pleasant surprise after seven hard years in a military prison in Kansas.
There is something profound and strong about the exhibition opening right now that Donald Trump is declaring war on people revealing classified information in government and inventing new ways to fuel the Twitter feud he is meant to soften.
When Dewey-harborg was asked about the coincidence of this just in time, she said, "by chance, nothing happens."
In the artist's statement, written on the wall of Galery, Manning's huge signature below (with a heart instead of a point over "i" in her surname) calls for an end to "automatic separation based on gender, race, sexual orientation and culture."
On the opposite side is her mitochondrial DNA, a long Caterpillar of pencil-written C, G and A.
By including 200 letters (or nucleotides, as the artist is scientifically exquisitely expressed), Dewey-harborg hoped to show how we are all remarkably similar, at any rate in our biological structure.
"I hope to explain to people that our genome does not define what we are, how open genetic data is to interpretation and how subjective it is," Dewey-harborg said; her 2007 video work, "false memories," is also on display here.
"DNA data can tell us a lot of different stories, and 30 of those stories are here."
The last part of the exhibition, which fits in one room, is the above-mentioned novel in comics.
On it, King Kong-style Manning appears above the U.S. correctional barracks building with a loudspeaker in his hand.
"If they kill your speech, they will win," it is written there.
"That's why never silence."
"It's a direct quote from a letter she wrote to me," says an artist greeting us from Philadelphia.
"I still have murals on my skin when I talk about it."
Manning has yet to see the exhibition in person - as it was provocatively depicted in comics - but when it comes, she will be greeted by masks in the center of the room, her own genomic simulacras gathered like crowds of protesters.
It's also done deliberately, like everything in the exhibition right up to the height (5 "2, Manning's height), on which genetic haplogroups were painted with a pencil.
"I would have hung them on the walls before, but now I wanted them to look like a crowd of people," Dewey-harborg says of the portraits.
"I wanted them to be like the mass movement that formed around Chelsea, like the movement that was behind its liberation as well."
Northwestern University professor and Oxford University employee is wanted by police on murder charges
According to police, there is a nationwide raid on a Northwestern University professor and an Oxford University employee who are wanted as suspects because a man was found stabbed to death in a luxury room in Chicago.
According to Cook County court records, arrest warrants were issued Monday for premeditated murder without bail for forty-two-year-old vindem Latham and fifty-six-year-old Andrew Warren over their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton G. James Cornell-duranlo.
According to the documents, twenty-six-year-old Cornell-Duranleau died after being stabbed multiple times.
A warning issued by the Chicago Police Department said the body was found on July 27.
Police received a call, they arrived at the Grand Plaza apartment complex and found the victim with several wounds on his body.
According to officials, Cornell-duranlo was pronounced dead at the scene of the crime, and detectives are now investigating the stabbing death, considering it a murder, while police are actively searching for two suspects.
Latham has been an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Kabbaj, the university's vice president of communications, said in an emailed statement that Latham was on administrative leave and that he was prohibited from entering Northwestern University campuses.
"This is now a criminal case being investigated by authorized individuals, and Northwestern University is cooperating with the investigation," Kabbaj said.
Warren works as a senior financial officer at the University of Oxford.
A spokesman for the university and Somerville College said in an emailed statement: "We have communicated with the UK police and stand ready to provide any necessary assistance to the US investigative authorities."
The statement also said Warren's colleagues were shocked and wanted him to give up.
Chicago Police Department communications chief Anthony gulelmi said he was very advising suspects to surrender to the authorities.
"The police have assumptions about their whereabouts, but our attempts to find them are intensifying," gulelmi said.
According to gulelmi, local, regional and federal authorities are helping in the search for suspects.
According to gulelmi, the police received a phone call from the administrator of the Grand Plaza building, who had just received a mysterious report that something had happened in room 1,008.
Police described the crime scene as terrible.
Gulelmi said it was unclear whether the incident itself occurred on July 27.
He said video camera data confirmed that Latham and Warren were in the building.
"We believe that Professor Latham and the victim linked the relationship," gulelmi said.
Grand Plaza authorities issued an appeal to guests, which reported: "The police are currently working on a chronology of the incident, collecting information about the victim and considering a number of motives, including a possible domestic incident."
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mutko: "We will meet the requirements of the Wade road map in the near future"
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said that the conditions of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), set to resume the work of the Russian anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA), will be fulfilled in the near future.
"A certain stage in compliance has been passed, RUSADA has been given the right to plan and carry out tests in conjunction with UKAD (the UK Anti-Doping Agency).
Wade's road map has been updated accordingly, "Mutko said on Thursday.
The Prime Minister commented on the second part of Wade's Roadmap to restore compliance with the code, which lists the conditions for the reopening of RUSADA and was recently published on the organization's website.
According to Mutko, it contains nothing that could present difficulties for Russia.
"Everything was announced, everything will be fulfilled.
And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and Wade in the near future, "he added.
However, one of the requirements included in the list implies that Russian andidoping structures should publicly acknowledge the results of the Wade-commissioned investigation by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren, which claimed that doping in Russian sports is controlled by the state.
Referring to the issue, Mutko said: "We are investigating as our anti-doping system has failed.
All measures have been taken.
But there were no state programs, and we will not recognize what was not.. "
Mutko echoed the words of Vitaly Smirnov, head of the Russian independent public anti-Doping Commission.
On the morning of the same day, in an interview with the Russian edition of "Rsport," Smirnov acknowledged earlier problems in Russian anti-doping structures, but added: "We have repeatedly said that the report contains certain controversial positions and provisions.
No one is going to accept this report unconditionally, "Smirnov added.
WADA suspended RUSADA from doping control in November 2015 after a doping scandal.
In June this year, however, he was allowed to plan and coordinate testing under the supervision of international experts and the British anti-Doping Agency (UKAD).
After visiting the organization's Moscow office in July, WADA CEO Olivier Niggli said RUSADA was "moving in the right direction" toward restoring his work.

Buzova's unimaginable outfit shocked fans: trousers that didn't cover the briefs
The controversial host of the reality show "House-2," Olga Buzova, struck the audience of the Europa Plus Live festival with dancing in briefs.

Stoltenberg admits deteriorating relations between NATO and Russia
This was reported by Radio 4 news service on Friday, August 4, citing foreign media.
According to him, the Russian authorities are responsible for the deterioration of relations between the West and Russia.
In an interview with CNN, the NATO Secretary General also criticized Russia for the situation with Crimea and "destabilization in eastern Ukraine."
At the same time, Stoltenberg assured that dialogue with Russia, nevertheless, is possible, and further escalation of the situation will not benefit any of its participants.
Earlier on Thursday, US President Donald Trump said relations between the US and Russia were at dangerously low levels, and blamed the US Congress.
Yekaterinburg Metro is mastering a new method of payment
In October, travel in the Yekaterinburg Metro will be able to pay with a bank card, said Pavel Vedernikov, general director of JSC "I-network" in an interview with "regional newspaper."
Our goal is to introduce the same system of Metro fare for the 2018 FIFA World Cup as in other major cities: Moscow, St. Petersburg, Nizhny Novgorod and Novosibirsk.
"We want fans from other countries, guests of the FIFA World Cup, to be able to use the metro with the help of their bank cards, without purchasing tokens and not standing in line," he said.
Start-ups that will help your company not become another "Uber"
Aimee Errett wanted to assess the level of satisfaction among her startup's E-commerce staff, but the surveys didn't work.
The answers were often vague, unhelpful or, worse, insincere.
And even though she promised anonymity, some employees did not trust the process.
"He's never been consistent and objective," said Errett, who manages the 75-person San Francisco-based Madison Reed, a hair care e-commerce company.
That's why she turned to third parties for help.
Now there is a new kind of HR start-ups that help companies figure out how their employees feel.
By developing and licensing software whose purpose is to measure employee engagement, they allow companies to do express surveys, contact certain teams and demographic groups, offer employees anonymity and hotline for complaints, and in some cases allow informants to pass top management and contact the Directorate directly.
"Now we have tools like Strava and Fitbit for health monitoring, and where is Fitbit for your company?" says Jim Barnett, co-founder and president of the Redwood City Startup Glint, whose analytical programs are used by companies to measure employee engagement.
Errett said she has reached a greater understanding of what her employees think and feel during her three years of using "Glint."
In addition to express surveys and questionnaires of certain teams, the product offers a heat card of the company and shows in a visual form which divisions have more complaints and which managers have a low approval rating, which allows it to figure out why.
Companies realize little by little that they need to control the workplace, otherwise they will become another "Uber" who was involved in the scandal when a former employee published a blog post describing an aggressive environment in which those who expressed discontent were punished.
For start-ups like "Glint," this desire to control the situation is an opportunity for profitable business.
The "Let's talk about pay" Internet portal, dedicated to financial technology, estimates that the global governance, regulation and compliance industry could cost more than $118.7 billion by 2020.
The Denver, Colorado-based start-up Convercent, which helps companies prevent and detect bad behavior, noted a slight increase in interest and activity earlier this year amid a drop in Uber's reputation.
Convercent has nearly 600 customers, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Recently, "Uber" appeared among the clients.
Like "Glint," "Convercent" allows companies to send tailor-made staff opinion surveys, collect confidential responses in real time and view heat maps of problem areas.
It also provides a hotline for anonymous text messages that allows employees to report bad behavior.
And if the top manager is affected, the complaints go straight to the Directorate.
"The court of public opinion has seized power from the inspectors," said Patrick Quinlan, founder and president of Convercent.
If it turns out that the company is not treating employees well or behaving unethically, even if the inspectors do not intervene, the company could face costly consequences in the form of boycotts by customers, employee outflows and lawsuits, Quinlan said.
Ruby Tuesday, a chain of restaurants with more than 25,000 employees in 500 establishments, has used Convercent for more than a year to make sure employees are aware of the rules and procedures, and offer an easy way to contact the company's head office.
Previously, if a staff member wanted to report a problem, he or she had to search for a telephone number or head office mail, file a formal complaint and hope that it would be taken seriously.
It was often a frightening and embarrassing experience, said James Vitrano, head of the legal department at Ruby Tuesday, who said there was no normal way to track employee complaints.
Now that the company is using the Convercent service, problems that used to be hidden from managers sitting in offices in other cities or states - such as discrimination, haraschange and unfair pay-can be detected and dealt with more quickly.
"I can get closer to a holistic, comprehensive understanding of the situation of employees," said Vitrano, who runs the Ruby Tuesday network's risk management group.
"And we protect our shareholders from litigation with employees."
According to Quinland, companies began to take the ethics, values and involvement of employees more seriously in 2002, after the accounting firm Arthur Andersen collapsed due to ethical violations as a result of the "Enron case."
But it was only when "social networks became widespread" that companies realised that they would not be able to keep their dirty underwear from spreading viral online.
"Before we start using technology to control ethics, people used hope as a strategy," he said.
Both "Glint" and "Convercent" offer their software as a service, charging companies regularly for the use of their products.
This is a business model and an opportunity that has received the approval of venture capital investors who have supported both start-ups.
In February, Convercent received $10 million in funding from firms such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, bringing the company's total capital to $47 million.
Glint received $10 million in November from Bessemer Venture Partners, bringing the company's total capital to $60 million.
These investments are hardly surprising given the interconnected nature of companies, culture, and venture capital.
A growing body of research demonstrates that today's employees expect more from their jobs than they did before.
In markets with tough competition, such as Silicon Valley, high wages and interesting projects are just the necessary minimum.
Employees want to feel that they are accepted and valued, and that they devote their time to a company with a positive mission.
"When people are happy to work for a company, feel that they are being heard, and that the work they do brings results, they try harder to make such a company successful," said Nina McQueen, vice president of global benefits and employee satisfaction at LinkedIn, where both Convercent and Glint are used.
Investors earn income when companies from their portfolio do well; companies do well when employees are dedicated and involved.
If the analytical tools of a third party promise to increase the dedication and involvement of employees, it is not surprising that they find support.
According to workplace culture experts, it is important to have data on employee engagement.
But the data is useless until the company's Trustees take action.
In fact, if a company asks employees for feedback, it can give the impression that change is coming.
And if change doesn't come quickly enough, or doesn't come at all, frustration can develop, and employees will lose interest.
"If you're going to ask for 4,000 offers, you have to be willing to have 4,000 conversations," says Russell Rath, president of consulting at management firm Kotter International, who has had to see companies make a mistake by relying too much on data collection.
"Because if you don't go to the end, the staff will guess," Did you hear me right?
Don't you care?
And if you don't care, why shouldn't I care? "
According to Errett, Madison Reed, which now conducts monthly employee surveys, is in a position to take action on the same day that anyone reports the problem using "Glint."
And, after collecting feedback from employees unhappy with the speed of decision-making and the quality of communication, she was able to reorganize several teams within the company and introduce communication training to solve problems.
Ruby Tuesday is gaining new knowledge about its employees and hopes that in the long run, this knowledge will help it more effectively retain employees in an industry known for high staff turnover.
"If you don't try to create a culture of transparency, you will lose people," Vitrano said.
If you lose people, you lose customers.
And if you lose customers, you lose companies.
A new asphalt on the Red Army Avenue is revealed in Barnaul
In Barnaul, radical measures were taken to eliminate the cause of the failures of the asphalt on the Red Army Avenue.
The place where the pits appeared twice on the newly paved roadway (crossing with youth Street), it was decided to "open."
Recall, the collapse of a small section of the road near the tram tracks was due to the fact that the land in the area of the idle unexploited network was cleared.
According to Ivan Garmat, deputy chairman of the City committee on road management, improvement, transport and communications, a detailed survey will be conducted for the detailed examination and elimination of the preconditions for the collapse.
Depending on its results, the necessary measures will be taken.
It is expected that it will be necessary to restore the opalubic communications and concrete them.
This is reported on the official website of the regional capital.
The Bruins team has to do longer because the National Student Sports Association cancelled training twice a day
The time is approaching eleven p.m.; a crowd of football players from the University of California, Los Angeles, is delayed to chat on one side of the team's new training fields located on campus.
Some of them stitched their t-shirts, exposing their backs, gleaming with sweat after a tense first day of sports camp.
For many team players, these minutes of idleness make up a break in the middle of the day.
Players enrolled in summer classes will go back to the dorms after a three-hour training session to prepare for the final exams, and return to Wasserman Football Center the next morning for meetings at 6: 30 a.m.
Shortly before Monday turned Tuesday, Bruins coach Jim Mora said, "on the next three days, these guys are waiting for a butcher."
That the National Student Sports Association cancelled training twice a day, which was invented to reduce the workload for players, actually lengthened their working day-at least until the end of exams on Friday.
Therefore, the beginning of the first three trainings of the team of the University of California at Los Angeles was scheduled for 7: 15 p.m. so that they fit in the already tight schedule of players.
A side effect of the lack of two workouts a day has been a larger number of days with one workout, and the Bruins are moving the start of camp by nearly a week compared to last year and holding workouts during summer school for the first time in Moor's six seasons in Westwood.
According to the schedule, they will have to conduct 18 workouts until August 20 inclusive before starting official preparations for the first game of the season against the Texas A & M University team in September.
Mora said he supported a change in the rules by the National Student Sports Association, despite the fact that because of it there was another item in the tight schedule of players.
"For three or four days, we give them this huge burden, this is a serious test," Mora said.
"And they just overcame it, they work, they are wonderful guys.
I think that when we get to Saturday and we have more time, it will be really great. "
When the camp ends, the University of California at Los Angeles will make the workouts closed; it's a daunting task, as its fields are in direct view from the adjacent parking lot and from the nearby "Laskin Center," an expensive hotel that has already been bombed with soccer balls that have overcome the safety net behind the gate.
Players from the Bruins should occupy the hotel starting this weekend, but Mora admits that when rooms are free during the season, there may be a problem.
"We will have security," Mora said.
"It is a serious problem, and I do not exaggerate the danger, assuming that someone can take off the room, sit there and record the training on video.
If you have a video of a workout, it is very serious.
But we will have security there and there will be security in the parking lot number 8.
We will do what we can with what we have.
I won't worry too much about it.
We have a plan. "
All the victims of the attack in St. Petersburg have been discharged from hospitals
All the victims of the St. Petersburg metro attack in April have been discharged from hospitals.
This was reported in the press service of the lieutenant governor Anna Mityanina.
According to the data at the end of July, three people remained in hospitals, reports "TV Center."
Recall, the explosion in the Metro of St. Petersburg took place on April 3 this year.
The bomb was detonated by a suicide bomber, Akbarzhon Jalilov.
Fifteen people were killed in the attack, as well as the perpetrator himself.
In the criminal case, 11 people, including the alleged organizer Abror Azimov, were arrested.
Recall, the day before Rospotrebnadzor recommended St. Petersburg metro to revise the Plan of measures to ensure transport security, in particular, increasing the number of frames of metal detectors.
Facebook strengthens fact-chucking in fight against fake news
Facebook will be more likely to send texts suspicious of hoaxes to independent experts and show their findings under original posts, the world's largest social network, which is trying to combat so-called fake news, said on Thursday.
In a statement on its website, the company said it was starting to use improved machine learning algorithms to recognize possible hoaxes, send them to check and possibly show fact-cheering results under the Source post.
Facebook has been criticized as one of the main ways to spread so-called fake news, which many believe had an impact on the 2016 US presidential election.
The issue is also being actively debated in Europe after French voters were misled by false messages before the presidential election in May, and in Germany before the September election declared support for a plan to fine social media unless they promptly remove hate-mongering posts.
On Thursday, in a separate statement in German, Facebook announced the testing of the new fact-cheking algorithm, which was launched in the United States, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
"In addition to seeing which messages are challenged by independent reviewers, people want to have a broader context to make informed judgments about what they read and what they share," Sarah Sue, Facebook's news feed manager, wrote in her block.
She added that Facebook will continue to test the "related articles" feature and work on other changes to the news feed to address the problem of fake news.
Create a comic novel: one castle in English history
In the recent past, Scotney's tiny Castle was filmed in the Squeeze music video, and served as a haven for Margaret Thatcher in the 70s and 80s.
But 700 years from his cosy place in the Byul River valley in Kent County, he watched the tumultuous story around, and now inspired Jamie Rhodes, a Yorkshire man with copious hair and with a penchant for historical documents, to a comic novel.
"I think it's so beautiful to look at the handwriting of a man who died 300 years ago," he says with encouragement.
"You feel it so personally when you hold this letter in your hand."
"Castle in England" covers the period from the middle ages to the evardian era and tells about the families who lived in Scotney; each story was illustrated by one of the Young British Artists - Isaac lenkevich, Bryony Mae Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
This is not Rhodes's first book, which is based on archival data: in 2014, he wrote "dead man's teeth and Other Stories," a collection of documents from the British Library; this project unexpectedly moved him to the core.
"I could be torn by just a fingerprint on the edge of a letter written in the 1700s by a double agent who worked for the Jacobites," he says.
"It's a fingerprint of his finger"
And the letters always smell smoke, because in those days the fire was lit for lighting.
And in 300 years, in the future, you seem to be there too.
Ah, how I love the archives! "
For a man caught up in such a passion for old papers, getting support from the National Foundation and the English art Council and living in a castle for four months ("frankly, I'm a bit of a stay there") seems too good to be true.
Rhodes studied the "new" Victorian Castle for days, walked through archives and looked at numerous treasures of the estate and ancient things - for example, the heads of hyenas on the walls or bottles that lay in the moat for centuries.
He walked through the park and the ruins of the old castle, talked to foresters, gardeners and sometimes artists who worked on illustrations for his book.
Then at night, he "drank whisky and sat down to write."
The history of Scotney Castle is not much studied because the National Foundation only gained full access to it in 2006, when the last heiress, Elizabeth Hussey, died.
When Rhodes arrived there ten years later, employees were just beginning to deal with the archive, which he describes as "what aristocrats have been piling into the attic for centuries."
Diaries, letters from the times of the British Empire, maps showing who owned what: "You think that land disputes are boring," says Rhodes, "but here for this Birch fought two families.
It happens so, guys! "
In some stories of the collection, the castle becomes the starting point for wider exploration in English history: for example, in "the worker," the hero leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant revolution of 1381.
"There are reports of a riot that took place at the castle in 1380, in a book called the Knight families of Kent and Sussex," Rhodes says.
"The peasant uprising began in these places, and I thought that the rebellion was the right beginning.
Maybe they were connected? "
Other stories are strongly linked to the history of the castle - for example, "the priest," which tells the story of a Jesuit priest whom the Darrel family hid for seven years during the English Reformation.
Or "Smuggler," about 18th-century smuggler Arthur Darrel, who is believed to have staged his own funeral by hitting his coffin with stones (this was discovered a few years later when the coffin was dug).
Darrels - the beloved family of Rhodes from all that inhabited Scotney: "Gentlemen, it seems, were the perfect Crook, forever got into debt and spent money on what they could not afford.
In different generations, Darrel men have solved their debt problems by marrying wealthy older women - I imagine them as a company of nice guys who know how to look after the heirs of big fortunes. "
After finishing work at the castle, Rhodes is looking for other opportunities to gain a unique writing experience.
He lived for two weeks in a Finnish muzzle, where he wrote a graphic novella about elyamyanmiaki, a place where there was a sanatorium at the beginning of the 20th century, and then it grew again into a forest.
But Scotney remains a special place for him.
"I was sad to leave," he says.
"I felt something like this: hell, I have to go back to real life again."
Fifteen of the largest banks choose "Russia"
The conflict in the Association of Russian Banks (ADB) is developing: following Sberbank, VTB, VTB-24, Alfa-bank, Gazprombank, rosagricultural Bank, Binbank and FC "discovery," seven more credit organizations are going to leave this public organization.
Thus, organizations that have withdrawn from the ADB will account for at least 80 per cent of the market.
But this is not just a way out-all the banks that have declared a break with the ADB are negotiating with another public organization uniting credit institutions - the Association of Regional Banks "Russia," which is headed by the well-known politician Anatoly Aksakov, Chairman of the State Duma Committee on the financial market, recognized, by the way, following the last session and the most effective head of the Duma committee and deputy on the number of prepared bills.
The beginning of the conflict within the ADB began during the discussion in the Federation Council, when the interregional Banking Council considered new bills, in particular, involving a new classification of banks depending on the size of the authorized capital.
Then Garegin Tosunyan, the president of the ADB, said that according to the association, this bill is passed in the interests of the largest banks, which thus try to limit the opportunities of small and medium-sized banks in the regions, intercepting their clientele.
Among other claims, there was criticism of the central bank, which, according to Tosunyan, is not always justified in withdrawing licenses from some banks, which, however, was objected to by the representative of the Central Bank: many heads of the fined banks, in particular, Vnesheconombank, were part of the governing bodies of the ADB.
Apparently, this exchange of mutually exclusive opinions in a highly sensitive relationship with the main regulator of the banking environment and became a visible reason that fifteen major banks, having declared disagreement with the policy of the ADB, began to prepare for joining the association "Russia," noting that "the effectiveness of the work of the ADB is low, and constructive dialogue within the banking community is not actually held."
Depositors will be better off
How will the matter end?
On the contrary, the reliability of the banking system will increase.
Anatoly Aksakov, who is known for his sensitivity in everything concerning the interests of banks and their clients, is head of "Russia," a high-level professional who is highly valued in the Central Bank: almost all central bank management is present at the annual events of the Association, and all significant legislative initiatives of the regulator pass through expert assessments of "regionals."
In terms of personnel and organization, it is clear that there are no particular shocks.
There is no doubt that ARB finds itself in a difficult financial and managerial situation after losing such powerful and influential participants with their contributions and lobbying opportunities.
However, in this oldest organization, established in 1991, which advocates for the interests of the banking community, there is considerable potential to continue to improve banking legislation and monetary circulation in general.
It is impossible to say that in the association "Russia" with open arms are ready to accept on any terms new members, judging by the reaction of its leader, Anatoly Aksakov ("Maybe too much will want"), who as early as July 21 at a briefing in the press center of the parliamentary newspaper, said that "just the next day representatives of the banks leaving the ADB asked me to consider the possibility to increase the potential of our association" Russia. "
Their proposals are to strengthen the voice of bankers on the association's board, as well as pay more attention to new banking technologies.
Now the negotiation process is underway, the proposals of both sides are being studied, the agenda of the extraordinary congress of the Association, which will be held in Sochi in mid-September within the framework of the international banking forum, is being prepared.
There we will make up our minds.
Also Anatoly Aksakov, stressing that "the chair does not hold," called a possible new head of the renewed Association "Russia" Georgi Luntovsky, who leaves the post of Deputy Chairman of the Central Bank in September, highly describing his business and human qualities.
On August 18 Anatoly Aksakov, who is currently vacationing in Crimea, plans to suspend his vacation for one day and arrive in Moscow, for an extraordinary meeting of the Council of the association "Russia," where it is planned to consider the agenda of the extraordinary congress "Russia."
The entry of petrol-powered cars into Russia's major cities will not be restricted
Nikolai Asaul, deputy head of the transport ministry, said that, contrary to media reports, the entry of gasoline-powered cars into Russia's major cities will not be restricted yet.
This is a more radical form of our concept.
Our concept is that it is necessary to gradually increase the ecological class.
And there's the concept of immediately switching to zero emissions.
I believe that technically we are not ready for it.
The question, after all, is: since what year?
It is the same on the level of slogans phrase - let's ban.
Where and when?
Tomorrow?
The whole city will be shut down?
"In 20 years - I don't know, maybe it will happen," Prime quoted the minister as saying.
Earlier, the newspaper "Izvestia" reported that by August 17, Deputy Prime Minister Arkady Dvorkovich was instructed to study the proposals on possible options for state support of electric transport, submitted to the government by the Director General of PJSC KAMAZ Sergey Kogogin.
Among the proposals, according to the newspaper, is the use of machines with ice in major cities and resorts.
Washington is changing the rules for getting a greencard.
According to media reports, President Donald Trump said a new U.S. immigration plan would be adopted that would change the rules for getting a greencard.
The plan calls for reducing the number of legal immigrants to 50,000 a year, stricter rules for temporary work visas and restrictions on family visas.
The new rules are proposed by the Republican Party and supported by the president.
The bill will be debated in two houses of Congress.
"This law will reduce poverty, raise wages and save taxpayers billions of dollars, and will do so by changing the way the U.S. issues Greencards to citizens of other countries.
The law will reduce chain migration and replace the existing scheme.
The new application process will provide benefits to candidates who speak English, have cash resources that allow them to support themselves, and have skills that will benefit our economy, "Trump said, according to U.S. media.
The advent of sex robots is real, and it should worry us
We didn't have time to think that 2017 can no longer get worse, a new report on technological successes in the production of sex robots has been released.
MDA.
Sex robots are now in the spotlight.
The Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) recently released a report on the development of sex robots in the next 5-10 years.
According to Noel Sharkey, a well-deserved professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of FRR, we should take their appearance seriously.
Users will be able to choose the eye color of the robots, the shape of the nipples and the type of nails.
"People are giggling about it, but firms are already sending them to consumers in large numbers, and soon we will see a lot more of them," Sharkey said at the presentation of the new report.
Modern sex dolls have evolved from their inflatable brethren into robots with silicone skin warm to the touch, and with almost human replicas controlled by artificial intelligence.
Users can also "customize" their robots to their liking, choosing everything from eye color and robot nipple shape to nail shape and color.
But the fact that many robots have a "personality," compared to which Stepford's wife would appear to be very progressive, is even more worrying.
Modern sex dolls have turned into robots with silicone skin.
RealBotix robot, for example, allows users to customize in robots the qualities they find attractive - for example, shyness.
There are still Roxxxy Gold sex robots developed by "True Companion," which come with an already programmed personality - for example, "Cold Farrah" gives the impression of being shy, and "Wild Wendy" has a "bold" character.
"Roxxxy Gold has a character that fits you perfectly," the True Companion website reports enthusiastically.
So she loves what you love, doesn't like what you don't like, and so on.
She has a changing mood during the day, like a real person!
She may want to sleep or chat, or she may "be in the mood"! "
In the emergence of sex robots, much is worrying - not least because they replace real human relationships - but most worrying is the subordinate image of a woman, an association with rape, which causes the mastery of a cold (read: resisting) headlamp.
On the "True Companion" site, Roxxxy is compared to a vibrator, only for men.
"If a woman (sic!) can have a vibrator, why can't men have Roxxxy?" the website says.
But these sex robots are not just fetishes or just new sex toys.
Their emergence and increasing complexity point to something darker and deeper in our culture, a retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards wanting sex with submission as an optional supplement.
Most men, of course, will not buy sex robots, and while FRR notes their growing popularity, they remain on the periphery of consumer culture for the time being.
But what comes to us from the periphery can be quite instructive about the meanings of the era in which we live.
And many people are not bad or aggressive until the free market gives them the opportunity to do so.
It's not a coincidence - that these complex sex robots have emerged just when women's rights around the world have been threatened when there is a president in the White House who is lauded for sticking to women.
The worst thing about the TV series "the Handmaid's story" is not graphic images, twisted bodies and squeezed eyes, but precisely how realistic that vision seems.
The Republic of Gilead is an exaggeration, but it doesn't seem so great now.
The purpose of the sex robot industry is to achieve the kind of physical likeness to real women (only with the proportions of pornographic stars) that technology allows.
Their creators want them to appear to be human to the touch to copy the movements of the human body.
But it's their "characters" that robots don't look like real women.
They can't break with their partners or get away with them.
They have no life or biography - nothing that could point to independence or anything else that could destroy the illusion of total dependency.
In other words, they are beautiful slaves.
Or, as they say in 2017, "handmaids."
Los Angeles native Eugene (Pooh) Jeter, who has been playing for the Ukrainian national team since 2013, will not help our national team at the European Basketball Championship, the final part of which starts on August 31.
This was announced in an interview with BeBasket portal by general manager of "Blue-yellow" Andrey Lebedev.
We tried to negotiate with Jeter, but unfortunately he won't come for family reasons.
We will go to Eurobasket without a naturalized player as we don't want to take someone we don't know.
"This situation will provide opportunities for the development of our young players," he said.
Let me remind: with the direct participation of Jeter the national team of Ukraine took a record sixth place for itself on Eurobasket-2013 and for the first time I got to the World Basketball Championship at which "yellow-blue" couldn't overcome the group stage, and the native of the USA scored on average for a game 15.4 points, made 3 selections and gave 5 assists.
Jeter has stopped playing for the Ukrainian national team since leaving his post as head coach of our national team American Mike Fratello, who left the position in 2015.
Men's EuroBasket 2017 will be held simultaneously in four countries: Turkey, Romania, Israel and Finland.
The Ukrainian team will hold their matches of the group tournament on the promised land.
The wards of Evgeny Murzin in Group B will have five duels: with Germany (August 31), Italy (September 2), Georgia (3rd), Lithuania (5th) and Israel (6th).
In preparation for tournament our men's national team carried out two control duels in which conceded to the Dutch and Belarusians.
Trump's great feat?
It seems quite reasonable to portray Mitt Romney
In the age of Trump, the common place was the fact that the political disputes that polarized the American electorate broke up some families at the micro level.
Between Thanksgiving and Christmas, American newspapers were peppered with columns about how to deal with the horrible relatives voting for Trump.
It seems that we are all stressed so that we will soon burst.
There is less talk about Trump's ability to connect families.
I write about it because my cousin, a left-leaning poet from Chicago who has long been on knives with Republicans in her family, was coming to see me in New York this week.
She reminded me that uniting in the fight against a common enemy can have a strong effect.
Under Trump in the White House, everyone she knows, including a Republican brother with whom she has argued about politics for decades, suddenly and strangely found herself on the same side.
Over dinner, this is undoubtedly a good thing; but I can't help but think that, in a broader context, it can be quite dangerous.
Trump has breathed strength into the left wing, but the distorting effect of his rule can move us all to the right.
When we talk about Trump and "normalization," we mean the unlikely possibility that one day we will stop being struck by his antics.
There is, however, an even more dubious scenario in which Trump will "normalize" the most right-wing Republicans, who, amid his standards, will suddenly appear to be a model of common sense.
I caught myself missing out on Mitt Romney's old-fashioned madness today - with a dog on the roof of a car and a 14 percent income tax (but we at least knew what his tax return looked like) - compared to Trump both seem to be very little evil.
When Trump leaves, it will be enough for the next Republican candidate to just be in his mind to be seen as a huge step forward.
When my cousin went to the center, we went with the kids to the carousel in Central Park - the biggest carousel in the New York City parks department farm and the best way in the city to spend three dollars if you don't need caffeine.
The horses are formidable and huge, the glass-fibre pictures on the central drum - grimacing clowns and animals that, bent, look on their backs in horror - are extremely sinister, and the ringing music, oddly enough, leads to delight.
So many famous things in this city are disappointing: the views from skyscrapers are becoming obsolete, the silhouettes of buildings are too attached to cause awe, and the reality of the city is not keeping up with the dream.
Thirty-five years have passed, and I'm still going through the day when I found out that the Suiss Cottage area is not really a Swiss chalet (the theme pub "Ye Olde Swiss Cottage" doesn't count), but a large circular intersection in north London.
And the carousel in Central Park is still an unusual, magical place in which a child of two, a child of eleven and two women in forty can have a great time.
If I could put a merry-go-round score, I would put a five, but fortunately no one asked me for it.
And at the department store this week, I was asked to rate my "experience" of shopping on a scale of one to five stars before holding a card through the terminal.
In the coffee shop on the corner of my street all the same plus the option to accompany the score with a tip of 15 percent is for the order at the counter.
As a result, not only does the idea-neutral interaction slow down, but it also has to bring a personal attitude to a situation that does not involve it.
The poor saleswoman at the department store smiled confusingly while I was tired of my experience of handing her a five-star credit card.
Oscar Pistorius transferred from prison to hospital due to chest pains
Pistorius is leaving the prison because of a visit to the doctor for the second time.
Last year, he was transferred to hospital to treat cuts on his wrists that the prison administration claimed he received as a result of a fall in his cell.
Pistorius was convicted of premeditated murder following an appeal by the prosecutor's office against the original conviction for manslaughter.
He killed Steenkamp in the early morning hours of Valentine's Day in 2013, shooting her several times through the toilet door at his home in Pretoria.
Pistorius said he took his girlfriend for a night thief hiding in his toilet.
The prosecutor's office has announced its intention to file another protest, this time against Pretorius's six-year term, which it says is too lenient.
The attorney general's office has said it will appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa and the appeal will be heard this year.
Pretorius's term could increase by 15 years if the Prosecutor's Office succeeds.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
The suspect in the beating of a journalist NTV elected a travel ban
The Metropolitan law enforcement officials elected a preventive measure in the form of a travel ban for the man who attacked the journalist of NTV Nikita Razvozhayev during a live broadcast from Gorky Park on August 2.
This is reported by TASS with reference to the official representative of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation Irina Volk.
"As part of the investigation of the criminal case initiated under Article 116 of the Criminal Code (" beating ") against a 32-year-old man who hit the face of a correspondent of a TV channel in the Central Park of Culture and Recreation Named after Gorky, the suspect was given a preventive measure in the form of a travel ban and proper behavior," Wolf said.
A spokeswoman for the Interior Ministry added that an administrative report had been drawn up against the suspect for disobeying the police.
On Wednesday, August 2, during a live broadcast, an innocent man approached the correspondent and hit him in the face.
As it turned out later, the bully has nothing to do with the VDM.
According to Razvozhayev himself, the paratroopers, on the other hand, tried to detain the Muscovite.
Two Bulgarian citizens were detained in Greece for illegal tent parking
According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, two Bulgarian citizens were detained in Greece for illegal tent parking.
On the morning of August 1, a group of people who had put tents in the wrong place, including two Bulgarian citizens, were detained on sitonia.
They were released on the same day, while the investigation is still underway.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs told the TV channel bi-Ti-VI that Bulgarian citizens were then released.
The Greek authorities have tightened controls on free camping and are already imposing hefty fines on anyone caught parking in a non-designated location.
The checks will be carried out throughout the season.
According to the ministry, the court can impose a fine.
Russian Foreign Ministry accuses US Vice President of Cold War rhetoric
Statements made during US Vice President Michael Pence's European tour were criticized by the Russian Foreign Ministry.
"It is regrettable to note that Washington is sliding deeper into primitive ideological strains of the Cold War that are completely divorced from reality," the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
So in the Foreign Ministry reacted to Pence's words about the "Russian threat" and attempts to forcibly redraw the borders he said in Podgorica.
The Russian Foreign Ministry pointed to the destructive nature of the choice "either with the West or with Russia" and the non-obvious thesis that there is no alternative to the whole of south-Eastern Europe joining Nato.
Russian diplomats also recalled that it was the United States that violated international law by using force to alienate Kosovo from Serbia and thus created another hotbed of tension.
"We call on American colleagues to stop the shelving of Russia and its foreign policy line, which is invariably based on respect for partners and willingness to work together constructively, on mutual consideration of interests," the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
A paramedic was injured in an accident with an ambulance in Moscow region
The accident occurred in Stupino, near Moscow, and a paramedic was injured in a collision between a foreign car and an ambulance.
Today, at about 08: 10 am, a Mitsubishi car collided with an ambulance in Stupino, Moscow Region.
"As a result of the collision, the ambulance turned over," Tass said in the press service of the State Ministry of Internal Affairs for the Moscow region.
Law enforcement officers are working at the scene of the accident, and the circumstances of the incident are being investigated.
In the Odessa region, a woman threw out her newborn son on the construction site, wrapped in a cellophane bag.
On the evening of August 3, the separate Police Department received a report from a local resident that he had found a package with an infant in an unfinished private house.
"Law enforcement officers and doctors went to the scene, who promptly took the child to a medical facility," the Odessa head of the national police reported.
Doctors determined that the boy was born a few hours before his discovery, as evidenced by the presence of the umbilical cord.
A 36-year-old local woman has been identified as having given birth in the course of priority operational and investigative measures.
It has also been established that the woman has three other young children.
According to the head office, the family had not previously come to the attention of law enforcement officials and was not on special account.
At present, the police determine the circumstances and reasons that led the woman to the act, after which a procedural decision will be made.
The baby is now under the supervision of doctors.
As previously reported, in Nikolayev, a 21-year-old woman threw her premature baby into a waste wire.
Grigory Leps: "I will fight, though 55-not 30"
One of the most successful artists of the Russian variety Grigory Leps will celebrate his 55th anniversary next Sunday.
Before the celebration, the singer talked to the Observer "news."
I remember how your "poltinnik" was celebrated.
A special tent in "Luzhniki," Gloria Gainor sang for the birthday boy, a powerful salute over the Moscow River.
For sure, then you were wondering how you would like to spend your next five-year plan.
The designs have come true?
Speaking of the profession, it was a successful period.
I worked hard, went three times with tours all over the country, gave 120-130 concerts a year.
He has released two good albums.
Of course, now I am no longer that, say, 20 years ago.
The biological clock is not to be fooled.
Singing the way I sang in my 30s is getting harder.
Nevertheless I will fight, I don't want to stop.
And I with new people, it seems to me, go to a different level.
With them you and the new album record, the first in three years.
Yes, work on it is now underway.
Actually, we have already recorded everything in my studio and now we will send it to Los Angeles.
It is called "are you so serious?" according to the song of the same name, which is written in conjunction with Timati.
It's not quite ready yet, so we haven't put it out anywhere yet.
Let's do it later, when and the clip on it will be filmed.
And the album will be presented in November - to a series of my anniversary concerts in Moscow "Crocus City Hall."
The cool American drummer Chris Coleman had a hand in your new record.
You seem to want to attract him to your tour line-up as well?
In my opinion, Coleman is one of the most outstanding drummers in the world today.
He was coming to my studio, recording his parts.
I invited him to join my band, and Jeremy Colson (a well-known drummer involved in different projects. - "Izvestia") suggested.
But for long-term work in Russia, they put forward, to put it mildly, excessive conditions.
These included fees ranging from €35,000 to €45,000 per month.
Then I thought that I would also find worthy musicians in the post-Soviet space.
And I found the excellent drummer Max Malyshev.
In general, it is better to feed your own (smiles).
At times, I want to get to any of them, not for anything.
For example, guitarist Fyodor Dosumov is highly quoted internationally.
Western music magazines write about him, and he is invited to various guitar festivals.
Steve Wai, listening to his game, said that "a new generation of guitarists came, with a different performance technique."
Your album comes down in Los Angeles, American musicians cooperate with you, but you in the USA still can't come?
Are you trying to lift this ban?
Now, frankly, I don't do anything.
There are a number of lawyers who are dealing with this issue.
As a musician, I am truly sorry that I can't get to America.
I have said more than once that I am studying there.
The more you communicate with real professionals, the more useful.
We're not dumber than them, but we don't have that experience, school.
Our performers of popular music for 70 years have not been given the tasks that American musicians have always solved.
They sought to sound as good as possible.
And I'm trying to follow the same principles.
Now for some reason and the UK refused me entry for ten years.
But I will still apply for a visa to the British Embassy every year to be allowed to go there again and the most important thing is to work there.
The rest of Europe treats me favorably.
And already in August you are planning a concert in Monaco, not ordered, but poster, right?
Yes, in Monte Carlo there is a good Hall "sporting," I already there once acted.
Now invited again, and as far as I know, all tickets to the concert have already sold out.
On "the Rendezvous of Laima waikule," which will begin on July 20 in jurmal, will you go?
She invited me, and I, of course, responded.
Lyme is a wonderful singer and a gorgeous woman who knows how to serve herself with both wonderful vocals and even whispers.
After the tour and the anniversary concerts, as far as I know, you want to turn to the work of Vladimir Vysotsky.
You already have two albums with his songs.
When will the third come out?
Probably next year.
But it will be done in a completely different way.
I want to record about 80-90 songs of vyotsky in about the same serve as he did himself.
Only voice and guitar.
No other arrangement.
Our famous musician Timur Vedernikov will accompany me.
I will try to attract Alexander Yakovlev Rosenbaum to participate in the album as well.
I talked to him about this subject, we have a good relationship, but he is a busy man, so we will see how it will work out.
You and Boris Grebenshchikov's songs gradually introduced into the repertoire.
Maybe then you'll write an album of his stuff?
Boris Borisovich is a wonderful man and a great musician.
I crossed with him several times and asked: can I sing one or the other of his songs?
He answered, "Gregory, I write songs to be performed."
Please try, sing.
Probably interesting and such an album to record.
Until I have a similar task, but in the future, in a year or two, if Boris Borisovich doesn't object, I may do such a project.
If you don't focus entirely on the affairs of your production center.
I suppose, while you haven't yet realised its potential, you haven't signed contracts with all the artists that are interesting to you?
There are a number of performers I would have dreamed of having under my wing, but they are independent, accomplished people.
Do you mean Sergey Lazarev?
Serezha is a brilliant singer, I invited him.
I can disagree with his repertoire, but he is a professional and he has his own development strategy.
And in my center now there is Alexander Panayotov, whom I led in "the Voice."
We have concluded a contract with him and are working.
In our pop music, such singers are rare.
It will be a real pity if he does not reach the heights he deserves.
I try to pick up his repertoire, I shoot clips.
I hope for a good result.
I also try to promote other artists of my center: I buy them songs, I pay poets, sometimes their tracks fall into the rotation of television and radio channels.
If they do not reach great heights, I will still bring our cooperation to its logical conclusion.
On the way out, they will get a recorded album, a few clips.
And then, if they want, they can go their own way, and I won't insist that they return the money invested in them.
Although I will be pleased if one of them succeeds commercially and pays me the interest we agreed on in the contract.
But if it doesn't happen, I'm not going to cut off oxygen to anyone.
Let everyone work, get through, prove, as I once proved.
If tomorrow you are offered to do a tour in Ukraine and guarantee entry to the country, will you go?
I am still invited there.
Most of the events are closed.
And as for the Grand Tour...
I am a man of my country, a Russian, by my own conviction flew to Syria on the same plane that then crashed.
If tomorrow they say that it is necessary to fly to some other point in the interests of the State, - polechu.
And I am spat that bloggers and other critics will think about me.
I sincerely regret that we have such a situation with Ukraine.
Since I believe: we are one people and should be together.
I regret that this is unlikely to happen, at least in the near future.
And I used to give 40-50 concerts in Ukraine in a year.
They met like nowhere else.
A very grateful public.
And with several Ukrainian artists collaborated: Ani Lorak, light Loboda, Artim Loik...
There are a lot of gifted people in Ukraine, and it is truly a pity that now they cannot fully pour out their talent to a wide Russian audience.
Music should unite and entertain people.
I would gladly invite some cool Ukrainian performer to Russia, such as the glory of Vakarchuk, and make a joint concert with him.
But, I think, at the moment it is unlikely...
Andrey ohlopkov moved from the launch site
As it became known "Kommersant," the technical director of the launch site east Andrey ohlopkov began work in the State Space Research and Production Center (GKNPC) named after khronichev.
Previously, he was de facto involved in the construction of the Eastern launch site, but because of disagreements with the management of the land and space infrastructure Operation Centre (ECDIS), he was transferred to an enterprise in the Moscow fields, where he will coordinate production.
Mr. ohlopkov will not have a replacement: the post of technical director is likely to be abolished, and the functionality is spread across the divisions of ECDIS.
The top managers of several space industry enterprises, as well as an employee of the government apparatus, told about the fact that the technical director of the Eastern and Deputy Director General of ECDIS for technological development Andrey ohlopkov moved to work at the Khrunichev State Committee.
"He has been working in the new post for several weeks," - said the interlocutors "Kommersant" in the industry.
It was not possible to get an operational comment from ECDIS on Thursday, and Mr. ohlopkov himself was not available for comment.
However, the information "b" has been officially confirmed in the SCOC.
He decided to move to the position of director of production coordination, - said at the enterprise. - Andrey ohlopkov assigned to him the task of ensuring the launch minimum for the first launch at the launch site East fully fulfilled.
Mr. ohlopkov joined ECDIS in 2013, having served in space forces, in particular in Baikonur, and in plesecki - at the "northern" launch site he served as the First Deputy Commander in the rank of colonel.
In 2009, Andrei ohlopkov became the subject of a criminal case.
The investigation accused him of bribery: allegedly, from his submission, regional merchants received state orders for kickbacks, but did not fulfill their obligations to clean the separated parts of the launch vehicles in the Arkhangelsk region and the Republic of Komi.
He was found not guilty by a jury in 2012.
The technological development responsibilities assigned to it in ECDIS extended to different projects, but the main one was the construction of a launch site in the Far East.
Oleg Ostapenko, then head of the Federal Space Agency, said in an interview with Kommersant that the state of affairs in the East "was critical already in October 2013."
The fact is that a strategic mistake was made in the planning: the completion of the construction and the first launch of the Soyuz-2.1 launch vehicle were planned for the same time - the end of 2015.
In order to carry out the launch by the end of the year, it was decided to complete the construction six months earlier and the dates were shifted from December to July 2015.
In order to speed up the process, it was necessary to take a trick: ECDIS specialists began to conduct parallel installation of technological equipment on unfinished objects.
The main supporter of this idea was Andrei ohlopkov.
Despite the risks and still the transfer (instead of December 2015 "Soyuz" departed only on April 28, 2016), this idea justified itself, says the source "Kommersant" at the launch site: "Otherwise we would not carry out any launch from the east, but would be engaged in construction."
Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin, who oversees the creation of the launch site, jokingly called Andrei ohlopkov his "cosmic Susanin," but it was from him almost always asked for information about the progress of the construction.
Mr. ohlopkov was remembered and straight: for example, in an interview with Kommersant, he proposed to deprive the Federal Agency for Special Construction (Special Construction) of the status of the only performer in Eastern and to work directly with subcontractors: "Why should we put all eggs in one basket of special system?"
This idea has found support in the government.
Since 2017, ECDIS has assumed the responsibilities of the general contractor to complete the construction and installation work at the start-up and technical complex by the planned fourth quarter.
According to Kommersant, the reason for Mr. ohlopkov's transition to a new place of work was a disagreement with the management of ECDIS about the ways to complete the construction of the structures and complexes of the launch site, as well as the methods of working with subcontractors.
"It was decided that it would be better for everyone," says one of the top managers involved in the construction of the East.
A government official, in turn, calls the decision strange: "He was one of the best specialists, finding him an equivalent replacement will not be easy."
According to Kommersant, this will not be necessary: the post of technical director of the launch site will be abolished and its functions will be spread across the divisions of ECDIS.
There will be a program to teach two specialties in music schools
In the future, students of children's music schools will be able to receive two specialties at the same time.
According to the deputy director of the Department of Science and Education of the Ministry of Culture Sviatoslav Golubenko, for this purpose it is possible to re-read students recurring disciplines, and the issue with payment of other classes in the second specialty to solve with special grants, RIA Novosti reports.
"The Ministry of Culture has taken control of this issue, and we, together with the expert community, will develop a mechanism that will allow to master two specialties, but at the same time will not contradict the current legislation in the field of education," Golubenko said.
Last Friday, during Vladimir Putin's "nedetsky conversation" with pupils of the Sirius children's center, student Maria Andreeva said that she was forced to pay for recurring items in the second specialty at the Moscow Conservatory.
The girl said that she is studying the violin and piano class and has awards competitions in both directions.
The head of state recognized her issue as very topical and promised to help.
17-year-old Russian detained on wall on skyscraper in Mexico
In Mexico, 17-year-old Russian Kirill N. was detained, who climbed on the wall on the roof of a high-rise building, according to the portal El Universal.
The incident took place in the capital, Mexico City.
The young man, with the help of two unknown men, crossed a three-metre fence into the Nestle office complex and climbed onto one of his towers on his own.
At the same time, he did not use any special equipment, insurance and ropes.
The young man was already detained on the roof.
Officials of the Ministry of Public Security brought him down to the ground by helicopter.
He was then sent to the National Institute of Migration.
They are investigating whether the young man is legally in the country.
Meanwhile, a video of a young man climbing a high-rise has become popular online.
Users called the youngster "Spider-man."
According to the media, such experiments are a hobby for him.
Red meat, dairy products and chocolate can help to ease the intake.
Red meat and chocolate is generally considered a nightmare for your digestive tract.
But recent research suggests otherwise: a diet rich in meat proteins and dairy products can help alleviate symptoms in those suffering from inflammatory bowel disease.
This incurable disease, which affects approximately 1.3 million people in the US and 300,000 in the UK, leads to Coles and abdominal bloating, chronic or bloody diarrhea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
Usually, to mitigate symptoms, patients are advised to avoid meat and dairy products, but researchers at the University of Washington have found that the main amino acid protein tryptophan promotes the production of immune cells that increase gut tolerance.
Lead researcher Dr. Marco column explained that immune cells in the gut make sure that harmful microbes coming with food do not penetrate the body.
Cells capable of triggering an inflammatory process are balanced by cells that increase tolerance, protecting the body while not harming sensitive tissues.
If the balance is too severely disturbed towards inflammation, it can lead to inflammatory bowel diseases.
Experiments have shown that mice with a certain bacterium in the gut appear to increase the tolerance of the cell.
And this bacteria needs tryptophan - one of the building elements of the protein - to trigger the emergence of these cells.
Professor column said: "We have established a link between one type of bacteria - lactobacco Illus reuteri - which is part of a normal gut microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that increase tolerance.
The more tryptophan was contained in the diet of mice, the more of these immune cells they had. "
He suggested that the same would work in humans: a combination of L. reuteri and a tryptophan-rich diet could contribute to a more tolerant and less inflammatory environment in the gut.
Postdoc Dr. Louise Cervantes-barraganvas, studying a variety of tolerance-enhancing immune cells, found that one group of experimental mice had these cells, and another group, which belonged to the same line but was kept separately, did not have them.
She suggested that the distinction could be caused by the gut microbiomes of mice - communities of bacteria, viruses and fungi that usually live in the gastrointestinal tract.
The DNA of the mice 'gut cells was sequencing, and six species of bacteria were found present in mice that have immune cells but are absent from mice that do not have them.
Mice grown in sterile environments that didn't have a good microbiome and didn't develop this kind of immune cells got L. reuteri, and they had immune cells.
To understand how bacteria affect the immune system, the researchers grew L. reuteri in a liquid environment and then transferred small portions of fluid - without bacteria - to underdeveloped immune cells released from mice.
Immune cells have become tolerance-enhancing cells.
When the active component was separated from the liquid, it turned out to be a by-product of tryptophan processing, known as indol-3-lactic acid.
When researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in mouse food, the number of these cells increased by about 50 percent, but when tryptophan levels were reduced by half, the number of cells also fell by half.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explains that humans have the same tolerance-enhancing cells as mice, and most of us have L. reuteri in our gastrointestinal tract.
It is not known whether tryptophan by-products from L. reuteri contribute to cell development in humans in the same way as mice, but people suffering from inflammatory bowel diseases have been found to have defects in the genes associated with tryptophan.
She says: "Perhaps we need to strengthen the development of these cells, as inflammatory processes on the inner surface of the intestines depend on these cells.
High levels of tryptophan with L. reuteri could potentially lead to an expansion of their population. "
According to Jose Mourinho, Manchester United have hired a "genius" in the face of Nemanja Matic
Manchester United have hired a "genius" in the face of Nemanja Matic, according to Jose Mourinho after the midfielder made his debut in the match against Sampdoria on Wednesday evening.
The player, acquired for 40 million pounds from Chelsea, started with a 2-1 win in Dublin in United's last pre-season match before the Uefa Super Cup match against Real Madrid on Thursday and impressed as a midfielder, while players like Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira broke through when they pleased.
However, as Matic did not take part in Chelsea's pre-season tour of Asia, he was seriously lacking in preparation for the game, and sustained just 45 minutes, which Mourinho said required refinement before the start of the Premier League season.
"He needs time, but his experience, mind, genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football," Mourinho said.
"We will help him prepare sooner rather than later."
As well as Matic, his fellow new players Victor lindeleuf and Romelu Lukaku started the game at the Aviva Stadium when Mourinho began to form his main squad by the start of next season.
The Independent newspaper reported this week that Mourinho wanted to hire three more players, but stressed that the club had already achieved fantastic results by hiring three of the four players he wanted to hire in the first place.
"I am grateful to the club for getting three out of four," he added.
"I will rejoice even more if they get me four out of four, but they have already tried very hard for me."
Former leaders of Lithuania's Social Democrats persuade them to stay in the ruling coalition
Former chairmen of the Social Democratic Party of Lithuania, former Prime Ministers Algirdas Butkevicius and Gediminas Kirkilas, as well as former speaker of the Sejm from the Social Democrats Ceslovas yurshenas appealed to the party members to remain in the ruling coalition.
As the "parliamentary newspaper" reported, because of friction with partners - the Union of peasants and the "greens" - the social-Democratic Party initiated a discussion on whether to remain in the ruling coalition.
And here are three senior experienced comrades addressed to the Party members with an open letter, which, in particular, says: "It is clear the disappointment of the party comrades with the results of the elections, but the coalition with the" peasants "has created for us even though not very easy, but still conditions for the further realization of the goals of social justice, which on our initiative are provided in the program of the government, and to preserve the political dominance of the left center over the right parties."
According to former party leaders, the discussion so far "has been dominated by emotion-based expression of opinion without concrete arguments."
The authors of the letter fear that reckless actions by their party could lead Lithuania to political, economic and social instability.
The disabled Anton Mamayev was given a fine
Moscow City Court reduced the punishment of wheelchair user Anton Mamayev from four and a half years imprisonment to a fine of 200 thousand rubles.
Earlier, the convicted person was released from jail.
At the same time, the Moscow City Court confirmed that the accused is a criminal because he organized the robbery and kidnapping of a motor vehicle from a former Special Forces fighter.
The Moscow City Court, by its decision, reduced the punishment of Anton Mamayev to 200 thousand rubles fine.
"Mamayev is the organizer of robbery, which also forms part of the crime, and, accordingly, such a person should be prosecuted," - explained "Kommersant" spokesman of the Moscow City Court Ulyana Solopova.
In this case, the court took into account Mamayev's state of health, the factual circumstances of the case, and the absence of aggravating circumstances.
In addition, the court applied Article 64 of the criminal code, according to which it is possible to impose punishment below the lower limit.
As for Mamayev's assistant Vasily Seroshtanov, the court did not establish the circumstances that would be the basis for changing the category of gravity of what was done and changing the sentence.
Anton Mamayev himself said that he was dissatisfied with the decision of the Moscow City Court.
I am disappointed with the court's decision.
The only legal solution would be justification, intends to fight further for justice.
His lawyer, Andrei Orlov, did not rule out an appeal against the verdict in the Cassation Court of the Moscow City Court and the Supreme Court.
"We will use all the levers up to the European Court of Human Rights," he told RIA Novosti.
Recall, 28-year-old Muscovite Anton Mamayev, who suffers from spinal muscular atrophy, became the subject of a criminal case last autumn.
The disabled man claims that he bought the scooter from acquaintances for 160 thousand rubles to then sell.
However, the owners of the motor vehicle, among them a former Special Forces fighter, said that the disabled man and his assistant Vasily Seroshtanov took away their property, threatening to use violence.
On June 30, Timiryazevsky District Court of Moscow sentenced Vasily Seroshtanov to three years in prison, and Anton Mamayev to four and a half years in prison, serving a sentence in a penal colony (under part 2 of Article 162 of the Criminal Code).
After the immobilized disabled person was placed in jail, the Public Chamber, the Prosecutor General's Office, the commissioner for human rights under the President Tatiana Moskalkova joined the case.
As a result, in mid-July Anton Mamayev was released from jail by the decision of the same Timiryazev court.
The defense, in turn, appealed the decision of the first instance to the Moscow City Court.
ONF to prepare a report on the environment to the President
The final "Action Forum" of the all-Russian People's Front (ONF) in 2017 will be devoted to environmental issues, a source in the ONF told "Izvestia" and confirmed the head of the Executive Committee of the movement Alexey Anisimov.
According to him, according to the results of the forum "frontmen" plan to prepare a report to the president on the problems of the domestic ecology, as well as to propose a strategy to solve them.
The interlocutors of "Izvestia" in the ONF note that the report to the head of state will contain "deep analysis" on the situation in all federal districts of the country.
According to "Izvestia," the final forum of the ONF will take place in the autumn.
The exact date is yet to be determined - as a rule, it adjusts to the schedule of the president, who is the leader of the movement and has traditionally been present at key ONF events.
The front held several interregional environmental conferences, one for two federal districts - in Rostov-on-don, Kaliningrad and Kirov.
The final conference will be held in the capital of the Republic of Buryat Ulan-Ude.
On the basis of the proposals that have been made and will be made at these events, we will form systemic proposals to solve environmental problems, - the interlocutor at the ONF told "news."
The co-Chairman of the Central Staff of the movement Olga Timofeeva, who heads the State Duma Committee on Ecology and Environmental Protection, said that the "frontmen" will report to the head of state on the work carried out within the framework of the Year of Ecology in Russia.
The final environmental forum and the ONF "Action Forum" are likely to be combined.
During the year, we grew up with a powerful team of experts in the field of environmental problems, saw gaps in the legislation, stopped dozens of violations of the law.
All of this will be included in the report that we are preparing for the president as the leader of our movement.
In addition to this document, "frontmen" will report on the work on priority projects of ONF, - Olga Timofeeva told "Izvestia."
According to her, the special representative of the head of state on environmental protection, ecology and transport Sergei Ivanov will also be invited to the forum.
Earlier, he had already taken part in the ONF Media Forum, which was held in St. Petersburg in April.
In a few months, the Year of Ecology will go down in history, and the most important thing to do today is to launch environmental mechanisms to make them work for many years.
So that these issues do not fall out of the agenda, "added Olga Timofeeva.
Andrei Kolyadin, head of the regional policy laboratory of the Expert Institute for Social Research (Eisi), noted: by raising environmental issues, ONF acts in line with the presidential agenda.
Many things they offered as experts in various forums, and these initiatives received the support of the President, - Andrey KOLYADIN told "Izvestia."
He stressed that, to date, the economic potential of the environmental agenda could not be excluded, which could give the regions additional impetus for development.
In the future, with the help of ONF, the regions will be able to lobby not only to solve their environmental problems, but also to develop ecotourism, - the expert added.
The relevance of the environmental theme was demonstrated by the "Direct Line" with Vladimir Putin in June.
In particular, the president was asked questions about the garbage dump in balashikh (already closed) and about coal dust in the port of Nakhodka (a bill has already been drafted to ban open trans-shipment of coal in settlements, one of the authors - Olga Timofeeva).
Experts in the field of ecology believe that the legal framework for solving environmental problems in Russia as a whole is created, the issue is further law enforcement practice, as well as the position of civil society.
We need a clear implementation of the decisions taken by the state, "said Leonid Bochin, head of the charitable foundation" Ecology for all. "
Member of the HRC, head of the non-governmental organization "Greenpeace of Russia" Sergey tilitkov in conversation with "Izvestia" stressed that in order to successfully solve environmental problems it is necessary a responsible approach of society and business, legislative efforts alone are not enough.
As soon as the society and business realize that the solution of environmental problems is a much more profitable step in the strategic perspective, the situation will change, - said Sergey tsylykov.
The expert stressed that it is necessary to reverse the trend that violation of environmental legislation is an economically beneficial solution for business.
The British inventor injected himself with a microchip to get into the house and car at the stroke of his hand
The British inventor became the first person in the country to be fitted with a microchip so he could open the door of his house, go into the office and even start a car with a simple hand shake.
Thirty-year-old Stephen Northam has absorbed a tiny chip between his thumb and index finger and now, through his firm biotech, offers this service to firms and individuals who want to simplify their lives through technology.
He teamed up with Dr. Jeff Watson, a consultant anesthesiologist at the Royal in Winchester, to ensure that the healing procedure was carried out in accordance with medical standards.
The technology is similar to a microchip that is absorbed by cats and dogs, and the procedure takes only 30 seconds.
Northam also replaces locks in homes and machines with Chip-compatible ones at a price of 300 pounds per lock.
The married father of one child has already installed the technology in his home and in his BMW Z4 car, which starts when his hand is on the steering wheel.
Props for the White House cost taxpayers thousands of dollars
According to armed forces records provided to TIME magazine, the White House's decision last month to drive a Marine helicopter to the South Lawn for an event dedicated to American industrial production cost taxpayers as much as $24,000.
The white-green Sikorsky VH-3D, known as "Marine One" when the president is on board, became the centerpiece of a July 17 White House event that showcased American construction programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and top White House officials examined technology products from all fifty states.
The Connecticut helicopter was displayed next to a Maine yacht, a Wisconsin fire truck and a Mississippi truck.
According to records from the first Marine Helicopter Squadron (HMX-1), the department responsible for managing the helicopter, the White House Military Department ordered the helicopter's presence in a private order, or "FRAGO," just 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn on the occasion of the "unusual" event.
"I just wanted you to make sure that you are aware because this is an unusual widely publicized event," the HMX-1 commander wrote in an email to his chief, the Marine Corps' first deputy chief of aviation, on the eve of the event.
The letter indicated that the helicopter would arrive on the South Lawn at approximately 7 a.m. on July 17 to attend an event scheduled for 3 p.m. and would remain there until the lawn was released between 6 and 9 p.m. on the same day.
The letter adds that if departure from the White House is delayed, a second crew will be required to return flight in accordance with working hours restrictions.
The first crew accompanied the helicopter during the event, and the unit's security officers remained close to the aircraft while it was on the ground.
It was not clear from the records obtained by TIME magazine whether the second crew was eventually required.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using public property for political purposes.
According to the records, HMX-1 clarified whether the event was contrary to this ruling.
"Among other things, we asked if it was a violation of the Hatch law, and we were told that it was not," the commander wrote.
"It looks like you have nowhere to go," the Deputy Chief replied.
The "Made in America" event was announced by the White House as an official event, and it was not covered by the hatchet law.
But even the official events have political notes.
During the event, the President made efforts to advance health care reform, then in development in the Senate, and praised attempts to regulate government regulations.
The use of aircraft known as "Marine One" and "Air Force One" for political purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.
Presidents are required to use them for travel.
But it is unusual to request them only in the interests of photography.
Trump was already the subject of discussions in February, when a presidential plane drove in the background during his first campaign rally in Melbourne, Florida, and his Twitter account is littered with messages complaining about his predecessor's use of the presidential plane.
"The White House is thrilled with the" Made in America "show, which featured products from 50 states made by American workers from American materials," said White House deputy press secretary Lindsay Walters.
HMX-1 crews often carry out training flights around the Washington metropolitan area and on the South Lawn to train the transportation of the President of the United States to the White House with the accuracy of an inch.
When Trump was at the G-20 summit in Germany in early July, HMX-1 held 58 training landings outside the White House.
According to one of the officials, the flight made for the "Made in America" event was counted to the crew for the necessary training flights in a month.
The unit's helicopters also flew 11 additional hours that day as part of "non-presidential support tasks."
According to the White House, taxpayers were not charged for any of the other exhibits presented at the event.
A spokesman for Sikorsky said the company had not taken part in the South Lawn helicopter demonstration.
HMX-1 does not account for the budget for presidential flights, and it is difficult to determine the exact amount spent on the event.
But according to the Department of Defense's watch rates for the 2017 fiscal year, the Department of Defense's reimbursement rate for VH-3D is $24,380 per flight hour.
The unit's records recorded that the aircraft's time in the air was 30 minutes each way from its base airfield at the Marine Corps Air Base of kuantiko in Virginia.
The White House argues that the real cost of using the helicopter is much lower than this rate.
"It is completely wrong to calculate the cost to taxpayers based on the estimated reimbursement rate," Walters says.
"These indicative rates include personnel, services and many other irreversible costs that are included in the annual allocations."
According to a 2015 RAND study, reimbursement rates do not include the cost of personnel, but do take into account the cost of fuel, maintenance and costs specified in the contract.
At the time, former White House press secretary Sean Spicer defended the use of the helicopter for the event.
"The idea is to showcase this week things made in America," Spicer said.
"And I know that Sikorsky and Connecticut are very proud of the fact that they contribute to national security, and that there are, I assume, hundreds, if not thousands, of people whose workplace depends on it.
And I think, like most Americans, that we are all proud of this helicopter and other military equipment that so many Americans have worked tirelessly to build.
Therefore, of course, it is entirely appropriate to pay attention to this. "
It was unclear whether Trump had been interacting with the helicopter while inspecting the South Lawn during the event, but he sat exactly in the driver's seat in the fire vehicle.
Inside the White House, Trump addressed representatives of Sikorsky, joking with the press about his own fleet of company products.
"I know Sikorsky perfectly," the President said. "I have three of them."
Moscow to provide grants for intensive care units of city hospitals
Every year, "Saving Lives" grants will be allocated to intensive care units and intensive care units of the capital's medical clinics.
The funds will be used to encourage doctors and nurses.
The mayor of Moscow, Sergei Sobyanin, visited the Yudin Clinical Hospital in the city.
During the examination of the clinic, he handed over a letter of thanks to the orthopaedic trauma doctor Victor Protko, who led the most difficult operation to reconstruct the teenager's foot.
Sergey Sobyanin also spoke about the decision to allocate grants to intensive care units and intensive care units of city clinics every year.
The funds will be used to encourage doctors and nurses.
According to the metropolitan mayor, the Yudin Clinical Hospital is one of the largest in Moscow today.
In recent years, the clinic has received new state-of-the-art equipment, allowing its doctors to carry out unique operations.
The clinic was opened in 1961 on the basis of Kolomenskaya rural hospital.
Currently, the departments of the medical institution are designed to receive more than a thousand patients.
In addition to intensive care and hospital, there are day-care units.
The hospital has a staff of 2,800.
The total area, occupied by a medical clinic, is 23.7 hectares.
In February this year, the medical institution became a participant in a pilot project for the organization of short-stay hospitals.
They are designed for relatively small operations.
In the course of surgical interventions, advanced medical equipment is used to significantly reduce the period of rehabilitation of patients.
After surgery in the hospital, they spend only a few hours.
In the first half of this year alone, 36,000 patients were treated in hospital at Yudin Clinical Hospital.
The clinic's medical staff performed 15800 operations of varying degrees of complexity.
The National Bank of Ukraine reported that there were no buyers of Ukrainian subsidiary Sberbank
The National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) reported that there were no applications for the purchase of Ukrainian subsidiary Sberbank.
This was reported by TASS on Friday, August 4, citing a spokesman for the NBA.
The NBU confirms that on August 3, 2017, a package of documents from Viktor prokopeni, a citizen of Belarus and Cyprus, to agree on the indirect (through parity Bank) acquisition of 100 percent of Sberbank shares has been withdrawn.
"There were no documents from other potential investors for the purchase of Sberbank shares in the national bank," the statement reads.
On August 3, Belarusian businessman Viktor Prokopenya withdrew his bid to buy a subsidiary of Sberbank.
On July 28, it became known that the National Bank of Ukraine refused Russian businessmen Said Gutseriev and Grigory Guselnikov to acquire Ukrainian subsidiary Sberbank.
The regulator based its decision on the fact that businessmen did not provide the necessary documents for checking their compliance with the requirements of the legislation of Ukraine.
Sberbank announced the sale of its Ukrainian subsidiary to the Norvik Bank Consortium and a private Belarusian company in March this year.
The majority shareholder of the consortium was Said Gutseriev, the son of Russian businessman Mikhail Gutseriev.
Sanctions against the subsidiaries of five Russian banks in Ukraine, among them Sberbank, were imposed in mid-March.
Within a year, they are prohibited from withdrawing capital from the country in favor of parent organizations.

Democracy in Afghanistan depends on the role of women in politics, the UN said.
Elections can only be representative when they involve all members of society, including women, the head of the UN mission in Afghanistan said on Wednesday.
According to Nicholas Heysom, the current head of the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan, hundreds of women are running for provincial council elections, three women are vying for the post of vice president, and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women.
"The role of women cannot be overstated," he said in a statement on Wednesday.
Choices can only be fully representative when women participate fully and are included in all stages of the electoral process.
Provincial council and presidential elections will be held in Afghanistan on 5 April.
The Taliban are threatening to disrupt the electoral process, which coincides with the transition of international forces from combat operations to the role of advisers.
In this year's elections, power is shifting peacefully from one democratically elected government to another for the first time.
Haysom said that increasing the role of women will contribute to the success of democracy in Afghanistan.
According to the Independent Electoral Commission of Afghanistan, out of a total of 3.6 million registered voters, 1.2 million are women.

In Venice increased fines for tourists for inappropriate behavior
The Venetian authorities have tightened the fines for bathing in the canals from 50 euros to 500 euros.
For walking around the city in a swimsuit or with a nude torso will now be fined 200 euros.
100 euros will be required from those who will have a picnic in a public place or ride a bike through pedestrian areas, TASS reports, citing the Association of Tour Operators of Russia.
In addition, it is mentioned that the authorities provide a fine for inscriptions on monuments 400 euros and for garbage 25 euros.
To inform tourists about the need to comply with the rules of conduct in Venice will be with the help of the special company "enjoy, respect Venice" on social networks, as well as through ads and posters on the website of the City Council, on billboards and in places of the greatest number of tourists.
The campaign will be conducted in 10 languages.
According to the tourist adviser of Venice Paola Mar, information about fines will be transmitted to the embassies of the native countries of the offenders, so as to warn their compatriots against such mistakes.
"The problem is that Venice is perceived as a beach," she said.
In April, the administration of the Italian city announced plans to limit the tourist flow.
Venice already has a successful limit on the number of tourists visiting the city center.
Instead of 100,000 people wishing to watch the Festa del Redentore festival, only 60,000 guests were admitted to the venue.
In addition, a moratorium has been imposed on the establishment of new hotels and fast food restaurants in the historic part of Venice.

SF relieved Ozerov from the post of the head of the committee
The Federation Council on Wednesday supported the statement of the chairman of the defense and Security committee Viktor Ozerov and relieved him of this position.
He remains a senator from Khabarovsk Krai.
A statement asking for his release from his position Ozerov wrote last week.
He attributed his decision to the need for rotation and his desire to "change the rhythm of life."
The senator also noted that the decision to leave was not short-term.
Victor Ozerov has been representing the legislative assembly of Khabarovsk Krai in the SF of the Russian Federation since 1996.
The senator has been in charge of the defense and Security committee since 2001.
Electricity is cheaper for both residents and producers of Buryat
The decades-long efforts of the Soviet and post-Soviet authorities of the Republic of Buryat (Eastern Siberia) to establish fair tariffs for electricity consumers are beginning to bear fruit.
Since September 1, the cost of low voltage electricity for industrial recipients has been reduced by 25%.
The Federal Antimonopoly Service of the country in accordance with the resolution of the Government of the Russian Federation "on amendments to the rules of the wholesale market of electric energy and power and to the consolidated forecast balance of production and supply of electric energy (capacity) within the framework of the Unified Energy System of Russia according to the subjects of the Russian Federation" (dated July 17, 2017, No. 842) set indicative prices for electricity and power for industrial consumers of the Republic of Buryat.
As a result, the cost of electric energy for Buryat producers is reduced by a quarter, which will make life much easier for small and medium-sized enterprises and individual entrepreneurs.
For many decades, the leaders of the Republic have embraced the thresholds of the Moscow offices in a thorough attempt to align the region in tariffs with the neighboring Irkutsk region with the cascade of hydroelectric power plants on the hangar stemming from Baikal, the main catchment area for which is Buryat.
And it was only this year that advances began.
In March, electricity tariffs for the population of the Republic were reduced from 4.24 rubles / kWh to 3.93 rubles / kWh, or 7.3%.
With the inclusion of Buryat by the decision of the federal government in the list of territories of price zones of the wholesale market, for which the peculiarities of functioning of wholesale and retail markets are established the turn of industrial consumers.

The National Union of unskilled, municipal and boiler workers (GMB) is concerned about investment in the McVitie's factory in Glasgow
The union is demanding guarantees from the managers of biscuit maker McVitie's over its long-term commitment to produce at the Glasgow plant.
The Scottish branch of GMB reports that the company has been silent on the issue of future investment at the Tolcross facility.
The factory, which produces, among other products, Hobnobs and Rich Tea cookies, employs more than 500 people.
Pladis, owner of McVitie's, says it has invested more than 5 million pounds in the facility over the past few years.
The company adds that in the event of any changes in the operation of the facility, employees and union representatives "will know about them first."
In a letter to the head of the company-owned facility, the GMB's Scottish branch demanded McVitie's reaction to the concern that funding would not be used to upgrade production lines.
Senior organiser Drew Duffy said: "Members of our Union are deeply concerned that we cannot get clarity from the general manager of the facility on business needs and the investment plan regarding the future of Tolcross."
Families have worked here for generations, and the concentration of workers is great in local society and in greater Glasgow; it is a crucial pillar of decent work in a territory of high unemployment and social deprivation.
So, in terms of jobs, wages and prosperity, and against the backdrop of Brexit, rising living standards and chronic decline in manufacturing, Glasgow's east end desperately needs to thrive manufacturing at McVitie's factory.
According to a spokesman for Pladis, "the head of the Tolcross facility only received a letter from the Scottish GMB branch yesterday, and the company will respond immediately, as we appreciate our continued cooperation with employees and union representatives."
Two months ago, we held a regular meeting with GMB staff and representatives in Tolcross, where we openly discussed a number of issues.
We talked to employees that as all companies operating in the most competitive and unstable economic climate, we are constantly reviewing our actions - and this applies to all our facilities and activities - in order to remain competitive.
"In recent years, we have invested more than 5 million pounds in our Tolcross facility, especially in production lines and improved performance."
We are fully aware of the value of Tolcross as a production facility, and in the event of any changes in work at this facility, employees and union representatives will learn about it first. "
Putin says authorities will not give instructions to Rosneft and Gazprom
Vladimir Putin said that the issue of gas supplies to the Eastern Petrochemical Company (WNHC) should be joined by the Kremlin and the cabinet, but no one will give instructions to Gazprom, like Rosneft.
Thus, Russian President Vladimir Putin responded to Igor Sechin's request to help resolve the contradictions.
The Head of State noted that the relations between Rosneft and Gazprom should be decided solely on the basis of market principles.
Earlier, the head of Rosneft Igor Sechin at a meeting on the implementation of major investment projects in the Far Eastern Federal District said that the absence of an agreement with Gazprom on gas for the WNHC threatens the duration of the project.
Sechin noted that the dialogue with Gazprom on this issue is continuing.
Gazprom offers to find gas resources from the perimeter of Rosneft, but we do not have such resources, "Sechin added.
Recall that Rosneft asked to allow it to use gas from the Kirinsky field Gazprom, located on the Sakhalin shelf, for the "Eastern Petrochemical Company."
In June, Gazprom said negotiations on the issue were continuing, and "there are no sharp corners there."
Did PSG warn Barcelona about Neymar's transition three years ago?
"La Liga" participant may regret his interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain will not stop chasing Neymar after the club offered 189 million pounds for his buyout, but did they warn Barcelona about the world record-setting raid held three years ago?
The sensational offer revived the summer transfer window when the Ligue 1 club were poised to break the world record for transition costs, more than double the previous mark associated with Paul Pogba's return to Manchester United last season for 89 million pounds.
When the transition is complete, Neymar will become the most expensive player in the world, as well as the highest paid professional athlete in the world, as PSG offers him a salary of more than 500,000 pounds a week clean.
It is known that Barcelona are furious at the way the offer was made, and how Neymar broke the contract, despite the fact that, as a source close to the Catalan club's management insists, the club has always done everything possible for the player since his transition from Santos in 2013.
But wasn't the football world warned about this possibility three years ago by the president of PSG?
When Manchester City expressed interest in hiring Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi issued a stern warning to any club that wanted to lure one of PSG's best players.
"I'm not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players, then we will oppose them, we will make offers to their players," Al-Khelaifi said.
"We respect all clubs.
But if they try to recruit one of our players, they are waiting for the consequences. "
Barcelona appeared to have crossed that line when the Spanish club expressed interest in PSG midfielder Marco Verratti earlier this summer.
PSG have made it clear that they will not release the Italian player of the national team on any terms, and now probably Barcelona are feeling the consequences of their offer in the form of the loss of one of their most valuable players, Neymar.
